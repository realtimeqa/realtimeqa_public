He told reporters during the team's OTAs Thursday that he is attending one of Swift's highly-anticipated shows at MetLife Stadium this weekend with his daughter, and he suggested playing some of the pop superstar's music at practice.\n\nHe was true to his word. Swift's multi-platinum hit \"22\" blared through speakers as players went through drills. The team returns to the field after making the postseason last year for the first time since 2016.\n\nDaboll grinned and twirled his whistle as he walked among quarterback Daniel Jones and other players stretching to Swift's declaration that \"everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22.\"\n\nAaron Rodgers, Jets love Taylor Swift jams\n\nDown the street, the New York Jets social media coordinator asked players for their favorite Taylor Swift songs.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nAaron Rodgers, who joined the team this offseason in a blockbuster trade from the Green Bay Packers, said he's a true Swiftie.\n\n\"Too many,\" he said. \"Too many to count.\"\n\nSeveral of his teammates agreed with Daboll's choice of \"22,\" while Rodgers eventually decided on his favorite album, \"Folklore.\"\n\nThe Super Bowl champ flexed his fandom further by mentioning a deep cut from her 2017 album, \"Reputation.\"\n\n\"Going way back, I would say 'New Year's.'

This result likely eliminated a lot of people from survivor pools.\n\nElsewhere, the Kansas City Chiefs routed the hapless Chicago Bears in front of a famous fan, Taylor Swift. The Dolphins scored the most points in a game by an NFL team since 1966. The Dolphins are just the fourth team to score 70 or more points in a game (regular season and playoffs).\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings remained winless after losing to the Los Angeles Chargers. Since the start of the 2019 season, only one team out of 32 that started a season 0-2 has gone on to make the postseason, something both the Vikings and Chargers did last year.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports brought the latest updates, scores, highlights, wild plays, analysis and more throughout the day.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nNFL Week 3: Sunday's scores\n\nHere are the results for all of Sunday’s NFL action.\n\nIt was a rough weekend for the undefeated, five 2-0 clubs losing Sunday. Speaking of rough ... seventy-burger? Seriously? You guys know this isn’t the BCS, and no style points are awarded, yeah? Regardless, what an obviously impressive performance as Miami became the fourth NFL team to reach the 70-point plateau. — Nate Davis\n\nThe Miami Dolphins put up a 70-20 whupping on the Denver Broncos that was more rare than a hybrid solar eclipse.\n\nQuick, when was the last time an NFL team scored – or gave up – 70?\n\nYou’d have to go back 57 years, to 1966, when the Washington team blasted the Giants, 72-41.\n\nThen again, as convincingly lopsided as it was, it may not have been the worst loss on a Blowout Sunday in the NFL. There are too many candidates for worst loss. — Jarrett Bell\n\nHot second half lifts Seahawks over Panthers\n\nThe Seahawks registered their first home win of the season in a 37-27 victory over the Bryce Young-less Panthers.\n\nSeattle scored 25 points in the second half to pull away from Carolina.\n\nThe Seahawks had a balanced attack on offense. Geno Smith passed for 296 yards, to go with 1 touchdown and 1 interception. Running back Kenneth Walker led the team with 97 yards and 2 rushing touchdowns.\n\nSeattle’s offense had 27 first downs and 425 total yards.\n\nPanthers’ Andy Dalton did a solid job filling in for Young at QB.

Arizona rushed 30 times for 222 yards and had 2 rushing TDs in the big win. Cardinals QB Joshua Dobbs threw for 189 yards and 1 TD.\n\nArizona gained 400 yards of total offense on the Cowboys defense.\n\nDallas played without multiple offensive linemen, and it showed.

Kelce snagged the ball and two-stepped his landing for the score.\n\nTaylor Swift yelled in delight from a suite, where she was sitting next to Kelce’s mom, Donna.

Running backs Isiah Pacheco and Clyde Edwards-Helaire have a touchdown apiece.\n\nNothing went right for Chicago in the first two quarters. Every single Bears offensive possession ended in either a punt or a turnover, and the defense allowed 321 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nThe Chiefs scored 10 points off Chicago’s two turnovers.\n\nThe only cause for concern for the Chiefs happened in the final minute of the second quarter when Mahomes appeared to get his ankle rolled up on, but the quarterback stayed in the game.\n\nKansas City took a 34-0 lead into halftime.\n\n— Tyler Dragon\n\nAndy Dalton scores long TD to put Panthers on top of Seahawks\n\nAndy Dalton is resuming his role as starting quarterback with Carolina Panthers rookie Bryce Young out due to an ankle injury.\n\nOn third-and-10 from the Seattle 47, the 13-year veteran dropped back, launched the ball across his body and found DJ Chark. The wide receiver spun around to juke out safety Julian Love, then sprinted downfield to complete the 47-yard score.\n\nThe touchdown gave the Panthers their first lead of the game as they went up 10-9.\n\nEach team scored a field goal before the break and Carolina is up 13-12 at the half.\n\n— Victoria Hernandez\n\nSaints' Derek Carr will undergo further examination on shoulder\n\nQuarterback Derek Carr was knocked out of Sunday's 18-17 loss to the Green Bay Packers with a right shoulder injury after being sacked in the third quarter. He was initially listed as questionable to return before later being ruled out.\n\nAfter the game, he was taken to a hospital for further examination, Saints coach Dennis Allen said after the game.\n\nWith the 10th-year veteran out of the lineup, New Orleans gave up 18 unanswered points as the team suffered its first loss of the year. Rookie kicker Blake Grupe had an opportunity to help the team retake the lead in the final two minutes, but he missed a 46-yard field goal. — Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz\n\nCowboys-Cardinals score: Arizona extends lead\n\nThe Cardinals' high-flying start against the Cowboys has continued well into the second quarter.\n\nRondale Moore took a read-option handoff from Joshua Dobbs and scampered 45 yards for the touchdown.

Running Back James Conner jetted to his right and powered past the line of scrimmage to reach the end zone.\n\nArizona went for the two-point conversion, which failed.\n\nThey opened the game with a 39-yard field goal from Matt Prater.\n\nThe Cowboys defense is playing without cornerback Trevon Diggs, who tore his ACL in practice this week. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nDolphins-Broncos highlights\n\nThe Miami Dolphins are on a roll with the most explosive offense in the NFL. And that might be a scary sight for the rest of the league.\n\nTua Tagovailoa threw for 309 yards with four touchdowns, running backs Raheem Mostert and De’Von Achane scored four touchdowns each in a 70-20 rout of the Denver Broncos on Sunday at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nStar Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill had 157 yards on nine catches and a touchdown catch from Tagovailoa, who threw one touchdown to Mostert and had two shovel passes to Achane for scores.\n\nAchane finished with 233 total yards, while Mostert had 142 total yards as the Dolphins set the franchise record for points in a game.\n\nMiami travels to face the Buffalo Bills next Sunday at 1 p.m. — Safid Deen\n\nColts-Ravens highlights\n\nIn what came down to a battle of long-distance kickers, the Indianapolis Colts gave the Baltimore Ravens the boot as Matt Gay nailed his fifth field goal of the game – a 53-yarder in overtime to give the Colts a 22-19 win.\n\nGay tied things up with less than a minute to go in regulation by hitting his third of four field goals from beyond 50 yards in the game. However, the Ravens' Justin Tucker still had a chance to win in the final seconds but was just short on a 61-yarder, sending the game to overtime.\n\nBackup quarterback Gardner Minshew, playing for the injured Anthony Richardson, threw for 227 yards and a touchdown in leading the Colts to their game-winning drive. — Steve Gardner\n\nChargers-Vikings highlights\n\nBrandon Staley and the Los Angeles Chargers decided to go for it on fourth-and-1 from their own 24-yard line and failed to convert in what was a questionable play call. But the Chargers' turnover on downs, didn’t cost them the ballgame.\n\nChargers linebacker Kenneth Murray Jr. intercepted Kirk Cousins’ pass intended for tight end T.J. Hockenson in the end zone with 12 seconds remaining in the game to seal the 28-24 victory.\n\nThe game-deciding play was the Chargers defense’s second red-zone stop in the final four minutes of the fourth quarter. — Tyler Dragon\n\nTexans-Jaguars highlights\n\nThe Houston Texans captured their first victory of the season, shocking the Jacksonville Jaguars 37-17 on the road.\n\nThe Texans went up 17-0 before halftime, including a 4-yard pass from rookie quarterback CJ Stroud to tight end Brevin Jordan.\n\nNo. 3 overall pick Will Anderson Jr. blocked a 51-yard field goal attempt from Brandon McManus, which drew boos from the crowd.\n\nFullback Andrew Beck put the exclamation point in the game with an 85-yard kickoff return to put Houston up by two scores in the third quarter.\n\nStroud finished 20-of-30 for 280 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nTrevor Lawrence went 27-of-40 for 279 yards, one touchdown and one interception. Calvin Ridley was held to three receptions for 40 yards. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nPackers-Saints highlights\n\nShut out for three quarters, Jordan Love led a furious fourth-quarter comeback, rushing for one touchdown and hitting Romeo Doubs for the go-ahead score with just under three minutes to play as the Green Bay Packers edged the New Orleans Saints 18-17.\n\nThe game was still in doubt in the final seconds as backup quarterback Jameis Winston, in for the injured Derek Carr, drove the Saints into field goal range. However, rookie kicker Blake Grupe's 46-yard field goal attempt with 1:10 to play was wide right. — Steve Gardner\n\nPatriots-Jets highlights\n\nThe New England Patriots marched into MetLife Stadium and handled the New York Jets 15-10 to avoid being 0-3 for the first time since 2000.\n\nIn the second quarter, quarterback Mac Jones threw a 58-yard pass to Pharaoh Brown to put New England up 10-0.\n\nThe Jets tried to come back late with a 1-yard touchdown run from Nick Bawden, but the Patriots sealed the win with a safety when Matthew Judon sacked Zach Wilson in the end zone. The play was one of three sacks on the young quarterback.\n\nThe Patriots had more than double the Jets’ total yards of offense, 358 compared to 171. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nLions-Falcons highlights\n\nThe duo of Craig Reynolds and Jahmyr Gibbs ran out the clock for the Detroit Lions, who moved to 2-1 with the 20-6 victory.\n\nJared Goff led the way with another good performance, completing 22 of 33 passes for 243 yards and one passing and one rushing touchdown. Sam LaPorta had eight catches for 84 yards and one touchdown. Detroit survived the onslaught of injuries at running back and on the offensive line and ran for 116 yards as a team.\n\nThe big story of the day was Detroit's defense, which only gave up six points. Detroit held the Atlanta Falcons to two field goals and 195 total yards, a much better performance than giving up 37 points to the Seattle Seahawks last week. Rookie Brian Branch stepped up to lead the team with 10 tackles and Tracy Walker, who started for the injured C.J. Gardner-Johnson, had six. The last time Detroit gave up six or fewer points was its 31-0 win over the Packers in Week 17 in 2018. — Jared Ramsey, Detroit Free Press\n\nBills-Commanders highlights\n\nLANDOVER, Md. — The Buffalo Bills (2-1) handed the Washington Commanders (2-1) their first loss of the season in embarrassing fashion.

The Bills sacked Howell nine times. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nBrowns-Titans highlights\n\nThe Browns defense continued its early season brilliance, holding Tennessee to 94 yards in a 27-3 victory at home.\n\nCleveland allowed just six first downs and picked up five sacks, including a career-high 3.5 from Myles Garrett. The Browns’ defense has only allowed one touchdown in three games.\n\nDeshaun Watson threw for 289 yards and two touchdowns for the Browns, connecting with Amari Cooper seven times for 116 yards and a score. — Casey Moore\n\nVikings-Chargers score: Justin Jefferson scores first TD\n\nJustin Jefferson found the end zone for his first touchdown of the season.\n\nThe Vikings star wide receiver ran a dig route and Kirk Cousins found him open in the middle of the field.

The Vikings reclaimed the lead, 24-21, following Jefferson’s TD. — Tyler Dragon\n\nBills-Commanders score: Buffalo opens up 30-0 lead\n\nJosh Allen walked into the end zone with such ease he hit the FedEx Field crowd with the euro-step celebration after crossing the goal line.\n\nWhen it’s going your way, you can celebrate like that.\n\nAllen’s 10-yard rushing touchdown gave the Bills a 23-0 lead with 10:37 left in the game. Buffalo picked up possession in Washington territory for the third time following Washington’s fourth turnover. Antonio Gibson put the ball on the ground for his second fumble of the season, and the Bills recovered.\n\nThings only got worse from there, as Buffalo extended it's lead to 30-0 with 10 minutes to go after Sam Howell’s fourth interception of the game.\n\nHowell tried to make a throw on the run over Buffalo defensive end A.J. Epenesa. Except the ball never arced high enough, and Epenesa pawed the ball down, stiff-armed Howell, and walked into the end zone with his teammates.\n\nIt was Washington’s fifth turnover of the game.\n\nThe Bills have removed Josh Allen in favor of Kyle Allen for the final eight minutes. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nTexans-Jaguars score: Kickoff return extends Texans lead\n\nJust when the Jacksonville Jaguars looked like they were poised to rally from a 17-0 halftime deficit, the Houston Texans got a lift from an unlikely source.\n\nAfter Jacksonville's Brandon McManus cut Houston's lead to 17-10, the Texans struck back on the ensuing kickoff when backup fullback Andrew Beck picked up a bouncing ball at his own 15 yard line and broke into the clear – taking it back all the way for a touchdown.\n\nIt was Beck's first NFL touchdown since he was a rookie in 2019 with the Denver Broncos. — Steve Gardner\n\nChargers-Vikings score: Keenan Allen throws long TD\n\nChargers wide receiver Keenan Allen is doing a little bit of everything in Minnesota. Allen has 12 catches, 135 receiving yards and a 49-yard touchdown pass to fellow wideout Mike Williams.\n\nAllen’s touchdown pass put the Chargers ahead 21-10 in the third quarter. — Tyler Dragon\n\nBrowns-Titans score: Jerome Ford scores second touchdown for Cleveland\n\nIn their first game without star running back Nick Chubb, the Browns' running game is leaving a lot to be desired.\n\nHowever, new starting running back Jerome Ford does have two touchdowns – one receiving and one rushing – as the Browns hold a 20-3 lead against the Titans as the game heads into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Browns' defense has allowed just 78 total yards while compiling five sacks. Myles Garrett has 3.5 of those sacks to give him 4.5 on the season. — Casey Moore\n\nSaints' Derek Carr leaves game vs. Packers with injury\n\nThe New Orleans Saints were dealt a potential setback amid their hot start.\n\nQuarterback Derek Carr left Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers with shoulder injury after being sacked in the third quarter.

Starting at the Washington 33-yard line, the Bills once again settled for a field goal. Tyler Bass knocked through a 32-yarder to make it 16-0 with 19 seconds left in the half.\n\nIt was a much shorter attempt than the one he converted earlier in the quarter. The Bills, taking over inside their own 5-yard line, had the ball for nine minutes, 47 seconds before Bass came out for a 54-yarder. Bass drilled it down the middle to make it 13-0.\n\nThe Bills are 6-for-10 on third down.

It's the rookie quarterback's third score of the season.\n\nTrevor Lawrence and the Jaguars have 121 yards of offense, but have yet to score.\n\nNo. 3 overall pick Will Anderson Jr. blocked a 51-yard field goal attempt from Brandon McManus.

When he approached a roadblock, he shifted his direction right, ran over the Packers logo at midfield and then pointed his body toward the end zone. He had a clear lane for 30 yards as he strode in for the score.\n\nHis teammates met up with him for a celebratory dance in the end zone. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nDolphins-Broncos score: Tua Tagovailoa throws no-look touchdown pass\n\nTua Tagovailoa didn’t even see where his second touchdown pass of the day went.\n\nTagovailoa’s no-look shovel pass to running back De’Von Achane gave the Dolphins a 21-7 lead over the Denver Broncos early in the second quarter at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nThe clever play design by Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel worked to perfection.\n\nTagovailoa dropped back. Tyreek Hill ran closely for a handoff as the decoy. Achane crept close to the goal line as the pocket collapsed. And Tagovailoa’s toss was spot on. — Safid Deen\n\nBills-Commanders score: Josh Allen hits Gabriel Davis for touchdown\n\nThe Bills needed one play to put six points on the board.\n\nThat’s all you need sometimes when you have a combination of winning the field-position battle, a 23-yard punt return and an additional penalty to set you up on the opponent’s 45-yard line.\n\nFrom that point on the field, Josh Allen dropped back and looked toward Stefon Diggs. He then turned to the other corner of the gridiron where Gabriel Davis was running a corner route. Allen floated a perfect pass to Davis who scored easily. Tyler Bass’ extra-point was good and the Bills lead 10-0 with 41 seconds left in the first quarter. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nSaints-Packers score: Jimmy Graham scores first TD for Saints since 2014\n\nFormer Pro Bowl tight end Jimmy Graham is back in the NFL, back with the New Orleans Saints ... and back in the end zone.\n\nGraham, who went to three Pro Bowls with the Saints during his first five NFL seasons, returned to New Orleans this season at age 37 after sitting out last year. His first reception of 2023 came on an 8-yard scoring pass from quarterback Derek Carr.\n\nIt was Graham's first TD catch since Week 15 of the 2021 season when he was a member of the Chicago Bears. — Steve Gardner\n\nRavens-Colts score: Lamar Jackson runs for touchdown\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens are on the board first against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nLamar Jackson led his team on a 12-play, 80-yard drive and capped it off with an 8-yard rushing touchdown.\n\nOn second-and-6, the quarterback took the snap from shotgun and rushed to his right, skipping and stutter-stepping his way through defenders before Shaquille Leonard wrapped him up and he fell into the end zone.\n\nThis is Jackson’s first score on the ground this season.\n\nThe Colts are playing without rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson and Gardner Minshew got the start.\n\nThe Ravens are up 7-0. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nBills-Commanders score: Sam Howell throws interception\n\nThe first drive for the Commanders ended with a Sam Howell interception.\n\nHowell, already sacked twice on the drive – including the previous play in which he was thrown down hard by a group of Bills defenders – tried to find former North Carolina teammate Diyami Brown on third down to keep the Commanders in manageable field goal position. He didn’t see Terrel Bernard, however, and the Buffalo linebacker leaped to snatch the ball and came down with it at the 16-yard line.\n\nRunning back Brian Robinson Jr. had two rushes for 12 yards and Howell connected with tight end Cole Turner for a 21-yard gain to bring Washington into Bills territory. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nBills-Commanders score: Stefon Diggs leads scoring drive\n\nJosh Allen and the Bills converted their first two third-down attempts. They could not execute on the third such situation from the red zone and Tyler Bass salvaged the drive with a 36-yard field goal to make it 3-0 five minutes, 31 seconds into the game.\n\nThe big plays came via Allen’s legs on third-and-10 to start the drive, as his rush up the middle went for 13 yards. Two plays later, Allen rolled right and threw a deep ball to two receivers (Gabe Davis and Stefon Diggs) running, essentially, the same route.\n\nDiggs, the Maryland native playing in his home state, came up with the 30-yard catch – his longest reception of the season. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nDolphins-Broncos score: Tyreek Hill reels in long touchdown\n\nThe first touchdown of the day comes from the Miami Dolphins. And it only took three plays from scrimmage to make it happen.\n\nTua Tagovailoa found star receiver Tyreek Hill for a wide open, 54-yard touchdown to take an early 7-0 lead on the Broncos.\n\nTagovailoa needed two passes for 69 yards to spark the drive, after a 6-yard run by Raheem Mostert to start. — Safid Deen\n\nChargers' JC Jackson a surprise inactive against Vikings\n\nAbout 90 minutes before their game against the Minnesota Vikings, the Los Angeles Chargers listed cornerback JC Jackson among their inactives.\n\nThe defender was not previously listed on the injury report throughout the week.\n\nJackson has three tackles and an interception so far this season.\n\nOther players listed as inactive for Los Angeles for the road game are running back Austin Ekeler, linebacker Eric Kendricks, offensive lineman Brenden Jaimes and defensive lineman Christopher Hinton. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nBills Mafia out in droves for Commanders matchup\n\nDespite miserable weather in the DMV for two consecutive days, “Bills Mafia” was out in full force at FedEx Field, the home of the Commanders, ahead of their 1 p.m. ET kickoff Sunday.\n\nThe passionate fan base travels well regardless of the location, but Landover, Maryland is a particularly accessible destination. Plus, Bills fans were able to purchase tickets when the home fans’ interest in their team remained passive prior to former owner Dan Snyder’s sale of the organization to Josh Harris and his partners over the summer.\n\nThe cheers almost outweighed the boos as the Bills ran onto the field 10 minutes before kickoff. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nNFL picks Week 3\n\nThe NFL's 104th season is off and running, and USA TODAY Sports’ panel of resident NFL experts have made their Week 3 picks.

And that's on top of the various bumps and bruises those primary ballcarriers have to withstand on any given NFL weekend. As a result, the position is looking extremely thin as we head into Week 3.\n\nThis week's fantasy football rankings are based on the point-per-reception (PPR) scoring used in most seasonal and daily fantasy football formats. One point is awarded for every 10 rushing and receiving yards and one point for every 20 passing yards. Six points are awarded for touchdowns scored, four points for passing TDs and one point for receptions.\n\nRankings are compiled by Daniel Dobish,TheHuddle.com. — Steve Gardner\n\nBills' Stefon Diggs honors brother, Cowboys' Trevon Diggs\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys lost one of their best defensive players earlier in the week when cornerback Trevor Diggs tore his ACL during practice.\n\nDiggs is the younger brother of Buffalo Bills star receiver Stefon Diggs, who showed off a tribute to his sibling while warming up at FedEx Field before the Bills' game against the Washington Commanders. — Casey Moore\n\nCould there be NFL games in Spain and Brazil?\n\nThe NFL will play three games in the next three weeks in London, but the league is looking toward other countries to broaden the sport’s appeal worldwide.\n\nNFL games could be played in both Spain and Brazil, NFL executive vice president Peter O'Reilly said on the Adam Schefter podcast this week.\n\n“Brazil and Spain are two strong markets and two important markets,” O'Reilly said.\n\n“And importantly, there are also markets that clubs are interested in. ... Marrying where clubs are now building their fan base is important. It needs to work for the clubs as well.”\n\nAccording to ESPN: The NFL is looking at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, the home of legendary soccer club Real Madrid, and Estadio Metropolitano, the home of Atletico Madrid, as potential sites in Spain.\n\nThe NFL will play five games this year in Europe -- three in London and two in Germany. — Safid Deen\n\nHow NFL Week 3's underwhelming schedule could be exciting\n\nThe 2023 NFL schedule is replete with marquee matchups and exciting story lines. But Week 3 of the slate ... not so much.\n\nNo offense intended to the league's schedule-makers, but the final Sunday and Monday of September present an overall underwhelming offering of matchups. Overall, the schedule looks heavy with lopsided matchups, and the San Francisco 49ers' 30-12 handling of the New York Giants could be a harbinger of more blowouts to come.\n\nStill, never count out the NFL when it comes to generating unexpected entertainment. With that in mind, USA TODAY Sports' NFL writers and columnists were asked: What's one thing to watch that could actually make Week 3 exciting?\n\nRead their answers here.\n\nPackers inactives: Aaron Jones, Christian Watson out vs. Saints\n\nAs expected, the Green Bay Packers will once again be without running back Aaron Jones and wide receiver Christian Watson for their game against the New Orleans Saints. Jones has been dealing with a hamstring injury he suffered in scoring the winning touchdown in Week 1. Meanwhile, Watson has yet to play this season because of a hamstring injury.\n\nBoth players were able to practice on a limited basis on Friday, but the Packers decided to wait a little longer before activating them. Green Bay has a short week upcoming, with a Week 4 clash on Thursday against the Detroit Lions.\n\nIn addition, offensive tackle David Bakhtiari and cornerback Jaire Alexander are also inactive today for the Packers. — Steve Gardner\n\nBills-Commanders inactives include Damar Hamlin\n\nFor the third consecutive week, Damar Hamlin will not suit up for the Buffalo Bills.\n\nThe safety hasn’t played since suffering cardiac arrest during a game Jan. 2 against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nHamlin, 25, was medically cleared by doctors to resume football activities this summer and he participated in training camp.\n\nThe other Bills inactives for their Week 3 road matchup against the Washington Commanders (2-0) are:\n\nCornerback Kaiir Elam\n\nTackle Germain Ifedi\n\nGuard Alec Anderson\n\nDefensive tackle Poona Ford\n\nThe Commanders declared the following players as inactive:\n\nDefensive end K.J. Henry\n\nT Trent Scott\n\nG Chris Paul\n\nTight end Curtis Hodges\n\nTight end Logan Thomas\n\nWide receiver Mitchell Tinsley\n\nThomas suffered a concussion on his first touchdown catch of the season – some Commanders players and coaches believed it was a dirty hit by Denver Broncos defensive back Kareem Jackson – and was in early stages of the concussion protocol throughout the week. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nBrowns' Kareem Hunt shows support for injured Nick Chubb\n\nThe Cleveland Browns are back home to face the Tennessee Titans on Sunday, but they'll be without star running back and fan favorite Nick Chubb, who suffered a torn MCL on \"Monday Night Football\" against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nIn the aftermath of Chubb's injury, the Browns signed free agent Kareem Hunt, who played the previous four seasons in Cleveland alongside Chubb. Before his first game of the 2023 season, Hunt showed up at Cleveland Browns Stadium wearing a Nick Chubb jersey T-shirt. — Casey Moore\n\nColts at Ravens: Predictions, picks and odds\n\nThe Ravens are favorites to defeat the Colts, according to BetMGM NFL odds.\n\nSpread: Ravens (-8)\n\nMoneyline: Ravens (-400); Colts (+300)\n\nOver/under: 44.5\n\nUSA TODAY Sports’ staff picks for this game:\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Ravens 23, Colts 19\n\nTyler Dragon: Ravens 26, Colts 16\n\nVictoria Hernandez: Ravens 24, Colts 17\n\nJordan Mendoza: Ravens 27, Colts 16\n\nTitans at Browns: Predictions, picks and odds\n\nThe Browns are favorites to defeat the Titans, according to the BetMGM NFL odds.\n\nSpread: Browns (-3)\n\nMoneyline: Browns (-165); Titans (+140)\n\nOver/under: 40\n\nUSA TODAY Sports’ staff picks for this game:\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Titans 22, Browns 17\n\nTyler Dragon: Titans 21, Browns 17\n\nVictoria Hernandez: Browns 23, Titans 21\n\nJordan Mendoza: Browns 22, Titans 20\n\nFalcons at Lions: Predictions, picks and odds\n\nThe Lions are favorites to defeat the Falcons, according to BetMGM.\n\nSpread: Lions (-3)\n\nMoneyline: Lions (-165); Falcons (+140)\n\nOver/under: 46.5\n\nUSA TODAY Sports’ staff picks for this game:\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Lions 28, Falcons 23\n\nTyler Dragon: Lions 24, Falcons 17\n\nVictoria Hernandez: Lions 24, Falcons 20\n\nJordan Mendoza: Lions 28, Falcons 24\n\nSaints at Packers: Predictions, picks and odds\n\nThe Lions are favorites to defeat the Seahawks, according to the BetMGM NFL odds.\n\nSpread: Packers (-2)\n\nMoneyline: Packers (-125); Saints (+105)\n\nOver/under: 42.5\n\nUSA TODAY Sports’ staff picks for this game:\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Saints 20, Packers 18\n\nTyler Dragon: Saints 24, Packers 21\n\nVictoria Hernandez: Packers 23, Saints 20\n\nJordan Mendoza: Packers 26, Saints\n\nTexans at Jaguars: Predictions, picks and odds\n\nThe Jaguars are favorites to defeat the Texans, according to the BetMGM NFL odds\n\nSpread: Jaguars (-9.5)\n\nMoneyline: Jaguars (-450); Texans (+350)\n\nOver/under: 44\n\nUSA TODAY Sports’ staff picks for this game:\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Jaguars 24, Texans 10\n\nTyler Dragon: Jaguars 27, Texans 12\n\nVictoria Hernandez: Jaguars 20, Texans 12\n\nJordan Mendoza: Jaguars 34, Texans 17\n\nBroncos at Dolphins: Predictions, picks and odds\n\nThe Dolphins are favorites to defeat the Broncos, according to BetMGM NFL odds.\n\nSpread: Dolphins (-6.5)\n\nMoneyline: Dolphins (-300); Broncos (+230)\n\nOver/under: 48\n\nUSA TODAY Sports’ staff picks for this game:\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Dolphins 29, Broncos 20\n\nTyler Dragon: Dolphins 28, Broncos 20\n\nVictoria Hernandez: Dolphins 28, Broncos 20\n\nJordan Mendoza: Dolphins 31, Broncos 23\n\nChargers at Vikings: Predictions, picks and odds\n\nThe Chargers are favorites to defeat the Vikings, according to BetMGM NFL odds.\n\nSpread: Chargers (-1)\n\nMoneyline: Chargers (-110); Vikings (-110)\n\nOver/under: 54\n\nUSA TODAY Sports’ staff picks for this game:\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Vikings 26, Chargers 23\n\nTyler Dragon: Chargers 25, Vikings 23\n\nVictoria Hernandez: Chargers 28, Vikings 24\n\nJordan Mendoza: Chargers 33, Vikings 30\n\nPatriots at Jets: Predictions, picks and odds\n\nThe Patriots are favorites to defeat the Jets, according to BetMGM NFL odds.\n\nSpread: Patriots (-3)\n\nMoneyline: Patriots (-155); Jets (+130)\n\nOver/under: 37\n\nUSA TODAY Sports’ staff picks for this game:\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Patriots 17, Jets 10\n\nTyler Dragon: Patriots 20, Jets 16\n\nVictoria Hernandez: Jets 17, Patriots 13\n\nJordan Mendoza: Patriots 17, Jets 12\n\nBills at Commanders: Predictions, picks and odds\n\nThe Bills are favorites to defeat the Commanders, according to BetMGM NFL odds.\n\nSpread: Bills (-6.5)\n\nMoneyline: Bills (-275); Commanders (+220)\n\nOver/under: 44.5\n\nUSA TODAY Sports’ staff picks for this game:\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Bills 30, Commanders 22\n\nTyler Dragon: Bills 28, Commanders 20\n\nVictoria Hernandez: Bills 30, Commanders 20\n\nJordan Mendoza: Bills 31, Commanders 23\n\nWho is the highest-paid NFL player?\n\nThe NFL's top 15 players in average annual salary are all quarterbacks, according to OverTheCap.com. As Joe Burrow proved in his new deal with the Cincinnati Bengals, teams place a huge priority on having a top-flight QB under center. Burrow's five-year, $275 million contract extension made him the league's highest paid player at a staggering average annual value of $55 million.

A lot, actually.\n\nArmed with a clipboard and his disarming personality, Clint Oldenburg readies himself for the questions. And on this particular Friday afternoon at Washington Commanders practice, there will be plenty.\n\nThe interrogators are the players themselves, and the topic of their consternation (in most cases) is both subjective and a cultural touchpoint: their Madden NFL 24 ratings.\n\n\"They care a lot,\" Oldenburg, a ratings adjuster and former NFL offensive lineman, told USA TODAY Sports. \"In my mind, the Madden rating is kind of like their street cred out there.\"\n\nThat's why some players’ reactions to their initial ratings can be combative. Dallas Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs, upon learning he was an 87 overall, took to social media to display his displeasure.\n\nRead Chris Bumbaca’s full feature here.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/12/entertainment/dave-chappelle-transgender-controversy-timeline-cec/index.html", "title": "Dave Chappelle on 'SNL': A timeline of the controversy around his ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTonight Dave Chappelle will host “Saturday Night Live” for the third time – an appearance that is courting controversy before he even takes the stage.\n\nThe comedian has drawn increasing ire in recent years for making jokes aimed at transgender people, and the outcry grew louder last fall when Netflix released a Chappelle special, “The Closer,” in which he doubled down on his comments.\n\nNetflix stood by Chappelle, who went on a national tour after the special and largely ignored the controversy after addressing it in his act.\n\nBut his comments were criticized by fellow comics, fans, trans advocates and some Netflix employees, and a Minnesota venue canceled a Chappelle show this year over the controversy.\n\nGiven that context, it was surprising to some “SNL” viewers to see him invited back to Studio 8H. Here’s a look at Chappelle’s recent history of jokes about trans people – and the resulting backlash.\n\n2017\n\nAugust: In a series of stand-up shows at New York City’s Radio City Music Hall, Chappelle made jokes aimed at trans people for at least 20 minutes, Vulture reported. He made explicit jokes about trans people’s bodies and referred to trans people as “transgenders,” among other comments, Vulture said.\n\nThese weren’t the first jokes Chappelle had made at trans people’s expense. But he delivered them in New York after drawing some backlash for earlier comments.\n\n“That joke and others in this section suffer from the same problems as those from his specials – they are rooted in disgust and generalization,” Vulture wrote of a Chappelle joke about ISIS fighters being horrified by transgender soldiers. “They’re just not good.”\n\n2019\n\nAugust 26: Netflix released a stand-up special, “Sticks and Stones,” in which Chappelle performed more material about trans people, including some content from his Radio City shows. In an epilogue to the special, he brought up his friend Daphne Dorman, a trans comedian, whom he said laughed hardest at his jokes about trans people.\n\n2021\n\nOctober 5: Netflix released Chappelle’s special “The Closer.” In it, he goes on an extended tangent about transgender people and makes several jokes at their expense. He misgenders a trans comedian, once again makes explicit jokes about trans women’s bodies and defends TERFs, or trans-exclusionary radical feminists.\n\nHe also referred to trans people as “transgenders,” states that “gender is a fact” and later says that Dorman died by suicide shortly after she was criticized by other trans people for defending Chappelle after “Sticks and Stones.”\n\nAt the time Chappelle’s special was released, at least 33 states had introduced anti-transgender legislation, much of it aimed at young trans people.\n\nOctober 13: Amid calls from LGBTQ advocates, fellow comedians, Netflix employees and social justice organizations to pull the special, Netflix stood by Chappelle.\n\nIn a letter obtained by the Verge and Variety, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos told employees that the special will remain available to stream.\n\n“We don’t allow titles on Netflix that are designed to incite hate or violence, and we don’t believe ‘The Closer’ crosses that line … Some people find the art of stand-up to be mean spirited but our members enjoy it, and it’s an important part of our content offering,” Sarandos wrote.\n\nNetflix suspended three employees for attending a virtual meeting of directors to discuss the special without notifying the meeting organizer in advance. Among them was Terra Field, a trans senior software engineer who had publicly criticized the special and Netflix. Her suspension was later reversed.\n\nDave Chappelle attends the UK premiere of \"Dave Chappelle: Untitled\" at Cineworld Leicester Square on October 17, 2021, in London. Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images\n\nOctober 19: Sarandos told Variety he “screwed up” his communications with Netflix employees but reaffirmed he did not believe the special qualifies as “hate speech.”\n\nOctober 20: Around 65 demonstrators, including Netflix employees and trans advocates, participated in a walkout in protest of Netflix’s support of “The Closer.” The demonstrators called on Netflix to hire more trans and non-binary executives and fund more trans and non-binary talent.\n\nOctober 24: Three trans stand-up comics told CNN they were disappointed by Chappelle’s jokes, even though all three said they once considered the celebrated performer as a comedy inspiration. While all of them agreed that jokes about trans people aren’t inherently offensive, they said Chappelle’s set was infused with the same hateful rhetoric and language used by anti-transgender critics.\n\n“When he talks about the trans community, he’s not talking about them, he’s speaking out against them,” comedian Nat Puff told CNN. “And that’s the difference between saying something funny about the trans community and saying something offensive about the trans community.”\n\nA fourth comic, Flame Monroe, one of the only trans comics whose material is streaming on Netflix, told CNN she believes Chappelle should be allowed to joke about trans people, even though she initially was taken aback by some of his comments.\n\nOctober 25: Chappelle addressed critics at a show in Nashville, appearing alongside Joe Rogan, the podcast host who’s been criticized for dismissing the effectiveness of vaccines and using racial slurs, among other controversies.\n\nChappelle released videos on his official Instagram account from the set, in which he seemingly addressed the trans employees at Netflix who participated in the walkout over “The Closer.”\n\n“It seems like I’m the only one who can’t go to the office anymore,” he said.\n\n“I want everyone in this audience to know that even though the media frames it as though it’s me versus that community, that’s not what it is,” Chappelle went on. “Do not blame the LBGTQ (sic) community for any of this s—. This has nothing to do with them. It’s about corporate interest and what I can say and what I cannot say.”\n\n“For the record – and I need you to know this – everyone I know from that community has been nothing but loving and supportive. So I don’t know what all this nonsense is about.”\n\n2022\n\nJuly 12: “The Closer” was nominated for two Emmys, including “outstanding variety special (pre-recorded).” Adele later won the category.\n\nJuly 21: A Minneapolis venue canceled Chappelle’s sold-out show hours before its doors were set to open, apologizing to “staff, artists and our community” after receiving criticism for hosting Chappelle.\n\n“We believe in diverse voices and the freedom of artistic expression, but in honoring that, we lost sight of the impact this would have,” wrote First Avenue, the venue famous for being featured in Prince’s “Purple Rain” film.\n\nNovember 5: “Saturday Night Live” announced Chappelle would be its post-midterms host. The backlash was swift.\n\nField joked on Twitter: “Wait I thought I cancelled (sic) him. Is it possible cancel culture isn’t a real thing??”\n\nNovember 10: After the New York Post reported that several “SNL” writers are boycotting Saturday’s episode, Chappelle’s representatives told CNN there are no issues with writers or cast members. “SNL’s” current staff includes nonbinary cast member Molly Kearney and nonbinary writer Celeste Yim.\n\nChappelle will take the stage live Saturday at 11:30 p.m. ET.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/27/corrections-clarifications-2017/3031456001/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications 2017", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWe recognize that mistakes may happen – or that new information can emerge after a story is published – and we pledge to address all concerns quickly, fairly and transparently.

The situation has been “simmering for months”, but became worse this week after Belarusian authorities “escorted an estimated 1,000 people, most of whom are from the Middle East, to the Polish border”.\n\nThe European Commission has accused Minsk of using “people as pawns” in Lukashenko’s dispute with the bloc, warning that he must “stop putting people's lives at risk” following “a sudden surge” in migrants on the EU’s eastern border, euronews said.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The Polish government has closed a major border crossing at Kuznica, with government spokesperson Piotr Muller telling reporters that up to 4,000 migrants are currently gathered across the border in Belarus.\n\nMuller has warned that Lukashenko is trying to create “an escalation” of “an armed nature” amid the tense stand-off, while Stanislaw Zaryn, head of Poland’s national security department, has said the Belarusian president “wants to cause a major incident, preferably with shots fired and casualties”.\n\nWith so many refugees finding themselves “trapped between borders”, The Guardian said, “at least eight” people have reportedly died so far “due to exposure”. Most of the migrants are currently camping out in “inhospitable forests as temperatures drop below freezing”.\n\nVideos seen by the paper show Polish border guards “spraying chemicals at men who were trying to cut the razor-wire border fence”. In other footage “gunshots were audible”. However, “it is not clear whether anyone was injured” as a result.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the EU is considering “extending sanctions” to include “third-country airlines” that are “involved in flying migrants to Belarus”, the BBC said. Germany has also offered to help Poland “secure its borders”, the broadcaster added.\n\nNato, of which Poland is a member, has also warned Minsk against “using migrants as political pawns”.\n\n‘A new low’\n\nThere is “no doubt Poland faces a legitimate emergency”, Politico said, with border guards reporting “more than 30,000 illegal attempts to cross the border since August”.\n\nLukashenko is clearly “trying to weaponize thousands of desperate people hungering to get into the EU as a way of punishing the bloc for the sanctions imposed on him”, the site continued. And while “the government’s tough approach to securing the border is popular”, it is raising “qualms about the humanitarian aspects”.\n\n“Some left-wing politicians have been calling for migrants to be admitted” and “granted asylum status”, the site added. But keeping the migrants suspended in limbo outside the country is “strengthening” the Law and Justice Party’s “appeal with its core voters”.\n\nFurther complicating the situation is the looming presence of Vladimir Putin behind Lukashenko’s regime. The man dubbed “Europe’s last dictator” has few allies on the international stage, but is reliant on Moscow’s support to prop up his ailing administration.\n\nThe Russian president “has already proved himself a master of the dark arts of hybrid warfare”, said The Telegraph, and “characteristically, there is plausible deniability for the former KGB agent in his latest assault on the West”.\n\nLukashenko “calculates that Fortress Europe will be so horrified by this new front” that “the EU could drop the sanctions against Belarus”. But “European governments believe this change of tempo was ordered not from Minsk, but from Moscow”.\n\nPutin “doesn’t miss an opportunity to sow discord among the member states”, the paper added. But the “use of thousands of desperate migrants to drive a wedge between the EU represents a new low for the cunning Russian president”.\n\nAny use of violence against the migrants “risks giving Belarus a propaganda win as it attempts to portray Poland as a violator of human rights”, said The New Statesman’s Europe correspondent Ido Vock.\n\nAnd with activists warning that “as winter approaches, conditions at the border will become deadlier”, Minsk has shown no signs that it plans to drop its “support of illegal migration into the EU, with potentially devastating consequences”.\n\nFurther sanctions could follow. But if they fail to break the deadlock, Belarus’s “attack on Polish sovereignty” will continue, The Telegraph said.\n\n“Putin clearly approves of the tactic,” the paper added. And he “​​has shown himself willing to use every weapon at his disposal” to achieve his aims.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Becca Stanek", "Brendan Morrow", "Devika Rao", "Rafi Schwartz", "Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Elliott Goat", "Joel Mathis", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona/2019/05/24/arizona-war-dead-casualty-list-men-and-women-who-died-service/3640947002/", "title": "Arizona war dead: Complete list of the men and women who died in ...", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nAlmost 3,000 Arizonans have died in America’s wars since 1917, giving their lives in service to their country.\n\nThey fell in Europe, the South Pacific, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and other lands far from the desert and pine of their home state.\n\nAlmost 200 have died in 21st century conflicts.\n\nIn their memory, we publish this list — so we never forget their sacrifice.\n\nWhile care has been taken to include all the names of Arizona war dead, we acknowledge the inevitability of error.

It marked the fourth trip to space and back for the Dragon Endeavour, having supported SpaceX's previous missions Axiom-1, Crew-2, and Demo-2.\n\nSplashdown wraps up NASA's SpaceX Crew-6 ISS mission\n\nUpon touchdown in the Atlantic Ocean, Crew-6 Commander Stephen Bowen said, \"Thanks, SpaceX. We really appreciate all the support – from all the initial training through the launch, throughout the mission, keeping us abreast of the status of the vehicle, and all the support all the way down.\"\n\n\"This has been incredible,\" Bowen said. \"Greatly appreciated. I look forward to working with you all again.\"\n\nThe conclusion of the nearly six-month science mission aboard the International Space Station began 17 hours prior to splashdown.\n\nAt 7:05 a.m. Sunday, NASA's Stephen Bowen and Woody Hoburg, the United Arab Emirates' Sultan Alneyadi, and Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev closed the hatch of their Dragon and departed the space station.\n\nAfter spending most of the day circling the globe in orbit Sunday, the Dragon Endeavour autonomously performed the final of five deorbit burns at 11:24 p.m., committing it and its crew on the final descent back to Earth.\n\nAs it plunged through the Earth's atmosphere, the Dragon's heatshield endured temperatures of up to 3,500 degrees, which produced a layer of plasma around the capsule and knocked out ground communications with the crew for about seven minutes, a routine part of reentry.\n\nOnce SpaceX teams approached the bobbing capsule to confirm that no toxic propellants were leaking, it was rigged and hoisted up onto the deck of an awaiting recovery ship, which SpaceX calls \"Megan,\" named after NASA astronaut Megan McArthur.\n\nThe crew of four would complete medical checkouts aboard the vessel before boarding a helicopter for the short jaunt back to Kennedy Space Center in Florida and an eventual return trip to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Texas.\n\nSplashdown and recovery officially complete a mission dedicated to thousands of hours of science experiments and station maintenance.\n\nTo date, SpaceX has flown 11 human spaceflight missions overall. Eight of those missions have been contracted with NASA's Commercial Crew Program, while the other three flew private astronauts – Inspiration4, Axiom-1, and Axiom-2.\n\nThe latest mission, Crew-7, carried NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli, European Space Agency astronaut Andreas Mogensen, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Satoshi Furukawa, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Konstantin Borisov to the space station just over a week ago.\n\nWhen is the next launch?\n\nFlorida's next liftoff is slated to be a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.\n\nThe national security mission, a joint effort between the U.S. Space Force and the National Reconnaissance Office, is set to carry secretive payloads to geostationary orbit.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThree astronauts lifted off to China’s nearly completed space station on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the country’s long-term presence in space.\n\nIt’s a major achievement for China’s ambitious space program, which has explored the far side of the moon and Mars. The milestone also means the aging International Space Station’s role as the sole venue for continuous human occupancy in Earth’s orbit is coming to an end.\n\nThe three astronauts launched aboard the Shenzhou-15 spacecraft at 11:08 p.m. local time (10:08 a.m. ET) on Tuesday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert, Inner Mongolia. The Shenzhou-15 spacecraft is expected to dock with the Tiangong Space Station about 6.5 hours after launch.\n\nThe arrival of the three astronauts — Fei Junlong, Deng Qingming and Zhang Lu — will mark the first crew rotation on the space station, with two teams overlapping for five to 10 days before the Shenzhou-14 crew, who landed at the station in June, returns to Earth.\n\nThe Shenzhou-15 mission will finish the orbital outpost’s construction, expected by the end of December, and launch the first stage of “its application and development,” Ji Qiming, assistant to the China Manned Space Agency director, said at a press conference on Monday, according to state media Xinhua.\n\nDuring the mission, according to state media, the crew will also conduct more than 40 experiments and tests in the fields of space science research, space medicine and space technology, as well as three to four extravehicular activities — performed by astronauts in space suits.\n\n(From left) Chinese astronauts Zhang Lu, Deng Qingming and Fei Junlong attend a prelaunch ceremony at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on November 29. VCG/Getty Images\n\nSmaller than the ISS\n\nOnce construction is completed, the space station is expected to last for 15 years. China plans to launch two crewed missions and two cargo missions to the station every year, according to the CMSA.\n\nTiangong, which means heavenly palace, is smaller than the International Space Station but similar in its modular design. The new space station will typically house three rather than six astronauts.\n\nOfficials at NASA have said it will retire the ISS, which is a collaboration between the US, Russia, Japan, Canada and the European Space Agency, in 2030.\n\nHowever, Russia has threatened to quit the ISS starting in 2024, which would make operating the ISS difficult, said Dr. Stefania Paladini, a reader in economics and global security at Birmingham City University in the United Kingdom.\n\n“There is no clarity about the future of the ISS after 2024. While the US seems committed to extend its life until 2030, Russia threatened to withdraw its participation after that date, (which would) make it extremely challenging to continue flying the ISS,” said Paladini, author of “The New Frontiers of Space: Economic Implications, Security Issues and Evolving Scenarios.”\n\n“The Chinese Space Station may … end up remaining the only human presence in Earth’s orbit for a while.”\n\nInternational collaboration\n\nThe new space station is expected to host around 1,000 scientific experiments during its life span.\n\nMost of the experiments taking place on board the Tiangong will involve research originating from China, but the country has invited experiments from international researchers, including how cancer tumors react to zero gravity.\n\nChina’s astronauts have long been excluded from the ISS, due to US political objections and legislative restrictions. However, CMSA astronauts have trained with their counterparts at the European Space Agency.\n\nIt’s not clear whether China would welcome astronauts from other countries to its space station, but Molly Silk, a doctoral researcher at the University of Manchester in the UK focused on China’s space program, said she thought it very likely that international astronauts would visit in the coming years.\n\n“Several European astronauts have been learning Chinese in order to better cooperate with their Chinese counterparts, which suggests that a visit to the CSS could be on the cards. Pakistan has also been trying to coordinate with China to send their first astronaut to space,” she said.\n\n“This project demonstrates to the world that China has both the vision and capabilities to pull off such an immensely challenging feat. The CSS will not only allow for China and other nations to conduct experiments in space, but acts as an important checkpoint for China’s planned international research base on the moon.”\n\nDebris risks\n\nEarlier this year, the space station’s two laboratory modules — Wentian and Mengtian — docked along the Tianhe core cabin, the main living space for the astronauts.\n\nThe Mengtian lab was launched by China’s massive Long March 5B rocket, remnants of which made an uncontrolled reentry into Earth’s atmosphere in early November.\n\nIt was the fourth uncontrolled reentry for a Long March 5B rocket since China’s space agency started flying it two years ago, as the vehicle was designed without the necessary equipment to steer itself to a safe landing.\n\nOfficials at NASA have slammed China for taking unnecessary risks. However, Tuesday’s launch involved China’s smaller Long March-2F rocket, used for human space flight, which experts have previously said is less likely to produce hazardous debris.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt Alex Stambaugh", "Katie Hunt", "Alex Stambaugh"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2023/09/04/splashdown-nasa-spacex-crew-6-astronauts-return-to-earth-iss-space-station-florida/70720874007/", "title": "Splashdown!

But that was before a piece of space junk pierced the explorers' original capsule late last year, requiring a new Soyuz spacecraft to be rushed up to them for their return journey to Earth.\n\nUltimately, Rubio would spend 371 days in space before his mission came to an end, according to NASA. Rubio and his Russian companions — Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin — landed Wednesday morning in a remote area of Kazakhstan in the replacement Soyuz capsule that had only reached them aboard the space station two weeks ago.\n\nIt might not have been Rubio's intention, but his lengthy and unanticipated stay in space helped him make history: The 47-year-old astronaut now holds the American record for the longest spaceflight, surpassing the previous endurance record set in 2022 by more than two weeks.\n\n“It’s good to be home,” Rubio said after being pulled from the capsule, according to the Associated Press.\n\nNASA UFO briefing:How NASA hopes to shift UAP talks 'from sensationalism to science'\n\nExpedition to space station intended to last six months\n\nWhen Rubio and the two cosmonauts launched Sept. 21, 2022 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, they thought they'd return to Earth the following March aboard the same spacecraft.\n\nBut that was not to be.\n\nA coolant leak in the Russian MS-22 Soyuz was detected in December while it was docked at the space station, meaning the trio would require a new ride home. NASA and Russian space agency Roscosmos later determined that a micrometeoroid had damaged the craft's radiator, causing coolant to spew into space for hours.\n\nEngineers worried that without cooling, the capsule’s electronics and any occupants could overheat to dangerous levels. Instead, the craft returned home empty while NASA and Roscosmos in February sent up a replacement spacecraft to the stranded crew, delaying the arrival of a new team of astronauts to relieve them.\n\nSince launching from Kazakhstan last September, Rubio and his crew logged more than 157 million miles and orbited Earth 5,963 times, NASA said. After undocking from the space station in the Soyuz craft at 3:54 a.m. Eastern Time this morning, the trio landed on schedule at 7.17 a.m. on the steppe of Kazakhstan, southeast of the town of Dzhezkazgan, according to the space agency.\n\nTo the moon and back:Astronauts get 1st look at Artemis II craft ahead of lunar mission\n\nWho held the previous American spaceflight record?\n\nRubio's stay in space was 16 days longer than Mark Vande Hei's time aboard the International Space Station.\n\nVande Hei returned to Earth in March 2022 after 355 days in space, which was at the time the record for the longest continuous spaceflight by an American.\n\nHowever, it's Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov whose 437 consecutive days spent in space in the mid-1990s remains the world record. Polyakov's milestone mission occurred between 1994 and 1995 aboard the Russian space station Mir, according to Astronomy.com.\n\nWho is Frank Rubio?\n\nAn Army doctor and helicopter pilot, Rubio joined NASA in 2017.\n\nBefore joining the space program, Rubio served in the U.S. Army flying combat missions in a Blackhawk helicopter during deployments to Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. In 2010, Rubio earned a doctorate in medicine and remains a board-certified family physician and flight surgeon.\n\nA native of Los Angeles, Rubio resides in Miami, Florida with his family.\n\nRubio's year-long expedition to the International Space Station was his first mission to space.\n\nMaking the most out of his time aboard the space station, Rubio worked on numerous science projects, including studying how bacteria adapt to spaceflight and how future astonauts can exercise and best maintain physical health. He also conducted three spacewalks surpassing 21 hours.\n\nThe investigations may prove invaluable for future missions, but in a September interview with Vande Hei shared by NASA, Rubio said that his proudest moment was to have the opportunity to fly with 28 different people aboard the space station.\n\n\"Every one of them have just been great crewmates, very special people and they hold special places now because I've been able to share this experience with them,\" Rubio said. \"That's the memory that I'll hold most dear forever.\"\n\nNow that he's landed, Rubio and his Russian companions Prokopyev and Petelin were to be flown from the landing site to Karaganda, Kazakhstan. From there, the American astronaut was to board a NASA plane back to Houston — a trip that this time won't be delayed.\n\n'A promising step:'NASA says planet 8.6 times bigger than Earth could support life\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nSpaceX’s Falcon Heavy — a towering, three-pronged vehicle that is the most powerful operational rocket in the world — returned to the skies on Tuesday for the first time since mid-2019.\n\nThe rocket launched at 9:41 a.m. ET from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, hauling satellites to space for the US military in a secretive mission dubbed USSF-44.\n\nThe Falcon Heavy debuted in 2018 to much fanfare as SpaceX CEO Elon Musk elected to launch his personal Tesla Roadster as a test payload on the launch. The car is still in space, taking an oblong path around the sun that swings out as far as Mars’ orbital path.\n\nSince that first test mission, SpaceX has launched only two other Falcon Heavy missions, both in 2019. One sent a hulking TV and phone service satellite to orbit for Saudi Arabia-based Arabsat, and the other delivered a batch of experimental satellites for the US Department of Defense.\n\nBut the rocket had not launched since 2019, as the vast majority of SpaceX’s missions don’t require the Falcon Heavy’s amped up power. SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, on the other hand, has launched nearly 50 missions so far this year alone.\n\nWith each Falcon Heavy launch, the rocket puts on a dramatic showing back on Earth.\n\nAfter Tuesday’s mission, the company only attempted to recover two of the Falcon Heavy rocket’s first-stage rocket boosters — the tall white sticks that are strapped together to give the rocket its heightened power at liftoff.\n\nAs planned, the center booster was left to plunge into the ocean, where it will remain, because it did not have enough leftover fuel to guide its journey home, according to a news release from the US military’s Space Systems Command.\n\nThe two side boosters, however, made their signature synchronized landing on ground pads near the Florida coastline.\n\nIn the past, SpaceX has attempted to land all three of the rocket’s boosters back on landing pads on land and at sea so that they can be refurbished and reused on future missions. It does this to cut down on mission costs. The company has yet to suceed at retrieving all three, although it’s come dramatically close. The two side boosters made a pinpoint, synchronized landing on ground pads after an April 2019 mission, and the rocket’s center booster touched down on a sea-faring platform. But then, rough waves at sea toppled it over.\n\nAll about this rocket\n\nThough the Falcon Heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world, there are two massive rockets waiting in the wings to claim that title.\n\nNASA’s Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket, which is currently slated to attempt its inaugural launch later in November to send the uncrewed Artemis 1 mission around the moon, is sitting in the Kennedy Space Center’s towering Vehicle Assembly Building, which lies just a few miles from the launch pad where the Falcon Heavy will take flight.\n\nWhile the Falcon Heavy gives off about five million pounds of thrust, SLS is expected to put off as much as 8.8 million pounds of thrust — 15% more thrust than the Saturn V rockets that powered the mid-20th Century moon landings.\n\nAnd just across the Gulf Coast, at SpaceX’s experimental facilities in South Texas, the company is in the final stages of preparing for the first orbital launch attempt of its Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket. Though the test flight is still awaiting final approval from federal regulators, it could take flight before the end of the year.\n\nThe Starship system is expected to out-power both SLS and Falcon Heavy by a wide margin. The forthcoming Super Heavy booster, which is designed to vault the Starship spacecraft into space, is expected to put off about 17 million pounds of thrust alone.\n\nBoth the SLS rocket and SpaceX’s Starship are integral to NASA’s plans to return astronauts to the surface of the moon for the first time in half a century.\n\nSpaceX also has its own, ambitious vision for the Starship: ferrying humans and cargo to Mars in the hopes of one day establishing a permanent human settlement there.\n\nAll about this mission\n\nThere is not much publicly available information about the USSF-44 mission. In a news release, the US military’s Space Systems Command said only that the launch will put multiple satellites into orbit on behalf of the Space Systems Command’s Innovation and Prototyping Delta, which is focused on quickly developing space technology as it relates to tracking objects in space as well as a range of other activities.\n\nThe Space System Command declined to provide additional information about the mission when reached by email. It referred questions to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, which also declined comment.\n\nThe US military is one of the primary drivers of the domestic rocket economy, doling out lucrative launch contracts that are coveted by private launch companies including SpaceX and its chief competitor in the area, United Launch Alliance, which is a joint operation between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/09/02/peggy-whitson-returns-international-space-station/629337001/", "title": "Record-setting astronaut Peggy Whitson returns to Earth", "text": "Associated Press\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Astronaut Peggy Whitson returned to Earth late Saturday, wrapping up a record-breaking flight that catapulted her to first place for U.S. space endurance.\n\nWhitson’s 665 days off the planet — 288 days on this mission alone — exceeds that of any other American and any other woman worldwide.\n\nShe checked out of the International Space Station just hours earlier, along with another American and a Russian. Their Soyuz capsule landed in Kazakhstan shortly after sunrise Sunday — Saturday night back in the U.S.\n\nShe set multiple other records while in orbit: world’s oldest spacewoman, at age 57, and most experienced female spacewalker, with 10. She also became the first woman to command the space station twice following her launch last November.\n\nMore:North Korea says it has developed a new ICBM hydrogen bomb\n\nMore:DOJ confirms no evidence supporting Trump claim Obama wiretapped him\n\nReturning cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin logged even more time in space: 673 days over five missions. NASA astronaut Jack Fischer returned after 136 days aloft. The men flew up in April.\n\nIt was an emotional farewell for Whitson, Yurchikhin and Fischer. Before retreating into their Soyuz, they embraced the three colleagues they were leaving behind at the 250-mile-high complex. Yurchikhin patted the inside of the station before floating into his Soyuz for the final time.\n\nThe station’s newest commander, Randy Bresnik, noted the outpost was losing 1,474 days of spaceflight experience with the departure of Whitson, Yurchikhin and Fischer. Four years and two weeks, he pointed out.\n\n“We are in your debt for the supreme dedication that you guys have to the human mission of exploration,” Bresnik told them on the eve of their departure. He offered up special praise for Whitson — “American space ninja” — and wished them all Godspeed.\n\nWhitson, a biochemist, set a breakneck pace on all three of her space station expeditions, continually asking for more — and still more — scientific research to do. Scientists on the ground said it often was hard to keep up with her. She even experimented on food up there, trying to add some pizazz to the standard freeze-dried meals. Tortillas transformed into apple pies on her watch.\n\nWhitson was supposed to fly back in June after a half-year in space. But when an extra seat opened up on this Soyuz, she jumped at the chance to stay in orbit an extra three months. Only one other American — yearlong spaceman Scott Kelly — has spent longer in space on a single mission.\n\nExcept for the past week, Whitson said her mission hurried by. She’s hungry for pizza and can’t wait to use a regular flush toilet again. She’s also eager to reunite with her husband, Clarence Sams, a biochemist who also works at Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nBecause of the effects of Hurricane Harvey, NASA could not get its plane from Houston to Kazakhstan in time for the crew’s landing. Instead, the European Space Agency offered to transport Whitson and Fischer to Cologne, Germany, where they will meet up with the NASA plane for the final leg of their journey. They should be back in Houston on Sunday night.\n\nThree men remain at the space station: Bresnik, a Russian and an Italian. They will be joined by two Americans and a Russian following liftoff from Kazakhstan on Sept. 12.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/01/tech/space-business-year-in-review-scn/index.html", "title": "2021: The year of billionaires going to space | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe US military is racking up deals with commercial rocket companies to explore the idea of using rockets typically tasked with launching satellites or astronauts to shuttle military cargo around the world at record speeds.\n\nJeff Bezos and Richard Branson each took supersonic joy rides to the edge of space, finally bringing their competing private-sector spacecraft into operation after around two decades of promises. Celebrities such as 90-year-old “Star Trek” actor William Shatner and “Good Morning America” co-host Michael Strahan followed soon after. Another billionaire self-funded a historic, three-day mission aboard a SpaceX orbital capsule that flew higher than any human has traveled in decades.\n\nAnd all that promises to just be the beginning.\n\nThe trio of space billionaires — Branson, Bezos and Elon Musk — have their eyes set squarely on the future. Over the past year, their visions continued to bump up against one another, stirring up plenty of controversy and one-upmanship.\n\nHere’s a look back at some of the most memorable moments the commercial space industry had to offer in the last year.\n\nBranson v. Bezos\n\nBranson’s and Bezos’ space companies have for years been working to develop spacecraft capable of taking paying customers on brief, supersonic trips to the edge of space, promising to usher in an age in which booking a flight to view the Earth from space is as easy as jetting across the Atlantic. (Musk’s SpaceX, it should be noted, is not in the suborbital tourism game. Its rockets and spacecraft take much longer and more dangerous treks into Earth’s orbit.)\n\nWe’re not quite there yet. But both billionaires pledged to kick off their respective suborbital space tourism businesses by taking the rides themselves, both as a show of their confidence in their vehicles’ safety and some strategic PR.\n\nJeff Bezos spoke about his flight on Blue Origin's New Shepard into space during a press conference on July 20, 2021 in Van Horn, Texas. Bezos and the crew that flew with him were on the first human spaceflight for the company. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nBezos, founder of the rocket firm Blue Origin, planned to become the first person ever to travel to space aboard a spacecraft his own company developed, setting his sights on a July 20 launch. (Blue Origin even auctioned off a ticket to ride alongside him for a whopping $28 million, though that auction winner did not ultimately fly.)\n\nThen, Branson swooped in, announcing days later that he planned to hop on the next flight of the rocket-powered space plane developed by his company, Virgin Galactic, on July 11 — nine days before Bezos’ mission.\n\nThat set off an immediate wave of speculation that — although Branson has repeatedly said in interviews he doesn’t view his competition with Bezos as a “race” — there was a bitter rivalry brewing behind the scenes.\n\nRichard Branson takes off on July 11, 2021 from a base in New Mexico aboard a Virgin Galactic vessel bound for the edge of space. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBoth billionaires’ flights ended without apparent issue, with the men emerging from their respective spacecraft outfitted in custom flight suits and beaming for the cameras.\n\nAdding to the spectacle, both flights also carried some notable crewmates for the billionaires.\n\nBezos was joined by 82-year-old Wally Funk, who famously trained for NASA’s Mercury program in 1961 but never went to space, and then-18-year-old Oliver Daemen, the son of a wealthy businessman. The pair became the oldest and youngest people, respectively, ever to travel to space. (Funk’s record was bested shortly after by the 90-year-old William Shatner.)\n\nBranson took with him Virgin Galactic executive Sirisha Bandla, who became only the second Indian-born woman to fly to space and back.\n\nShaping up suborbital space\n\nBezos’ successful July launch catapulted the company into a busy rest of the year spent flying some high-profile figures as “honorary guests” — meaning they didn’t have to pay for tickets. Shatner took his suborbital excursion in October, a feat widely celebrated by “Star Trek” fans that was followed by an Amazon video special on the flight. Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the daughter of famed astronaut Alan Shepard, flew in December.\n\nWilliam Shatner and the NS-18 crew inside the capsule, floating around. Blue Origin\n\nWhile Blue Origin was sending celebrities to space, Virgin Galactic faced significant delays. A report from the New Yorker revealed that warning lights had gone off in the cockpit during Branson’s flight and the space plane had traveled outside its designated airspace for 41 seconds. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights pending a review, which concluded in September and gave Virgin Galactic the all-clear. Still, the company is delaying the start of commercial services, citing unrelated technology upgrades.\n\nBlue Origin, meanwhile, has faced its own controversies, though none that have indicated specific safety issues with its rocket or spacecraft.\n\nRather, a group of 21 current and former employees co-signed a letter alleging the company operates a toxic work environment where “professional dissent” is “actively stifled.” Blue Origin responded to the claims by saying it has “no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind.”\n\nInspiration4 flies higher\n\nThough Musk does not have any apparent plans to join one of SpaceX’s missions, his company continued to prove its technology chops. It drastically expanded its space-based internet service, Starlink, growing the constellation to include roughly 2,000 satellites. Its Dragon spacecraft also launched and returned astronauts to and from the International Space Station this year, and it topped the billionaire space tourism competition with a historic space tourism mission of its own.\n\nSpaceX’s Inspiration4 mission, self-funded by billionaire payments platform CEO Jared Isaacman, sent Isaacman and three other people, none of whom were professional astronauts, on a three-day trip to orbit that traveled even higher than the International Space Station — higher than any human has traveled this century.\n\nThe passengers floated around the capsule, played songs, created works of art and kept in touch with ground control as their 13-foot-wide capsule whisked around the planet once about every 90 minutes, traveling at more than 17,500 miles per hour.\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Inspiration4 crew launched from Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida on September 15, 2021. Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe mission was intended to raise money for St. Jude Children’s Hospital, a cause to which Isaacman donated $125 million and a public fundraiser fetched more than $118 million. Musk promised to donate $50 million.\n\nThe whole thing went off (almost) without a hitch.\n\nStill, all the billionaires-in-space news generated plenty of backlash, including from high-profile figures such as the United Nations secretary general and Prince William.\n\nA “disease is spreading in our world today: a malady of mistrust,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in September, adding that includes “billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on earth.”\n\nBezos v. Musk\n\nPlaying out in the background of all the space tourism hype was a tense battle pitting the two wealthiest people on the planet against each other.\n\nBezos and Musk each want their own companies to be at the center of NASA’s plans to return astronauts to the moon this decade. But after initially planning to bring on more than one contractor to build the lunar lander for the job, NASA later said it only had enough money for one — and it went with Musk’s SpaceX. It awarded $2.9 billion to the company.\n\nBlue Origin fought that decision all year, saying NASA unfairly favored SpaceX. Meanwhile, the PR offensives and twitter battles began.\n\nBut a federal judge delivered a major blow to Blue Origin in November by ruling in favor of NASA and SpaceX. That put the future of the Bezos-owned company’s plans to build a lunar lander into question.\n\nThe ordeal highlighted how important government contracts are to the viability of the commercial space industry. Though these companies are private, their revenue streams still rely heavily on taxpayer money.\n\nAnd the battle over NASA’s moon lander contract queued up what are sure to be more high-profile battles and an interesting few years ahead, as NASA and its contractors map out a path back to the lunar surface for the first time in half a century.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/01/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/05/13/soyuz-iss-capsule/9064147/", "title": "3 astronauts return to Earth", "text": "AP\n\nDZHEZKAZGAN, Kazakhstan (AP) — A Russian Soyuz space capsule carrying three astronauts who had spent a half-year aboard the International Space Station landed Wednesday in the steppes of Kazakhstan.\n\nThe landing occurred on schedule with the capsule descending under a white parachute.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nOfficials at NASA and Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, are working to decide how to bring home several people at the International Space Station after a Russian Soyuz spacecraft sprang a leak last week.\n\nNone of the seven people currently on board the ISS — including three Roscosmos cosmonauts, three NASA astronauts and one astronaut with Japan’s space agency — were ever in any danger as a result of the leak, officials have noted. But it’s not yet clear whether the spacecraft will be able to make a trip back home with its crew on board.\n\nThe Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft ferried NASA’s Frank Rubio and two Russian cosmonauts, Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitry Petelin, to the space station on September 21. It was scheduled to bring them back to Earth in March. But Roscosmos is now evaluating whether to fly its next Soyuz mission to the ISS empty and move the launch up two to three weeks so that the spacecraft can serve as a rescue vehicle for Rubio, Prokopyev, and Petelin if Soyuz MS-22 is deemed not safe enough for the crew. If Roscosmos goes with that plan, the next Soyuz mission could lift off in February, according to Montalbano.\n\nThe leak on the Soyuz MS-22, which is currently attached to the ISS at one of the orbiting laboratory’s eight docking ports, was identified on December 14. It forced the delay of a planned spacewalk by two cosmonauts last week, and live images during a NASA broadcast showed liquid spewing out from the spacecraft.\n\nRoscosmos determined that the leak occurred on an external cooling loop of the Soyuz. The leak is not expected to cause any external corrosion or damage to the exterior of the ISS, Montalbano noted, saying the leaked coolant “boils up very quickly” as it’s exposed.\n\nIt’s not yet clear was caused the leak, which has been traced to a small hole that could have been caused by a collision with a piece of space debris, a mechanical problem or some other issue, according to Montalbano.\n\nSpace debris was, however, the certain cause of a one-day delay for a spacewalk planned by the United States. Two astronauts were slated to venture out on Wednesday to install a new solar array to the space station’s exterior, but the ISS had to maneuver out of the way of a piece of spaceborne garbage. The debris was determined to be a piece of an old Russian rocket.\n\nThe ISS was able to maneuver successfully, and the US spacewalk kicked off Thursday morning without issue.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}]}

The White House hopefuls addressed the spread of fentanyl in the United States and workers' rights.\n\nBut the debate also turned personal Former President Donald Trump didn't attend the debate, but his Republican rivals took time to launch new attacks against the GOP frontrunner. As former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley sparred with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, she told him to \"bring it\" on the debate stage.\n\nThe Republican hopefuls started off the debate by discussing the United Auto Workers strike, with several criticizing President Joe Biden for joining the workers on the picket line earlier this week.\n\nSen. Tim Scott showed a feistier side in this debate, taking on Vivek Ramaswamy for having done business with China.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis jabbed at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for not participating in the debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here,\" DeSantis said.\n\nChris Christie: Kick Donald Trump 'off the island'\n\nNone of the Republican debaters wanted to vote one of their fellow candidates \"off the island,\" though Chris Christie suggested running Donald Trump out of the GOP primary.\n\n\"This guy has not only divided our party, he's divided families all over this country,\" Christie said. \"He needs to be taken out of this process.\"\n\nOther candidates balked at the last question of the evening, one borrowed from the game show \"Survivor:\" Who would you vote \"off the island.\"\n\nDeSantis voiced his objection, calling it \"disrespectful\" to the candidates who showed up to the debate.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRon DeSantis takes on Donald Trump over abortion\n\n“He should be here,” Ron DeSantis said of Donald Trump during Wednesday's debate, calling on the former president to explain his stance on abortion.\n\nTrump recently called the Florida governor’s six-week abortion ban “a terrible mistake” and refused to state his position on a federal ban, while on NBC’s Meet the Press.\n\nDeSantis, who has also fielded criticism from anti-abortion advocates for not taking a strong enough national abortion stance, called out Democrats for what he said are extremist abortion rights positions.\n\n“We’re better off when everybody counts,” he said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\n'Bring it, Tim:' South Carolina candidates Haley, Scott argue about experience\n\nThe two South Carolina candidates in this race went after each other over who has the better experience: Former Gov. Nikki Haley or current Sen. Tim Scott.\n\n\"Twelve years - where have you been?\" Haley asked Scott, citing the Senate's uneven record on issues like debt and federal spending.\n\nScott responded that Haley's experience as governor is inadequate, and the two drowned out each other in argument. It was broken up by DeSantis, who touted his own record as governor of Florida.\n\nHaley shot back at Scott \"Bring it, Tim.\"\n\nBoth Haley and Scott are aiming for the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24 - if they can make it that far.\n\n– David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy spar over Ukraine, China\n\nAnother fight broke out between Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy over foreign policy, this time over Russia’s war against Ukraine, as he said the candidates need to “level with the American people” on the issue.\n\n“Just because…Putin’s an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good,” he said, bringing up the country’s ban on 11 political parties with ties to Russia.\n\nInterrupting him, Haley said, “A win for Russia is a win for China.” She added, “But I forgot, you like China.”\n\nRamaswamy hit back that “hurling personal insults” were not helping.\n\nMike Pence also got in on the action, arguing that letting Russian President Vladimir Putin have Ukraine would be a “greenlight” to China to invade Taiwan. “Peace comes through strength,” Pence responded, in a nod to Reagan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nNikki Haley criticizes Donald Trump on his handling of China\n\nNikki Haley, who served as an ambassador to the United Nations under the Trump administration, took a jab at her former boss for his handling of China.\n\nShe said that she would end all normal trade relations with China until it stops contributing to the spread of fentanyl.\n\n“This is where President Trump went wrong,” Haley said. “He focused on trade with China. He didn't focus on the fact that they were buying up our farm and he didn't focus on the fact that they were killing Americans. He didn't focus on the fact that they were stealing $600 billion in intellectual property.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley tells Vivek Ramaswamy 'Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber'\n\nVivek Ramaswamy tried to defuse the biggest criticism of him: That he's a young and arrogant \"know-it-all\" who doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\n\"I'm here to tell you, I don’t know it all,\" Ramaswamy said, adding that he knows how to use staff and develop a strong organization.\n\nHis rivals didn't seem convinced, especially Haley.\n\nNoting that Ramaswamy has joined TikTok while pledging to confront Chinese spying, Haley told the upstart candidate: \"Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber for what you say.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMike Pence: ‘I’ll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American’\n\nWhen asked how he would protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination and violent attacks, Mike Pence said “I’ll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American from every background.”\n\nBut Pence quickly turned to transgender children and their rights at school.\n\n“We've got to empower parents at the state level with the ability to choose where the kids go to school, whether it's public, private, parochial or homeschool,” Pence said. “You empower parents, and our schools will straighten up and reflect our values and focus on the basics faster than you can possibly imagine.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'How it's done': Ron DeSantis touts education record\n\nRon DeSantis answered controversy around Florida’s new history curriculum, which requires teachers to instruct students on “how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” The Florida governor called criticism and response to the change a “hoax” led by Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDeSantis turned his comments to Florida’s other education policies, including the Parental Rights in Education Act, dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by opponents. The law bans instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in grades K-12.\n\n“Florida is showing how it’s done,” DeSantis said, boasting his administration’s focus parents’ rights and having “eliminated critical race theory.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence takes on 'former running mate' Trump\n\nMike Pence also got in a few digs at Donald Trump on Wednesday, faulting him for proposals that would expand government.\n\nReferring to the ex-president as \"my former running mate,\" Pence said that \"Donald Trump has a plan to consolidate more power to the government.\"\n\nIt looked like a planned attack: Pence dragged in Trump after a question about whether former President Barack Obama's health care would survive all Republican efforts to repeal it. However, Pence did not address Obamacare.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley calls for transparency in the healthcare system\n\nNikki Haley told a story about her mother being in the hospital, and when healthcare workers tried to bring her Tylenol and she refused, they said ‘honey, go ahead and take it because you're paying for it anyway.’\n\n“Why is it that when we got the bill, the insurance company in the hospital negotiated the bill for her without her having anything to do with it?” Haley said. “When I'm president, we will bring all that from the insurance company to the hospitals.\n\n\"We will make it all transparent because when you do that, you realize that's what the problem is,\" Haley added.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Address fentanyl crisis by sealing border, addressing mental health\n\nWhen asked how he would stop fentanyl brought into the country through ports of entry, Vivek Ramaswamy said that there’s two sides to the issue: seal the southern border and address the mental health epidemic in America.\n\nHe referenced two parents he met whose son died after buying Percocet on Snapchat.\n\n“It is our job to make sure that never happens,” Ramaswamy said. “But it's also our job to make sure that 17 year olds don't turn to Percocet via Snapchat. We have to bring back mental health care in this country, not with pumping pharmaceuticals but with faith based approaches.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMore politics, in your inbox.

It's a reference to the Chinese Communist Party\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRon DeSantis: Donald Trump is 'missing in action'\n\nFollowing Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis also invoked Donald Trump's absence from the debate by saying that Biden and others are \"missing in action\" when it comes to national leadership.\n\n\"You know who else is missing in action?\" DeSantis said, referencing the former president's choice to skip the second GOP debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Missing in action':Ron DeSantis blast Donald Trump for skipping the GOP presidential debate\n\nVivek Ramaswamy veers from Tim Scott, sides with workers\n\nWhile saying he agrees with the “spirit” of Tim Scott’s comments on the ongoing UAW strike, Vivek Ramaswamy added that he sympathizes with workers.\n\n“I understand that hardship is not a choice,” Ramaswamy said, referencing his own family and upbringing. He added, though, that he believes “victimhood\" is a choice and told workers to picket outside the White House in Washington in a message to President Joe Biden.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence: Joe Biden should be on the unemployment line, not the picket line\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence pulls out the first pre-planned line of the night, saying that Biden \"doesn't belong on the picket line - he belongs on the unemployment line.\"\n\nLike the other candidates, Pence hits Biden for the condition of the economy. The group of GOP hopefuls quickly zeroed in on inflation, jobs and other economic issues.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTim Scott weighs in on UAW strike, blasts Biden\n\nTim Scott, when asked about his previous comments that striking workers should be fired, said that the president can’t fire anyone in the private sector.\n\nHowever, he criticized workers for wanting additional benefits and fewer hours, saying that this will simply not stand.\n\nHe also blasted Biden for being on the picket line in Michigan to show support to striking autoworkers and said the president should be at the southern border instead.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump praises unions, attacks Joe Biden, mocks GOP rivals before debate\n\nSeeking to divert attention from a debate among his Republican opponents, Donald Trump traveled to Michigan for a speech extolling union members, attacking President Joe Biden, and mocking his GOP campaign opponents.\n\n\"You know, we're competing with the job candidates,\" Trump said at one point during an event in Clinton Township, Mich., adding he didn't even see a potential vice president or Cabinet secretary in the group.\n\nTrump designed his speech on \"economic nationalism\" to take advantage of the ongoing auto workers strike. He blamed it on Biden, saying his emphasis on electric cars will lead to the elimination of auto workers' jobs.\n\n\"Yesterday, Joe Biden came to Michigan to pose for photos at the picket line,\" Trump said. \"But it's his policies that send Michigan auto workers to the unemployment line!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTim Scott needs a breakout moment. Will this debate be his chance?\n\nTim Scott, who is lagging in the Republican primary polls, struggled to have a breakout moment on stage in the last debate, often disappearing into the background as other candidates sparred over issues like Ukraine aid and abortion.\n\nThis debate, however, could look different.\n\nModerators could contrast Scott's positions with Nikki Haley, since both candidates are from South Carolina. The senator will also likely face questions about a complaint filed by the UAW over his comments supporting the idea that striking workers should be fired.\n\nBut Scott has said he doesn’t think he needs a standout moment on stage in the second debate\n\n“What I need to do is continue to do what I have been doing — showing up,” Scott told “Fox News Sunday.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate fact check: Follow along live\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data? An accurate description or a baseless conspiracy theory?\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will dig into key claims from the candidates as they make them during tonight’s Republican primary debate. Follow our live fact-check file as we dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nGOP debate live fact check: What the candidates get right – and wrong\n\n– Eric Litke\n\nWill the economy take center stage?\n\nThe Republican candidates onstage in California will likely spend swaths of the debate talking about jobs, inflation and other economic issues impacting Americans' wallets.\n\nAnd one of the sponsors of the debate is the Fox Business Network, so expect a lot of discussion of the economy. You can also expect a lot of attacks on President Joe Biden on these issues, many of which will follow the campaign for the next 13-and-a-half months.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia’s violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ description of the conflict as a “territorial dispute” helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a “war criminal.” Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a previous proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nRepublican debate in the shadows\n\nThe Ronald Reagan presidential library is nestled in the mountains of Simi Valley, Calif., but the candidates who debate here Wednesday night will be in some political shadows.\n\nAs much or more attention is being given to Donald Trump's speech in Michigan, and a prospective government shutdown is also soaking up media coverage.\n\nThat means the GOP challengers will have to work extra hard to get attention, perhaps on the topics of Trump and the shutdown.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRepublican candidates on immigration\n\nOfficials in New York City and San Diego have recently warned about the migrant crisis in their cities that have overwhelmed shelters, schools and other services.\n\nAnd Republican White House hopefuls will likely discuss immigration and the U.S. southern border during Wednesday's debate.\n\nOne candidate has already vowed to bring up the issue. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday that his first action if elected to the White House will be to send the National Guard to the border. He has also criticized Trump and Biden’s border policies and said he would be the only candidate willing to address the issue head on at the second debate.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nAnd then there were 7: Asa Hutchinson, other candidates aren't debating in Simi Valley\n\nThe debate stage in Simi Valley will be a little less crowded than the last time the GOP candidates went up against one another.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson barely made the August debate and did not meet the threshold for the September match. He’ll be watching on Wednesday evening from a Washington, D.C. hotel.\n\nHe is the only candidate who qualified for the first debate who missed the mark the second time.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, pastor Ryan Binkley, radio host Larry Elder and businessman Perry Johnson have not qualified for any of the primary debates yet.\n\nGOP frontrunner Donald Trump has met the donor and polling requirements, but he has declined to go head-to-head with his opponents so far.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates try to appeal to \"maybe Trump\" voters while he's in Michigan\n\nThe Republican debaters are looking for any slivers of good news in the polls, and they found a little bit this week: Many self-proclaimed Trump voters also say they are open to other candidates.\n\nIn Iowa and New Hampshire, \"most voters are still considering multiple candidates,\" CBS News said about its most recent survey of those states. These \"maybe Trump\" voters will be big targets in the debate.\n\nMany of the Republican presidential candidates have hesitated to criticize Trump for fear of alienating the many Republican voters who have backed him in the past. Those are voters they'll need if they are to somehow wrest the GOP presidential nomination away from him in 2024.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWill there be a Democratic primary debate?\n\nJoe Biden probably won't take the debate stage with his Democratic rivals.\n\nIf an incumbent president is running, political parties usually rally around that person's reelection bid. There's no formal rule, but at this point, Biden is the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nGavin Newsom: Republican debate is ‘vice presidential debate at best’\n\nThe second Republican presidential primary debate is nothing more than a try out to be Donald Trump’s running mate in 2024. At least that’s how California Gov. Gavin Newsom sees things.\n\n“This is a vice presidential debate at best,” he told CBS News. “This is the JV team.”\n\nNewsom, whose state is where Wednesday’s discussion is taking place, has been a surrogate for the Biden campaign and has vigorously defended the president and Democratic Party's record. He emphasized how Trump is “running away” with the primary in every poll.\n\n“This is the XFL, and it’s entertainment, I guess,” he said.\n\nNewsom is also set to debate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis later this year in Georgia in a Fox News event\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nHow will the Republican candidates line up?\n\nThere's a new debate lineup tonight, and not just because there are only seven candidates on stage.\n\nJust like the first Republican debate in Milwaukee, poll averages helped determine where the candidates will stand on stage: Nikki Haley and Tim Scott have moved up, while Mike Pence has moved down.\n\nOnce again, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy are listed first and second, and will be in the middle of the pack on stage at the Ronald Reagan library.\n\nHaley and Tim Scott will be on either side of those first two, in the 3 and 4 slots. Chris Christie is in the fifth position, Pence is in sixth, and the late-qualifying Doug Burgum is in seventh.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhich candidates would pardon former President Trump?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is facing four sets of criminal charges, and it has raised questions among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected president − and he's found guilty.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, who has defended Trump on the campaign trail, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have leaned towards a pardon, though Haley noted in interviews that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis indicated he would be pursuing pardons aggressively if he's elected but hasn’t given a definitive answer on Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDoug Burgum will appear on the debate stage - this time without an injured leg\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, the final candidate to qualify for the debate, will appear on stage with six other candidates vying for the Republican nomination. But with this debate, he won't have just injured his leg.\n\nBurgum, 67, was rushed to a emergency room after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball a day before the first GOP debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin last month. But he still made it on stage the next day.\n\n“I think I took them a little too literally when they said go to Milwaukee and break a leg,” he joked on stage that day.\n\nSudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Republican candidates clash with Ramaswamy again?\n\nVivek Ramaswamy will again be near the center of the debate stage, ensuring high-profile skirmishes with other candidates, according to Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and co-author of \"Debating The Donald.\"\n\nIn the last debate, many candidates sparred with Ramaswamy over his lack of experience and some of his controversial stances on foreign policy and former President Donald Trump’s indictments, which will likely resurface in the second debate.\n\nRamaswamy has leaned on ultra-conservative values to try to appeal to voters, but he has also reached out to younger Republicans as the youngest Republican candidate in the field.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGOP debate live updates:Republicans face off for 2nd time at Ronald Reagan library\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on abortion?\n\nNikki Haley reiterated her abortion stance in the first Republican debate, arguing that leaders need to find consensus on the issue, including agreeing to not jail women who have the procedure. A self-described “pro-life” candidate, Haley said Republicans need to be honest about a national ban, which would require 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nMike Pence, abortion’s harshest opponent among the Republican candidates, took immediate issue with Haley’s comments during the event, saying abortion is “a moral issue.”\n\nMost Republican candidates, including Chris Christie and Doug Burgum, have dodged the question by saying they would leave the issues to the states.\n\nRon DeSantis has touted his record on the issue as Florida governor, having signed a statewide six-week ban into law earlier this year.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nNikki Haley seeks to keep the debate spotlight\n\nMany Republicans said Nikki Haley \"won\" the first debate − she certainly garnered the best reviews − and they are watching to see if the former South Carolina governor can do it again.\n\nAfter the Aug. 23 set-to in Milwaukee, Haley saw a spike in fundraising and poll numbers. She passed DeSantis for second place in a few national and state polls.\n\nThat may make her a target tonight for other Republican candidates, as the former United Nations ambassador seeks to make it two in a row.\n\n\"America deserves a choice, not an echo,\" Haley said in a pre-debate post on the social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on transgender rights?\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed multiple anti-trans bills in Florida earlier this year targeted at gender-affirming care for minors, instruction of gender identity in schools and more.\n\nHe isn’t alone among the Republican candidates. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has signed a law that allows schools and government employees to ignore pronouns that transgender individuals use.\n\nOther GOP candidates have also been vocally opposed to transgender rights. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has made disparaging remarks about transgender individuals, and former Vice President Mike Pence said he wouldn’t allow transgender Americans to serve in the military.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie stands apart. He has said he opposes transgender health care bans, along with other measures.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat are the candidates saying about Donald Trump's criminal indictments?\n\nDonald Trump’s four sets of criminal charges in both federal and state cases have led some of his rivals to fiercely defend him – while others have knocked him.\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has taken the former position, alleging without evidence that the indictments are politically motivated. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have also condemned the indictments on the campaign trail.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about the indictments.\n\nMeanwhile, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, two of Trump's most vocal critics, have argued that the Republican Party can't stand behind Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said in response to federal allegations that Trump tried to steal the 2020 presidential election that anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate moderator Dana Perino: The 'rubber meets the road' for GOP debaters\n\nFor students of political history, one of tonight's debate moderators will look familiar: She's a former White House press secretary.\n\nDana Perino, the chief spokeswoman for President George W. Bush and now a Fox News host, says tonight's showdown is where \"the rubber meets the road\" for GOP candidates who are struggling to catch the front-running Trump.\n\n\"This is the moment where all of them realize, 'if I don't have some sort of break-out moment to show that I could be the rival, the alternative to President Trump, their campaigns probably start to lose even more steam,'\" Perino told Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe other moderators tonight are Fox Business Network host Stuart Varney and Univision anchor Ilia Calderón.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates. “It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,” then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped. What a difference a few years makes. The nation’s highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Earlier this year, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. – John Fritze\n\nNikki Haley, Tim Scott and others oppose student debt forgiveness\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court had struck down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt for hundreds of Americans, a move that many of the 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president “cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy supported the court’s decision.\n\n“We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do: more $$ to stay at home than to work, more $$ to be a single mother than married, more $$ for those who *fail* to repay loans than those who do,” Ramaswamy wrote on X.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is the third Republican debate?\n\nThe third Republican debate will be held in Miami on Nov. 8, the day after Election Day 2023.\n\nThe Republican National Committee announced that the requirements to participate in the debate will the strictest yet: participating candidates must secure 4% of the vote in multiple polls and 70,000 unique donors.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nRepublican primary polls: Trump still leads, DeSantis a distant second\n\nDonald Trump continues to lead Republican primary polls by about 40 points in most national surveys heading into the debate night. The frontrunner will not be on the stage, though, opting instead to hold a rally for United Auto Workers members in Detroit.\n\nSecond and far behind Trump in polls is Ron DeSantis, who will stand at the center of the debate stage. Next in the polls, each less than ten points behind DeSantis and standing on either side of him on stage, are Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMike Pence and Chris Christie are close behind Ramaswamy in most polls, followed by Tim Scott and Doug Burgum.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nRepublican debate ratings ahead of 2024\n\nMillions of Americans may be tuning into the GOP debate on Wednesday night Approximately 12.8 million people watched the first Republican presidential primary debate last month, when GOP candidates faced off in Milwaukee.\n\nEight Republican candidates pitched their vision for the country’s future during the event, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nCandidates focused on issues like climate change, the war in Ukraine and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. But the debate also got personal, with Republican hopefuls targeting Ramaswamy’s lack of political experience, Haley’s perspective on abortion restrictions in the U.S. and more.\n\nDonald Trump did not participate in the event, instead opting for an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolitical groups divide their forces between Trump speech, non-Trump debate\n\nSome political interest groups seem more interested in Donald Trump’s speech in Michigan this week than in the challengers' debate in California.\n\nFor example: American Bridge 21st Century, a progressive group, financed a plane to fly over the site of Trump's union event with a banner saying \"Trump Sold Us Out.\"\n\n“It’s obvious that, barring something drastic, Donald Trump is going to be the GOP nominee next year,\" said Pat Dennis, president of American Bridge 21st Century. \"The Republicans on the debate stage know that, too.\"\n\nGroups that flooded Milwaukee for the first Republican debate are not much in evidence in Simi Valley, though the Reagan library is a fairly remote location compared to Wisconsin's Fiserv Forum.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhere is the second Republican debate?\n\nThe seven Republican presidential candidates will take the stage in Simi Valley, California, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nNorthwest of Los Angeles, the library opened in 1991 with a ceremony that at the time boasted the largest ever gathering of former presidents and their families. The site is also the final resting place for the 40th president and his wife, Nancy Reagan.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhy is Donald Trump not debating?\n\nNo, Donald Trump won’t go head-to-head with his Republican rivals on Wednesday night.\n\nInstead, Trump, the current Republican frontrunner, is traveling to Michigan to speak with supporters in a battleground state. It's also the epicenter of the ongoing United Auto Workers strike, where workers are protesting the nation's largest auto companies.\n\nTrump also skipped the first Republican debate last month, explaining that he didn’t want to give opponents free shots at him.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nFox's Stuart Varney and Dana Perino, UNIVISION's Ilia Calderón are moderating\n\nFox News Media's Stuart Varney and Dana Perino and UNIVISION's Ilia Calderón will co-moderate the second Republican presidential primary debate.\n\nCalderón will be the first Afro-Latina to moderate a Republican Primary Debate, according to the network.\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nGOP debate participants\n\nSeven Republican candidates are expected to participate in the Wednesday debate: Florida Gov.

Nikki Haley said to businessman Vivek Ramaswamy in one lively exchange.\n\nTrump was dinged for failing to show up. But fighting among the candidates on stage drowned out their occasional criticism of the former president, who has widened his primary lead since the first Republican debate in August. He is now topping his closest rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, by more than 40 percentage points, according to recent polls.\n\nThe rest of the field has stayed in single digits.\n\nWith Iowa's caucuses set for January, candidates have only three months to emerge as a top alternative to Trump and cut his massive lead.\n\nHere are six takeaways from the debate:\n\n'Donald Duck': Republicans call out Trump for skipping debate\n\nUnlike the first debate, candidates called out Trump for skipping this discussion, arguing he owes it to Republican voters to defend his record.\n\nYet they stayed away from Trump's legal troubles, including four indictments, and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Instead, the pack criticized him primarily over a less controversial topic: the national debt he racked up in the White House.\n\n\"Donald Trump − he hides behind the walls of his golf clubs, and won't show up here to answer questions like all the rest of us are up here to answer,\" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said.\n\n\"Donald, I know you're watching. You can't help yourself,\" Christie later added, looking directly into the camera. He said that if the former president continues to skip debates, \"no one up here is going to call you Donald Trump anymore. We're gonna call you Donald Duck.\"\n\nDeSantis turned a question about a potential government lockdown by first taking aim at President Joe Biden and then noting Trump's absence.\n\n\"Where's Joe Biden? He's completely missing in action from leadership.\" DeSantis said. \"And you who else is missing in action? Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be on the stage tonight to defend his record.\"\n\nDeSantis said debt accumulated under the Trump administration \"set the stage for the inflation that we have now.\" That prompted Biden to weigh in on X, formerly Twitter: \"Couldn't agree more,\" the president said.\n\nA more hostile debate where zingers, jokes fell flat\n\nThroughout the debate, Trump's rivals were more aggressive with one another than the former president, turning to zingers to grab voters’ attention and try to get some laughs.\n\nBut some of the one-liners seemed to fall flat.\n\n“Build Back Broker,” Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said of Biden’s domestic agenda “Build Back Better.”\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said, “Joe Biden doesn’t belong on a picket line. He belongs on the unemployment line.”\n\nBut the most awkward moment came when Christie, slamming the teachers union, made a reference to first lady Jill Biden.\n\n\"When you have the president of the United States sleeping with a member of the teachers union, there is no chance that you could take the stranglehold away from the teachers union every day,” he said.\n\nThat prompted Pence to later weigh in: “My wife isn’t a member of the teachers union, but I’ve got to admit I’ve been sleeping with a teacher for 38 years. Full disclosure.”\n\nUkraine remains a wedge for GOP\n\nThe candidates were asked about supporting Ukraine, which has divided congressional Republicans amid the government shutdown fight. Most on stage said the U.S. should continue to provide military aid.\n\nRamaswamy, however, continued to defy the herd. He said Russian President Vladimir Putin is “evil,” but that doesn’t mean Ukraine is good. That is part of his larger belief that China is a bigger international threat, which is why he supports allowing Russia to seize the eastern half of Ukraine.\n\nChristie blasted that viewpoint, with the former New Jersey governor calling out “the naïveté of some of the people on this stage.”\n\nIn one of the night's most direct attacks on Trump over policy, Christie pointed to Trump's past praise of Putin. \"If we give him any of Ukraine, next will be Poland,\" Christie said. \"He wants to put the old band back together, and only America can stop it.\"\n\nThe hawks on stage were Haley and Pence, who echoed how defeating Putin is vital to U.S. national security and would send a message to China to back off neighboring Taiwan.\n\nDeSantis had also come under fire for describing Ukraine's war with Russia as a “territorial dispute,” but on Wednesday he asserted that it is “in our interest to end this war.\" But Ukraine cannot expect a “blank check,\" he said.\n\nScott shows some life and picks some fights\n\nScott was mocked as being too nice and not saying much during the first debate, and he tried to change that by tussling with his opponents more.\n\nDuring a question on immigration, Scott went after Ramaswamy for his comments in the first debate that all the other contenders were “bought and paid for.”\n\n“I can’t imagine how you can say that knowing that you were just in business with the Chinese Communist Party, and the same people who funded Hunter Biden millions of dollars was a partner of yours as well,” Scott said.\n\nScott later took DeSantis to task for a provision in Florida’s school curriculum that suggested slavery offered enslaved Americans some benefits, which gave the South Carolina senator a moment to declare: “America is not a racist country. … The city on the hill needs a brand-new leader.”\n\nNear the end of the debate, Scott also went after Haley, a fellow South Carolinian, over who has the better experience, and gas taxes, saying her time as governor was inadequate.\n\n\"Bring it, Tim,\" she said.\n\nRepublicans sympathetic to UAW workers but blame Biden for strike\n\nRepublican candidates sympathized with striking UAW workers demanding better pay from the nation's three largest automakers, but none got behind the union's cause.\n\nAnd they were no fans of Biden joining the picket line Tuesday − a historic moment for a sitting president.\n\nRamaswamy said autoworkers should be angry at Biden for \"disastrous economic policies\" that have caused consumer prices to rise.\n\n\"If I was giving advice to those workers, I would say go picket in front of the White House in Washington, D.C. That's really where the protest needs to be,\" he said.\n\nMark your calendar:USA TODAY to host town halls with six GOP presidential candidates in New Hampshire\n\nBiden campaign zeroes in on Trump\n\nThe Biden campaign spent as much time rapidly responding to the front-runner who wasn't present than the seven Republicans on stage.\n\nIt underscored how the Biden team is already preparing for a rematch of the 2020 election.\n\n\"It looks like he is destined to be the nominee again,\" Biden said last week at a fundraiser in New York.\n\nAs Trump spoke at an auto supplier facility in Clinton Township, the Biden campaign on social media accused the former president of lying about Biden's push for electric vehicles and failing to rebuild the U.S. manufacturing industry like he promised.\n\nThe Biden campaign released its first attack ad hours ahead of Wednesday's debate, which took aim at Trump, not anyone else.\n\n“This is a vice presidential debate at best,” said California Gov.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and this is 5 Things You Need To Know, Thursday the 28th of September 2023.\n\nToday we recap a feisty Republican presidential debate, plus the latest on a looming government shutdown and the aftermath of Michigan State's firing of head football coach, Mel Tucker. Republican presidential candidates took the stage near Los Angeles last night for the second GOP debate, the party's front-runner for the nomination, former President Donald Trump, was notably absent like he was for the first debate, but in attendance, positioned on stage in order of how they're ranked in the polls were Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, along with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. Former Vice President Mike Pence was there, as were former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.\n\nTo qualify, candidates needed a minimum of 50,000 unique donors while also polling at least 3% in two national polls or 3% in one national and one early state poll, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who qualified for the first debate did not make the stage this time. The night's big issue centered on the economy, the border and crime. Only two candidates, Chris Christie and Ron DeSantis went directly at the elephant in the room, Donald Trump. Here's Governor DeSantis, who's number two in the polls after Trump.\n\nRon DeSantis:\n\nDonald Trump is missing in action. He should be on this stage tonight. He owes it to you to defend his record where they added 7.8 trillion to the debt.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd former governor Chris Christie had choice words for the former president.\n\nChris Christie:\n\nAnd you're not here tonight, not because of polls and not because of your indictments. You're not here tonight because you're afraid of being on this stage and defending your record. You're ducking these things and let me tell you what's going to happen, you keep doing that, no one up here is going to call you Donald Trump anymore. We're going to call you a Donald Duck.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nStill despite the shots at Trump, no candidate is even close to him in the polls. According to a RealClearPolitics average of multiple national polls, those on stage last night were a combined 20 points or more below him. And pollster Frank Luntz, who has long done focus groups of Republican voters, said the chaos of the argumentative debate made no one a winner. He said, \"Tonight just makes it more likely that Donald Trump is the Republican nominee.\" For his part, former Vice President Mike Pence, highlighted positives under his administration with Trump.\n\nMike Pence:\n\nWe became a net exporter of energy for the first time in 75 years.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPence also said the administration oversaw record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic Americans. Though he failed to mention that those rates have fallen even lower under President Joe Biden. You can find a full recap and analysis of last night's debate with a link in today's show notes or by heading to usatoday.com.\n\nA possible government shutdown continues to loom. As of yesterday, lawmakers had made little progress toward diverting a crisis that would hit homes across the country on Sunday. That means Congress has just three days left to cut a deal. A shutdown wouldn't be as far-reaching as the debt ceiling threat this past May, but it would deeply impact Americans who need the most help. That includes low income families who rely on Head Start programs for preschool, people who receive food stamps and college students who receive federal grants to pay for their education. A shutdown would also hit federal workers, furloughing some without pay. While other essential federal workers would work without pay but would receive back pay once a shutdown ends.\n\nMichigan State has fired head football coach Mel Tucker for inappropriate conduct. The move came just two weeks after a USA Today investigation revealed sexual harassment allegations against him. I spoke with USA Today sports columnist Dan Wolken for more. Dan, thanks for hopping on the show.\n\nDan Wolken:\n\nThank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDan, what led to this moment?\n\nDan Wolken:\n\nIf you go back late last year, Brenda Tracy, who is a rape survivor and an activist who goes around and does a lot of speaking engagements at various colleges with football teams, other athletic teams to try to educate about sexual assault. She filed a complaint against Mel Tucker alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The university launched an investigation and it took place essentially in secrecy over the course of many months, and it became public earlier in September, thanks to the work of USA Today colleague, Kenny Jacoby. That initiated a process where Michigan State was going to have hearings and essentially suspended him. And that led to his firing.\n\nThere was really no other option in this for Michigan State because what Tucker admitted to with their investigators was enough grounds really for the school to fire him with cause. He will contest it and he will try to recoup some of the money that was remaining on his 10 year, $95 million contract. But what he admitted to which is essentially making sexual comments while masturbating in a phone call with Brenda Tracy, who he claimed he had a intimate, personal relationship with, was very problematic behavior and very clearly grounds for Michigan State to fire him.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou mentioned the hearings, a formal hearing on this is scheduled for next week, and also Tucker and his attorneys are expected to file a lawsuit against the school. What's next, Dan, for these battles?\n\nDan Wolken:\n\nLook, I think we're probably going to get some type of settlement at some point. That's the way these things typically work. However, Michigan State may press forward on this and just go through the entire process because they believe that they don't owe Mel Tucker anything. I'm not a lawyer, it's hard for me to say exactly where this is going to fall legally, but I think the argument from the school side is pretty rock solid, which is that Mel Tucker, in his job as the head football coach at Michigan State, had a key role, probably the biggest role in determining whether Brenda Tracy was going to continue being paid by Michigan State to come speak to the football team.\n\nThat's her job, that's how she makes her living, and the fact that they had some type of relationship, personal relationship that was taking place over the course of about a year from 2021 to 2022, and then Tucker essentially canceled subsequent appearances that were scheduled for Brenda Tracy after they had this phone call and falling out. It certainly suggests that the relationship, even if he considered it personal, was very clearly wrapped up in his duties as the head coach of Michigan State.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDan, as you said, there's this massive $95 million contract at the heart of all this. Why are the details of Tucker's contract so important here?\n\nDan Wolken:\n\nI think one of the things that Tucker contends, and he might have a point here, is that Michigan State is using this as a pretext to not have to pay him. Essentially, after the 2021 season, which was a great year at Michigan State, they went 11 and two. It was only Tucker's second year there. They gave him this massive contract extension, 10 years, $95 million fully guaranteed. That's a lot of money to commit to a coach over a very long period of time. And he was only in a second year of this deal. There was a lot of money left on it, and yet the results at Michigan State had very clearly declined last year. They're not very good this year, and it was looking like a bad contract, like a bad deal they couldn't get out of. Now they have this ability to get out the contract based on his personal conduct. What he's saying is, \"No, no, no, you're only firing me because we started losing football games and you're just using this as an excuse to not pay me what I'm owed.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nUSA Today's sports columnist, Dan Wolken. Great insight as always. Thank you, Dan.\n\nDan Wolken:\n\nThank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMore than 50 people have been arrested after multiple stores, including Apple, were ransacked in Philadelphia's center city area on Tuesday night, according to authorities. Police say a crowd at the stores grew to about a hundred at one point. The incident came just hours after the National Retail Federation reported what it called a dramatic jump in financial losses associated with theft. Losses to theft, often referred to as shrink, as a percentage of total retail sales accounted for more than $112 billion in losses last year. That's up from 94 billion a year earlier.\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus. The Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus is back, but there's a notable absence from the 152-year-old American circus. The famous animal acts are gone. I spoke with USA Today, national correspondent Marco della Cava to learn more. Marco, thanks for hoping on 5 Things.\n\nMarco della Cava:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe Ringling Brothers Circus is coming back, but without the famous animal acts this time. Marco, what led to this decision to get rid of the animals in the first place?\n\nMarco della Cava:\n\nFrankly, a combination of things. One was a lot of lawsuits on the part of the Humane Society, the ASPCA and others. Incidentally, there was never any real hardcore proof of animal abuse. There were certainly animals in captivity. Feld Entertainment, which owns Ringling Brothers, actually won a big lawsuit and they were paid damages. But in the end, the combination of that publicity and poor ticket sales caused them to close down in about 2017.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe animals are going away. What are some of the new acts that the circus is bringing into the fold to make up for the loss of animals?\n\nMarco della Cava:\n\nA lot of them are the acts you might expect. And that existed when there were animals. That's people on a trapeze and people on a high wire and the human cannon, all of that's still there. The new acts are, I guess a tribute to the times we're in. There's a big BMX bike segment. They're also jugglers. There are clowns, but not clowns in face paint that much like the animals has disappeared. It's a lot of action that's aimed at the whole family. A lot of this may sound familiar to people who got the Cirque de Soleil. They're arguing that their show is going to be more family friendly, less about a funky story that's being told and more just straight ahead, \"Hey, here's a guy on a 30-foot unicycle. Check it out.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThis was a part that stood out in your story to me, Marco, about the clowns and how they're now associated really with horror movies more than anything. What is this new version of clown they're going to have? Or is it just that there won't be clowns at all and they're going to do a new type of comedy?\n\nMarco della Cava:\n\nThere will be people who will be being funny and potentially dressed funny, but they will not have the Bozo the Clown red hair, face paint, which as you say, thanks to the Stephen King It movies, is horrifying to some people. I think they decided to just steer clear of that and not risk anything. They're basically going to be folks who are going to entertain in a humorous way, and I guess it remains to be seen how.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat does distinguish this from Cirque de Soleil or other similar performances without animals? And also Marco, how are they really planning on trapping people's attention here in 2023 when there are so many distractions and so many different types of entertainment out there?\n\nMarco della Cava:\n\nTo answer your first question about Cirque de Soleil, Cirque de Soleil, if anyone's been, it always has a theme. It has a name, it has a theme, and they weave that theme in for the whole show. And it's almost like a play with amazing acrobatics. That's not what Ringling Brothers is doing. They're literally just saying, \"Here's a whole bunch of amazing acts, 75 performers from 18 countries. There's no story we're telling other than we're at this amazing spectacle that there's something going on every two seconds and you're bound to be entertained by a lot of it.\"\n\nYour question about how to capture people in 2023 is an apt one. The truth is, I think a combination of really pacing, the show is just under two hours, 75 performers, I think you're just going to be hit with performance after performance. And ultimately what they told me, the Feld Entertainment people said, \"Look, ultimately everything you see is real. And much of what we see, especially in movies, may look amazing, but it's questionable as to how real it is. You come to our circus, you're going to see people doing amazing things in real life, in real time and you can't get that anywhere else.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, USA Today, national correspondent, Marco della Cava, getting us excited for the circus. Thank you, Marco.\n\nMarco della Cava:\n\nThank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd finally is in-person work the new norm.

Juggling a broad range of issues, the seven candidates on stage spent more time and energy attacking Vivek Ramaswamy, a political newcomer now scoring in single digits in national polls, than they did on Trump.\n\nWho, by the way, has a yawning lead over all of them.\n\nThere were more attacks on Trump this time than in the first debate in August, but the jibes were more often simply for failing to show up than for anything he has done, as president or since then. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie dubbed him \"Donald Duck\" for dodging questions. But he wasn't taken to task in a concerted way for what could be a serious vulnerability in the GOP: His statement last week suggesting he would negotiate a compromise on abortion, blurring the hard line on the question that has defined the GOP for decades.\n\n\"He should be here explaining his comments,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in the only reference to Trump's remarks last week on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" Trump had accused DeSantis of making a \"serious mistake\" by signing a six-week ban on abortion in his state and blamed abortion for costing Republicans in last year's midterm elections.\n\nDuring the contentious, sometimes chaotic forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, hosted by Fox Business and Univision, candidates frequently talked over one another. Moderators Dana Perino, Stuart Varney and Ilia Calderon at times struggled to maintain order and control.\n\nThe final scorecard: Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley was crisp and specific, as she was in the first debate. DeSantis, though at times still awkward, delivered a more confident performance than he did before. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who had sometimes seemed to disappear in the first debate, was more assertive. Ramaswamy once again found himself under fire from several of his colleagues.\n\n\"Honestly, every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber,\" Haley told him.\n\nBut to remind: Ramaswamy now ranks fourth in the GOP field at 5.1%, according to an average of national polls by Realclearpolitics.com. Meanwhile, Trump's support is at 56.6%, an edge of more than 42 percentage points over DeSantis, at second.\n\nWhen the evening ended, there were no signs the fundamental dynamic of the race had shifted. None of the contenders had effectively challenged Trump's standing as No. 1. None even emerged as the clear No. 2, the leading alternative to Trump, a standing DeSantis has lost. And a muddled field of multiple contenders eases Trump's path to claiming the nomination, as it did in 2016.\n\nSome of the candidates may have had other goals in mind, either to be Trump's running mate or to run for president in some future campaign, or for fame or vindication. Because actually getting the nomination would mean wrenching it from Trump's increasingly secure grip.\n\nInstead of being in California, he had appeared earlier Wednesday addressing autoworkers in Michigan, one of the half-dozen swing states in the general election. That was one more sign he already has pivoted to the general election, campaigning against President Joe Biden and feeling free to largely ignore the Republicans challenging him for the nomination.\n\nMark your calendar:USA TODAY to host town halls with six GOP presidential candidates in New Hampshire\n\nWhen the debate was over, senior Trump adviser Chris LaCivita on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, called on the Republican National Committee to \"immediately put an end to any further primary debates\" to focus instead on defeating Biden.\n\nThe Trump campaign already had sent out a fundraising appeal. \"As you read this message, disloyal \"Republicans\" (RINOs, as we like to call them) are dishonestly attacking yours truly in tonight's GOP debate and are playing right into Crooked Joe's hands.\"\n\nThat said, they weren't attacking \"yours truly\" very hard.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/06/01/2024-presidential-election-candidates-republican-democratic/11641319002/", "title": "2024 presidential candidates: A comprehensive list of everyone ...", "text": "The 2024 election cycle has kicked off. Though Election Day is over a year away, the race is well underway.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced he will seek another term, and with former President Donald Trump's hat also in the ring, a rematch of their 2020 race is a real possibility. Though the Democratic establishment is expected to fall firmly behind Biden, the Republican side is more of a toss-up.\n\nTrump-endorsed candidates suffered in the midterm elections, and with his legal troubles mounting, the GOP may consider other options. Polls still show Trump with a strong lead however, and many of those trying to unseat him have floundered including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. That dynamic was on full display at the first GOP debate which Trump skipped but still managed to loom over.\n\nDeSantis who generated early buzz has suffered in the polls, struggling to translate popularity in Florida to popularity at the national level, and recently firing much of his campaign staff in a major shake-up.\n\nHere are the latest developments on the path to the 2024 election:\n\nAnd here are the candidates who have announced their intention to run for president in the 2024 election:\n\nLearn more about each candidate:\n\nJoe Biden ∣ Robert F.

He lost his first wife Neilia Hunter and their one-year-old daughter Naomi in a 1972 car accident shortly after winning his first Senate race. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were injured in the crash but survived. In 2015, Biden lost Beau to brain cancer and has made it a major political goal to champion cancer research.\n\nHe remarried in 1977, tying the knot with now-First Lady Jill Biden. The two share a daughter, Ashley, and a large clan of grandchildren.\n\nBiden's son Hunter has been the subject of scandal in recent years and has written about his struggles with drug addiction. The GOP-led House has seized on Hunter's business dealings, hosting hearings to investigate his finances and the potential influence he has on his father.\n\nPrevious political experience: Joe Biden is a veteran of the Senate. First elected in 1972, he served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before being elected as vice president on the Obama ticket in 2008.\n\nAfter serving two terms as vice president, Biden took a brief hiatus from government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020.\n\nHis views: Biden's campaign is focused on the \"battle for the soul of America,\" doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago. He said the question facing the nation is \"whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer.\"\n\nMore on Biden's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nAge: 69\n\nFamily: Kennedy bears a powerful last name in Democratic politics. He is the son of Robert F. Kennedy, the former attorney general who was assassinated during a 1968 presidential run, and the nephew of former president John F. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy has been married three times and has six children. He wed current wife Cheryl Hines in 2014. Hines is a television star best known for her role on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"\n\nPrevious political experience: Kennedy is an environmental lawyer known for trumpeting a debunked theory that vaccines can be linked to autism.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy opposed vaccine mandates, calling them an infringement on individual liberty and at times used the Holocaust as a historical comparison. In 2017, former President Trump invited Kennedy to head up a presidential commission on vaccine safety.\n\nHis views: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the \"liberties guaranteed by the Constitution,\" according to his campaign website.\n\nMore on Kennedy's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Democratic\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: Williamson was married once in the late 1970s to a Houston businessman whom she has not named. She has one daughter, India Emmanuelle, whose father has not been publicly identified.\n\nPrevious political experience: Williamson is a self-help author and spiritual leader who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020. Then she was largely drowned out by a crowded Democratic field, breaking through for a rare viral moment, but eventually written off as a non-traditional candidate whose views involved centering the \"politics of love\" and rejecting a “dark psychic force of collectivized hatred.”\n\nHer views: Williamson supports abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for descendants of formerly enslaved Americans. She has suggested creating a U.S. Department of Children and Youth to increase child advocacy, and a U.S. Department of Peace.\n\nMore on Williamson's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nRepublican party candidates for 2024\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 55\n\nFamily: Binkley met wife Ellie in college and the two share five children.\n\nPrevious political experience: Binkley is CEO, president, and co-founder of the mergers and acquisitions conglomerate Generational Equity Group. He is also a faith leader, having co-founded and serving as the pastor at Create Church in Richardson, Texas.\n\nThe 2024 run is Binkley's first foray into politics. He says he wants to stand out in a crowded field by prioritizing unity, and leaning on his faith and business experience.\n\nHis views: Binkley has said he hopes to prioritize balancing the budget, lowering health care costs, creating bipartisan immigration reform, and putting more community emphasis on education. Binkley is against abortion. Though he signed a highly restrictive bill in his own state, he had indicated he would not do the same nationally and it should be a local issue. Binkley advocates for American energy independence using an \"all of the above\" approach that encompasses both fossil fuels and new technologies.\n\nMore on Binkley's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nLatest Ryan Binkley news : Explore\n\n: Explore Who is Ryan Binkley?

He remarried in 2016, tying the knot with current wife Kathryn.\n\nPrevious political experience: Burgum comes from a business background, once serving as SVP of Microsoft and founding both a real estate and venture capital firm. He was elected governor of North Dakota in 2016 and reelected in 2020.\n\nBurgum’s candidacy is expected to focus more on economics than culture wars – a favored topic of frontrunners Trump and DeSantis.\n\nHis views: Burgum has emphasized economic issues, rather than hot-button cultural issues that have been a focal point for some other GOP candidates. He is a vocal supporter of the oil industry, and the U.S. role in exporting it to other nations, and has said he favors smaller government and lower taxes.\n\nMore on Burgum's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 60\n\nFamily: Christie met wife Mary Pat at the University of Delaware and the two wed in 1986. They share four children: Andrew, Sarah, Patrick and Bridget.\n\nPrevious political experience: Christie was appointed U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey in 2002 and served for six years. He was elected governor of New Jersey in 2010 and occupied the office until 2018.\n\nChristie has been a prominent figure in the GOP since he launched his first presidential campaign in 2012. He ran again unsuccessfully in 2016 and, despite prior criticism, ultimately endorsed Trump and later joined his campaign.\n\nHis views: Christie is anti-abortion, but does support some exceptions in the case of incest, rape, and danger to the mother. He is not for a federal ban, instead believing the issue should be left to the states. He has advocated for a more secure border to stem the flow of fentanyl into the country and is in support of U.S. aid for Ukraine.\n\nMore on Christie's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 44\n\nFamily: The governor wed former television host Casey DeSantis in 2009 and the couple share two daughters Madison and Mamie and one son Mason.\n\nPrevious political experience: DeSantis serves as the 46th governor of Florida. His national profile grew during the pandemic when he spoke out publicly against mask mandates and pushed to keep many Florida businesses and schools open. Since then, he has captured national attention with controversial legislative measures on education and immigration.\n\nWhile in law school, DeSantis joined the U.S. Navy as a JAG officer, later deploying to Iraq for active duty. Prior to his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018.\n\nHe is widely viewed as Trump’s biggest threat in the Republican primary. Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to the former president.\n\nHis views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida. He is in favor of \"defending parental rights and eliminating CRT,\" and is anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment.\n\nMore on DeSantis' 2024 Presidential Candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: Elder has no children and has been married once. The couple divorced after two years and Elder was engaged again to Alexandra Datig from 2013 to 2015. Amid his candidacy for California governor, Datig went public with an allegation that Elder had once brandished a gun at her while high on marijuana.\n\nPrevious political experience: Elder is a lawyer and conservative talk show host who mounted a campaign against California governor Gavin Newsom in 2021's recall election. Though he lost, Elder received the highest number of votes of any candidate besides Newsom.\n\nElder announced his candidacy on Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" tweeting afterward \"America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable. We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there. That’s why I’m running for President.\"\n\nHis views: Elder backs school choice, including vouchers and charter schools. His platform also includes a vow to be tough on crime, to secure the border, and to \"contain China\" by asserting military dominance in the South China Sea and minimizing reliance on the country's manufacturing.\n\nMore on Elder's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 51\n\nFamily: Haley is one of four children born to Indian-American parents in Bamberg, South Carolina - a town she has described as divided by race.\n\nShe and her husband of 26 years, Michael, live still in South Carolina where they are raising two children Rena and Nalin.\n\nPrevious political experience: Haley started her political career in the South Carolina state legislature where she served for 6 years before mounting a successful campaign for the governor's office in 2010. She won reelection in 2014 and has bragged that she has \"never lost a race.\"\n\nIn 2016, former President Trump nominated Haley to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a position she held for a year before unexpectedly stepping down in 2018. Haley has played up her role as a female candidate in what is expected to be a largely male primary field. \"May the best woman win,” she quipped in an interview with Fox News.\n\nHer views: Haley is anti-abortion and pro-Israel. She supports cracking down on illegal immigration and \"getting tough\" on China and Russia. She has supported Trump in the past but also criticized him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\nMore on Haley's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 45\n\nFamily: Hurd wed Lynlie Wallace, a fellow political operative, in 2022. The two first met in 2009.\n\nPrevious political experience: A former CIA officer, Hurd served three terms in Congress representing Texas in the House after first being elected in 2014.\n\nHis views: Hurd stands out from an increasingly crowded GOP field as a rare vocal critic of Trump. He joins the likes of Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson in publicly disavowing the former president and in his campaign launch video listed illegal immigration, inflation, crime, and homelessness as legislative priorities.\n\nMore on Hurd's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 72\n\nFamily: Hutchinson has been married to wife Susan since 1973. The two share four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nPrevious political experience: Hutchinson has had a long career in Republican politics. He was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to serve Arkansas' 3rd district in 1997; he served until 2001 when he was appointed DEA administrator and later undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security for the George W. Bush administration.\n\nWhile in the House, Hutchinson served as impeachment manager in the trial of former president (and fellow Arkansas native) Bill Clinton. After leaving Washington he was elected 46th Governor of Arkansas. He served for two terms, from 2015 to 2023.\n\nHis views: He supports lower taxes, a strong national defense, and opposes abortion. He has said the Biden administration \"stood on the sidelines\" in the face of crime and “turned its back on the American worker.\"\n\nMore on Hutchinson's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 75\n\nFamily: Johnson tied the knot with wife Diane in 2008, and the pair share three sons.\n\nPrevious political experience: A businessman trying his hand at politics, Johnson built his wealth with the launch of Perry Johnson Registrars Inc., a company that ensures auto, aerospace and other businesses are complying with industrial standards. In 2022, he threw his hat in the ring for the GOP nomination for Michigan governor before being disqualified because of invalid signatures.\n\nHis views: Johnson told a group of Iowa voters in July that he was \"pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, anti-woke and anti-China,\" − and \"if you don't like it, well, tough.\" His campaign's signature \"2 cents\" proposes cutting 2 cents off every dollar of federal discretionary spending.\n\nMore on Johnson's 2024 Presidential Candidacy\n\nLatest Perry Johnson news: Explore\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 63\n\nFamily: Pence wed wife Karen in 1985 and the two share three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.\n\nPrevious political experience: Pence entered politics in 2000 when he won his local congressional seat. He went on to serve six terms in the House of Representatives before being sworn in as governor of Indiana in 2013.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump chose Pence as his running mate, and he served one term as Vice President. The role thrust him into a precarious situation in 2021 when Trump sought to pressure him to throw out some of Biden's electoral votes to overturn the election.\n\nPence ultimately defied Trump and certified the results, infuriating MAGA voters and Trump himself. His candidacy will likely involve a difficult tightrope walk as he attempts to distance himself from the former president without alienating the base.\n\nHis views: Pence is a vocal opponent of abortion, and of what he sees as the nation's long-term debt problem. He favors cuts in government spending and lower taxes, and while he often touts his time as vice president and speaks well of the policies that came out of the Trump White House, he has begun to distance himself from his former running mate in terms of tone. He has also criticized Trump's actions during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore on Pence's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 37\n\nFamily: Ramaswamy married Apoorva Tewari, a throat surgeon and assistant professor at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in 2015. The pair have two sons together.\n\nPrevious political experience: Ramaswamy is framing himself as an outsider, an entrepreneur-turned-political-hopeful who will give the establishment a run for its money.\n\nHe is a former biotech investor who founded pharmaceutical research company Roivant Sciences in 2014. Ramaswamy left the company in 2020 amid clashes with colleagues over how to respond to the murder of George Floyd and the public outcry that followed. He now heads up Strive Asset Management.\n\nHe is the author of three books, including \"Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam,\" which explores how American politics and capitalism have become increasingly intertwined.\n\nHis views: He has peddled ideas such as ending affirmative action and eliminating the Department of Education. His elevator pitch: He'll go farther than Trump ever did or could today.\n\nMore on Ramaswamy's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 57\n\nFamily: Scott is unmarried, with no children. He was raised by a single mother in North Charleston and has one brother.\n\nPrevious political experience: Scott first entered politics in 1995 during a special election for City Council in Charleston. His profile grew nationally when he suggested posting the 10 Commandments outside the council building, a proposal that was denied.\n\nScott served for two years in the state legislature before being elected in 2010 to the House of Representatives for South Carolina's 1st district. He served one term before being appointed to the Senate by then-governor Nikki Haley and becoming the first Black U.S. senator from the state.\n\nScott is pitching himself as a more hopeful alternative to Trump, drawing on Reagan-era ideals and centering a tone of optimism.\n\nHis views: Scott joined the Senate in 2013. He’s anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment. He says on his website that his “signature legislation,” Opportunity Zones, put $75 billion into “distressed communities” across the country.\n\nMore on Scott's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 76\n\nFamily: Trump is the son of real estate magnate Fred Trump. Born and bred in New York, he first made his name developing skyscrapers and casinos.\n\nTrump first married in 1977, wedding Czech-born model Ivana. The two were married for 13 years and share three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric. In 1993 Trump married actress and model Marla Maples. The two had one daughter: Tiffany. Following his divorce from Maples, Trump tied the knot for a final time with model Melania, who is mother to his youngest child, Barron.\n\nTrump's family was uncharacteristically involved in his presidency. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner played prominent roles in the administration, and both Don Jr. and Eric were often cited as close advisors.\n\nPrevious political experience: When Trump entered the race in 2016, he branded himself as a political outsider, a businessman separate from the establishment, ready to \"drain the swamp.\"\n\nPrior to 2016, he dabbled in politics, often sounding off on controversial issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on Barack Obama's citizenship and the guiltiness of the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump shocked pollsters by securing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. He served a full four-year term and was defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.\n\nHis views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported “political persecution” by Democrats. He supports securing America’s borders, “reclaiming free speech,” and “dismantling the Deep State,” according to his campaign website. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.\n\nMore on Trump's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThird-party 2024 presidential candidates\n\nPolitical Party: Green Party\n\nThough West originally announced his candidacy under the People's Party, he later officially filed as a Green Party candidate.\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: West has been married five times and has two children.

He has taught at a number of Ivy League institutions and works now as a professor of philosophy at Union Theological Seminary.\n\nIn a video uploaded to Twitter, West announced his 2024 candidacy saying, \"I enter in the quest for truth, I enter in the quest for justice.\" As a third-party candidate, West alleged \"neither political party wants to tell the truth\" on various issues. His bid with the People's Party represents the first independent ticket to enter the race thus far.\n\nHis views: West is a proponent of Medicare for All, and removing oil and gas subsidies as well as drilling on public lands. Long a vocal opponent of militarism, West's campaign website lists \"end the wars\" as a key priority which would include disbanding NATO and banning nuclear weapons across the globe.\n\nMore on West's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThese presidential candidates have ended their 2024 campaigns\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 45\n\nFamily: Suarez is the son of another prominent Florida politician: Xavier L.

Donald ...", "text": "Who won Wednesday night's Republican presidential primary debate? A former president, but not the one you may be guessing.\n\nDonald Trump skipped the encounter, the second installment in the series, but his name was invoked and mentioned plenty nonetheless. In fact, there were few issues in which the former president's record wasn't dragged into the sparring among the candidates.\n\nThe first name-drop came about 15 minutes into the two-hour debate co-moderated by Fox Business and Univision. The issue that first drew Trump's name into the fray was the national debt. Then came immigration, the border, abortion and China.\n\nIronically, the winner of the debate may well have been the legacy of Ronald Reagan.\n\nIn the Trump era, Reagan's standard, once the north star for the GOP, has faded. But on Wednesday night, several of the candidates quoted Reagan, and Fox Business played short clips of his speeches.\n\nRead on.\n\nDonald Trump and the national debt\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie noted that the Trump administration added almost $8 billion to the country's debt during his single term, and President Joe Biden's policies have added another $5 trillion. Christie then offered up a line that other candidates would pounce on — that Trump is \"hiding\" rather than defending his record by not appearing on the debate stage.\n\n\"He put $7 billion and he should be in this room to answer those questions,\" Christie said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis added that it was Trump \"who is missing in action\" rather than showing up to explain his fiscal policies while he was at the helm of the \"reckless\" decision-making in Washington. DeSantis omitted saying that he was in the U.S. House GOP majority for the first two years of Trump's term.\n\n\"You know who else is missing in action? Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be on this stage tonight,\" the governor said. \"He owes it to you to defend his record where they added $7.8 billion to the debt. That set the stage for the inflation we have now.\"\n\nGOP debate:Republican debate at Reagan library contrasts how 'Gipper,' Trump have spoken to Americans\n\nDonald Trump, immigration and border security\n\nGenerally speaking, Republican voters applauded Trump for shoring up border security, but on Wednesday his rivals were loathe to give him credit.\n\nChristie scoffed at Trump's border wall, saying the former president \"failed on this as well\" by building only 52 miles of new barrier. He then ridiculed Trump's 2016 claim that the Mexican government would foot the bill for the wall.\n\n\"I think if Mexico knew he was only going to build 52 miles, they might have paid for the 52 miles,\" Christie said.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence took credit for the Trump administration's border security wins saying he was the one who negotiated the so-called \"remain in Mexico policy\" and reduced \"immigration and asylum abuse by 90%.\"\n\nFormer South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley didn't mention Trump when she addressed immigration but lauded the Trump \"remain in Mexico policy\" and called for its reinstatement.\n\nDeSantis sounded almost dismissive of the Trump policies on the border as he again advocated using the military to attack the drug cartels.\n\n\"Yes, we'll build the wall,\" he said, adding later that \"those Mexican drug cartels are going to be treated like the foreign terrorist organizations that they are.\"\n\nWhat about the next debate?Would Trump attend a GOP presidential debate in Miami or hold his own split-screen event?\n\nDonald Trump, law-and-order, urban violence and crime rates\n\nThe discussion on law and order in America, a key catchphrase for GOP voters, did not mention any of the four different sets of felony charges against Trump.\n\nThe exception was Christie, who used the topic to lob his most blatant taunt to the former president.\n\n\"Donald, I know you are watching. You can't help yourself. I know you're watching,\" he said looking at the camera as if talking directly to Trump. \"And you're not here tonight not because of polls, not because of your indictments. You're not here tonight because you are afraid of being on this stage and defending your record. You're ducking these things. Let me tell you what's going to happen. You keep doing that, no one up here is going to call you Donald Trump. They're going to call you Donald Duck.\"\n\nDonald Trump and China\n\nHaley, who occupied a Cabinet-rank diplomatic post in the Trump administration, said the former president failed in his China policy by overly emphasizing trade at the expense of other threats posed by Beijing. Haley said Trump overlooked Chinese purchases of U.S. farmland, their stealing of $600 billion worth of intellectual property rights, a spy base in Cuba and the fact that American law enforcement drones are Chinese-made.\n\nDonald Trump and energy\n\nPence again took credit for Trump administration policies without crediting his former boss. The ex-veep said a \"signature accomplishment\" of their tenure was energy independence, as the United States became a net exporter of energy for the \"first time in 75 years.\"\n\nDonald Trump and Obamacare\n\nPence was asked to explain why the Trump administration failed to repeal Obamacare, which has been a decade-long talking point and promise by GOP candidates across the United States.\n\nPence ducked the question but took a shot at Trump.\n\n\"My former running mate, Donald Trump, actually has a plan to start to consolidate more power in Washington, D.C., to consolidate more power in the executive branch,\" he said, and then added that he would reduce the federal government by returning housing, Obamacare and overall health care responsibilities to the states.\n\nDonald Trump and abortion\n\nDeSantis took Trump to task for his recent statements that abortion bans, like Florida's six-week prohibition, cost Republican candidates in 2022 and would penalize them in 2024.\n\n\"The former president, he's missing in action tonight. He's had a lot to say about that,\" DeSantis said. \"He should be here explaining his comments to try to say that pro-life protesters are somehow a terrible thing. I want him to look into the eyes and tell it to people who've been fighting this fight for a long time.\"\n\nDonald Trump and the polls\n\nFox debate moderator Dana Perino, who was White House spokeswoman under George W. Bush, sought to close out the debate with a question about Trump's lead in the polls. Perino surmised that the only way for someone other than Trump to win the nomination would be for current candidates to drop out and back someone other than the former president.\n\nSo, Perino asked the candidates to say who they believe \"should be voted off the island\" now to boost a non-Trump candidate.\n\nDeSantis immediately rejected the question, but co-moderator Stuart Varney noticed Christie writing a name. Christie revealed it should be Trump.\n\n\"I vote Donald Trump off the island right now,\" Christie said, insisting that Trump is disrespecting voters by not debating and is a polarizing influence. \"This guy has not only divided our party. He's divided families all over this country. He's divided friends all over this country. I've spoken to people — and I know everyone else has — who have sat at Thanksgiving dinner or a birthday party and can't have a conversation anymore if they disagree with Donald Trump.\"\n\nBut entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy said he thinks \"Trump was an excellent president.\"\n\n\"But the America First agenda does not belong to one man,\" Ramaswamy added, noting it is time for a leadership change. \"It does not belong to Donald Trump. It doesn't belong to me. It belongs to you, the people of this country.\"\n\nWho won the debate? Reagan's legacy as Donald Trump wasn't praised, but the 40th president was frequently lauded\n\nThe debate was held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library & Museum in Simi Valley, California, and references to \"The Gipper\" abounded, from clips of his speeches to references to the 40th president as the gold standard of the modern American conservative movement.\n\nSouth Carolina U.S. Sen. Tim Scott invoked Reagan's \"city on a hill\" mantra in a soliloquy on racism and equality in America in which Scott condemned Democratic President Lyndon Johnson's \"Great Society\" programs.\n\n\"Frankly, the city on the hill needs a new leader,\" Scott said. \"And I am asking for your vote.\"\n\nPence and Haley invoked Reagan's \"peace through strength\" axiom in chiding DeSantis and Ramaswamy for not being fully committed to the defense of Ukraine in the face of the Russian invasion.\n\nPence invoked Reagan's advocacy of limited federal government and a strong national defense in calling on GOP voters to reject the \"siren song of populism,\" a code for Trump's isolationist foreign policy and protectionism.\n\nDeSantis quoted a marker by Reagan's grave that every person has a purpose and worth and that we are better off when everybody counts.\n\nAntonio Fins is a politics and business editor at The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY Florida Network.

Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley both drew some praise for their performances at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. But analysts agreed that none of it was enough to pull away from the pack or put a dent in Trump’s commanding lead in every Republican primary poll.\n\n“Nikki was on the attack, for sure,” said Chris Collier, a Thousand Oaks-based Republican strategist. “I think her and DeSantis performed well, but nothing was so standout that you walked away saying, ‘That was a clear winner.’”\n\nHaco Hoang, the chair of the political science department at California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, said the seven candidates in Reagan Library debate are in “a race for distant second,” while Trump and President Joe Biden are already “running a general election campaign” against each other.\n\nTim Allison, an adjunct professor of political science at CSU Channel Islands, said he thought the only two people who benefited from the debate were Biden and Trump, neither of whom were there.\n\n“That was a stage full of people that were afraid of Donald Trump,” Allison said. “I don’t think the debate changed anything in the minds of Republican voters. … Of the seven people that took that stage, probably only Chris Christie looked like he wanted to be president. The rest were running for some combination of three reasons: get attention, be vice president or run for the job whenever Donald Trump isn’t running, whenever that is.”\n\nHoang said Haley might be doing well enough in the campaign to be a contender for the vice presidency. But securing a spot as Trump’s running mate will require a difficult balancing act. On Wednesday, Haley didn’t praise Trump, like candidate Vivek Ramaswamy did, and she didn’t directly attack him, like DeSantis and Christie, the former governor of New Jersey.\n\nAaron Kall, who was at the Reagan Library Wednesday night, wrote the book “Debating the Donald” about the 2016 election cycle debates, which helped push Trump to the presidency. Kall, director of the debate program at the University of Michigan, said the candidates missed an opportunity by not taking harder swings at the front-runner.\n\n“Even though he’s not here, you can still talk about him and get a benefit ... because he can’t defend himself,” Kall said. “Trump is a great counter-puncher.”\n\nJohn Andersen, chairman of the Ventura County Republican Party, said he thinks Trump should join the debates. He may have a huge lead in the polls without debating his primary opponents, but Andersen said sitting out will hurt him in the general election, when he’ll need to appeal more to voters in the middle.\n\n“When he is not representing himself, he is allowing the press and the other candidates to define him,” Andersen said.\n\nDeSantis did criticize Trump for skipping the first two Republican debates, calling him “missing in action.” Between those comments and his defense of his record in Florida, including an ability to win in traditionally Democratic areas, DeSantis drew praise from some observers.\n\nTab Berg, a Republican political consultant in Sacramento, said comments like those from DeSantis might bait Trump into joining the debates.\n\n“Conventional wisdom is going to tell him not to do it,” Berg said. “He’s not a conventional candidate.”\n\nAllison, though, said he thought DeSantis’ debate performance was “completely unmemorable,” on a night when he needed a big win. DeSantis is running second behind Trump in most polls. He often trails by 40 or more points, and he has been losing ground in recent weeks.\n\n“I watched DeSantis more than anybody else because I thought this debate was an opportunity for him,” Allison said. “It was probably more important for him than anybody else because of his slide in the polls, and I just don’t think he showed up. It was half an hour into the debate before he said anything.”\n\nChristie was the candidate who took the most direct shots at Trump. But his attempt at a Trump-like derisive nickname — “Donald Duck,” because Trump is ducking the debates — might have had more people laughing at Christie than with him.\n\n“Everyone was talking about ‘Donald Duck,’ and that’s what you want,” Collier said. “Maybe that line wasn’t great, but people are talking about it.”\n\nCollier said the attention is the best Christie could hope for, but it's unlikely to help his campaign. Collier advises candidates for state and local office, and he said he often tells his clients the best outcome in a debate is not to lose ground, “unless there’s something magical that happens.”\n\n“Most of the time, you get up there and you get your points out, make sure your supporters know you did a good job,” Collier said. “It’s more about fundraising and endorsements than anything else.”\n\nThe format in Wednesday’s debate, with so many candidates sharing the stage, made it especially hard for anyone to win, he said.\n\n“It’s hard to get that many people to have a real conversation,” Collier said.\n\nHe didn’t blame the moderators: Dana Perino of Fox News, Stuart Varney of Fox Business and Ilia Calderón of Univision, But Allison did, along with the candidates. He called the event “the worst debate that I have ever seen,” due to the moderators’ failure to control the conversation and the candidates’ insistence on talking over each other.\n\n“I have seen kindergarten classrooms that were less chaotic than that debate,” Allison said.\n\nThe cross-talk made it hard for Sarah Stephan, a CLU student who volunteered for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation at the debate, to evaluate the candidates. Stephan, 20, is a senior political science major, and also attended last month’s GOP debate in Milwaukee.\n\nShe said the Milwaukee debate was more informative because the moderators kept things under control and the candidates didn’t talk over each other as much.\n\nStephan is an independent and said she hasn’t decided whether to vote in the Republican primary or who to vote for if she does. Her job on Wednesday night included working with candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, and she said she came away impressed with his ability to connect to younger voters. Ramaswamy is 38 and a newcomer to politics, and has surprised many observers by running near the top of the non-Trump candidates in recent polls.\n\n“It was interesting to see how such a young candidate composes himself among veteran politicians,” Stephan said. “I think that’s refreshing to the American people. … I think he is really showing that a young candidate can go against these veterans and can rattle them to a point.”\n\nRamaswamy certainly seemed to get under Haley’s skin, and near the end of the debate, she remarked, “Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber.”\n\nStephan said it reminded her of the way some veteran politicians reacted to Pete Buttigieg in the 2020 Democratic primaries. Buttigieg was 37 when that campaign began and had never held an office higher than mayor of South Bend, Indiana, but he performed well in debates and is now Biden’s secretary of transportation.\n\nBut Stephan said she’d rather the debates in the future focus more on the issues facing the candidates and the country.\n\nAllison said the candidates could use a little more Reaganism in their outlook and delivery, even if Reagan’s policy positions, like amnesty for undocumented immigrants, wouldn’t get them far in today’s Republican Party.\n\n“No matter what you feel about Ronald Reagan, most people saw him as an optimist and a great communicator, and I don’t think anyone on that stage took up that mantle,” he said.\n\nTom Kisken covers health care and other news for the Ventura County Star.

The Gadsden Times reports Black Creek was restocked Tuesday with about 1,100 pounds of trout above Noccalula Falls by the Rainbow Fly Fishing Club. The group also stocked 1,000 coppernose bluegill into the watershed in late March. Republican Rep. Craig Lipscomb, of Rainbow City, is a member of the fishing club and says its members are working with the city to fill a gap for activities at the falls in the winter months. Lipscomb says trout fishing in Georgia brings in tens of millions of dollars for the state, and Gadsden would benefit even from a fraction of that.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A new FBI report says the state has the nation’s highest rate of sexual assault, and violent crime has increased. Alaska Public Media reports that the 2018 statistical analysis from the agency’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program says Alaska does not conform to a general national decline in violent crime. The annual report uses statistics from law enforcement agencies to provide an analysis of crime at the national, state and municipal levels. The report says violent crime in Alaska increased by 3% from 2017 to 2018 while falling 3% nationally. It says Alaska saw an 11% increase in the number of sexual assaults reported to law enforcement, while nationally there were 2.7% more assaults. The FBI says Alaskans reported four times more sexual assaults than the national rate.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An increase of bald eagle breeding areas this year didn’t result in more nestlings in the state. Game and Fish Department officials say there were 71 eagle nestlings during the 2019 breeding season, down from 87 hatched last year. During the department’s annual bald eagle survey, raptor biologists counted a minimum of 74 occupied breeding areas statewide – up from the 69 counted last year. But the number of eggs laid dipped from 102 last year to 97 this year. The number of birds that made their first flight fell to 63 from the 70 recorded in 2018. Arizona’s bald eagle population has flourished since 1978, when 11 pairs were counted within the state and the species was listed as endangered. There currently are an estimated 74 adult breeding pairs.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Court records show a former lobbyist who pleaded guilty to bribing three former state lawmakers will be sentenced this month. Rusty Cranford could face up to 10 years in federal prison for bribing Sen. Jon Woods, Rep. Hank Wilkins and Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson, the nephew of Gov. Asa Hutchinson and son of former U.S. Sen. Tim Hutchinson. Cranford had hoped to increase revenue for the Missouri-based nonprofit Preferred Family HealthCare. Cranford also confessed to embezzling from the nonprofit where he worked. His attorney declined to comment. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports court records posted Tuesday show he’ll be sentenced Nov. 25. A federal grand jury in Missouri indicted Cranford on one count of conspiracy and eight counts of accepting bribes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Rosa: A Northern California brewery owner upset with devastating fires sparked by Pacific Gas & Electric power lines is producing a beer he named “F--- PG&E,” and the brew has sparked a backlash. Steve Doty, owner of Shady Oak brewery in Santa Rosa, announced the new beer last week on a Facebook post. Doty tells SFGate he meant to draw attention to the negligence of PG&E executives and was stunned by the onslaught of critical comments by people who said they are related to utility employees. Others have attacked Shady Oak by giving it one-star reviews on Yelp and Google or calling the taproom with violent threats. Doty posted an apology to those upset by the beer name but says he is still standing by the name.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Muslim civil rights group is protesting after an arena security guard told a woman to remove her hijab before she could enter to see her 8-year-old daughter sing the national anthem with her school choir at a Denver Nuggets basketball game. Gazella Bensreiti said Wednesday that the guard told her to “take that thing off of my head” at the Pepsi Center box office Nov. 5. Bensreiti said she explained the scarf was for religious purposes. She said the guard replied that she didn’t care. After speaking with a supervisor, the guard ushered her inside. The Council on American-Islamic Relations protested the incident. Arena owner Kroenke Sports & Entertainment called the encounter a misunderstanding and said the guard didn’t recognize that Bensreiti was wearing a hijab.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Republicans in the state Senate are unveiling an alternative transportation plan they say doesn’t rely on tolls or tax increases. Thursday’s plan from the minority party in Connecticut’s Senate comes a day after Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont pitched his 10-year, $21.3 billion initiative to Senate Democrats. While the Democrats liked projects in Lamont’s proposal, they didn’t like how it includes 14 tolls on bridges across the state. It’s unclear whether the GOP’s plan will ultimately lay the groundwork for a compromise on an issue that has vexed the state for years. Like Lamont’s plan, the 10-year, nearly $18 billion Senate Republican plan also relies on low-cost borrowing from the federal government. Instead of using toll money to pay off the loans, it banks on money from the state’s dedicated transportation fund.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s birding community is mourning the loss of Wilmington resident William “Bill” Stewart Jr., who died Tuesday after battling cancer, while celebrating his legacy of conservation and determination. Stewart, 67, was a well-known birder, conservationist, educator and former gymnastics coach who helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to permanently preserve nearly 2,000 acres of land for future generations of birders and Delawareans through the Delaware Bird-A-Thon program he started in 2006. He helped put the First State on the birding map by showing visitors and locals the state’s beauty and international role in shorebird migrations. The Bird-A-Thon effort has raised more than $400,000, which has helped protect properties and start a hawk watch program in northern Delaware, as well as a science education grant for researchers. A celebration of life for Stewart will be held from 1 to 4 p.m. Friday at the Delaware Nature Society’s Ashland Nature Center in Hockessin.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A landlord in the district is being forced to pay $1.1 million in rent payments to former residents who homes were plagued by pests, mold and raw sewage and violated housing and fire codes. The Washington Post reports D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine announced Wednesday that Sanford Capital LLC will pay the settlement to 155 former residents “forced to live in squalor.” Racine’s office had sued the Bethesda, Maryland-based company for violating consumer protection laws. For years, tenants struggled with unsanitary and poor conditions that left many without heat in winter months. Prosecutors said some residents also lacked working toilets, stoves or refrigerators. They say Sanford refused to fix some broken locks and didn’t maintain fire extinguishers, a move made even more dangerous by missing or broken smoke detectors.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: It’s light and bright in all the merriest of ways at Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom this holiday season. For the first time since the park opened in 1998, there’ll be holiday-themed entertainment and decor throughout the 500-acre park, with twinklers lining rooftops and other new seasonal touches at the park, now Central Florida’s second most popular theme park, behind Magic Kingdom. At DinoLand, Donald’s Dino-Bash, the dance party is complemented by holiday decorations chosen by Donald Duck’s pals, with all kinds of holiday merch available for sale at the gift shop. Diwali, India’s festival of lights, is celebrated over in Asia, while in Africa, African celebrations blend with Western traditions, making a stroll through Harame for food and shopping a colorful mix of tastes and treats.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A nonpartisan organization has placed a national debt clock downtown ahead of a Democratic presidential debate coming to the city. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports New York-based Peter G. Peterson Foundation placed the billboard on Ted Turner Drive between Walton and Marietta streets, near Centennial Olympic Park. The clock displays the nation’s nearly $23 trillion debt and pegs each American’s share of the number at about $68,000. CEO Michael A. Peterson says the debt issue affects everyone, not just lawmakers. He says he hopes the billboard sparks conversation on the enormous debt and ways to manage it. The foundation says the clock will remain in the city indefinitely. The Democratic debate will be Wednesday at Tyler Perry Studios in southwest Atlanta.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man was surfing with his girlfriend when – instead of hanging 10 – he knelt down on one knee on his board and proposed. Hawaii News Now reports Lauren Oiye said yes just before Chris Garth dropped the ring in the ocean. Multiple photographers nearby captured the Sunday moment. Luckily, he had a spare. Garth said he knew it could go wrong, so he used a stand-in while they were out in the water. The real ring was on shore at Queen’s Beach in Waikiki, where the two met years before.\n\nIdaho\n\nRexburg: Brigham Young University-Idaho has stopped accepting Medicaid as health insurance coverage, forcing full-time students to buy a university-backed plan. University officials say health plans could be purchased for at least $81 a month for single students and up to $678 a month for a family. Officials say a student form used to opt out of the school health plan was updated this month reflecting the change in policy. Open enrollment for Medicaid expansion began Nov. 1. State health officials say Madison County has the highest concentration of potential Medicaid expansion enrollees in the state. Students say a reason for the change has not been disclosed. Some students argue the plan is expensive and has limited coverage. The university declined multiple requests for comment.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A copy of Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address that was handwritten by the 16th president himself is going on display at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum for two weeks. In a news release, the museum says it will display the copy – one of only five surviving copies written by Lincoln – from Thursday through Dec. 2. The display coincides with the anniversary of Lincoln’s delivery of the brief speech Nov. 19, 1863, at the height of the Civil War. The document that stays in a climate-controlled space most of the time to protect it from light and humidity will be housed in the museum’s Treasures Gallery. The address that begins famously with the words: “Four score and seven years ago … ” is handwritten on plain white paper.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb isn’t promising any quick action on the call for further boosting teacher pay that thousands of educators will be making at the Statehouse next week. Teacher unions say at least 107 school districts with more than 40% of Indiana’s students will be closed Tuesday while their teachers attend the rally. Holcomb didn’t criticize school districts for closing the day of the union-organized rally, saying it was a local decision. The Republican governor said Thursday that he applauds teachers for expressing their concerns, but he’s waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed to make recommendations by the end of next year. The rally dubbed “Red for Ed Action Day” will happen on the day legislators are gathering for organization meetings ahead of their 2020 session.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Slaughterhouse has a new home downtown. The haunted attraction, which has become a staple in Iowa, has begun moving to the old Bank of America building. To break in the new digs, set to open fully next September, Slaughterhouse will host a Krampus Krawl. The event will begin Dec. 7 with an all-age photo op before the crawl to four Full Court Press establishments. Krampus is a horned, anthropomorphic figure described as “half-goat, half-demon” in Austro-Bavarian Alpine folklore. During the Christmas season, Krampus punishes children who have misbehaved, as opposed to Santa Claus or Saint Nicholas, who rewards well-behaved children with gifts. Tickets are available online. General admission tickets include a Glow Stein for one free pour at each of the four Full Court Press stops.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The City Council has approved a public financing package worth about $35.5 million to subsidize the creation of a medical school. The Wichita Eagle reports the package approved Tuesday will help create a campus for training osteopathic physicians. Called the Kansas Health Science Center, the new school will be built in the former Finney State Office Building. Once the center of state government in Wichita, the building was abandoned in favor of leasing privately owned office space across the city. Plans also call for three other buildings to be transformed – one into student housing, another into a dining hall and culinary center, and the third into a boutique hotel. The bulk of the money for the development will come from tax abatements.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A federal court is allowing a man to personalize a license plate with the phrase “IM GOD” after a three-year legal battle over the custom engraving. Court documents show Ben Hart, a self-identified atheist, set out to get the Kentucky plate in 2016. But Hart’s request was denied by the state transportation department on the basis it violated antidiscrimination guidelines. News outlets report similar plates had been approved before, including “TRYGOD” and “NOGOD.” Kentucky’s American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation got involved to help Hart challenge the decision. In an opinion Wednesday by a U.S. District Court in Frankfort, the judge ruled that “vanity plates” are private speech protected by the First Amendment and that the state had violated Hart’s rights by denying him the plate.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A legislative auditor says 18 cities, towns and villages may be close to reaching bankruptcy or may have the inability to provide basic services to residents in the future based on the municipalities’ most recent financial information. The Monroe News Star reports Legislative Auditor Daryl Purpera compiled a list of “fiscally distressed municipalities” and added it the auditor’s website. The municipalities range from small villages like Epps in northeastern Louisiana to larger towns like Winnsboro in central Louisiana. Purpera says the list is a way to alert the public and officials of the problems so they can be easily addressed. The list includes concerns for each municipality, including incomplete or inaccurate financial information, insufficient utility rates, debt and rural water infrastructure problems.\n\nMaine\n\nHarpswell: The town wants the Navy to protect the clam flats as part of its remediation plan for the former Brunswick Naval Air Station. The Harpswell Conservation Commission has argued the stormwater system that brings water from ponds at the former Navy base to Mare Brook and Harpswell Cove should be extended. The commission told the environmental coordinator for the closure process that the Navy has an obligation to investigate the impact of the stormwater system. The Times Record reports that an investigation of the pond system had found several heavy metals including lead, arsenic and cadmium that could potentially reach nearby clam flats. Paul Plummer, Harpswell’s harbormaster, says the Harpswell side of the Harpswell Cove alone holds $100,000 worth of shellfish.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city has reached 300 homicides in a year for the fifth year in a row. Detective Donny Moses told WBAL-AM the total reached 300 Thursday morning with the shooting deaths of a man and a woman. The Baltimore Sun reports the city is on track to see one of its most violent years on record. The city recorded 309 homicides last year and 342 the year before. Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young addressed the homicide rate at a news conference Wednesday. He said the city is working to reduce the crime rate, and leaders aren’t to blame. Young took over as mayor this spring after Democrat Catherine Pugh resigned amid investigations into her business dealings. He’s running for reelection in 2020 against a dozen challengers, some of whom criticized his comments Wednesday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSudbury: The Sky Bar, the multiflavored chocolate bar divided into four sections, is back on the market after a yearlong hiatus. The Boston Globe reports that production of the confection has resumed at a suburban gourmet shop less than a year after the owner bought rights to the brand in an online auction. The Sky Bar made its debut in 1938 but was discontinued last year when the New England Confectionery Co., also known as Necco, went out of business. Louise Mawhinney, owner of Duck Soup in Sudbury, bought the rights to the Sky Bar in January. The candy bar, divided into caramel, vanilla, peanut and fudge sections, is available in the store and online for $1.98. After the holidays, Mawhinney plans to get a wholesale license and ramp up operations.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: A museum at a former southern Michigan prison is closing at the end of December. Cell Block 7 in Jackson allows visitors to step into the cells and walk the corridors of what was once the largest walled institution in the world. The museum’s website invites people to “spend some time on the inside” during a self-guided tour. The museum opened five years ago under an agreement between the state of Michigan and the Ella Sharp Museum, also in Jackson. Ella Sharp director Diane Gutenkauf says the costs are too high. Gutenkauf says some artifacts from the prison museum will be available at the Sharp museum, including oral histories of people who worked there or were inmates. The last day at the prison museum will be Dec. 29.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The battle over the name of a popular Minneapolis lake has landed before the Minnesota Supreme Court. Justices heard arguments Wednesday on whether the state Department of Natural Resources has the authority to change the name of Lake Calhoun to its original Dakota name, Bde Maka Ska. The state Court of Appeals ruled in April that the agency overstepped its authority in January 2018 when it changed the name. It said authority to change the name rested with the Legislature under statutes governing lake and other place names. KARE-TV reports Save Lake Calhoun attorney Erick Kaardal argued the legislature enacted a policy that says lake names that have been used more than 40 years cannot be changed without lawmakers granting additional authority. It could take the court months to make a decision.\n\nMississippi\n\nRolling Fork: The state is naming a stretch of land in the south Delta in honor of the two-term governor who is leaving office in January. Officials gathered Wednesday to dedicate the Phil Bryant Wildlife Management Area. The 18,000-acre site in Warren and Issaquena counties is made up of bayous, cypress sloughs and bottomland hardwoods. Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks Director Sam Polles says the area is divided into four tracts that will offer different types of hunting, including group hunts in a primitive setting. The department worked with the Nature Conservancy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to buy the land in 2018 from Anderson-Tully Company. Republican Bryant said during the dedication ceremony that he looks forward to bringing his grandchildren hunting on the land.\n\nMissouri\n\nJackson: A rescued puppy is attracting a lot of attention because of his resemblance to a unicorn. The nearly 10-week-old puppy, named Narwhal, has a tail-like appendage growing from his forehead. Narwhal was rescued over the weekend and sent to Mac’s Mission in Jackson, which specializes in fostering animals with special needs. Mac’s Mission founder Rochelle Steffen says Narwhal doesn’t notice the extra tail and is otherwise a happy, healthy puppy. Although it looks like a tail, Narwhal cannot wag it. Steffen says the rescue group has been flooded with requests from people wanting to adopt Narwhal since his picture hit social media. But he’ll remain at Mac’s Mission so his caretakers can be sure the tail doesn’t grow out of proportion to his face and cause him problems.\n\nMontana\n\nButte: A fish hatchery will be locked at night and begin using security cameras after vandals mutilated several fish. The Montana Standard reports the perpetrators killed about 20 rainbow trout, broke windows and tossed items into water channels at the Ennis National Fish Hatchery. The Madison County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the Oct. 27 vandalism at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service facility about 88 miles southeast of Butte. Sheriff Phil Fortner says a witness saw a yellow ATV near the hatchery, but no suspects have been identified. Hatchery Manager Ron Hopper says the fish were cut with garden hoes, ice choppers or other tools. Hopper says that for the previous 80 years, the hatchery was left unlocked for after-hours visitors.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state Transportation Department is offering to produce and emplace roadside memorials as a way to keep highways free of roadside safety hazards. The new departmental policy announced Wednesday says each sign will display the name of the person being memorialized and include one of five safety messages: “Please Drive Safely,” “Seat Belts Save Lives,” “Don’t Drink and Drive,” “Don’t Text and Drive” or “Don’t Drive Impaired.” The sign will be placed as near to the accident site as possible. Family members who have placed private memorials alongside state highways are encouraged to contact their local department offices to discuss disposition of the memorials and get information on the state installing new signs. The department’s Jeni Campana says the state-produced signs would be of a familiar design and would pose less of a safety hazard than the irregular appearance of private memorials.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Elon Musk’s Boring Co. will begin drilling an underground tunnel Friday for the Las Vegas Convention Center’s forthcoming people mover. To officially kick off the tunneling phase of the company’s first commercial project, the boring machine will be turned on 40 feet below ground. The $52.5 million underground people mover will allow convention attendees to travel the expanse of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s 200-acre campus in approximately one minute, according to officials. The transportation system will include three passenger stations that connect the convention center’s 3.2 million-square-foot space with the 1.4 million-square-foot West hall that is now under construction. Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority officials say plans call for the expansion project to be completed by January 2021.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: After facing criticism over its prior annual holiday celebrations, the town is making some tweaks, planning a “Frost Fest” without a tree-lighting ceremony or grand entrance from Santa. WMUR-TV reports in past years Durham’s held a tree-lighting ceremony. But after some concerns that the event was too focused on Christmas, a working group was formed to make changes, such as not hanging wreaths on light posts. The Frost Fest is billed as a “winter celebration” with a bonfire, cookie decorating, ice sculpting, crafts and activities. Last year, town officials were under fire for denying a menorah to be displayed next to the tree decorated annually at a local park. The officials cited vandalism concerns.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: The state has drumsticked up a plan to deal with flocks of wild turkeys that are ruffling some feathers in a Jersey Shore neighborhood. And it doesn’t involve them winding up on dinner plates in two weeks. The state Department of Environmental Protection will trap scores of turkeys that have descended on a retirement community in Toms River and relocate them. The move comes as some residents say large flocks of turkeys have invaded the area, pecking at cars – and at some people who venture too close. Others say they give the birds a wide berth and haven’t experienced any problems. Toms River residents who have run a-fowl of the birds include former New York Yankees and Mets baseball player Todd Frazier, whose SUV was covered by turkeys recently.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Federal and state officials have reached an agreement they say will strengthen their relationship as they work to improve forest conditions in the state. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and U.S. Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen signed the so-called shared stewardship agreement during a gathering Thursday in Santa Fe. The agreement has been a work in progress over years and will address issues such as wildfires, drought and invasive species. Officials say the challenges faced by land managers transcend boundaries and affect people beyond the jurisdiction of any single organization, so they have to find new ways of working together and doing business at a greater pace and scale. Under the agreement, the state and national forests plan to evaluate opportunities, threats and alternatives for risk management.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Until recently, New York City police secretly kept fingerprints of children arrested as juveniles on file permanently in a department database. It’s an illegal practice that raised alarms about the lengths the nation’s largest police force has taken to keep tabs on the city’s youth. The Legal Aid Society uncovered the years­long practice. The public defender organization pressured the police department to acknowledge it and threatened legal action to make it stop, citing a state law barring local police from stockpiling juveniles’ fingerprints. Now, after years of wrangling and resistance, the NYPD said Wednesday that it has purged all juvenile fingerprints records from the database and will no longer keep them indefinitely. The Legal Aid Society said the database contained the fingerprints of tens of thousands of New York City youths.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: An opossum has illegally taken up residence in the ceiling of a Duke University dorm, where students have been complaining about being bitten by fleas. The school’s assistant vice president of student affairs, Joe Gonzalez, told reporters Wednesday that the school has yet to catch the elusive opossum about which students first complained in October. He says the creature has escaped custody partly because it appears to be splitting its time between the Few Quad dorm and somewhere else. Reports of fleas also began to surface last month, prompting the school to put students up in another dorm while they fumigated the place. Gonzalez says the opossum may have brought the fleas, but that’s unconfirmed. Irritated students are questioning why they’re dealing with such conditions at a $78,608-per-year school.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials have given an estimate on how much oil was spilled from a pipeline leak in Williams County last month. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality says an estimated 12,432 gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline operated by Hiland Crude about a mile northeast of McGregor on Oct. 17. The department says the oil leaked onto cropland. Department staff have inspected the site and say they will continue to monitor remediation.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: A traveling exhibit celebrating the service and heroism of military working dogs and the sacrifices they make during battle is being displayed at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. The exhibit titled “Canine Warriors – Courage and Sacrifice, Always Beside You” features wooden sculptures of eight Wounded Warrior Dogs and four Canine War Dogs and is now on display at the museum in Dayton. Ohio craftsman James Mellick designed the exhibit to be symbolic of the wounds suffered by military dogs in battle and to raise awareness of their needs. The exhibit also features art depicting working military dogs from the Air Force Art Program. It will remain at the museum through Jan. 31.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: District attorneys are raising concerns about a proposed new ballot measure aimed at further reducing the state’s prison population. In a statement late Tuesday, Oklahoma District Attorneys Association President Jason Hicks says one problem is that crimes like child trafficking, aggravated assault and battery, and domestic abuse aren’t technically violent crimes under state law. The proposed state question filed Tuesday would prohibit prosecutors from using previous nonviolent felony convictions to enhance prison sentences. Hicks says state prosecutors are still examining the proposal, but there are already elements that would be “detrimental, if not catastrophic, for public safety.” District Attorney Angela Marsee says ignoring past convictions of repeat offenders is “detrimental to our mission.”\n\nOregon\n\nMedford: Traditional Christmas feasts featuring Dungeness crab may not be in the cards this year, as officials have delayed the commercial crabbing season due to the small size of the crustaceans. The Mail Tribune reports the season had been set to start Dec. 1 for Oregon’s most lucrative commercial fishery, but now crabbing has been postponed until at least Dec. 16. It’s the sixth straight year the season has been delayed to allow the crabs a chance to fatten up to meet industry standards. Dungeness crabs off the coasts of Washington and California also have low meat levels in their shells, prompting similar delays in those states. Tests planned for late November or early December will determine whether commercial crabbers can start plying the Pacific beginning Dec. 16.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The FBI has begun a corruption investigation into how Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration came to issue permits for construction on a multibillion-dollar pipeline project to carry highly volatile natural gas liquids across the state. FBI agents have interviewed current or former state employees in recent weeks about the Mariner East project and the construction permits, according to three people who have direct knowledge of the agents’ line of questioning. All three spoke on condition of anonymity. The focus of the agents’ questions involves the permitting of the pipeline, whether Wolf and his administration forced environmental protection staff to approve construction permits, and whether Wolf or his administration received anything in return, those people say.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A federal judge has sided with the cities of Providence and Central Falls after they challenged the conditions of U.S. Department of Justice public safety grants they said in a lawsuit would turn local police into federal immigration agents. District Court Judge John McConnell Jr. said in a ruling Thursday that “Congress has not granted the power to impose the conditions the DOJ imposed.” The federal government, among other things, wanted cities receiving public safety grants to notify federal agents when immigrants in the country illegally are about to be released. Attorneys for the cities said in a statement that they are pleased the court “found DOJ’s attempts requiring our police departments to be agents of a federal immigration system to be unlawful.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Bars throughout downtown in this college town are now signed on to the Angel Shot program, offering patrons a way to request help when they don’t feel safe. The simple order – “one Angel Shot, please” – is meant to be a simple solution to combat sexual violence and assault in the university’s entertainment district. An “Angel Shot” is not an actual drink. It is a code word that signals to a bartender or barback that a customer feels unsafe, typically from a potential perpetrator of sexual violence. From there, the bar’s staff will find that customer safe passage out of the bar and home. The Angel Shot program was implemented in every bar downtown this fall semester by Clemson University Student Government, which partnered with Pickens County Advocacy Center, Clemson City Police Department and Clemson’s Healthy Campus for the initiative.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A man sentenced to 90 years in prison for killing his stepfather has petitioned the court in Minnehaha County to change his name because he wants a fresh start. Thirty-five-year-old Daniel Charles was 14 when he was sent to prison in 2000 for first-degree murder in Meade County. He was accused of putting a rifle to his stepfather’s head and pulling the trigger at a ranch near Opal. He told law enforcement at the time that he didn’t know the gun was loaded. Charles’ petition says he wants to change his name to Rameus Tiberius Aryada to start a new life with an adult identity. The South Dakota Department of Corrections lists Charles’ earliest parole eligibility as March 2045.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee State Museum is collecting stories of cultural identity, immigration and migration from the public. The project called Your Story, Our Story uses everyday objects as an entry point for these personal stories. Members of the public can add their own stories and read the stories of others on the Tennessee State Museum’s website. Because the museum is currently showcasing an exhibit on Tennessee food, it is especially encouraging visitors to add images and stories of recipes, cookware, dinnerware and ingredients that carry meaning in their families. Your Story, Our Story is an initiative of the Tenement Museum in New York City and partners across the U.S. that include museums, colleges, schools, libraries and community groups.\n\nTexas\n\nRobstown: With help from Nueces County Public Libraries, county Judge Barbara Canales led local students on a “bear hunt” at Oscar O. Ortiz Park on Wednesday evening. Despite the biting cold, Canales gamely led the students down a path to read from “We’re Going on a Bear Hunt” by Michael Rosen. The county unveiled StoryWalk, a new feature at the park in which pages of picture books are displayed in wooden stands along paths so residents can read while they walk. It’s an effort to promote literacy and physical activity, and the county plans to implement StoryWalk at more parks. Canales and the kids read aloud together as the characters braved tall grass, a deep river, a forest and mud along their search for a bear. Canales called out to the students to stomp in big strides, run and tip-toe like the characters to bring the story to life.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Former Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. on Thursday announced his 2020 candidacy for the Republican nomination for the office that he held from 2005 to 2009 before leaving to serve as a U.S. ambassador. Huntsman announced his candidacy in a statement before a scheduled kickoff swing Thursday and Friday to Cedar City and St. George in southern Utah. Incumbent Republican Gov. Gary Herbert is not running for reelection, and Huntsman has said he was considering a run for governor. Huntsman served as U.S. ambassador to China in the Obama administration and as U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Trump administration. Other Republicans in the 2020 race include Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, Utah County businessman Jeff Burningham and Salt Lake County Councilwoman Aimee Winder Newton.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Five groups are sharing more than $1 million to use phosphorus recovery technologies as the state works to reduce algae-causing phosphorus runoff into Lake Champlain and other waterways. It’s part of the Vermont Phosphorus Innovation Challenge announced last year to generate creative solutions to the phosphorus pollution in the state. Officials estimate about 38% of the phosphorus load in the lake comes from agricultural land. Gov. Phil Scott said Thursday that the state received 21 applicants for the funds. The finalists include Agrilab Technologies of Enosburg Falls. The governor’s office says the group will use existing phosphorus recovery technologies, composting and drying equipment to create a series of sites for phosphorus processing in Franklin, Addison, Lamoille and Caledonia counties.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A task force has been created to come up with ways to help mitigate and prevent evictions in the city. The group will include affordable housing and social justice advocates, youth and family homelessness specialists, public housing residents and property management professionals. Mayor Levar Stoney said in a news release that the group will work with the city’s Eviction Diversion Program, which began last month to provide rental assistance, free legal help, financial counseling and supportive service referrals to residents who are facing eviction. Stoney said the task force will explore steps the city can take to better understand the root causes of evictions. A research group at Princeton University found that Richmond and four other Virginia cities have some of the highest eviction rates in the country.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A weeklong hearing will help determine whether a small American Indian tribe from the northwest corner of Washington state can once again hunt whales. The Makah Tribe conducted its last legal hunt in 1999, when its crew harpooned a gray whale from a cedar canoe. A U.S. appeals court later revoked permission for the hunts, saying the tribe needed to obtain a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The tribe has been trying to obtain the waiver since 2005, a process that has been repeatedly stalled by scientific reviews. The hearing beginning Thursday will focus on whether the tribe meets the requirements for the waiver. Animal rights groups oppose the effort. Whatever the outcome, the matter is likely to end up in federal court.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The West Virginia Board of Education will give the public 60 days to comment on a proposal on charter schools, double the normal allotted time. The board put the policy proposal up for comment Thursday. Legislation signed by Gov. Jim Justice authorizes a staggered implementation of public charter schools, limiting the state to three charters until 2023, then three more every three years after that. The legislation was part of a broader education bill that included teacher pay raises. The West Virginia Education Association and the West Virginia chapter of the American Federation of Teachers have lambasted the bill, saying it shut out teachers’ voices and violates the state Constitution.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers is asking the Republican leaders of the Legislature’s budget committee to release $3.7 million a year in funding to pay for programs designed to help homeless people. Evers sent a letter Thursday to the committee cochairs, urging them to make available the funding that has been pending for four months. Evers is seeking action now before winter sets in. He says with cold temperatures and snow across the state already, “my concern has only grown.” The funding would go toward such things as grants to help low-income people with housing costs, help fund emergency shelters and pay for support to help homeless people get into permanent housing. The Assembly passed bills to approve the funding, but they’ve stalled in the Senate.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The National Park Service says snowy weather last month likely cut down on visitors to Yellowstone during October. The agency recorded just over 170,000 visitors during the month, a 22% decrease from October 2018. So far in 2019, the park has hosted over 3.9 million visitors, which is down 2.5% from the same period last year. Yellowstone is entering its winter season, when visits to the park are typically the lowest of the year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/15"}]}

Colorful pills drive new warnings about ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new wave of concern has spread across the United States over multi-colored “rainbow fentanyl” pills, powders and blocks – that look similar to candy or sidewalk chalk – being sold and used in several states, and potentially posing a threat to young people.\n\nBut parents of young children should not overly panic, and the emergence of this new product is one small part of the larger ongoing opioid crisis.\n\nRainbow fentanyl comes in bright colors and can be used in the form of pills or powder that contain illicit fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, making them extremely addictive and potentially deadly if someone overdoses while trying to achieve a high off of the drugs.\n\nThis multi-colored fentanyl may appeal to young people or fool them into thinking it’s safe, but experts say illicit fentanyl has been hiding in what appears to be other products for a long time, and fentanyl is fentanyl – it’s all dangerous, rainbow or not.\n\n“Colored fentanyl pills have been around for a few years. Typically, they’ve been blue pills labeled ‘M30’ to counterfeit oxycodone, which is a much weaker opioid,” Joseph Palamar, an associate professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone Health, who has studied trends in illicit fentanyl, said in an email to CNN.\n\n“I think the big difference people are concerned about is with regard to accidental ingestion. People are worried that their kids will take one of these pills thinking they’re another drug or even thinking they’re some sort of candy,” Palamar said. “I don’t think the color of the pills greatly increases danger to people who don’t use fentanyl, but there is always a possibility of someone who uses fentanyl leaving their pills around in the reach of children.”\n\nHe added, “We need to keep in mind that these pills cost money so people aren’t going to be throwing them on the ground for kids to find. I don’t think people will be giving these pills out as Halloween candy.”\n\nWhere rainbow fentanyl warning originated\n\nThe US Drug Enforcement Administration released a warning in August advising the public of this “alarming emerging trend” of “colorful fentanyl available across the United States.”\n\nAt the time, the agency said that it and its law enforcement partners seized the brightly colored fentanyl and fentanyl pills across 18 states. Fentanyl remains the deadliest drug threat facing the nation, according to the DEA.\n\nBut the DEA did not specify in its announcement whether rainbow fentanyl had led to overdoses or deaths among young people.\n\n“Rainbow fentanyl – fentanyl pills and powder that come in a variety of bright colors, shapes, and sizes – is a deliberate effort by drug traffickers to drive addiction amongst kids and young adults,” DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in the August announcement.\n\nSince then, some colleges and universities are cautioning students about the presence and dangers of rainbow fentanyl, and the California Department of Public Health has alerted K-12 school administrators in the state about rainbow fentanyl being “a new trend.”\n\nAt Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, physicians have been seeing more fentanyl exposures among both young children and adolescents, Dr. Sam Wang, the hospital’s pediatric toxicologist, told CNN on Friday. While he and his colleagues are aware of rainbow fentanyl warnings, he hasn’t heard any patients or parents mention it.\n\nAfter all, the bottom line, he said, is that fentanyl is fentanyl, whether it comes in the form of rainbow-colored pills or simply a white powder.\n\n“It’s just coming out in a different form to potentially be more attractive, more quote unquote ‘fun’ to use because it looks potentially fun to take,” said Wang, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\nAnd when young people use illicit drugs, they sometimes don’t know what they really contain, or how dangerous those substances might be.\n\nWhen it comes to rainbow fentanyl, “the fentanyl itself is going to be the same issue as the counterfeit pharmaceutical fentanyl. We don’t know how much is in it – it can vary. We don’t know the type of fentanyl,” Wang said. “And so those concerns transmit, still, over to this product. It’s just now this looks like it has a potential danger for young children and then also, it’s going to be more attractive for people to use and have consequences from that.”\n\nThe rise of fentanyl\n\nThe United States has been facing an opioid overdose epidemic – and waves of opioid overdose deaths – for decades, starting with a rise in prescription opioid overdose deaths in the early 2000s, followed by a rise in heroin overdose deaths beginning in 2010 and, most recently, a rise in synthetic opioid overdose deaths that started in 2013, fueled by potent fentanyl.\n\nPharmaceutical fentanyl is a synthetic opioid intended to help patients, such as those with cancer, manage severe pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and typically prescribed in the form of skin patches or lozenges. But most recent cases of fentanyl-related harm, overdose, and death in the United States are linked to illegally made fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe latest data suggest that annual drug overdose deaths have jumped 44% from before the Covid-19 pandemic. There were about 76,000 deaths reported in the 12-month period ending March 2020. The CDC’s latest provisional data show that more than 109,000 people in the United States died of a drug overdose in the 12-month period ending March 2022.\n\nSynthetic opioids, including fentanyl, were involved in more than two-thirds of overdose deaths in the year ending March 2022. Deaths involving synthetic opioids increased by a staggering 80% over the past two years, CDC data shows.\n\nRainbow fentanyl has been receiving attention due to the bright colors of the products, but the illicit fentanyl that the products contain represents a continuation of the ongoing opioid epidemic. The only difference between rainbow fentanyl and the fentanyl products of the past appears to be the coloring.\n\n“The reason it’s colored is just to differentiate products. If we had a regulated market, they would be differentiated in different ways – we do not. It has nothing to do with marketing to kids at all, period, whatsoever,” said Maya Doe Simkins, co-founder of the Opioid Safety and Naloxone Network and co-director of Remedy Alliance, a collection of harm reduction groups that work to make naloxone more accessible.\n\nSimkins likened the different colors of rainbow fentanyl to how people used food coloring in heroin in the past, and she said the colors are sometimes used to differentiate batches.\n\n“It’s just a differentiation between your product, my product or this batch and the next batch,” she said.\n\nIncreasing fentanyl seizures\n\nIllicit fentanyl has long been hiding in drugs, and its presence appears to be on the rise.\n\nA study, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence in May, found that the number of fentanyl-containing powder and pills seized by law enforcement in the United States rose between 2018 and 2021.\n\nThe weight of powder fentanyl seizures increased from 298.2 kilograms in 2018 to 2,416 kilograms in 2021, and the number of pills seized increased from 42,202 in 2018 to 2,089,186 in 2021, according to the study, of which Palamar was the lead author.\n\n“We found that not only has fentanyl seizures been increasing, but the proportion of pills seized to overall fentanyl seizures has been increasing. The proportion of pill seizures increased from 14% in early 2018 to 29% in late 2021,” Palamar wrote in his email to CNN.\n\n“We don’t have information regarding what these seized pills were purported to be, but we think many were disguised as oxycodone or even Xanax,” he wrote. “Seizures of these counterfeit pills have been increasing at a rapid rate, suggesting increasing availability, and availability is going to continue to increase.”\n\nWith this increase, counterfeit pills have been more difficult to identify, but Palamar said that people can use test strips to detect traces of illicit fentanyl if they have concerns.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“People can purchase fentanyl test strips for as little as a dollar. Most of these strips are meant for urine testing but they can detect the presence of fentanyl if used correctly,” Palamar wrote.\n\n“I highly recommend that anyone who plans to use an illegally purchased pill or an illegal powder like cocaine test the drug before using,” he added. “There are also hundreds of newer fentanyl analogs and other opioids that can be very dangerous that test strips can’t detect. I do worry that test strips will give some people a false sense of security, but they’re something.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/politics/marijuana-decriminalization-white-house-joe-biden/index.html", "title": "Biden pardons all federal offenses of simple marijuana possession ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden is taking his first major steps toward decriminalizing marijuana, fulfilling a campaign pledge to erase prior federal possession convictions and beginning the process of potentially loosening federal classification of the drug.\n\nBiden on Thursday pardoned all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession, a move that senior administration officials said would affect thousands of Americans charged with that crime.\n\nThe announcement comes a month ahead of critical November elections that will determine control of Congress. Some candidates – in particular Pennsylvania Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who is running for his state’s US Senate seat – have made the issue of marijuana legalization central to their campaigns. When Fetterman and Biden met last month, the candidate said he would raise the issue with the President. At the same time, Democrats have sought to rebuff allegations they are soft on crime, an issue that has risen to the top of some voters’ agendas in certain swing districts.\n\nAs part of the announcement, Biden also encouraged governors to take similar steps to pardon state simple marijuana possession charges, a move that would potentially affect many thousands more Americans.\n\nAnd the President will task the Department of Health and Human Services and Attorney General Merrick Garland to “expeditiously” review how marijuana is scheduled under federal law, the first step toward potentially easing a federal classification that currently places marijuana in the same category as heroin and LSD.\n\n“No one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana,” Biden said in a video announcing his executive actions. “It’s legal in many states, and criminal records for marijuana possession have led to needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities. And that’s before you address the racial disparities around who suffers the consequences. While white and Black and brown people use marijuana at similar rates, Black and brown people are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted at disproportionate rates.”\n\n“Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It’s time that we right these wrongs,” the President said.\n\nThe moves Biden announced Thursday stop short of full decriminalization, which has enjoyed growing support among both political parties. But they are the first significant steps taken by a US president toward removing criminal penalties for possessing marijuana.\n\nThe President and a small circle of White House aides had been wrangling for weeks over the changes, complicated both by Biden’s own personal skepticism about decriminalization and not wanting to dictate changes to the Justice Department.\n\nBiden’s own view on marijuana is a product of both his age and the years he spent as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate working on crime bills. During the 2020 campaign, aides argued that he was waiting for new studies to come out that would inform a shift in his position – but even without any such studies, Biden was eventually moved by arguments about the lack of fairness and justice, particularly along racial lines.\n\nWhite House aides were also watching the calendar with the midterms in mind, hoping that the changes long sought by criminal justice advocates will help build enthusiasm among Black voters, younger voters and a wider array of core Democratic voters.\n\nSenior administration officials declined to say how quickly the review might be completed that would lead to further steps toward decriminalization.\n\n“The process will take some time because it must be based on a careful consideration of all of the available evidence, including scientific and medical information that’s available,” one senior official said.\n\nIn his statement, Biden wrote that certain rules on marijuana would remain in place, even if the drug is descheduled.\n\n“Even as federal and local regulations of marijuana change, important limitations on trafficking, marketing, and under-age sales should stay in place,” he said.\n\nMarijuana is illegal under federal law, even as individual states have moved toward legal use for recreational and medical purposes. Under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is listed on Schedule 1, meaning it has “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.”\n\nThat has left some users open to prosecution, even in places where marijuana use is legal.\n\nBiden’s pardons will be issued through an administration process overseen by the Justice Department, a senior administration official said. Those eligible for the pardons would receive a certificate showing they had been officially forgiven for their crime.\n\nOfficials said there are currently no Americans serving prison time solely on federal simple marijuana possession charges. But they said the number who had been charged with that crime was north of 6,500.\n\nAs a candidate, Biden stopped short of endorsing legalization of marijuana for recreational purposes. But he did adopt a stance toward decriminalization.\n\n“No one should be in jail because of marijuana. As President, I will decriminalize cannabis use and automatically expunge prior convictions,” he said during the presidential campaign.\n\nLoosening federal rules on marijuana has gained steam in recent years as the drug is legalized in a growing number of states. In late 2020, the House passed a measure that would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level, though it wasn’t taken up in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/middleeast/saudi-drug-capital-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Saudi Arabia is becoming the drug capital of the Middle East | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nLondon and Abu Dhabi CNN —\n\nA grisly drug-induced homicide captivated the media in Saudi Arabia this April, when a man in the country’s Eastern Province set his family house on fire before iftar, the meal that ends the Ramadan fast. Four members of his family were killed.\n\nPolice said he was under the influence of shabu, a methamphetamine, according to local papers.\n\nSaudi media has been sounding the alarm lately over the rise in drug use, with one columnist describing shipments of narcotics to the kingdom as an “open war against us, more dangerous than any other war.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Saudi authorities announced the largest seizure of illicit drugs in the country’s history after nearly 47 million amphetamine pills were hidden in a flour shipment and seized at a warehouse in the capital Riyadh.\n\nThe record seizure demonstrates what experts say is Saudi Arabia’s growing role as the drug capital of the Middle East, driving demand and becoming the primary destination for smugglers from Syria and Lebanon.\n\nThe kingdom, they say, is one of the largest and most lucrative regional destinations for drugs, and that status is only intensifying.\n\nWednesday’s operation was the biggest single smuggling attempt in terms of narcotics seized, according to the General Directorate of Narcotics Control. While authorities didn’t name the drug seized or where it came from, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has previously said that “reports of amphetamine seizures from countries in the Middle East continue to refer predominantly to tablets bearing the Captagon logo.”\n\nCaptagon was originally the brand name for a medicinal product containing the synthetic stimulant fenethylline. Though it is no longer produced legally, counterfeit drugs carrying the captagon name are regularly seized in the Middle East, according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.\n\nDrug busts of captagon in Saudi Arabia and around the region have grown over time. Earlier this week, A US Coast Guard boat seized 320 kilograms of amphetamine tablets and almost 3,000 kilograms of hashish worth millions of dollars from a fishing boat in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nThe drug was popularized in the kingdom some 15 years ago but has taken off more intensely in the past five years, “perhaps becoming on par with cannabis,” according to Vanda Felbab-Brown, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, who has written on the topic.\n\nOne of the reasons captagon is spreading in use is “because there is a supply flood now coming mostly from Syria” where it is produced “on an industrial scale in the chemical factories inherited from the [Assad] regime” and supplied by warlords and affiliates of the regime.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Center for International Communication didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nCaptagon can be sold for between $10 and $25 a pill, meaning the latest Saudi haul, if it was the same drug, has a street value of up to $1.1 billion, based on figures from the International Addiction Review journal.\n\n“Captagon’s amphetamine-type properties are sought out as a coping mechanism that can aid users facing food insecurity in staving hunger, and inducing a euphoric ‘rush’ that users have said to help with traumatic stress,” said Caroline Rose, a senior analyst at the New Lines Institute in Washington, D.C. who has studied the captagon trade. “It’s also been said that these same traits for captagon have been sought out by foreign workers in wealthy Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, seen to aid work performance.”\n\nWhile hashish and khat are also common drugs in the kingdom, amphetamines are popular among Saudi youth. A 2021 study in the journal of Crime, Law and Social Change cited a user as saying, “captagon is small. My school mates and I like it more than hashish. Not like hashish, we can buy in tablet……Once we get 25 riyals from [our] parents, we can buy one tablet and enjoy it.”\n\n“In wealthier consumer markets, the drug has a different appeal, serving as a recreational activity amongst its growing youth population that, despite social reforms… have reportedly struggled with boredom amidst widespread youth unemployment and a lack of opportunities for leisurely activities,” said Rose. “Some consumers have justified captagon as less of a taboo substance, compared to ‘harder’ drugs like opiates and cocaine.”\n\nSince many young people in Saudi Arabia have been taking drugs as a result of boredom and lack of social opportunities, the increased freedoms introduced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman could help reduce some of that use, said Felbab-Brown.\n\n“The important thing is neither to curtail the freedoms, nor to turn concerts into places of dragnets and raids, but rather to educate young people,” she told CNN.\n\nOver the past few years, a number of drug rehabilitation centers have popped up across the kingdom after the government began licensing private establishments.\n\nKhalid Al Mashari, the CEO of Qaweem, one of the first such centers to open, says around four or five have opened in the past two years. That’s a testament to the government’s recognition of the importance of rehabilitation, he says, but it also shows that the problem is on the rise.\n\n“We’re in high demand, unfortunately,” he told CNN. “But at least people have an option now, instead of having to go to neighboring countries to seek treatment.”\n\nDespite the presence of rehabilitation centers, Rose says there is little public health messaging or campaigning to raise awareness about captagon.\n\n“While this taboo regarding drug consumption in the kingdom is not going anywhere, the government’s tendency to exclusively securitize this issue and downplay its role as a destination market will be harder to ignore,” she said.\n\nFelbab-Brown says drug policies in the Middle East have focused on the harshest of responses.\n\n“Unlike large parts of the world [that] have walked away from such rigid and mostly ineffective or outright counterproductive policies, the Middle East has often doubled down on them,” she said. “Imprisoning users is ineffective and counterproductive.”\n\nThe digest\n\nUS says Iran reply on EU proposal for revival of nuclear deal is “not constructive”\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the US has received Iran’s reply to the US’ response an EU proposal for the revival of the nuclear deal on Thursday. “We are studying it and will respond through the EU, but unfortunately it is not constructive,” said the spokesperson. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani earlier said Tehran’s response was sent after “carefully” examining it and “with the aim of finalizing the negotiations,” according to a statement.\n\nBackground: Earlier this week during a press conference in Russia, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Iran needs guarantees that the US will not withdraw from the nuclear accord and reapply sanctions as happened under the Trump administration.\n\nWhy it matters: The US and Iran have been trading responses to a “final” EU text aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said he hopes the talks can be concluded in a matter of days. French President Macron also said on Thursday he hopes to conclude the talks in the next few days. It’s unclear how the talks will move forward from here as Iran continues to increase its uranium enrichment and break commitments under the nuclear deal.\n\nFour killed during Shiite clashes in Iraq’s Basra\n\nClashes between rival Shiite groups killed four people in Iraq’s Basra on Thursday, as the fallout from the country’s worst political violence in years continues, Reuters reported. Basra is the main oil-producing city in Iraq and now violence has spread from Baghdad to the south.\n\nBackground: The violence began earlier this week in Baghdad when powerful Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr announced his resignation from political life. That move set off an intense round of political infighting between Iran-backed Shiite groups and al-Sadr’s supporters. Both sides have been trying to exert control since parliamentary elections in October 2021 saw Iran-backed blocs lose seats to Sadrists . Despite his win, al-Sadr failed to form a government amid opposition from his rivals.\n\nWhy it matters: The episode served as a reminder of the fragility of the government in Baghdad, which remained largely neutral in the crisis, as well as the competing players at home and abroad that seek to control the country’s politics.\n\nTurkish pop star could face up to 3 years in prison for joking about religious schools\n\nSinger Gulsen Bayraktar Colakoglu, known as Gulsen, could face a prison sentence of up to three years over comments made during a concert in April, according to a 48-page indictment. The Istanbul chief prosecutors office brought charges of “inciting the public to hatred and enmity,” the indictment said.\n\nBackground: Last week, Gulsen was jailed pending trial after a video circulating on social media showed her making a comment about religious schools in Turkey, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. During a concert in April, Gulsen said, “[He] graduated from Imam Hatip [religious schools.] That’s where his pervert side comes from,” referring to a person on stage. The singer denied the charge, saying it was a joke, and apologized to those offended by her remarks. She has since been released from custody but placed under house arrest. An Istanbul criminal court will assess the indictment and decide to accept or refuse it. If accepted, the hearings will start and Gulsen will be brought before court.\n\nWhy it matters: Gulsen has previously been targeted by Turkish conservative groups for her revealing stage outfits and support for the LGBTQ community. Her recent arrest sparked outrage and support from fans on social media. Some critics say it’s part of a move by Turkish officials to gain support from their religious and conservative base ahead of elections next year.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Adam Pourahmadi Abbas Al Lawati", "Adam Pourahmadi", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/politics/spending-bill-congress-omnibus/index.html", "title": "Here's what's in the $1.7 trillion federal omnibus spending law | CNN ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story originally ran December 20. It has been updated to reflect the current status of the legislation.\n\nCNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed into law a $1.7 trillion yearlong federal government spending package on Thursday, after the House and Senate passed it last week.\n\nThe legislation includes $772.5 billion for nondefense discretionary programs and $858 billion in defense funding. That represents an increase in spending in both areas for fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe sweeping package includes roughly $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies, an overhaul of the electoral vote-counting law, protections for pregnant workers, an enhancement to retirement savings rules and a TikTok ban on federal devices.\n\nIt also provides a boost in spending for disaster aid, college access, child care, mental health and food assistance, more support for the military and veterans and additional funds for the US Capitol Police. And the legislation contains several major Medicaid provisions, particularly one that could disenroll up to 19 million people from the nation’s health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nHowever, the law, which runs more than 4,000 pages, left out several measures that some lawmakers had fought to include. An expansion of the child tax credit, as well as multiple other corporate and individual tax breaks, did not make it into the final bill. Neither did legislation to allow cannabis companies to bank their cash reserves – known as the Safe Banking Act – or a bill to help Afghan evacuees in the US gain lawful permanent residency. And the spending package did not include a White House request for roughly $10 billion in additional funding for Covid-19 response.\n\nThe spending law, which will keep the government operating through September, the end of the fiscal year, is the product of lengthy negotiations between top congressional Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCongress originally passed a continuing resolution on September 30 to temporarily fund the government in fiscal year 2023, which began October 1.\n\nHere’s what’s in the law:\n\nMore aid for Ukraine: The spending law provides roughly $45 billion to help support Ukraine’s efforts to defend itself against Russia’s attack.\n\nAbout $9 billion of the funding will go to Ukraine’s military to pay for a variety of things including training, weapons, logistics support and salaries. Nearly $12 billion will be used to replenish US stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine through presidential drawdown authority.\n\nAlso, the law provides $13 billion for economic support to the Ukrainian government. Other funds address humanitarian and infrastructure needs, as well as support European Command operations.\n\nEmergency disaster assistance: The law provides more than $38 billion in emergency funding to help Americans in the west and southeast affected by recent natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. It will aid farmers, provide economic development assistance for communities, repair and reconstruct federal facilities and direct money to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, among other initiatives.\n\nOverhaul of the electoral vote-counting law: A provision in the legislation aims at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, the first legislative response to the US Capitol insurrection and then-President Donald Trump’s campaign to stay in power despite his loss in 2020.\n\nThe changes overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act, which Trump tried to use to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe legislation clarifies the vice president’s role while overseeing the certification of the electoral result to be completely ceremonial. It also creates a set of stipulations designed to make it harder for there to be any confusion over the accurate slate of electors from each state.\n\nFunding for January 6 attack prosecutions: The law provides $2.6 billion for US Attorneys, which includes funding efforts “to further support prosecutions related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol and domestic terrorism cases,” according to a fact sheet from the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe package also gives $11.3 billion to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including for efforts to investigate extremist violence and domestic terrorism.\n\nThe funding measures are part of nearly $39 billion for the Justice Department.\n\nRetirement savings enhancements: The law contains new retirement rules that could make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings – and less costly to withdraw them. Among other things, the provisions will allow penalty-free withdrawals for some emergency expenses, let employers offer matching retirement contributions for a worker’s student loan payments and increase how much older workers may save in employer retirement plans.\n\nTikTok ban from federal devices: The legislation bans TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, from federal government devices.\n\nSome lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China’s national security laws could force TikTok – or its parent, ByteDance – to hand over the personal data of its US users. Recently, a wave of states led by Republican governors have introduced state-level restrictions on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices.\n\nProtections for pregnant workers: The law provides pregnant workers with workplace accommodations – such as additional bathroom breaks, stools or relief from heavy lifting duties – needed for healthy pregnancies. It will prevent them from being forced to take leave or losing their jobs, as well as bar employers from denying employment opportunities to women based on their need for reasonable accommodations due to childbirth or related medical conditions. Also, another provision in the package guarantees workplace accommodations – particularly time to pump – for more nursing workers.\n\nChanges to Medicaid and other health care programs: The law phases out the requirement that prevented states from disenrolling Medicaid recipients as long as the national public health emergency was in effect in exchange for an enhanced federal match. This continuous coverage measure was enacted as part of a Covid-19 relief package passed in March 2020 and has led to a record 90 million Medicaid enrollees, many of whom may no longer meet the income requirements to qualify.\n\nUnder the law, states will be able to start evaluating Medicaid enrollees’ eligibility and terminating their coverage as of April 1. The redetermination process will take place over at least 12 months. Also, the enhanced federal Medicaid funding will phase down through December 31, 2023, though the states will have to meet certain conditions during that period.\n\nUp to 19 million people could lose their Medicaid benefits, according to estimates, though many would be eligible for other coverage.\n\nAlso, under a provision in the law, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, will offer 12 months of continuous coverage for children. This will allow the 40 million children on Medicaid and CHIP to have uninterrupted access to health care throughout the year.\n\nIn addition, the law makes permanent the option for states to offer 12 months of postpartum coverage for low-income mothers through Medicaid, rather than just 60 days. More than two dozen states, plus the District of Columbia, have implemented the measure, which was available on a temporary basis through the American Rescue Plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Another seven states are planning to implement the option.\n\nPlus, the package provides more money for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The funds are intended to speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics and preventive measures, beef up public health activities and strengthen the nation’s biosecurity by accelerating development of medical countermeasures for pandemic threats and fortifying stockpiles and supply chains for drugs, masks and other supplies.\n\nIncreased support for the military and veterans: The package funds a 4.6% pay raise for troops and a 22.4% increase in support for Veteran Administration medical care, which provides health services for 7.3 million veterans.\n\nIt includes nearly $53 billion to address higher inflation and $2.7 billion – a 25% increase – to support critical services and housing assistance for veterans and their families.\n\nThe law also allocates $5 billion for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, which provides additional funding to implement the landmark PACT Act that expands eligibility for health care services and benefits to veterans with conditions related to toxic exposure during their service.\n\nBeefing up nutrition assistance: The legislation establishes a permanent nationwide Summer EBT program, starting in the summer of 2024, according to Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger advocacy group. It will provide families whose children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals with a $40 grocery benefit per child per month, indexed to inflation.\n\nIt also changes the rules governing summer meals programs in rural areas. Children will be able to take home or receive delivery of up to 10 days’ worth of meals, rather than have to consume the food at a specific site and time.\n\nThe law also helps families who have had their food stamp benefits stolen since October 1 through what’s known as “SNAP skimming.” It provides them with retroactive federal reimbursement of the funds, which criminals steal by attaching devices to point-of-sale machines or PIN pads to get card numbers and other information from electronic benefits transfer cards.\n\nHigher maximum Pell grant awards: The law increases the maximum Pell grant award by $500 to $7,395 for the coming school year. This marks the largest boost since the 2009-2010 school year. About 7 million students, many from lower-income families, receive Pell grants every year to help them afford college.\n\nHelp to pay utility bills: The package provides $5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Combined with the $1 billion contained in the earlier continuing resolution, this is the largest regular appropriation for the program, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Home heating and cooling costs – and the applications for federal aid in paying the bills – have soared this year.\n\nAdditional funding for the US Capitol Police: The law provides an additional $132 million for the Capitol Police for a total of nearly $735 million. It will allow the department to hire up to 137 sworn officers and 123 support and civilian personnel, bringing the force to a projected level of 2,126 sworn officers and 567 civilians.\n\nIt also gives $2 million to provide off-campus security for lawmakers in response to evolving and growing threats.\n\nMore money for child care: The legislation provides $8 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, a 30% increase in funding. The grant gives financial assistance to low-income families to afford child care.\n\nAlso, Head Start will receive nearly $12 billion, an 8.6% boost. The program helps young children from low-income families prepare for school.\n\nMore resources for children’s mental health and for substance abuse: The law provides more funds to increase access to mental health services for children and schools. It also will invest more money to address the opioid epidemic and substance use disorder.\n\nInvestments in homelessness prevention and affordable housing: The legislation provides $3.6 billion for homeless assistance grants, a 13% increase. It will serve more than 1 million people experiencing homelessness.\n\nThe package also funnels nearly $6.4 billion to the Community Development Block Grant formula program and related local economic and community development projects that benefit low- and moderate income areas and people, an increase of almost $1.6 billion.\n\nPlus, it provides $1.5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which will lead to the construction of nearly 10,000 new rental and homebuyer units and maintain the record investment from the last fiscal year.\n\nMore support for the environment: The package provides an additional $576 million for the Environmental Protection Agency, bringing its funding up to $10.1 billion. It increases support for enforcement and compliance, as well as clean air, water and toxic chemical programs, after years of flat funding.\n\nIt also boosts funding for the National Park Service by 6.4%, restoring 500 of the 3,000 staff positions lost over the past decade. This is intended to help the agency handle substantial increases in visitation.\n\nPlus, the legislation provides an additional 14% in funding for wildland firefighting.\n\nWhat’s not in the law\n\nEnhanced child tax credit: A coalition of Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates pushed hard to extend at least one provision of the enhanced child tax credit, which was in effect last year thanks to the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Their priority was to make the credit more refundable so more of the lowest-income families can qualify. Nearly 19 million kids won’t receive the full $2,000 benefit this year because their parents earn too little, according to a Tax Policy Center estimate.\n\nNew cannabis banking rules: Lawmakers considered including a provision in the spending bill that would make it easier for licensed cannabis businesses to accept credit cards – but it was left out of the legislation. Known as the Safe Banking Act, which previously passed the House, the provision would prohibit federal regulators from taking punitive measures against banks for providing services to legitimate cannabis businesses.\n\nEven though 47 states have legalized some form of marijuana, cannabis remains illegal on the federal level. That means financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses are subject to criminal prosecution – leaving many legal growers and sellers locked out of the banking system.\n\nCovid-19 response: Lawmakers did not include a White House request for an additional $10 billion in funding for Covid-19, which would have been aimed at continued access to and development of vaccines and therapeutics, among other things. Earlier in the year, the Biden administration unsuccessfully pushed for $22.5 billion in extra funds.\n\nFBI headquarters: There was also no final resolution on where the new FBI headquarters will be located, a major point of contention as lawmakers from Maryland – namely House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer – pushed to bring the law enforcement agency into their state. In a deal worked through by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the General Services Administration would be required to conduct “separate and detailed consultations” with Maryland and Virginia representatives about potential sites in each of the states, according to a Senate Democratic aide.\n\nAfghan Adjustment Act: Also not included in the spending bill was the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would have helped Afghan allies who run the risk of deportation from the US. It would have given those evacuees a pathway to lawful permanent residency before their temporary status, known as humanitarian parole, expires in 2023. Many congressional Republicans raised concerns about vetting and other issues, but the legislation’s supporters, including former US military leaders, argued those worries have been addressed.\n\nLegislation to extend and expand Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who worked with the US during the war there and want to come to America is included in the spending bill.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby Katie Lobosco", "Tami Luhby", "Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/football/fans-qatar-world-cup-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "World Cup 2022: What fans can't do in Qatar | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter years of anticipation – and controversy – since Qatar was awarded the World Cup, the tournament finally got underway on Sunday in Doha.\n\nEven before a ball was kicked, some sore spots arose. Despite years of planning, just two days before the tournament kicked off, Qatar announced a ban of alcoholic beer at the eight stadiums hosting the World Cup in a surprise volte-face.\n\nNow, fans traveling to the country might be wondering where they stand with the rest of the host country’s local laws and customs.\n\nDrinking\n\nThe sale and consumption of alcohol has been a highly contentious issue since Qatar was first announced as the World Cup host 12 years ago.\n\nThe Muslim country is considered to be very conservative and tightly regulates alcohol sales and consumption.\n\nIn Qatar, it’s illegal to be seen drunk in public and those who violate this could face legal consequences. According to UK government advice on traveling to Qatar, drinking in a public place could “result in a prison sentence of up to six months and/or a fine up to 3,000 Qatar Rial ($824).”\n\nIn September, Qatar had said it would permit ticketed fans to buy alcoholic beer at World Cup soccer matches starting three hours before kick-off and for one hour after the final whistle, but not during the match.\n\nThen two days before the first match, soccer’s world governing body FIFA confirmed that no alcohol would be sold at the eight stadiums which will host the tournament’s 64 matches.\n\nAlcohol will only be served in designated fan parks and other licensed venues around Doha, FIFA said in a statement.\n\n“There will be […] over 200 places where you can buy alcohol in Qatar and over 10 fan zones, where over 100,000 people can simultaneously drink alcohol,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Saturday.\n\n“I think personally, if for three hours a day you cannot drink a beer, you will survive.\n\n“Especially because actually the same rules apply in France or in Spain or in Portugal or in Scotland, where no beer is allowed in stadiums now,” he added.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino attends a press conference at the Qatar National Convention Center (QNCC) in Doha on November 19, 2022, ahead of the Qatar 2022 World Cup football tournament. Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images\n\nStill, some fans will be able to consume alcohol at matches – at a price. Supporters can purchase a Match Hospitality package, with prices ranging from $950 to $4,950 per match, for varying services and including alcohol.\n\nA spokeswoman for Match Hospitality told CNN Sport that their packages are not impacted by FIFA’s policy change.\n\nNonetheless, alcohol is available at licensed hotel restaurants and bars, and expatriates living in Qatar can obtain alcohol on a permit system, according to UK government advice.\n\nPDA, sex and sexual orientation\n\nSex outside of marriage is illegal in Qatar, and intimacy in public between men and women can result in arrest.\n\nSex between men is also illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison in the country, and a report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nA Qatar government official recently told CNN in a statement that the World Cup host was an inclusive country.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar,” the statement read, adding: “Our track record has shown that we have warmly welcomed all people regardless of background.”\n\nAnd to ensure discrimination of any kind did not happen, measures were being implemented such as human rights training sessions with public and private security forces, and the enacting of legal provisions for the protection of everyone, according to FIFA.\n\nA statement sent to CNN on behalf of the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup, pointing to the fact that the country had, it said, hosted hundreds of international and regional sporting events since being awarded the World Cup in 2010.\n\nEven so in the run-up to the tournament there were mixed messages coming from Qatar with a World Cup ambassador and former soccer player Khalid Salman saying earlier this month that homosexuality was “damage in the mind,” in an interview with German broadcaster ZDF.\n\nDress codes\n\nWinter in Qatar is a relative term with temperatures still likely to be around 30 degrees Celsius (around 86 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nDespite the heat, all visitors to Qatar should show “respect for local culture by avoiding excessively revealing clothing in public,” according to the country’s tourism authority, adding that it’s recommended that both men and women should cover their knees and shoulders.\n\nA football fan takes a picture at the Corniche ahead of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 on November 19, 2022 in Doha.. Stuart Franklin/Getty Images\n\nAccording to UK government advice, men and women “are advised not to wear shorts or sleeveless tops, when going to government buildings, health care facilities or malls,” and failure to do so means you could be asked to leave or be denied entry.\n\nHowever, the US Embassy in Qatar notes that attire standards can differ according to which neighborhood or facility you are in. CNN’s teams in Doha have spotted plenty of tourists wearing shorts.\n\nDrugs\n\nUsing illegal drugs in Qatar can result in heavy fines and long jail sentences, according to the US State Department – this includes possession of marijuana/THC, CBD products and vape products.\n\nBut there are also restrictions on some prescription drugs, like stimulants, anxiety medication and strong pain relievers, and visitors are advised to check the list of banned substances before they travel.\n\nFreedom of expression\n\nThere’s a sliding scale of freedom in the world, according to Freedom House, the independent watchdog that gets funding from the US government.\n\nQatar, for instance, scores a paltry 25 on Freedom House’s 0-100 scale that combines access to political rights and civil liberties. But it’s not the lowest-scoring country taking part in the World Cup; Saudi Arabia scores a 7 and Iran scores a 14.\n\nNor is the US the most free. Canada gets a 98 and Uruguay and Denmark get a 97, while the US scores an 83.\n\nThere is no legal guarantee of press freedom or freedom of expression in Qatar, the US Embassy in Qatar notes.\n\nAccording to the US State Department, anyone convicted of “defaming, desecrating, or committing blasphemy” against Islam, Christianity, or Judaism could face a prison sentence of up to seven years, and public worship by non-Islamic faiths and atheism are illegal.\n\nMeanwhile, attempts to convert someone of another religion or even “share your faith” can result in imprisonment or deportation.\n\nTensions often run high at international football matches, and it’s not uncommon for scuffles to erupt between fans, both in and outside of stadiums, from rival countries – but swearing and making rude gestures are considered obscene acts in Qatar.", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/24/us/atlanta-public-safety-training-center-plans-community/index.html", "title": "Atlanta wants to build a massive police training facility in a forest ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Ram moved to the Boulder Walk neighborhood just southeast of Atlanta five years ago, it felt like finding a hidden gem: It was a diverse, affordable and family-friendly community just steps away from the local high school, bordering a forest but still a short drive from the big city; perfect for her family of five.\n\nBut she hasn’t been able to get used to hearing the daily sprays of gunfire.\n\n“When I first moved here, it increased my anxiety,” Ram, who did not want her full name used due to privacy concerns, said. “It messed up my nerves.”\n\nThe sound comes from a nearby Atlanta police firing range. It’s unnerving, residents from several nearby neighborhoods told CNN. Worse, they worry it’s just a glimpse into what could come when local officials begin building a massive police and fire training center in their backyards. “I absolutely want the police to be well-trained,” said Joe Santifer, who lives in another neighborhood, roughly a mile away from where the facility is slated to be built. “But if they’re not being good neighbors now, what will give us the confidence that they’ll be good neighbors in the future?”\n\nJoe Santifer poses for a portrait at Glen Emerald Rock Garden in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 22, 2022. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThe expected $90 million, 85-acre center, announced and approved by the city of Atlanta last year, will include a shooting range, mock city and burn building, among other facilities. The Atlanta Police Foundation says the center is needed to help boost morale and recruitment efforts, and previous facilities law enforcement has used are substandard, while fire officials now train in “borrowed facilities.” The police foundation, a nonprofit established in 2003, helps fund local policing initiatives through public - private partnerships. Among those sitting on its board of trustees are leaders of UPS, Wells Fargo, The Home Depot, Equifax and Delta Air Lines.\n\nBut the plan has been met with fierce resistance from a community still reeling from monthslong demonstrations protesting police brutality and racial injustice. Some locals say the city’s announcement blindsided neighbors and the development process since has largely been a secretive one with limited input from the most affected communities.\n\nFor others, the facility poses environmental concerns at a time when the deadly impacts of climate change have become hard to ignore: The training center would carve out a chunk of forested land Atlanta leaders previously seemed to agree to preserve, though the city says officials are committed to replacing trees destroyed in construction.\n\nActivists determined to stop the project have camped out in the forest’s trees and, despite a permit which could soon signal the start of construction, say they have no plans to leave.\n\nA promise unkept\n\nAtlanta and then-Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms were in the national spotlight in 2020 as protests erupted across the country over police killings of Black people, including Rayshard Brooks, a Black man fatally shot in the back by Atlanta police.\n\nThe city’s police chief resigned and Bottoms denounced the “chaos” she said was unfolding on the city’s streets, adding she was trying to strike a “tough balance” between criticizing police officers and supporting the ones who protected the city.\n\nIn the spring of 2021, following mounting pressure over a demoralized police force, Bottoms announced plans to build a new police training academy in an unincorporated part of neighboring DeKalb County on a controversial parcel of land owned and used as a prison farm by the city for much of the 1900s, sprawling across more than 300 acres. Prisoners there were subject to harsh punishments and bleak conditions, including poor sanitation and nutrition and overcrowding, according to the Atlanta Community Press Collective, a local group of researchers and writers.\n\n“We knew that (the training facility) was a direct response to the uprisings that took place in 2020,” said Kwame Olufemi, of Community Movement Builders, a Black member-based grassroots organization opposing the project.\n\nThe site of the proposed project, the Old Atlanta Prison Farm – where graffitied ruins now sit entwined with weeds and vines surrounded by forested land – is a “cultural landscape of memory,” say local advocates, who have long called for it to be turned into a park and memorial.\n\nIt’s also less than half a mile away from a tributary of the South River, which is one of America’s most endangered, according to nonprofit conservation group American Rivers. That’s a result of decades of neglect and pollution the area, which is overwhelmingly Black, has endured, local advocates say.\n\nIn 2017, a report authored by Atlanta’s city planning department which envisioned the prison farm as a key part of a larger effort to protect green spaces around the river was adopted into the city charter. It felt like a “unanimous promise” from city leaders to protect the land, said Joe Peery, with local volunteer group Save The Old Atlanta Prison Farm.\n\nBut in September 2021, after hearing roughly 17 hours of public comment – the majority of which was against the training center – the Atlanta City Council approved a ground lease agreement with the Atlanta Police Foundation, allowing for 85 acres of the prison farm site to be turned into the training facility while the other 265 is slated to be preserved as greenspace. (For comparison, the NYPD’s training academy is a roughly 32-acre campus; the LAPD training campus is about 20 acres.) Andre Dickens, Atlanta’s current mayor, was among the council members who voted for the lease.\n\n“Everybody was floored,” said Jacqueline Echols, board president for the South River Watershed Alliance, an organization working to protect the river. “Just in 2017 they’d said this would be a park and a community investment.”\n\nJacqueline Echols stands for a portrait outside of Intrenchment Creek Park in Atlanta, Georgia, on August 3, 2022. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThough the land is in unincorporated DeKalb County, it’s long been owned by the city, and residents in the surrounding area don’t have a say in city elections or vote for the leaders who made this decision. “It was kind of foisted upon us,” Santifer, who lives in Glen Emerald Park, said. “That’s part of the issue: the lack of transparency, the lack of engagement with this community because frankly, they know the community doesn’t want it.”\n\nThe police foundation has said the city went through an “exhaustive review of its properties” before selecting the site, adding it is the only one owned by Atlanta big enough to accommodate the two departments’ needs. And even if another privately-controlled site was identified, the foundation has said, preparing it for development would take “decades and present taxpayers with an unwarranted financial burden.”\n\nCity spokesperson Bryan Thomas told CNN the prison farm site was “a pragmatic choice, given its adjacency, its ownership by the City and its former and continued use” by Atlanta’s police and fire rescue departments.\n\nOther sites were explored over several years, Thomas said, adding the city engaged with a group of designers, architects and engineers about what a “first-rate training center” would require. The group eventually focused on the prison farm site since it has previously hosted training facilities, like the firing range, Thomas added.\n\nCNN also reached out to the police foundation for comment.\n\nAfter the September 2021 vote, Bottoms said she was aware of widespread opposition to the facility, but the city did not have any other site options to choose from, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The center was a move to support the city’s fire and police officers “while also focusing on sensible reform,” Bottoms, who did not run for reelection, said in a September 2021 news release.\n\nThe White House had no comment from Bottoms, who serves as senior adviser to the President for public engagement.\n\nActivists living in trees to stop ‘Cop City’\n\nPerhaps the loudest voices of opposition come from activists and organizers who have dubbed the plan “Cop City” and called on Mayor Dickens to cancel the lease.\n\n“Tree sitters” and other members of the “Defend the Atlanta Forest” movement built shelters in trees to prevent the facility’s construction and have also called attention to the forest’s history, saying a police center will continue a legacy of oppression on the land. Before it was a prison farm, White settlers established slave-based plantations in the area after forcing off the Muscogee Creek tribe, according to anthropologist Mark Auslander. Forest defenders refer to it today by its Muscogee name, Weelaunee Forest, as a nod to its original inhabitants.\n\nMembers of the movement have been accused by local officials and some neighbors of using violent tactics in related opposition efforts, including allegedly setting a tow truck on fire. In May, eight protesters were arrested after a Molotov cocktail was allegedly thrown at police as authorities tried to remove them from the area, according to CNN affiliate WSB. But it did not deter their efforts. The Defend the Atlanta Forest Twitter account posted a letter in August it said was from a tree sitter. “I’ll be here keeping up the struggle,” the letter said. “My question to the (Atlanta Police Foundation) is: When will you give up?”\n\nA person walks near the entrance to Intrenchment Creek Park in Atlanta, Georgia, on August 3, 2022. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThe Community Movement Builders group, which also opposes the plan, would have liked to see the financial resources instead be put toward mental health, food and housing programs for south Atlanta communities, according to Olufemi.\n\nTaxpayers will fund about $30 million of the facility’s cost in total, with the rest coming from private philanthropic and corporate donations, the city has said. Among those backing the center is the Atlanta Committee for Progress, a partnership between the mayor and the city’s top business, civic and academic leaders. Its former chairman, Alex Taylor, Chairman and CEO of Cox Enterprises, led the initial private funding campaign for the center at then-Mayor Bottoms’ request. (Cox owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the city’s major daily newspaper.)\n\nCox Enterprises spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs told CNN in a statement, “The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has always operated with complete editorial independence, and the newspaper, in its coverage of the police training facility, has repeatedly disclosed that it is owned by Cox Enterprises.”\n\nAtlanta Police Foundation President and CEO Dave Wilkinson wrote in a 2021 Atlanta Journal-Constitution op-ed a surge in violent crime across Atlanta since the summer of 2020 called for “more effective law enforcement,” but the city had struggled to build morale and retain employees in recent years.\n\nResidents who are in support of the facility told CNN they wanted police to be able to train properly and hoped the development would make their communities safer and help spur economic development.\n\nSpence Gould, a marine and resident of the Boulder Walk community for roughly a decade, said he sees the need for a training center. “I want my police force very well-trained, I want them to have all the resources that they need,” Gould told CNN. “But I also see the (Defend the Atlanta Forest) concerns because we are really wrecking the planet.”\n\nOnce the foundation has a land disturbance permit (which is still under review, according to DeKalb County) and construction begins, a fence will be put up around the site and anyone on the property “will be arrested,” Wilkinson told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in March.\n\nConstruction is expected to begin in the late fall and the first phase of the facility is expected to open before the end of 2023, the city spokesperson said.\n\nAmid climate crisis, advocates urge city not to cut trees\n\nTrees are seen with hearts placed on them near the planned police development in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 22, 2022. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nBefore the mayor’s sudden announcement, the prison farm site had been a key centerpiece in another vision: the South River Forest.\n\nThe forest is a 3,500-acre network of connected green spaces across parts of Atlanta and DeKalb County, which advocates say is desperately needed. Despite being known as the “city in a forest,” Atlanta has massive disparities in green space, with fewer and smaller parks in predominantly Black areas like this one. And with a population size expected to sharply increase in the coming decades, the benefits the forest can provide – floodplain restoration, habitat expansion and tree canopy protection, among others – will be critical, the Nature Conservancy has said.\n\nIn August 2021, more than a dozen environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club’s Georgia Chapter, wrote an open letter to city leaders urging them not to lease the prison farm site to the police foundation, arguing fragmenting the South River Forest will leave surrounding communities vulnerable to adverse impacts, like stormwater flooding – a problem already worsening because of climate change.\n\n“The forest serves as the city’s lungs,” said Nina Dutton, chair of the Sierra Club Metro Atlanta Group. “Forests capture carbon, they clean the air … they mitigate flooding and prevent erosion and they help keep the city cool. Breaking up this area of forest would reduce the amount of forest that’s available to help us in those ways.”\n\nThe forest vision could also spur economic development in long neglected areas and reconcile decades of environmental injustice with investment, said urban planner Ryan Gravel. “If you live in a community in the South River Forest, you’re more likely to live within walking distance of a landfill or a prison than anywhere else in metro Atlanta, by far,” he said. “You’re talking about an area that has historically been treated as a dumping ground.”\n\nDiscarded bags of trash are seen along a hole in a fence that leads into a proposed police development in Atlanta on August 15, 2022. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThomas, the city’s spokesperson, said training facilities will make up less than half the site, while the rest will be green space open to the public and include walking trails and picnic areas.\n\nMuch of the land to be developed has previously been cleared of trees and the parts including forest cover are “overwhelmingly dominated by invasive species,” devoid of thick forest, Thomas added. The Atlanta Police Foundation has committed to replace any hardwood tree destroyed in construction with 10 new ones and replace any invasive species with hardwood trees, the spokesperson added.\n\nBut advocates with Save the Old Atlanta Prison Farm argue most of the land has been reforested and reducing the forest in any way would also reduce the economic opportunities for the surrounding communities. “The noise and smoke coming from the Police Training Facility would further erode that impact,” the group has said.\n\nAlthough the training center will put a dent in advocates’ plans, many are still determined to see the South River Forest come to life. An ongoing initiative by the Nature Conservancy and the Atlanta Regional Commission is collecting community input about the forest’s future and is slated to wrap up in the coming weeks.\n\n“This could be the first step in starting to reverse some of the discrimination that this part of the city has seen over the last decades,” Santifer, who is among the project managers of that initiative, said.\n\n‘Violations of our environment and our neighborhoods’\n\nDeKalb County leaders could soon take a vote on a resolution introduced by county commissioner Ted Terry calling for an environmental assessment of the site and a noise study for the proposed center – and asks developers to reconsider the location if their plan cannot satisfy environmental standards. (Atlanta Police Foundation officials have said the center will “be built with 21st century EPA standards and controls.”)\n\nTerry recently said on Twitter county leaders have received more public comment from residents on this issue than any other during his tenure. “All opposed,” he wrote.\n\nDickens, Atlanta’s mayor, told the New Yorker recently an advisory committee created in the aftermath of the lease approval offered a way for public input on the project. But critics of the group note its members were appointed by local officials and don’t have the power to hold the police foundation and developers accountable to the community’s concerns.\n\nOne member was voted out after publishing an opinion piece criticizing the police foundation and project developers for misleading the community and avoiding their environmental due diligence – including by never investigating the possibility of unmarked graves on the prison farm land.\n\nA \"Defend the Atlanta Forest\" sign is seen in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 22, 2022. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThe committee isn’t meant to serve as a watchdog, but rather to make recommendations on changes or adjustments to the development which would benefit surrounding communities, said committee chair Alison Clark. And so far, the foundation has adopted all the group’s recommendations, she added, including relocating the center’s firing range further away from residential areas.\n\nClark, who has lived in the Boulder Walk neighborhood for roughly eight years, told CNN she is in favor of the training facility. She agrees the area has long been used as a “dumping ground” for unpopular developments like landfills, and hopes the center can help economically lift the area, bring in new vendors and also boost police presence. “At the end of the day, I think that’s a win-win for the community,” she said.\n\nBut ahead of the DeKalb County commissioners’ vote, county leaders heard from residents who said the project remained highly unpopular among the surrounding communities and urged for the approval of Terry’s resolution.\n\n“Residents in the area, who are predominantly Black and brown, often low-income, have been left out of the decision-making process and their voices have been ignored,” DeKalb County resident Brad Beadles said during an August meeting, according to a summary posted on the county’s website. “No one should have to be subjected to such clear harmful violations of our environment and our neighborhoods.”\n\nTerry told CNN he is taking more feedback from community members on the resolution and expects a vote on it from the commission next month.", "authors": ["Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/29/us/new-york-marijuana-first-legal-sales/index.html", "title": "Marijuana sales NY: New York recreational cannabis sales begin ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe first public sales of regulated cannabis in New York began at a dispensary in Manhattan’s East Village on Thursday at 4:20 p.m., hours after the first sale was made to a city official, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced.\n\nHousing Works Cannabis Company became the first licensed dispensary in the state to open its location for business.\n\nThe dispensary is operated by Housing Works, a non-profit that services people living with HIV/AIDS and those who are homeless and formerly incarcerated, Hochul said. The store will be open seven days a week and all proceeds will be directed to Housing Works, which runs a “network of charitable retail storefronts,” according to the release.\n\nTremaine Wright, chairwoman of the New York State Cannabis Control Board, speaks during the opening of the first legal cannabis dispensary in New York City, on December 29, 2022. Kena Betancur /AFP/Getty Images\n\n“We set a course just nine months ago to start New York’s adult-use cannabis market off on the right foot by prioritizing equity, and now we’re fulfilling that goal,” Hochul said.\n\nThe measure will attempt to address the racial disparities in cannabis-related arrests with a social and economic equity program to “facilitate individuals disproportionally impacted by cannabis enforcement,” city officials have said.\n\nThe program includes “creating a goal of 50% of licenses to go to a minority or woman owned business enterprise, or distressed farmers or service-disabled veterans to encourage participation in the industry,” a city news release said.\n\n“Today marks a major milestone in our efforts to create the most equitable cannabis industry in the nation,” said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in a statement on Thursday.\n\n“The legal cannabis market has the potential to be a major boon to New York’s economic recovery – creating new jobs, building wealth in historically underserved communities, and increasing state and local tax revenue,” Adams said.\n\nBill signed in March 2021\n\nIn March 2021, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill allowing recreational marijuana use across the state by adults 21 and older after the state Senate and Assembly voted to approve the legislation. The New York State Cannabis/Marijuana Regulation & Taxation Act also expunges previous marijuana convictions for actions that would be legal under the new law.\n\nThe bill allows adults 21 and older to buy cannabis from authorized sellers. Adults can also possess up to 3 ounces of cannabis and 24 grams of cannabis concentrate. Eighteen months after the first sales begin, the law will allow adults to grow six mature and six immature plants at home per household.\n\nIt also establishes the Office of Cannabis Management, an independent office operating as part of the New York State Liquor Authority, to implement a regulatory framework. The office was designed to have a two-tier licensing structure that would separate growers and processors from those owning retail stores, Cuomo’s office previously said.\n\nThe law will also add a 13% tax to retail sales for state and local tax revenue.\n\nThe development of a regulated cannabis industry in New York has the potential to create 30,000 to 60,000 jobs and the ability to earn $350 million annually in tax collections, CNN previously reported.\n\n‘People are eager,’ CEO says\n\nNew York’s Cannabis Control Board issued the first 36 adult-use retail licenses on November 21, including 28 for qualifying businesses and eight for non-profits, according to Hochul’s office.\n\nHousing Works received over 2,000 responses to its invitation to RSVP for the grand opening. The line outside the store was already stretching down the block hours before 4:20 p.m., Charles King, the chief executive officer of Housing Works, told CNN on Thursday. King says the nonprofit is hoping to have a total of three marijuana dispensaries in Manhattan by the end of 2023.\n\n“I don’t know that we’re actually going to be able to serve everyone in the three hours that we’re open,” King said. “People are eager.”\n\nNew York state has contracted with various laboratories to test all cannabis products to be sold for adult recreation, King says. The biggest challenge, he adds, was finding enough products to sell.\n\nMembers of the media take pictures before the opening of the first legal cannabis dispensary in New York City, on December 29, 2022. Kena Betancur /AFP/Getty Images\n\nPatrons must show their state or federal identification to make a purchase at the dispensary.\n\n“We’re required by regulation to card everyone who enters the store to make sure they’re over the age of 21 and take documentation that we’ve actually done that carding,” King said.\n\nKenneth Woodin, who waited in line to enter the store for four hours, told CNN affiliate ABC 7, “I want to be part of history. I like the idea of regulated weed.”\n\nA fast-growing industry\n\nThe federal ban on marijuana has not slowed down one of the fastest-growing industries in the United States. More than two-thirds of US states have legalized cannabis in some capacity. California was the first to legalize medical marijuana in 1996. Since then, the medical use of cannabis has been legalized in 39 states and the District of Columbia. Recreational cannabis use is legal in DC and 21 states.\n\nBallot measures in Missouri and Maryland to legalize recreational marijuana passed in the 2022 midterm elections, as momentum has grown nationwide to push for lifting penalties once associated with cannabis.\n\nA poll by the Pew Research Center conducted in October found that 59% of adults believe marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use, while 30% believe it should be legal for only medical use. However, just 10% of adults say marijuana use should not be legal, the survey found.\n\nIn October, President Joe Biden took the first significant steps by a US president toward removing criminal penalties for possessing marijuana by pardoning all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession, a move that senior administration officials said would affect thousands of Americans charged with that crime.\n\nBiden has also tasked the Department of Health and Human Services and Attorney General Merrick Garland to “expeditiously” review how marijuana is scheduled under federal law.\n\nNew York’s bill follows marijuana legalization in neighboring New Jersey. In February 2021, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy signed bills to legalize and regulate marijuana use for those 21 and older, decriminalize possession of limited amounts of marijuana and clarify marijuana and cannabis use and possession penalties for those younger than 21.\n\nRacial disparities in cannabis arrests\n\nThere are wide racial disparities in marijuana-related arrests nationwide, according to a study by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n“On average, a Black person is 3.64 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person, even though Black and white people use marijuana at similar rates,” the ACLU said in a 2020 report.\n\n“In every single state, Black people were more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession, and in some states, Black people were up to six, eight, or almost 10 times more likely to be arrested,” the report said.\n\nPolicymakers and industry members should not lose sight of how individuals, especially people of color, continue to be criminalized for activities that are now legal at the state level, Amber Littlejohn, CEO of the Minority Cannabis Business Association, previously told CNN.\n\n“First and foremost, we need to get people out of prison, and we need to stop arresting people for doing things that folks are making lots of money doing,” Littlejohn said.\n\nPeople of color also face tremendous barriers operating within the industry. Attempts have been made to create paths into the industry for those with non-violent marijuana convictions whose communities were negatively impacted from the War on Drugs. But these efforts have largely been unsuccessful due to state policies that limit licenses, fail to offer financial and business resources to people of color and that benefit deeper-pocketed multistate operators, Littlejohn says.\n\n“I think one of the biggest problems is there seems to be an incredible disconnect between what people say they support and believe in and what [becomes law],” she said. “It’s up to us, the collective us, to be holding folks accountable.”", "authors": ["Emma Tucker Laura Ly", "Emma Tucker", "Laura Ly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/americas/colombia-coco-decriminalize-intl-latam/index.html", "title": "Colombia's drug problem is worse than ever. But it has a radical ...", "text": "Bogota CNN —\n\nWhen Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s first progressive president, took office in August, he laid out an ambitious agenda.\n\nHis administration would finally achieve a stable peace with Colombia’s multiple rebel organizations; it would fight inequality by taxing the top 1% and lifting millions out of poverty; and it would abandon a punitive approach to drug policing that costed millions of lives around the world to little results, he promised.\n\nThree months later, there are signs for optimism: Colombia and the largest rebel group still active in its territory, the National Liberation Army ELN, have signed a commitment to restart peace negotiations after a four years hiatus; and Congress has passed a fiscal plan that aims to collect almost 4 billion USD in new taxes next year.\n\nBut drugs remain perhaps the hardest challenge for Petro.\n\nMore cocaine than ever before\n\nDrug production boomed in Colombia during the pandemic.\n\nThe total area harvested for coca leaves – the main ingredient for cocaine – grew 43% in 2021 according to a new annual survey by the United Nation’s Office on Drug and Crime. At the same time, the amount of potential coca produced per hectare grew a further 14%, the UN reported, leaving experts to believe Colombia is producing more cocaine than ever in its history.\n\nIn many rural parts of the country, the production of illicit drug became the only economic activity during pandemic lockdowns, the UN explains, as markets and agricultural routes shut down and farmers switched from food crops to coca.\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Dickenson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, the spike in harvests has become so evident even the casual traveler can see it.\n\n“A few years ago, you’d have to drive for hours to see coca crops. Now they are much more common, less than one kilometer from the main highway,” she told CNN after a recent field trip to Cauca, part of a Colombian southwestern region that has seen a +76% increase in harvested area.\n\nColombian president Gustavo Petro speaks during a press conference about the first 100 days of his government in office, in Bogota on November 15. Chepa Beltran/Long Visual Press/Abaca/Sipa USA/AP\n\nIn the Indigenous reserve of Tacueyo, Cauca, the increase in coca and marijuana harvests have caused profound concern for the leaders of the community according to Nora Taquinas, an Indigenous environmental defender who has received multiple death threats from criminal organizations.\n\nTwo signs show a more sustained drug trade than in recent years, Taquinas says: informal checkpoints on the road leading up to Tacueyo and worrying trends of school dropouts as local children are pressed into service by criminal organizations for menial tasks around the production of narcotics.\n\n“The cartels pay about 15’000COP (about 3USD) to clean a pound of marijuana sprouts. A kid can do up to six pounds per day, and that is solid money down here. It’s hard to stop that.”\n\nThe only positive aspect, Taquinas says, is that the increase in drug production and trade in her community has not caused higher levels of violence. “We are on the lookout. But soon enough, the cartels will start competing for the harvests here, and the competition between them is to the death. Right now, it’s like the calm before the storm.”\n\nThe proliferation of armed groups in recent years is one of the greatest shortcomings of the Colombian peace process, which in 2016 brought an end to more than half a century of civil warfare.\n\nBefore the deal, most of the guerrilla groups were disciplined like a regular army and this helped war negotiations between public officials and rebel groups. Now, the armed actors who didn’t abandon armed struggle have splintered in up to sixty different groups often in competition against themselves, according to the United Nations.\n\nEven if the recently announced peace negotiation with the ELN succeeded, there are at least 59 more groups involved in the drug trade for the government to deal with.\n\nCompeting with cocaine\n\nConvincing farmers to stop growing coca has been one of Colombia’s largest problems for the last fifty years.\n\nThe traditional solution has been to punish the farmers by destroying crops through ever-more sophisticated and forceful measures: aerial fumigations, enforced eradication campaigns, aerial monitoring, and the deployment of troops to coca-growing regions.\n\nBut this cost millions of dollars, mostly financed through military aid from the United States to Colombia, and has claimed the lives of thousands of Colombian farmers and soldiers in clashes and drug-related violence. Until this year, few dared to question it from a position of power.\n\nWhile Petro bears no responsibility for latest the production increases – the report details narcotic trends until December 2021, before this year’s election – his message to ditch the war on drugs resonates with the United Nations’ finding that the billions of dollars invested in preventing Colombian farmers from growing coca could be put to a better use.\n\n“The first thing to notice from the report is the total failure of the war on drugs,” says Colombia’s Justice Minister Nestor Osuna and one of the people tasked with coming up with a new solution to the drug problem.\n\nThe government’s plan, Osuna told CNN, is centered on three key moments.\n\nIn the immediate, term, Petro’s administration aims to limit the spread of drug-related violence immediately, even if that means allowing further increases in coca harvesting areas might take place in the coming years.\n\nIn order to avoid confrontation with coca-growing communities and reduce retaliatory actions from the cartels, Colombia’s coca eradication campaign will be pared-down, although not completely suspended, and the justice ministry would embark in a series of ‘voluntary consultations’ to convince communities to replace illicit crops with legal ones in exchange for financial incentives.\n\nEventually, crop substitution will take place on a massive scale by expanding the farming frontier of Colombia, he says.\n\n“If we offer a sustainable alternative to the farmers harvesting coca, they will take it. It is true that right now no agricultural product can compete with the revenue coca makes, but it’s also true that coca remains illegal, and we believe the farmers have signaled us they would rather work under the law, even at lower margins, than in illegality,” the justice minister said.\n\nThe plan is to relocate thousands of farmers who are currently harvesting coca into unused agricultural for a fresh start with legal crops. Last month, the Colombian government agreed to the purchase of up to three million hectares from the country’s rancher association to expand the agricultural lands.\n\nColombia has tried crop replacement in the past, but failed to overcome the appeal of coca. The coca bush can produce a harvest up to six times a year and requires minimal care, as an invasive plant that grows even in unfavorable conditions.\n\nCoca buyers, the drug cartels, are willing to pay in advance for a harvest, often in cash, and crucially will also provide transport by picking it up from the farm – a significant incentive for farmers who live hours of unpaved road away from main market towns. That’s why the Petro government wants to relocate the cocaine workforce entirely.\n\nMembers of Colombia's anti-narcotics police seize a cargo of molasses mixed with cocaine that was being sent to Valencia in Spain in Cartagena, Colombia on February 4, 2022. Sebastian Barros/Long Visual Press/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nThe areas that are currently devoted to coca, once abandoned, would go through a process of reforestation, Osuna said, thanks to a new public investment fund worth 120 million USD to pay farmers to protect the rainforest for the next 20 years. Each family would receive up to 600 USD per month to launch reforestation projects in areas affected by coca harvesting as well as illegal ranching and logging.\n\nUltimately, Petro’s ultimate goal is to de-criminalize cocaine. But Osuna is adamant the government would not launch such a move unilaterally – cocaine’s criminal status is globally codified in a series of international treaties.\n\nPetro has made a point of displaying the failures of the war on drugs at any international forum he took part to, from the official visit of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the United Nations General Assembly in September.\n\nIt’s a strategy Osuna labelled as “nagging offensive”, with the hope that the world would one day hold an informed debate on whether narcotics should still be considered prohibited substances.\n\n“We must recognize that cocaine consumption takes place all around the world, it’s evident. For many people, that consumption is harmful, and that’s why it would be good if countries employed public health policies to deal with this issue,” said Osuna.\n\n(For his part, Osuna noted that his only experience with drugs was a marijuana joint in his twenties in Amsterdam that left him sick for two days.)\n\nCan it be done?\n\nWhile many world leaders have urged a global rethinking around the issues of drugs, this is the first time a sitting president of Colombia – the world’s largest cocaine producer – openly calls to give up the war on drugs.\n\nAccording to a 2019 study from the University of Oxford, the drug trade is worth almost 2% of Colombia’s GDP. Nobody can predict how a Colombia free from the drug trade would eventually look like, and Osuna is well aware of how difficult the task ahead is: “The war on drugs has failed for the past fifty years, it’s not like we can come and solve it in fifty days,” he told CNN.\n\nThe government’s critics, such as former Colombian president Alvaro Uribe, who presided over the greatest crop reduction in the country’s history through a controversial all-out military campaign in the early 2000, believe legalizing cocaine would only make the cartels wealthier, not poorer.\n\nBut recent development on marijuana legislation around the world, with countries as far as Germany and Uruguay, as well as more than fifteen US states, passing legislation to allow recreational use, prove that it is possible to turn the tide, Osuna says.\n\nColombia is also discussing legalizing weed, a move that just three years ago would have been unthinkable and that, if passed, has the potential to legalize the work of dozens of families in Tacueyo.\n\nA pilot project to produce textile fabrics made of hemp is already up and running, though demand for the fiber is very small compared to cartel demand for marijuana, Taquinas says. “What we need is more legal outlets, not fewer.”", "authors": ["Stefano Pozzebon"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/success/job-scams/index.html", "title": "Job scams are on the rise. Watch out for these red flags | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe strong labor market has given us near record low unemployment, higher wages – and an unfortunate uptick in the number of reports of job seekers getting scammed.\n\n“We are definitely seeing job scams,” said Rhonda Perkins, attorney and chief of staff of the Federal Trade Commission’s division of marketing practices. In 2021, the agency received more than twice the number of job scam reports than in 2020, Perkins said. And in the first quarter of this year, there’s been more than 16,000 complaints filed.\n\nJob scams have been around for a while and the tactics scammers use can vary. Some will try to gain access to your personal information, while others might solicit payments from you or hire you for an illegal task, such as reshipping luxury goods that were bought using stolen credit cards.\n\nSo if you’re looking for a job, here are some of the red flags experts say to look for when reviewing potential opportunities:\n\nThe job post is flashy, but offers few details\n\nIn a job seekers’ market, employers are trying to stand out. But if a job posting is all about making money quickly or other big promises – proceed with caution.\n\n“If a job ad is using too-good-to-be-true terms like: ‘quick money,’ or ‘unlimited earnings potential,’ or ‘laptop for free’ and has very few skill requirements … and a lot of caps and images to distract you, it just doesn’t come across professionally,” said Sara Sutton, CEO and founder of FlexJobs.\n\nIf you are unsure of the legitimacy of a post, check to see if you can find the opening posted directly on the company’s website.\n\nYou have questions, but they don’t have the answers\n\nGetting a call from a recruiter is flattering, but make sure they are who they say they are – especially if it’s for a job you didn’t apply for.\n\n“Pay attention to the questions they are asking you,” said Sutton. “If the recruiter is offering you a job very quickly without verifying your work experience or asking for references and moving very, very quickly – those are also red flags.”\n\nIf the job description was overly vague, be sure to ask for more details about the position, duty expectations and experience requirements.\n\n“They will definitely run from you when you start asking more questions,” said Sinem Buber, lead economist at ZipRecruiter. “If they start giving you inconsistent answers or not answering your questions properly, you know that’s not a real job.”\n\nSutton added that scammers can fraudulently use a company’s name and recommended to check the recruiter’s email is legit. For instance, if the domain is “company-inc.com” versus “company.com,” she advised looking online to see what the company uses.\n\nThey ask for personal information\n\nJob applications tend to include questions like your name, address, contact information and work experience, but it shouldn’t go much deeper than that.\n\n“If they are asking you to provide personal information upfront during the interview stages, like your Social Security number for a background check … no legitimate company asks for a background check or Social Security number during the interview stage. That happens after you are hired,” said Buber.\n\nBefore giving out any personal information, Perkins recommended doing some online research. “Look up the name of the company, the person who claims to be hiring you, plus the word ‘scam,’ ‘review,’ or ‘complaint’… and don’t trust reviews on the company’s website. Those could be fake.”\n\nThey ask for payment\n\nThe only conversation you should be having with a potential employer about money should be about compensation. If they ask you to pay any fees for things like special services, training or software or equipment, that should be a major red flag.\n\n“Don’t pay for the promise of a job, don’t make an upfront payment to get a job – only scammers will ask you to do that,” said Perkins.\n\nThere’s also a fake check scam that can involve a bogus company sending you too large a check for you to buy something like computer equipment and then asks you to repay the excess funds via a wire transfer service, cryptocurrency or gift cards.\n\nThese forms of sending money are hard for law enforcement to trace and people to get their money back, Perkins explained.\n\n“Under the law, banks are required to make the money available quickly, so when you deposit a check and it looks like it’s cleared that doesn’t mean it’s a good check,” said Perkins. “The bank will find out later it’s a bad check.”", "authors": ["Kathryn Vasel"], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}]}

Johnson’s attorneys asked the Alabama Supreme Court on Friday to “right a grievous wrong” and grant him a new trial. The filing is the latest effort in a case that has seen former judges, prosecutors and the local district attorney join in calls to reexamine the 1998 conviction and death sentence. Johnson’s attorneys are asking the justices to review a lower court decision denying the new trial request. They argued that the conviction rested on the testimony of a single witness who was paid a reward and that her testimony “was at odds with the physical evidence and directly contradicted by the state’s theory of the case in other proceedings.” Johnson was convicted and sentenced to death for the killing of Jefferson County Deputy Sheriff William Hardy, who was shot twice in the head while working off-duty security at a hotel in 1995. The conviction came after Johnson’s first trial ended with a hung jury. A co-defendant in the case was acquitted. Former Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley, former Chief Justice Drayton Nabers, and several former judges and prosecutors submitted briefs to the circuit court or wrote editorials supporting a new trial for Johnson. Danny Carr, the district attorney in the county where Johnson was convicted, also called for a new trial.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Lance Mackey, one of mushing’s most colorful and accomplished champions, has died. The four-time Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race winner died Wednesday from cancer, his father and kennel announced on Facebook. He was 52. Officials with the world’s most famous sled dog race said Iditarod Nation was in mourning. “Lance embodied the spirit of the race, the tenacity of an Alaskan musher, displayed the ultimate show of perseverance and was loved by his fans,” officials said in a statement. The son of 1978 Iditarod champion Dick Mackey and brother of 1983 champion Rick Mackey, Lance Mackey overcame throat cancer in 2001 to win an unprecedented four straight Iditarod championships, from 2007 through 2010. It wasn’t just the 1,000-mile race across Alaska where he excelled. During his Iditarod run, twice he also won the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race between Canada and Alaska with only two weeks’ rest between races. But after the string of wins, he was beset by personal problems, health scares and drug issues that prevented him from ever again reaching the top of the sport. The treatment for his throat cancer cost him his saliva glands and ultimately disintegrated his teeth. He was then diagnosed with Raynaud’s syndrome, which limits circulation to the hands and feet and is exacerbated by the cold weather with which every musher must contend in the wilds of Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Democrat Katie Hobbs’ campaign announced Sunday that she would not debate Republican Kari Lake as the two battle for the governor’s office, calling off any negotiations with Lake and the state commission overseeing debates. The decision came after more than a week of efforts by Hobbs, currently secretary of state, to change the debate into separate half-hour interviews with the moderator. The Citizens Clean Elections Commission, which has held debates for two decades featuring candidates for statewide and legislative offices, flatly rejected that proposal Thursday. Instead, the commission urged its staff to work with Hobbs to come up with minor changes to the debate and gave her a week to come to an agreement. Hobbs’ campaign manager’s statements to the commissioners made it seem unlikely that a deal could be reached. Nicole DeMont instead repeated the campaign’s concerns that debating Lake would “just create another spectacle, like we saw in the GOP primary debate. But on top of that, I would just add, you can’t debate a conspiracy theorist, and at the last debate, she brought the conversation back to the 2020 election no less than a dozen times.” The GOP primary debate featured four candidates who almost immediately devolved into a free-for-all of talking over and constantly interrupting each other.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The University of Arkansas-Fort Smith plans to use the donation of $18.7million, the largest in the school’s history, to improve both its nursing and art and design programs. The Windgate Foundation awarded UAFS the money after much discussion and a grant proposal requesting money to draw more students to those two fields. The $9.9 million reserved for nursing will bring in new students and faculty. After speaking with the Fort Smith medical community, Paula Julian, the executive director of nursing, said the area needs double the number of nurses it has. “This is the greatest nursing shortage of our lifetime,” Julian said. For nursing, officials have divided the money into two phases. In the first, Julian expects to hire more than 20 nursing educators. The second phase creates two new degrees, the associate degree of nursing and the RN-to-BSN pathway. Julian said that along with these new degrees, the school will offer classes at nontraditional hours such as evenings and weekends. The other $8.8 million of the gift is dedicated to art and design. Construction will begin next year on an expansion to the Windgate Building, with the new square footage to be partly used as studio space for faculty and students. The department will also expand the number of classes it offers, such as adding ceramics.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: An arson investigation is underway after fire destroyed a historic church in South Los Angeles early Sunday, authorities said. The blaze at Victory Baptist Church broke out shortly before 2:30 a.m. and quickly grew to major emergency status, said Nicholas Prange, a spokesperson with the Los Angeles Fire Department. Two firefighters were hospitalized with mild to moderate injuries after battling the flames, Prange said. One became trapped by a collapsing ceiling before being rescued, he said. The Los Angeles Times said Victory Baptist has played a major role in the spiritual and political history of South LA. Founded in a local storefront on Easter Sunday in 1943, the church moved into its current building on McKinley Avenue a year later. In the 1950s, its Sunday night services were broadcast on television nationally. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the church in 1964. An arson team with the House of Worship Task Force was part of the investigation, officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nArvada: Authorities have arrested a suburban Denver man on suspicion of first-degree murder and other charges in the death of a 27-year-old police officer who was fatally shot while trying to break up a large family disturbance over the weekend. Sonny Thomas Almanza, 31, of Arvada, was arrested by police late Sunday in connection with the shooting death of Arvada Officer Dillon Vakoff, police said in a statement released Monday. Vakoff died at a hospital Sunday after being shot while he and another officer responded to the disturbance that spilled into a street outside a housing complex. He was the second Arvada police officer to be killed in the line of duty in two years. Almanza was taken into custody at a hospital, where he is recuperating from injuries sustained while exchanging gunfire with Vakoff and another officer early Sunday. He will be transferred to Jefferson County Jail when he is released from the hospital, the Arvada department said. Vakoff and his fellow officer had been dispatched to check on the well-being of two minor children when they encountered the disturbance, police said. A suspect opened fire, wounding a woman, at which point the officers returned fire, Police Chief Link Strate said at a news conference Sunday. The suspect then fired at Vakoff, Strate said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Sports fans won’t be able to place bets at Hartford’s XL Center until next spring. Officials told the Hartford Courant that delays in receiving crucial construction components due to global supply chain issues are to blame and that the project isn’t expected to be completed until at least March. It had been hoped the 4,000-square-foot sportsbook, featuring a bar and restaurant, would be open in time for the start of the NFL season this weekend. A main component delaying the project is a large glass wall that will overlook a major intersection and is expected to transform the building’s bunker-like appearance. “We’re groping along, frankly, because the window system is frustrating us,” Michael W. Freimuth, executive director of the Capital Region Development Authority, which oversees arena operations, told the newspaper. “We’re trying to keep going, but the wall system is going to delay us.” The state-financed, $4 million project was approved after lawmakers passed legislation legalizing sports gambling last year. The legislation called for the creation of sports betting venues at 15 locations. The XL Center hosts University of Connecticut men’s and women’s basketball as well as minor league hockey and concerts.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A report released Thursday once again underscored the need for the state to streamline its delivery of substance use services, expand collaboration of treatment within emergency departments and increase reimbursement rates for those treatments. Those were just some of the nearly 60 recommendations detailed in the study conducted by HMA Institute on Addiction, which was commissioned by New Castle County along with Kent and Sussex county officials to evaluate the landscape of addiction treatment in Delaware and target areas for improvement. The First State is not alone in its struggle to combat addiction and reduce overdose deaths, which skyrocketed amid the COVID-19 pandemic and have continued to plague communities across the country. There were 515 overdose deaths in the state last year – a 15% increase from 2020, which saw 447 deaths in Delaware, according to the report. There were 437 overdose deaths in 2019, state Department of Health and Social Services figures show.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Several Metro stations are operating under new names as of this week, WUSA-TV reports. The name changes, which will be reflected on signage and maps across the system, were approved by the Metro Board of Directors in December 2021. Travelers will see the changes immediately on digital maps throughout all rail stations and on bus displays, as well at the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority website and Trip Planner. The station previously known as White Flint is now North Bethesda. Largo Town Center has become Downtown Largo. Tysons Corner is now simply called Tysons. Prince George’s Plaza changed to Hyattsville Crossing, and West Falls Church’s secondary name, VT/UVA, is now VT only.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: A shooting scare at a central Florida high school was a “cruel prank” carried out by two groups of students who now face criminal charges and possible expulsion, police said. Rumors, lies and conspiracy theories have been “floating around” on social media since Friday’s lockdown at Mainland High School, Daytona Beach police said Sunday in a lengthy Facebook post. “This entire incident appears to have been a cruel prank by several students that has now gotten out of control due to internet trolls, misinformed people and in some cases, people that are not even in Florida,” police said. Investigators said officials at the school became aware of a threat written on a bathroom stall Thursday. School officials and law enforcement reviewed video and interviewed two students who had entered the bathroom around the time the graffiti was discovered. The students denied involvement, and it was determined that no threat existed, police said. On Friday, two groups of students in the cafeteria “decided to capitalize on the threat” and “appear to collaborate with each other to create a panic,” police said. They were seen on video “getting into specific positions and locations within the cafeteria, timing their actions,” and several female students told an administrator someone had a gun.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: Fishermen, shrimpers and business owners dependent on coastal tourism have filed lawsuits over pollution caused when a cargo ship capsized off the Georgia coast in 2019. The two federal lawsuits filed last week say the pollutants released by the capsize of the Golden Ray and the harm caused by the subsequent salvage operation have damaged the area’s sensitive marine ecosystem – and the plaintiffs’ livelihoods. The South Korean-owned Golden Ray capsized with more than 4,200 automobiles in its cargo decks shortly after departing the Port of Brunswick on Sept. 8, 2019. The wreck occurred in the sound between St. Simons and Jekyll Islands. Removal dragged on for more than two years. The lawsuits accuse the companies connected to the shipwreck of negligence and of violating the federal Clean Water Act and the federal Oil Pollution Act, which was enacted in 1990 following the Exxon Valdez disaster. Plaintiffs are asking the court to order the companies to pay civil penalties, remediate the sound and award compensatory damages. “The Golden Ray was grounded near environmentally sensitive areas that serve as a unique habitat for a variety of species, including, but not limited to, shrimp, fish, migratory birds, crabs, and food sources for all marine life, including, but not limited to, fiddler crabs,” the lawsuits said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A new program at the University of Hawaii aims to offer more mental health services to Indigenous students. The COVID-19 pandemic hit Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students particularly hard, HawaiiNewsNow reports, and a dearth of counselors with similar backgrounds and culturally relevant treatments has compounded the situation. Under the Ka Malu a Waʻahila program, the John A. Burns School of Medicine offers therapy, monthly group support and self-help tools at no charge, according to the news outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A “Drag Kids” program slated for this year’s Boise Pride Festival prompted a wave of political pressure and anonymous threats. Festival organizers said they envisioned a short performance where kids could put on sparkly dresses and lip-sync to songs like Kelly Clarkson’s “People Like Us” on stage. But others, including Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon, expected a lurid scene where children would “engage in sexual performances with adult entertainers.” The event garnered national attention from far-right websites and podcasts, and by last Tuesday, organizers realized this wasn’t the “normal” amount of opposition, said the festival’s president, Michael Dale. Moon and the Idaho GOP sent out statements directing constituents to ask the festival’s corporate sponsors to pull support for this past weekend’s three-day event. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced it was pulling $38,000 in funding and resources. A conservative pastor from California began rallying like-minded congregations, asking members to tell the Ada County Sheriff to arrest any festival organizer who “contributes to the delinquency of minors.” A group known for armed protests told followers to show up Sunday. On Thursday afternoon, festival organizers made the decision to postpone the kids’ performance. “We wanted to ask these kids first and foremost because it affects them and their confidence and their lives. And they still wanted to do it,” Dale said, fighting back tears. “But it came to be an issue of their health, their well-being, and that of the festivalgoers.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Democrats who run state government celebrated Monday while announcing that tax-rebate checks totaling more than $1.2 billion had begun heading to 6 million taxpayers. Rebates on income and property taxes are part of a $1.83 billion inflation-relief package built into this year’s budget. “Everyone knows inflation is a global problem with local consequences,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at a Chicago news conference. “Prices at the pump and at the supermarket have taken Illinois families on a roller-coaster ride over the past months. It’s exactly the kind of thing that responsible government should help our residents with and we have, starting today.” With eight weeks remaining before the November election, the timing is perfect for Pritzker, Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who shared Monday’s spotlight, and virtually every member of the General Assembly. Rebates will arrive by mail or direct deposit in the closing days of the campaign season, when voters make up their minds. Individual taxpayers making less than $200,000 will receive a $50 rebate, with $100 to couples filing jointly earning less than $400,000, Revenue Director David Harris said. Taxpayers will also receive $100 for claimed dependents, up to three. Property tax rebates will be equal to the amount a homeowner claimed as a credit on income tax returns last year, up to $300, Harris said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Five women and a religious abortion-rights group filed a new lawsuit in Marion County on Thursday challenging the state’s near-total abortion ban on the grounds of religious freedom. Hoosier Jews for Choice and the five women – residents of Marion, Monroe and Allen counties – claim the ban violates the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The 2015 measure, signed into effect by then-Gov. Mike Pence, prevents the government from impeding someone’s religious exercise unless there’s a strong argument in favor of the state’s interest. The defendants in the case include members of the Medical Licensing Board of Indiana and prosecutors in five counties. The lawsuit says the belief that life begins at conception, which is widely shared by Christian anti-abortion advocates, “is not a theological opinion shared by all religions or all religious persons.” “For example, under Jewish law, a fetus attains the status of a living person only at birth,” the lawsuit says. “Jewish law recognizes that abortions may occur, and should occur as a religious matter, under circumstances not allowed by (the near-total abortion ban) or existing Indiana law.” That would include when an abortion could prevent a “mother’s mental anguish” from severe physical or mental health issues.\n\nIowa\n\nAltoona: The former owners and operators of Adventureland Resort have told a court that the family of the 11-year-old boy who drowned there in 2021 may have contributed to the deadly accident and its aftermath. That argument was part of a court filing last week by Adventure Lands of America Inc. in response to a lawsuit blaming the theme park for the death of Michael Jaramillo and injuries to members of his family. A raft carrying the family on the park’s Raging River ride overturned July 3, 2021, resulting in the drowning of Michael and severe injuries to his brother, who were trapped underwater for an extended period. Attorney Guy Cook represents the then-owners of the park, who have since sold the property to another operator. His filing denies key allegations of the family’s lawsuit alleging the accident was the result of mismanagement, neglect and safety violations under CEO Michael Krantz. In addition to saying the Jaramillos themselves may have been negligent or failed to appropriately “mitigate” the accident’s results, Cook’s response argues that the park complied with government regulations and that others – possibly including “government entities” – may have been the “sole proximate cause” of the tragedy. The response does not say what the Jaramillos allegedly may or may not have done to contribute to the accident.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A suburban Kansas City police officer who shot and killed a 17-year-old four years ago will not face civil rights charges, federal prosecutors announced Friday. John Albers was shot by officer Clayton Jenison after he backed a minivan out of his family’s garage in Overland Park in January 2018. Officers went to the home to check reports that Albers was posting threats to harm himself on social media. Albers’ parents were not home at the time. The Justice Department said its two-year investigation into the shooting found no evidence to contradict an earlier finding in a civil court that Jenison used unreasonable force in shooting Albers. However, federal law requires that investigators prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer “willfully” used unreasonable force, federal prosecutors said. Evidence gathered during the investigation “does not clear the high bar that the Supreme Court has set for meeting this standard, and the department has therefore closed its investigation into this matter,” federal prosecutors said in a news release. Jenison shot twice at Albers as he backed the van past him and out of the driveway, investigators said. When the van spun around to face the street and began slowly backing toward the house, Jenison fired 11 more shots. Albers was hit by six bullets and died at the scene.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: Construction of the new U.S. 60 Cumberland River Bridge in western Kentucky will take a big step forward this week as crews plan to float a 700-foot steel truss up the river and install it, officials said. The truss was expected to float from Paducah to the construction site at Smithland, then be placed atop the main piers Monday through Wednesday, according to the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Security during the procedure will be tight, but a public viewing area will be available at the north end of the bridge construction site so people can watch the slow process of raising the truss and putting it into place, District 1 Chief Engineer Kyle Poat said. There will be lane restrictions on the existing Cumberland River Bridge while the truss is being installed. The $63.6 million project is expected to be completed next year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Taxpayers have until Oct. 6 to claim millions in state income tax refunds before they become unclaimed property. The Louisiana Department of Revenue sent letters to 20,400 people and business taxpayers advising them to claim their refunds before they are transferred by law to the Unclaimed Property Division of the state treasurer’s office. More than $36 million in unclaimed refunds is due for transfer if not claimed, the department said in a news release. To claim a refund, taxpayers must complete and return to the revenue department the voucher in the Notice of Unclaimed Property letter dated Aug. 18. The department will issue paper checks to all taxpayers submitting completed vouchers by the October deadline. Any refund not claimed by the deadline remains the property of the taxpayer and can be retrieved from the Unclaimed Property Division.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal judge has denied a request from fishing groups that sought to challenge new fishing rules designed to protect rare whales. The lobster fishing groups wanted a federal judge to stop regulators from placing new restrictions on the harvest of the crustaceans. The rules are intended to protect North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340 and are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear. U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg denied the request in a Thursday ruling. It’s the latest in a string of legal setbacks for lobster fishermen who are coping with increasingly strict fishing rules meant to save the whales. The Maine Lobstermen’s Association said in a statement that it was disappointed by the ruling, which it said “puts the future of Maine’s lobstering heritage at great risk, and along with it, the livelihoods of thousands of hard-working men and women.” Conservation groups have long pushed for stricter protections for the vanishing whales. Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement the ruling affirms “right whales can’t wait any longer for stronger protections from deadly entanglements in fishing gear.”\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Offshore wind projects like those by US Wind and Orsted were boosted Wednesday as the Maryland Energy Administration added $1.6million to fund additional projects by emerging companies. The Maryland Offshore Wind Capital Expenditure Grant Program, a fund aimed at assisting new or existing emerging businesses entering the offshore wind supply chain in Maryland, will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis for qualifying proposals until Jan. 1, 2023, or until all funding has been awarded. “Proposed projects must provide a positive net economic benefit to the state and local communities through job opportunities while encouraging diversity, inclusion and equity in their business operations. Proposed projects should also be designed to serve the larger U.S. offshore wind market and related industries,” the state energy agency said in a statement. Developments like MARWIN I and Momentum Wind by US Wind represent a projected 77 turbines 15 to 18 miles off the coast of Maryland and Delaware that are expected to turn out 1,864.5 megawatts of power for the state – enough to power 285,000 Maryland homes. The state regards the industry as a boon, bringing 12,000 direct full-time equivalent jobs, with both Baltimore-area and Ocean City-area port facilities seeing the windfall.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Voters will get the chance to decide whether the state should reject a new law allowing immigrants in the country illegally to obtain state driver’s licenses. The secretary of the commonwealth’s office announced late Friday that it had certified the signatures needed to put repeal of the law on the November ballot. The measure became law after the Democrat-controlled Massachusetts House and Senate overrode a veto by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker in June. With the override, Massachusetts joined 16 other states and the District of Columbia that have similar laws. The push to repeal the new law is being led in large part by the state Republican Party. The law was a win for immigrant rights groups that had long pushed for the measure, framing it in part as a public safety measure, noting that those seeking the licenses will have to show they can properly operate a car and get insurance in the event of an accident. Maureen Maloney, whose son Matthew Denice was killed in 2011 after being struck and dragged by a driver in the country illegally, is helping to lead the repeal effort and claimed the law hurts the integrity of state elections by creating a backdoor for noncitizens to vote. Backers of the new law say it will make the roads safer for everyone.\n\nMichigan\n\nYpsilanti: Striking Eastern Michigan University faculty members returned to their classrooms Monday, after their union reached an agreement with the university to end a walkout that started last week. University and union officials announced the tentative contract agreement Sunday night following weekend negotiations, but they didn’t immediately release the details. The university said a full class schedule would resume Monday at the Ypsilanti campus of more than 15,000 students about 35 miles southwest of Detroit, where several dozen faculty members started picketing Wednesday. The union represents more than 500 tenured and tenure-track faculty. The two sides had been split over salary increases and how much faculty members should pay for health care. Union leaders had argued that the school’s proposal would have saddled its members with thousands of dollars in additional costs. Union negotiating team chairman Matt Kirkpatrick, an associate professor of English language and literature, called the agreement “an important victory.” “We took a stand to maintain and strengthen quality education at EMU, and this agreement moves us forward,” Kirkpatrick said in a statement. The agreement would have to be ratified by the university’s board and union members to take effect.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Thousands of nurses in the state launched a three-day strike Monday, complaining of low salaries and understaffing worsened by the strains of the coronavirus pandemic. Some 15,000 nurses at seven health care systems in the Minneapolis and Duluth areas walked out. The affected hospitals said they recruited temporary nurses and expected to maintain most services. Picket signs went up and strike chants began at 7 a.m. outside 15 Twin Cities- and Duluth-area hospitals. The hospitals and the striking nurses said staff shortages are a shared concern. Minnesota Nurses Association President Mary Turner said pay raises are necessary to address the “crisis of retention” that would otherwise leave the hospitals severely understaffed. The hospitals have offered 10%-12% wage increases, but the nurses are seeking more than 30%. Hospital leaders called their wage demands unaffordable, noting that Allina and Fairview hospitals have posted operating losses and that the cost of such sharp wage increases would be passed along to patients. Union spokesman Sam Fettig said the nurses settled on a three-day rather than open-ended strike because of concerns about the impact of drawn-out labor action on patient care. “As the nurses always say, this isn’t something they want to be doing; they want to be at the bedside providing care,” Fettig said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: As the city emerges from the depths of a crisis that made water unusable even for bathing, another is stacking up in piles of empty plastic bottles. The city has distributed hundreds of thousands of water bottles in the past six weeks. Churches, businesses and other groups have rallied to bring truckloads of water to the capital. In the state’s first week of aid, it distributed about 5 million bottles, Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday. Making things worse, the city ended its curbside recycling program in August 2019, saying the lack of interest and cost made it an impractical endeavor. Residents were referred to private recycling companies if they wanted to continue curbside service. Environmentality Recycling Solutions and Allen’s Recycling are among the private companies that pick up recyclables. Tri-Miss Recycling has drop-off points but does not offer curbside pickup, nor does it accept plastics. Derek Augustus, owner of Environmentality Recycling Solutions, said his company is working with Keep Jackson Beautiful to collect empty bottles at some water distribution sites. Keelan Sanders, executive director of Keep Jackson Beautiful, said the group already was working with the city and Jackson Public School District on exploring ways to bring back some sort of recycling program. “The water crisis has basically expedited what we’re trying to do because we saw the need, especially with all the water bottles we are being inundated with now,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Officers fatally shot a 16-year-old they say was reaching for a gun, police said Monday. Darryl Ross was shot just after 11:30 p.m. Sunday at a gas station on the city’s north side. Ross was Black. A police incident report said one of the officers involved in the shooting was Black, and one was white. The city’s new Force Investigation Unit, established last month, was handling the investigation. Police said two drug enforcement detectives spotted several people with guns at the service station and drove to the parking lot. Their car was unmarked, and they were in plain clothes but wearing black, bulletproof vests with the word “POLICE” written on the front and back. Ross, armed with a gun according to the police report, walked away quickly to an alley. The detectives followed him and announced they were police officers. Ross ran, then tripped and fell, dropping a pistol, police said. As the detectives approached, Ross reached for the pistol, the report said, prompting both officers to shoot him. Ross was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The officers were unhurt. It was the second fatal officer-involved shooting in St. Louis in less than a week. Officers killed a 61-year-old man last Wednesday at an apartment complex. Police said a man who had been evicted engaged police in a standoff.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A federal judge on Friday ordered the Biden administration to reinstate a drilling lease that has been in dispute for decades on land near the Blackfeet Indian Reservation that is considered sacred to Native American tribes in the U.S. and Canada. The 10-square-mile oil and gas lease in the Badger-Two Medicine area of northwestern Montana was first issued in 1982. It was canceled in 2016 under then-U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, at the request of the Blackfoot tribes and conservation groups. There have been efforts to declare the area a national monument or make it a cultural heritage area, and tribal leaders have bitterly opposed drilling in recent decades. But U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said Jewell lacked the authority to withdraw the lease so many years after it was sold and after several prior studies examined the environmental and other impacts of drilling in the area. He ordered Interior Department officials to reinstate the lease and issue a drilling permit to Solenex LLC, the Louisiana company that holds the lease. Leon issued a similar order in 2018 that was later overturned on appeal. The Badger-Two-Medicine is adjacent to Glacier National Park and is the site of the creation story of the Blackfoot tribes of southern Canada and Montana’s Blackfeet Nation.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A former police captain has prevailed in her lawsuit against Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer and the city, having sued over allegations that the chief failed to promote her in retaliation for filing a discrimination complaint. A federal jury agreed Monday that Schmaderer based his decision, at least in part, to not promote Kathy Belcastro-Gonzalez to deputy chief in 2018 because of a discrimination complaint she made directly to the mayor’s office, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Belcastro-Gonzalez said in her lawsuit that she and another woman who was a lieutenant in the department filed separate complaints against the same male officer in 2010, describing the man as creating a hostile work environment for them because they were women. In 2017, the male officer in question was promoted to one of five chief deputy positions for which Belcastro-Gonzalez had also applied . That same year, Belcastro-Gonzalez went over her police superiors’ heads to complain to the mayor’s office after the earlier complaints about the male officer made through the chain of command went nowhere. During the lawsuit’s trial, two former commanders of the Omaha police internal affairs unit testified to irregularities they described as “very unusual” in the handling of Belcastro-Gonzalez’s and the other woman’s complaints.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Nevada State College won’t get a name change for now, despite a passionate plea from the school’s president, DeRionne Pollard. Pollard told the Board of Regents, the elected body of 13 that oversees the state’s public colleges and universities, that a name change to Nevada State University would have added value to the degree during a quarterly board meeting in Elko on Friday. She said that at schools across the country, the word “college” indicates a community college. The board voted to table the discussion until December so that more information could be gathered about what the name change could mean to state funding formulas including tuition and how staff are paid. Pollard said the name change wouldn’t change the school’s mission and would not compete with the research-driven campuses of the University of Nevada, Reno or UNLV. She said changing the name of the college to Nevada State University would have made a degree more valuable to the students, many of whom are the first in their family to go to college.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: After a successful first year, Oyster Week will return Sunday with a slate of events highlighting the state’s fastest-growing seafood industry. Half of New Hampshire’s 14 oyster farms will take part in events at local breweries and restaurants from Newmarket to Newington showcasing the state’s oyster harvest, which has grown by nearly 800% in value since 2013. “We really want to promote the oyster farmers and help their product,” said Kelsey Meyer, the coordinator for the New Hampshire Shellfish Initiative, which organizes the event. “It’s a local and very sustainable product.” The week will once again culminate with the second annual Seacoast Oysterfest on the deck at Bernie’s Beach Bar on Hampton Beach on Sept. 24. Along with live music, craft beer and cocktails, at least six different oyster farms will be on hand shucking their mollusks until they run out. The week kicks off Sunday with the annual Stone Church Oysterfest in Newmarket, which will pair oysters from Fox Point Oysters, Virgin Oyster Company and Rising Tide Oyster Co. with plenty of live music in the courtyard of the iconic music hall. On Sept. 21, Stoneface Brewing will unveil two new beers that were made with oysters from all the participating farms.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Two bills that expand and promote access to free meals for schoolchildren in middle-income households were signed by Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday as part of a response to food insecurity in New Jersey that was laid bare by the pandemic. Both laws will take effect during the next school year, starting in September 2023. The Working Class Families’ Anti-Hunger Act will provide free school breakfasts and lunches to those students that qualify. The second bill – which Murphy jokingly referred to as the “get the word out” act – builds upon an existing law that requires schools to create public education and promotion campaigns to inform families and communities about the availability of these programs. Both laws work to pick up after a pandemic-era federal program that provided universal free lunches in schools across the nation ended earlier this year. “There’s a stigma to receiving free food and lunch,” Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin said Friday at South Amboy Elementary School, where the announcement was made. “We are taking a big and important step today.” This would mean a saving of $1,260 in school meal costs for families, Coughlin said, saving them about 22% in overall food costs every year. About 26,000 more students would qualify for free meals, he said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Commercial cannabis sales in August grew by about $374,000 over July in data released Wednesday by the state’s Cannabis Control Division. Total sales topped $40 million for the second consecutive month, a high since regulated sales of cannabis opened for adults April 1. Meanwhile, tax data suggests the number of retailers sharing the market is growing much more quickly than the market for adult-use cannabis. Based on data from the state Taxation and Revenue Department, the number of cannabis retailers filing their taxes grew by 15%, while the revenue collected in excise taxes grew by just 2%. Total reported sales back in July topped $40.3 million, which had been the high point since the state opened sales of cannabis for adult use. In August, the total of medical and non-medical cannabis products was reported at $40.7 million, with a 2.1% drop in medical cannabis sales since July. Adult-use sales increased by 3% over the month. The top five cities, who also topped July sales, accounted for 61% of the total market in August: Albuquerque ($14.6 million), Santa Fe ($3.5 million), Las Cruces ($3.3 million), Hobbs ($1.7 million) and Rio Rancho ($1.6 million).\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Water at a public housing complex is OK to drink after earlier tests incorrectly showed the presence of arsenic, city officials said Saturday. A tweeted video showed Mayor Eric Adams and another official drinking glasses of water from a tap at the Jacob Riis Houses. Tests by an outside lab last month had showed higher than allowable levels of arsenic, but on Friday the company said the results were incorrect. Residents of the 1,700-unit complex on the Lower East Side had been told to avoid drinking or cooking with the water beginning last weekend. Adams said Saturday additional tests had confirmed the water was safe. “This morning, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reviewed the final test results for contaminants and found the water to be well within EPA drinking water quality standards,” Adams said in a statement. “We can confidently say the water at Riis Houses is and has been free of any discernible amount of arsenic since the initial tests were initiated in August and meets EPA standards.” Adams’s office said the city would cease working with the lab, Environmental Monitoring and Technologies, and would “pursue all available legal options” and seek to reimburse residents for costs incurred during the past week.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Oral arguments over the constitutionality of the state’s photo voter identification law will be held next month, the North Carolina Supreme Court has decided in another ruling determined along partisan lines. In a 4-3 decision, the justices who are registered as Democrats agreed with attorneys for minority voters who had asked the state’s highest court in July to move the case along more quickly. These voters are plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in December 2018, moments after the Republican-controlled General Assembly approved a photo ID law. That law has never been administered. A panel of judges held a trial, and in September 2021 a majority struck down the law, saying it intentionally discriminated against Black voters. Earlier this year, in a similar 4-3 decision, the justices agreed to hear the case, instead of waiting for the intermediate-level Court of Appeals to deliberate first. The plaintiffs wrote in July that an expedited argument date as soon as September would help state officials and voters “prepare for future elections without the risk of voter confusion and disenfranchisement.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A $4.2 million project to install metal poles with reflective markers along two-lane highways across the state has been put on hold because of worries about how the new poles affected farmers driving large equipment. The posts installed this summer along state highways with shoulders less than 8 feet wide will be removed as the Department of Transportation redesigns the project. State Sen. Janne Myrdahl, who complained about the problems the posts were causing farmers, said the hard metal posts will likely be replaced by flexible ones. “I’ve rarely heard about an issue more than I heard about that in two weeks,” Myrdahl told the Bismarck Tribune. Outgoing Transportation Department Director Bill Panos said in a statement that “it’s not uncommon to pause, reassess and implement design changes when new information becomes available.” It wasn’t immediately clear how the changes would affect the cost of the project that is being paid for with federal money.\n\nOhio\n\nMason: Kings Island has been named the park of the year by Amusement Today. The trade journal’s publisher and editor-in-chief, Gary Slade, selected the park for the Publisher’s Pick Award for Park of the Year because of its “important history and celebration of it, with its 50th anniversary event this summer, its excellence in providing record-breaking rides and its ongoing commitment to quality, maintenance and extreme safety in the amusement and theme-park industry,” Kings Island wrote in an announcement on its website. The local park was also a top finalist in four other categories, coming in second and fourth, respectively, for best new show for its “Fun, Fireworks and Fifty – A Kings Island Nighttime Spectacular” and “Phantom Theater Encore”; second for best kids’ area for Planet Snoopy; fourth for best guest experience; and fifth and sixth for best wooden roller coaster, for the Beast and Mystic Timbers. According to Kings Island, the Beast is one of only two wooden roller coaters to place in the top 10 every year in the more than 20 years of the Golden Ticket Awards from Amusement Today. Kings Island first opened in April 1972, as a new amusement park to replace the old Coney Island, which closed in 1971. It opened with five original themed areas, attractions and a number of rides, 11 of which still remain today.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An inmate found dead in his jail cell over the weekend was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the county alleging that in 2019, he and other inmates were tortured by jail employees who forced them to repeatedly listen to the children’s song “Baby Shark” for hours. John Basco, 48, was found unresponsive in his cell early Sunday morning, Oklahoma County Detention Center officials said in a news release. He was pronounced dead after jail workers began lifesaving efforts, they said. Basco’s death is the 14th this year at the jail, which has faced criticism over inmate deaths, escapes and other incidents. Jail spokesman Mark Opgrande said there were no obvious signs of foul play, and investigators will look into the possibility of a drug overdose. The State Medical Examiner’s Office will determine the cause of death. Basco, who was booked into the jail Thursday on a drug trafficking complaint, was among a group of inmates suing the county in federal court for allegedly being handcuffed to a wall and forced to listen to the song “Baby Shark” on repeat for hours during separate incidents in 2019. A jail lieutenant retired and two detention officers were fired in connection with the incidents, and all three face misdemeanor charges. Basco’s attorney, Cameron Spradling, said he found the circumstances surrounding Basco’s death “disturbing” and called for the preservation of all evidence as the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation probe of it unfolds.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Utility companies said Monday that they have restored power to tens of thousands of customers after shutting down service over the weekend to try to prevent wildfires during high winds, low humidity and hot temperatures. Both Portland General Electric and Pacific Power enacted planned power shutoffs Friday as high, gusting winds and low humidity moved into Oregon, posing extreme fire danger. The utilities were concerned that the winds would cause power lines to break or sag, making sparks that could ignite tinder-dry vegetation. Portland General Electric halted power to about 37,000 customers in 17 service areas starting Friday, and Pacific Power shut down service to 12,000 customers. Power shut-offs due to fire weather, common in California, are new to the Pacific Northwest. The strategy appeared to be successful, with no major new blazes over the weekend. Portland General Electric also fully restored power to all affected customers by Saturday evening, the company said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s highest court on Monday rejected a request from Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf that it immediately take up his challenge to Republican legislation that has bundled a constitutional amendment regarding abortion with four unrelated proposed changes. In turning down Wolf’s request, the justices said he was free to file a legal action before the lower-level Commonwealth Court. The amendments could go before voters as early as May. Wolf filed the legal action in late July, arguing that bundling together the measures in a bill before the politically divided Legislature violates a constitutional rule against passing laws that address multiple, unrelated topics. The proposed abortion amendment would say the state constitution does not guarantee any rights relating to abortion or public funding of abortions. The other amendments would require voter ID, have gubernatorial candidates choose their own running mates, enable lawmakers to cancel regulations without facing a governor’s veto and set up election audits. The two chambers, both with Republican majorities, voted mostly along party lines to advance the package of five amendments. If the General Assembly passes them again in the session that starts in January, they will go before voters as five separate referendums in the May 16 primary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: A nonprofit plans to build an LGBTQ-friendly apartment building for low-income older adults. Four years ago, when Jodi Glass joined the board of Aldersbridge, a nonprofit that runs health care centers for older adults, she had already been working on an issue close to her heart: care of the aging population of LGBTQ people. “Elder LGBTQ folks, they don’t have children as they do now in the younger generation, and their support systems are more lateral,” she said. The idea of a better support system for older members of the queer community started percolating for Glass 15 years ago. When she joined Aldersbridge, formerly known as United Methodist Elder Care, her project gained momentum and direction as she helped form the policies, trainings and procedures to deter discrimination in assisted living and nursing homes. Glass and Aldersbridge CEO Rick Gamache had a bigger, bolder plan in mind: building an income- and age-restricted apartment complex to serve aging members of the LGBTQ community. With a little luck, a little help from the city of East Providence and the right timing, Glass’s vision is set to become a reality as Aldersbridge and the nonprofit housing developer One Neighborhood Developers try to build a 39-unit building as part of the sprawling, 390-unit East Point housing project in East Providence, on the east bank of the Seekonk River. The apartment building will consist of studios, 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom apartments on the 27-acre property. Gamache said their building will be the first of its kind in Rhode Island.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Department of Corrections will offer a new digital tracking service to support addiction therapy for inmates in the state’s main prison for women. Eligible inmates will report their substance use, cravings and triggers on a smart device, and counselors will use the results to inform their therapy sessions. The $159,840 program is funded by the S.C. Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services. Pear Therapeutics Inc. said its program is the first of its kind in a U.S. prison. “We are excited to begin this cutting-edge treatment for our female inmates who suffer from addiction,” SCDC Director Bryan Stirling said in a press release. The Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution will offer the FDA-authorized tracking software as a 90-day treatment intended to increase abstinence and boost participation in cognitive behavioral therapy programs. Safety warnings say the devices are designed to work alongside existing medications and in-person clinical contact. A prison spokesperson, Chrysti Shain, said incarcerated people will still receive the therapy required by federal regulators. When used outside of prisons, the digital therapeutics can incentivize users through nonmonetary rewards and retail gift cards. Behind bars, participants will earn digital badges and rewards including “increased canteen spending, homework passes, increased tablet time, no duties or chores,” according to Shain.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem asked a state ethics board to dismiss a complaint against her without a public hearing and to seal off certain records, documents released Friday by the state’s Government Accountability Board show. The Republican governor, who is widely seen as eyeing a 2024 White House bid, argued in an April motion that the state’s then-attorney general, a fellow Republican who filed the complaint, was out for political retribution and should be removed from the complaint. Noem had pushed former Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg to resign and later for his impeachment over his involvement in a fatal car crash. The attorney general’s complaint was sparked by a report from the Associated Press last year that Noem had taken a hands-on role in a state agency. Shortly after the agency moved to deny her daughter, Kassidy Peters, a real estate appraiser license in July 2020, Noem held a meeting with Peters and key decision-makers in her licensure. Days after the meeting, Peters signed an agreement that gave her another opportunity to meet the licensing requirements. The South Dakota Legislature’s audit committee, controlled by Republicans, unanimously approved a report in May that found Noem’s daughter got preferential treatment.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: The University of Tennessee is hosting a sustainable transportation forum and an electric vehicle summit in November, and registration is now open, officials said. The Drive Electric Tennessee initiative will host the first DriveElectricTN Momentum Summit on Nov. 7 at the Knoxville university’s student union, state officials said in a news release. Then, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the Tennessee Department of Transportation and the Tennessee Clean Fuels Coalition will hold the Tennessee Sustainable Transportation Forum & Expo on Nov. 8-9 at the student union, officials said. Research, technology, planning and policy developments to be shared at the forum will aim to improve transportation efficiency, reduce vehicle emissions and address mobility needs, officials said. Speakers and panelists at the forum will address topics such as alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies, mobility and transportation justice, and the intersections of transportation with public health and emergency response, among other issues, officials said. The DriveElectricTN Momentum Summit will focus on transportation electrification efforts and include breakout sessions on community outreach, electric vehicle infrastructure, policies and programs, and innovation, officials said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State child-abuse investigators are still pursuing families with transgender children and, in at least one case, have expanded the investigation beyond Gov. Greg Abbott’s ordered scrutiny of gender-affirming medical care, a new court filing says. The filing included affidavits from two mothers who, using pseudonyms to protect their families from harassment, described the devastating effect the child-abuse investigations have had on their children. One, 13-year-old Steve, was pulled out of class Aug. 30 and questioned by a state child-abuse investigator, leading to anxiety attacks and missed classes, disrupting his education and upending hard-won improvements to his mental health, mother Carol Koe wrote. “This is extremely upsetting given he has been doing so well in school this year, both socially and in his classes,” she wrote. The other, 14-year-old Whitley, has never received gender-affirming medical care, but the Department of Family and Protective Services has declined to close its investigation after more than six months – and instead added a new requirement, telling mother Samantha Poe on Aug. 25 that investigators wanted proof that Whitley is well-adjusted.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A professional bull rider was killed overnight Monday in what police are calling a domestic violence homicide. Demetrius Omar Lateef Allen, who went by the name Ouncie Mitchell as a pro bull rider, was found shot outside an apartment complex in Salt Lake City, police said in a news release. Allen, 27, was taken to a hospital, where he died. Police arrested LaShawn Denise Bagley, a 21-year-old woman, on suspicion of murder. Bagley and Allen had been in a relationship. Allen had come to Utah to attend the state fair and was staying with Bagley. The two got into a fight at a bar, and Allen went to Bagley’s apartment to get his things, where he was shot, police said. Bagley was booked into jail. No charges had been filed as of Monday afternoon. It was unknown if she had an attorney. Sean Gleason, commissioner of Professional Bull Riders, said in a statement that Allen is the same person who goes by the name Ouncie Mitchell. He said the organization was saddened to find out about the death of a rider who had become a familiar face on the PBR Velocity Tour and competed in the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo. He was from Fresno, Texas, according to his bio on the PBR website. “Ouncie got his name because he was born small,” Gleason said. “He grew up to compete with a huge heart.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The University of Vermont announced Tuesday that it will build 295 apartments in South Burlington over the next four years to alleviate the school’s housing needs. UVM will partner with local developer Snyder-Braverman to build “Catamount Run” in South Burlington’s City Center. Students and employees at UVM can look forward to the first 100 apartments being completed by summer 2024, another 65 units by summer 2025 and another 130 units by 2026. The apartments will hold nearly 500 beds. A tight job market and tighter housing market have some Vermont employers creating employee housing. “This initiative will increase access to housing within close reach of campus, primarily for students in our graduate and professional programs and for the talented employees we are attracting to UVM and the Greater Burlington area,” UVM President Suresh Garimella said in a press release. “The university expects this project to help address the housing shortage that poses real challenges to nearby communities.” Garimella said he had repeatedly heard from students, staff and faculty that they were having to look farther and farther away for housing because of the extremely low supply in the Burlington area.\n\nVirginia\n\nPortsmouth: The Portsmouth Humane Society is letting the dogs out. A new program called Paws Around P’Town pairs shelter dogs with community members for daylong field trips to the beach, a park or even a person’s couch, The Virginian-Pilot reports. Alison Fechino, executive director of the Portsmouth Humane Society, said she hopes the program will emphasize that helping shelter pets is possible for everyone, including those with a busy schedule. “It helps us by, first of all, getting the dogs out of their cages,” Fechino said. “And it gives them the one-on-one time they deserve.” Anyone who’s at least 18 can participate. Individuals can select a dog after reviewing its documented personality traits, or shelter staff can work to find the right fit. One recent Saturday, Suffolk residents Cassie and Hailey Caldwell picked up Morgan, a 5-year-old female pit bull mix, for a day of fun. The mother and daughter cannot have animals where they live, so weekend trips are a great way for them to enjoy time with some furry friends. They said after grabbing a “pup cup” of whipped cream for Morgan, a trip to the beach or a local park was on the itinerary. Amanda McQuarry, the shelter director, said 70 is the maximum number of dogs the facility ideally can support, but 90 is the absolute cut-off. The shelter has reached 90 this summer, but the program has alleviated some of the burden the staff experiences.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A running dispute over LGBTQ-related policies took a dramatic new turn Monday at Seattle Pacific University. A group of students, faculty and staff at the Christian university sued leaders of the board of trustees for refusing to scrap an employment policy barring people in same-sex relationships from full-time jobs at SPU. The 16 plaintiffs say the trustees’ stance – widely opposed on campus – is a breach of their fiduciary duties that threatens to harm SPU’s reputation, worsen enrollment difficulties and possibly jeopardize its future. The lawsuit, filed in Washington State Superior Court, requests that the defendants – including the university’s interim president, Pete Menjares – be removed from their positions. It asks that economic damages, in an amount to be determined at a jury trial, be paid to anyone harmed by the LGBTQ hiring policy. “This case is about six men who act as if they, and the educational institution they are charged to protect, are above the law,” the lawsuit says. “While these men are powerful, they are not above the law… They must be held to account for their illegal and reckless conduct.” The Free Methodist Church, a denomination whose teachings do not recognize same-sex marriage, founded SPU in 1891.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Lawmakers were scheduled to convene at the state Capitol outside of their regular session Monday to discuss putting millions of dollars into road maintenance and creating a new industrial plant program within the state economic development office. The new special session is set to begin more than a month after the Republican supermajority failed to reach consensus on a sweeping bill that would have barred access to abortions in most circumstances. A version of the bill passed the House, but it stalled after the Senate adopted its own version with amendments, one of which removed criminal penalties for physicians who perform illegal abortions. Instead, delegates asked for a conference committee to iron out differences. Republican Gov. Jim Justice put out a call Saturday for another special session beginning at 1:30 p.m. Monday, while lawmakers are gathered in Charleston for previously scheduled September interim committee meetings. He asked lawmakers to consider legislation that would establish a “Certified Industrial Business Expansion Development Program” within the Department of Economic Development. It would be charged with encouraging the development and construction of high-impact industrial plants “in certain circumstances where the availability of electricity generated from renewable sources is demonstrated to be necessary,” according to Justice.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican challenger Tim Michels announced Monday that they have agreed to debate just one time ahead of the Nov. 8 election. The debate will be Oct. 14, hosted by the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association, held in Madison and broadcast statewide. Both campaigns put out a joint statement announcing the agreement. The debate will include journalists from across the state, according to the statement. “There are plenty of differences between the two candidates, but we agree that voters deserve this opportunity to hear directly from each candidate,” Evers’ campaign manager, Cassi Fenili, and Michels’ campaign manager, Patrick McNulty, said in the joint statement. “This will be the only debate between the candidates before the November election.” In 2018, Evers debated then-Gov. Scott Walker twice in October. Michels, co-owner of construction company Michels Corp., participated in two televised debates with his Republican challengers this summer. One was in a traditional debate format, and the other was a town hall where questions came from people in the audience. Michels also did a radio debate with former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and state Rep. Timothy Ramthun.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A legislative committee is considering a controversial bill that would allow public inspection of some personnel files in K-12 schools. The Joint Education Committee is considering that more drastic step and another piece of legislation as lawmakers try to address harassment and bullying allegations against teachers, WyoFile.com reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}]}

His victory heralds a political about-face for Latin America’s largest country, after four years of Jair Bolsonaro’s far-right administration.\n\nThe 76-year-old politician’s win represents the return of the left into power in Brazil, and concludes a triumphant personal comeback for Lula da Silva, after a series of corruption allegations lead to his imprisonment for 580 days. The sentences were later annulled by the Supreme Court, clearing his path to run for reelection.\n\n“They tried to bury me alive and I’m here,” he said in a jubilant speech to supporters and journalists on Sunday evening, describing the win as his political “resurrection.”\n\n“Starting on January 1, 2023, I will govern for the 215 million Brazilians, not just the ones who voted for me. There are not two Brazils. We are one country, one people, one great nation,” Lula da Silva also said.\n\nHe will take the reins of a country plagued by gross inequality that is still struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Approximately 9.6 million people fell under the poverty line between 2019 and 2021, and literacy and school attendance rates have fallen. He will also be faced with a deeply fractured nation and urgent environmental issues, including rampant deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nThis will be his third term, after previously governing Brazil for two consecutive terms between 2003 and 2010.\n\nSupporters of Lula da Silva react as they wait for results at Paulista Avenue, Sao Paulo, Brazil, October 30, 2022. Amanda Perobelli/Reuters\n\nThe latest in a leftist wave\n\nThe former leader’s victory on Sunday was the latest in a political wave across Latin America, with wins by left-leaning politicians in Argentina, Colombia and Chile. But Lula da Silva – a former union leader with a blue-collar background – has sought to reassure moderates throughout his campaign.\n\nHe has built a broad alliance including several politicians from the center and center-right, including historical opponents from the PSDB, Brazil’s Social Democrat Party. Among these politicians is his vice-president, former São Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin, who has been cited by the Lula camp as a guarantee of moderation in his administration.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Lula da Silva has been reluctant to show his cards when it came to outlining an economic strategy – a tendency that earned sharp criticism from his competitors. “Who is the other candidate’s economy minister? There isn’t one, he doesn’t say. What will be his political and economic route? More state? Less state? We don’t know…,” said Bolsonaro during a live transmission on YouTube on October 22.\n\nLula da Silva has said that he would push Congress to approve a tax reform which would exempt low-earners from paying income tax. And his campaign received a boost from centrist former presidential candidate Simone Tebet, who came third in the first round earlier this month and gave Lula da Silva her support in the run-off. Known for her ties with Brazil’s agricultural industry, Tebet said in an October 7 press conference that Lula da Silva and his economic team had “received and incorporated all the suggestions from our program to his government’s program.”\n\nHe has also received the support of several renowned economists highly regarded by investors, including Arminio Fraga, a former president of the Brazilian Central Bank.\n\nHealing a divided country\n\nLula da Silva received more than 60 million votes, the most in Brazilian history, breaking his own record from 2006.\n\nBut despite the huge turnout from his supporters, his victory was by a narrow margin – Lula da Silva won 50.90% of the vote and Bolsonaro received 49.10%, according to Brazil’s electoral authority.\n\nHis biggest challenge now may be unifying a politically fractured country.\n\nHours after the results were announced, Bolsonaro had yet to concede defeat or make any public statement. Meanwhile, videos on social media showed his supporters had blocked highways in two states to protest against Lula da Silva’s victory.\n\n“We will only leave once the army takes over the country,” one unidentified Bolsonaro supporter said in a video taken in the southern state of Santa Catarina.\n\nLula da Silva will need to pursue dialogue and rebuild relationships, said Carlos Melo, a political scientist at Insper, a university in São Paulo. “The president can be an important instrument for this as long as he is not only concerned in addressing his base of voters,” he said.\n\nSupporters of Lula da Silva react as they gather on the day of the Brazilian presidential election run-off, in Brasilia, Brazil October 30, 2022. Diego Vara/Reuters\n\nWith more than 58 million votes cast for his rival Bolsonaro – who had been endorsed by former US President Donald Trump – Lula da Silva will have to form “pragmatic alliances” with parts of the center and the right that bought into his predecessor’s politics, adds Thiago Amparo, professor of law and human rights at FGV business school in São Paulo.\n\nAt the same time, he will have to deliver to match supporters’ expectations, Amparo added. “Many voters went to the ballot expecting that, not just to get rid of Bolsonaro, but with memories of better economic times during Lula’s previous governments.”\n\nMany will be watching for potential change to the 2017 Labor Reform Act, which subjected more workers’ rights and benefits to negotiation with employers, and made union contributions optional. Lula da Silva had said previously that he would revoke the act but recently changed the verb to “review” following criticisms from the private sector.\n\nHe may find that enacting his agenda is an uphill battle, Amparo warns, especially with a hostile Congress. Seats that were from the traditional right are now occupied by the far right, who are not open to negotiation and not easy to deal with, underlines Amparo.\n\nIn the latest elections, Bolsonaro’s Liberal Party increased its representatives in the lower house from 76 to 99, while in the Senate it doubled from seven members to 14. Lula da Silva’s Workers’ Party has also increased its number of deputies from 56 to 68 and senators from seven to eight – but overall, conservative-leaning politicians will dominate the next legislature.\n\nThat friction will require some compromises, points out Camila Rocha, a political scientist at the Cebrap think tank. “[Bolsonaro’s] Liberal Party will have the highest number of representatives and important allies and will make real opposition to the government, [Lula da Silva’s] Worker’s Party will have to sow a coalition with [traditional rightwing party] União Brasil in order to govern, which means the negotiation of ministries and key positions,” Rocha told to CNN.\n\nA supporter of Lula da Silva reacts while gathering with fellow supporters on the day of the Brazilian presidential election run-off, in Brasilia, Brazil October 30, 2022. Diego Vara/Reuters\n\nThe Amazon and climate leadership\n\nEnvironmentalists meanwhile will be watching Lula da Silva’s administration closely, as it assumes governance not only over the Brazilian nation but over the planet’s largest forest reserves.\n\nWith destruction of the vast Amazon rainforest reaching record levels under Bolsonaro’s presidency, Lula da Silva has repeatedly said during his campaign that he would seek to curb deforestation. He has argued that protecting the forest could produce some profit, citing the beauty and pharmaceutical industries as potential beneficiaries of biodiversity.\n\nIn an interview with foreign press in August, Lula da Silva called for “a new world governance” to address climate change and stressed that Brazil should take a central role in that governance, given its natural resources.\n\nAccording to the head of Lula da Silva’s government plan, Aloizio Mercadante, another tactic will be to create a group including Brazil, Indonesia and Congo ahead of the UN-led November 2022 Conference of Parties. The group would aim to pressure richer countries to finance the protection of forests as well as outlining strategies for the global carbon market.\n\nSeveral experts told CNN they believed his stance on environment and the climate issue could represent a fresh start in Brazil’s international relations.\n\nFor Amparo, environmental protection could indeed be springboard for Brazil’s global leadership, a major shift after Bolsonaro warned the world away from intervening in the destruction of the Amazon. “Lula would try to reposition, almost like a rebranding, Brazil in the international arena as a power to be taken into account,” he said.\n\n“We can expect a government that goes back to talking to the world, especially with a new stance in the environmental area,” said Melo, the Insper researcher.", "authors": ["Camilo Rocha"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}]}

But less well-known is a looming high-stakes clash between one of America’s oldest unions and the world’s biggest package courier.\n\nContract negotiations are set to begin in the spring between UPS and the Teamsters Union ahead of their current contract’s expiration at the end of July, 2023. Already, before the talks have even started, labor experts are predicting that the drivers and package handlers will go on strike.\n\n“The question is how long it will be,” said Todd Vachon, professor of Labor Relations at Rutgers. “The union’s president ran and won on taking a more militant approach. Even if they’re very close [to a deal], the rank and file will be hungry to take on the company.”\n\nIf that happens, a strike at UPS would affect nearly every household in the country. An estimated 6% of the nation’s gross domestic product is moved in UPS trucks every year. The explosive growth of online retail has made the company and its drivers more crucial than ever to the nation’s struggling supply chain. Beyond the company’s home deliveries, it also delivers many of the goods found in stores, factories and offices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Starbucks employees at New York store vote to unionize (2021) 02:06 - Source: CNNBusiness\n\nAbout 350,000 Teamsters work at UPS as drivers and package sorters out of a global workforce of 534,000 permanent employees. And that’s growing fast — the company has added some 72,000 Teamster-represented jobs since the start of the pandemic.\n\nWhile there are competing services at FedEx (FDX), the US Postal Service and Amazon’s own delivery service, none of them have the capacity to handle more than a small fraction of the 21.5 million US packages that UPS moves daily.\n\n“We want a contract that provides wins for our employees and that provides UPS the flexibility to stay competitive in a rapidly changing industry,” the company said in a statement this month. “UPS and the Teamsters have worked cooperatively for almost 100 years to meet the needs of UPS employees, customers, and the communities where we live and work. We believe we’ll continue to find common ground with the Teamsters and reach an agreement that’s good for everyone involved.”\n\nThe union has not gone on strike against UPS since a nearly two-week protest in 1997. If the union does go on strike, it would be the largest strike against a single business in nation’s history.\n\nAnger over current contract\n\nThere are certainly signs of strain in relations between the company and the union — both its leadership and its rank-and-file members.\n\nA majority of members voted against ratifying the current contract in 2018, only to see the previous Teamster leadership, led by then-President James Hoffa, put it in place because not enough of the membership participated in the ratification vote to trigger a strike.\n\nThe union’s new president, Sean O’Brien, won his office earlier this year by making the UPS contract a central focus of his campaign. He has vowed to make UPS pay Teamster members far more this time and he often talks about a $300 million strike fund the union has accumulated to pay members in case they go on strike.\n\n“Do our members wake up every day wanting a strike. I’d say no. But are they fed up? Yes they’re fed up,” O’Brien told CNN Business last week. “Whether or not there is a strike, that’s totally up to the company. We’re going to utilize as much leverage as we can to get our members the contract they deserve.”\n\nUPS said the average pay for its delivery drivers is $95,000 a year, with benefits such as a traditional pension plan, worth an additional $50,000 a year. UPS’ semi-tractor drivers are paid even more. That’s far higher than most wages at FedEx and Amazon, where many drivers work for small independent contractors.\n\nThe current contract expires at 12:01 am August 1. O’Brien vows the union will not grant any kind of contract extension past that deadline.\n\nAnd he added that on top of improved pay and benefits, the union will demand better working conditions, including adding air conditioning in the panel trucks used for UPS deliveries which the union says poses a health risk for drivers.\n\n“It’s not a heavy lift for the company to install air conditioning,” he said. “There’s a lot of heat stroke going on.”\n\nRecord profits at UPS\n\nThe company often speaks about how much it values its Teamster-represented workforce.\n\nAnd in one important way – employment numbers – UPS is one of the best friends labor has in the ranks of US corporate management, despite the obvious tensions. UPS is one of the few unionized employers that is significantly adding payrolls, and to union membership. At other businesses, union membership numbers have been steadily declining or decades.\n\nThe increase in Teamsters jobs at UPS has come from the steady growth in online purchases, especially during the pandemic-era surge. Last year, it took only nine months to report what was already a record profit for a full year. UPS ended 2021 with operating income up 50% to $13.1 billion. In the first half of this year, earnings rose another 10% compared with a year ago.\n\n“Everyone keeps getting richer except for our members,” said O’Brien.\n\nUPS CEO Carol Tome, who started that job just as the pandemic began, says that the company’s union contract is a competitive advantage at a time of worker shortages.\n\nShe also is trying to assure both investors and UPS customers that the company will be prepared in case the union does go on strike. She declined to comment on what those preparations are.\n\n“Our goal with the Teamsters is win-win-win,” she told investors in July. But she added that UPS is “building contingency plans.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2021/11/17/uaw-john-deere-strike-2021-vote-results-contract-end/8619898002/", "title": "John Deere workers approve new contract proposal; UAW ends strike", "text": "A five-week strike of Deere & Co. ended Wednesday as United Auto Workers members approved a new six-year contract with the agricultural and construction equipment maker and prepared to report for evening shifts.\n\nAbout 61% of voters approved the agreement, which boosts hourly wages by 10% and increases retirement benefits.

After that vote, company officials said they would not offer any further wage or benefit increases.\n\nSome union members said in advance of Wednesday's vote that they believed co-workers who had previously opposed the contract would change their minds, facing a winter of picketing duty with only $275 a week in strike pay from the union.\n\nMore:Head of largest U.S. labor group tells striking John Deere workers: 'The nation is watching'\n\nThe number of workers approving the contract Wednesday increased from the Nov. 2 tally at all of the five Iowa Deere plants, including the Des Moines Works in Ankeny.

Union leaders said they expect the changes to make performance targets more attainable for employees, boosting the size of weekly paychecks.\n\nUAW members told the Des Moines Register that ratification meetings across Iowa on Wednesday were more subdued than those before the first two votes, when some employees admonished union leaders for failing to extract more concessions from the company.\n\nMore:UAW members weigh consequences as they consider whether to reject John Deere's third offer\n\nIn Dubuque, Local 94 President Chad Kaiser told members that Deere might shift production to nonunion factories or hire strikebreakers if employees didn't approve the latest proposal.

The group instead assigned workers in alphabetical order to hour-long voting blocs throughout the day.\n\nAt the hall, members said, leaders met individually with any concerned voters to answer questions about the contract. Gone were the heated speeches against the union and the contract that were a hallmark of the first two ratification meeting, held in large, rented venues.\n\nIn Ankeny, both supporters and opponents spoke out during a meeting Wednesday. In a video provided to the Register, one member told UAW leaders that the latest changes weren't enough to sway him.\n\n\"Do you think it's a good plan for you?\" the man asked, addressing the audience.\n\n\"No,\" some members shouted back.\n\nAbe Elam, the sergeant-at-arms at Local 74 in Ottumwa, told workers that the contract was a step in the right direction. He said he didn't believe the union could win greater wage increases or better benefits even if workers stayed out for months.\n\n\"This is it,\" he said. \"We've pushed them to that line, and they're not going to give anything else.\"\n\nBig profits; big concessions\n\nThe strike began as Deere celebrated the prospect of record profits, with executives projecting in August that the company would earn $5.7 billion to $5.9 billion for the fiscal year that ended Nov. 1 — a 62% bump over 2013 earnings, the company's previous record year.\n\nExecutives will reveal whether they actually hit those targets Nov. 24, when they host an investor call.\n\nMay earned $15.6 million in 2020, a 160% increase over his 2019 pay.

Employees also said they were willing to hold out for more money because they had worked through the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and because managers were struggling to hire new workers.\n\nMore:Union leaders say members lost work at John Deere plant in solidarity with striking UAW\n\nIn the first contract introduced in early October, Deere offered 5% and 6% pay increases and reintroduced quarterly cost-of-living adjustments, a feature of previous Deere-UAW contracts that the company had eliminated in 2015. Deere also offered workers $3,500 bonuses if they ratified the contract.\n\nThe company proposed a boost to the pension program that would have given a 25-year employee about $100 extra each month in retirement. Deere also offered lump-sum payments of $20,000 to $50,000 for workers when they retire, depending on their length of service. At the same time, the company proposed to eliminate the pension program for workers hired after Nov. 1.\n\nAfter members rejected that contract, Deere upped its offer. Employees would get 10% pay bumps and ratification bonuses of $8,500. The company also promised to preserve the pension program for future workers and boost payments to retiring employees, giving a 25-year worker about $250 extra every month.\n\nThe company threw in a second lump-sum payment for those workers: $2,000 for each year at the company as of 2021. Union leaders told employees that the money is supposed to pay for health insurance until they qualify for Medicare.\n\nThe third contract offer retained those terms, adding only the modified production incentives. With its approval Wednesday, workers on the lowest end of the pay grade, such as those in foundry support, will see an hourly wage increase to $22.13 from $20.12. The skilled trades positions at the top of the pay grade, like electricians, will see hourly boosts to $33.05 from $30.04.\n\nMembers were split on what to do\n\nOutside of the Palace Theatre at Adventureland Park, where Des Moines Works employees voted Wednesday, members were divided on whether to extend the strike.\n\nChuck Smith, a welder, declined to say which way he voted. But he told the Register that the company could afford to pay rank-and-file workers better, even though a Deere spokesperson said the company had \"economically exhausted\" its offers.\n\nMore:Timeline shows key dates in the John Deere strike\n\nSmith pointed out that even in 2015, a down year by Deere's standards, the company earned a profit of $1.9 billion.\n\n\"Look at what they're paying executives,\" he said. \"Look at what they're giving their CEO. It's corporate greed.\"\n\nBut Bob Loney, a maintenance welder, warned that employees would regret a longer strike. Loney has been with the company since before October 1997, when the union and Deere agreed to cut benefits and wages for new hires. That means he is in line for a better retirement plan than most employees at Des Moines Works.\n\n\"They're going to push too hard,\" Loney said of workers. \"And Deere's going to push back harder.\"\n\nMore:Polk County judge rejects Deere's request for injunction against Ankeny plant strikers\n\nDustin Garland, a machinist on the line that manufactures cotton pickers, voted for the contract because he was pleased that Deere preserved the health insurance program.\n\nGarland picked up a part-time job at Amazon.com's Bondurant fulfillment center during the strike, a job he doesn't like as much as his work at Deere.\n\nForklift driver Randy Oldham, meanwhile, said he approved the contract Wednesday as he thought about the misery of strike duty in December and January.\n\n\"I'm an old man,\" he said. \"And I don't want to be picketing in the cold.\"\n\nTyler Jett covers jobs and the economy for the Des Moines Register.

They began their meeting Wednesday morning with the clock ticking down to a strike that had been set to start at 12:01 am ET on Friday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called in personally to talk to negotiators around 9 pm ET Wednesday, according to a person familiar with negotiations. Biden stressed that catastrophic harm could come to families, businesses and communities if the rail system shut down. Sources within the unions were giving Biden’s call credit for helping to get the deal completed without a strike.\n\n“We’re very proud of what was accomplished,” said Jeremy Ferguson, president of the conductors union and one of the leaders involved in the marathon session. He thanked Biden and Labor Department officials involved in the talks for the deal.\n\n“Everybody pulled together to make sure that we could get our members what they deserved,” he said.\n\n“This is the quality of life issue we have been trying to get for our members since bargaining started,” said Dennis Pierce, president of the engineers’ union and the other union official involved in the talks.\n\nPierce and Ferguson met with Biden at the White House later Thursday morning. At a Rose Garden appearance, Biden thanked them, the railroads’ negotiators and administration officials who participated in the talks.\n\n“You’ve reached an agreement that will keep our critical rail system working and avoid disruptions of our economy,” Biden said. “I’m grateful. This agreement is validation…of what I’ve always believed: Unions and management can work together…for the benefit of everyone.”\n\nThe deal needs to be ratified by union members before it can go into effect and totally end the threat of a strike. But it’s good news for a wide range of businesses that depend upon the freight railroads to continue to operate, and for the wider US economy. About 30% of the nation’s freight moves by rail.\n\nA win for workers, railroads and the economy\n\nThe deal gives the union members an immediate 14% raise with back pay dating back to 2020, and raises totaling 24% during the five-year life of the contract, that runs from 2020 through 2024. It also gives them cash bonuses of $1,000 a year. All told, the backpay and earlier bonuses will give union members an average of an $11,000 payment per person once the deal is ratified.\n\nFew other details of the deal have so far been made public. But the statement from Biden indicated that the major sticking point – involving work rules and scheduling issues – that had brought the country within a day of its first national rail strike in 30 years had been addressed in the unions’ favor.\n\n“It is a win for tens of thousands of rail workers who worked tirelessly through the pandemic to ensure that America’s families and communities got deliveries of what have kept us going during these difficult years,” said Biden in a statement. “These rail workers will get better pay, improved working conditions, and peace of mind around their health care costs: all hard-earned.”\n\nThe dispute was about staffing shortages and scheduling rules that union leaders said had brought their membership to a breaking point. The unions say the railroads have been requiring their members to be “on call” and ready to report to work on short notice as often as seven days a week. Leadership of the two unions had said their members would not accept a contract without changes to those work rules.\n\nThe union said the deal provides one additional paid day off a year as well a protections against discipline if they need time off to attend to routine and preventative medical care, as well as exemptions from attendance policies for hospitalizations and surgical procedures. Railroad actions against workers who were unable to be on call or report to work due to medical issues had stoked anger among union members.\n\nBiden described the deal as “also a victory for railway companies who will be able to retain and recruit more workers for an industry that will continue to be part of the backbone of the American economy for decades to come.”\n\nIt is an important victory for Biden, who faced nothing but bad choices if a deal had not been reached. Backing Congressional action sought by the business community to impose a contract on workers would have angered his supporters among the unions. Letting the work stoppage play out risked massive economic consequences just ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nHow we got here\n\nRailroad workers are governed by a different labor law than most workers, one that limits their freedom to strike and allows for more governmental intervention. In July, Biden issued an order that prevented a strike at that time and created a panel, known as a Presidential Emergency Board, to try to find a solution to the dispute.\n\nIt also imposed a 60-day cooling off period during which the unions could not strike and management could not lock out workers. That cooling off period was due to end early Friday.\n\nBiden could not have ordered the railroads to keep operating once the cooling off period ended Friday. Only Congress could have acted to get the unions back to work if a strike had begun.\n\nWith a wide range of business groups calling on Congress to act, Republicans had prepared legislation that would have given railroad management the deal they wanted. But Democrats were opposed to taking such action.\n\nA union source said that Democrats’ refusal to side with management had been a key to the talks.\n\n“Senate leaderership not acting gave space for these negotiations,” said the union source. He said that Walsh had “hung in” with the union during the negotiations.\n\n“it was a slog yesterday,” he said, with lots of back and forth.\n\n“Our people were not going to give up,” said the source. “Our people would have gone on strike” if a deal was not reached by the Friday deadline.\n\nRank and file ratification still needed\n\nThe agreement does not mean the threat of a strike has gone away entirely. The deal needs to be ratified by rank-and-file union members.\n\nSome union members appeared to criticize the deal on social media, and the unions’ leadership conceded that some rank-and-file members may be unsatisfied with the deal.\n\n“We got a little bit of paid time off, but we’ll live to fight another day. You know, that’s part of bargaining,” Michael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, told CNN. “When the members look at what is in the contract, I think they’re going to see that the wages and extra day of paid leave is going to be beneficial to them. …Sometimes you can’t accomplish everything, so you come back next time.”\n\nAnother union leader was confident the tentative deal would be accepted.\n\n“I think we got everything we could,” Dennis Pierce, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen told CNN. “And I think once our membership understands where we sit and what’s in it, I think it’ll ratify.”\n\nRecently, the members of some unions have balked at approving deals, even when recommended by their union’s leadership.\n\nAbout 10,000 members of the United Auto Workers union at farm equipment maker John Deere went on strike last fall after rejecting a lucrative tentative agreement, and then stayed on strike after rejecting a subsequent deal. They finally returned to work after five weeks.\n\nStriking workers at cereal maker Kellogg (K) also rejected a tentative deal and decided to stay on strike in December before finally agreeing to deal weeks later. And only 50.3% of film production workers voted in favor of a deal that achieved virtually all bargaining goals of their union, averting a strike by 63,000 technicians, artisans and craftspeople which could have brought production of movies, television and streaming shows to a halt.\n\nThe Association of American Railroads also praised the deal and thanked the Biden administration, as well as the unions themselves, for their role in reaching an agreement.\n\nThe pay raises and bonuses had been recommended by a presidential panel charged with trying to find a solution to the impasse in negotiations at that time.\n\nThose terms were lucrative enough for most of the rail unions to agree to tentative deals in recent weeks, the engineers and conductors, who were faced with work and scheduling rules that did not apply to others, refused to sign on without relief on the scheduling issue.\n\nShares of the major freight railroads were mixed. Union Pacific (UNP) and CSX (CSX) were a bit higher, while Norfolk Southern (NSC) shares fell. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), which owns the fourth national freight railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, was narrowly lower.\n\nDisruptions had already started\n\nThe threat of the strike had already started to disrupt operations. Amtrak, whose 22,000-mile system is almost exclusively over freight rail lines outside of the Northeast Corridor, had already canceled all long-distance trains. Amtrak said it “is working to quickly restore canceled trains and reaching out to impacted customers to accommodate on first available departures.” It said it will provide update soon as information becomes available.\n\nThe railroads had already stopped accepting shipments of hazardous and security-related materials a week ago. And Wednesday some of the railroads had stopped accepting shipments of crops from the agricultural industry.\n\nCustomers of the railroads who had been braced to major problems expressed relief that a strike had been avoided.\n\n“This is fantastic news for the economy,” said Eric Hoplin, CEO of the National Association of Wholesale Distributors, in an appearance on CNN’s New Day Thursday. “My phone has been ringing off the hook over the last 48 hours, talking to distribution leaders from across the country, who were spelling out what some of the catastrophic consequences could have been to America’s supply chain and the economy.”\n\nThe US economy avoided several economic blows, including a potential spike in gasoline prices that could have undone the 26% decline in prices at the pump over the last three months. Although refineries get most of their oil through pipelines and ship out most of the gasoline they produce the same way, they still needed railroad tank cars to deliver other materials to refine gasoline and to take away waste products.\n\nHigher prices for food and cars and a shortage of consumer goods well into the holiday shopping season were likely if there had been a prolonged strike, according to business leaders and economists.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich Jeremy Diamond", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich", "Jeremy Diamond"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/01/12/new-york-city-nurse-strike-ends-deal/11038376002/", "title": "New York City nurse strike ends: Deal reached; workers at hospitals", "text": "After three days on strike, nurses returned to work at two major New York City hospitals after reaching a tentative contract agreement with thousands of striking nurses, ending this week's walkout, officials announced Thursday.\n\nIn a dispute over pay and chronic understaffing, more than 7,000 nurses at two privately owned nonprofit hospitals walked out Monday after talks to avert a strike failed over the weekend.

But thanks to a nearly century-old law that regulates labor relations only when it comes to railroads and airlines, what otherwise would be strictly an economic issue became a political one.\n\nThe Railway Labor Act was passed in 1926 as one of the very first labor laws in the nation. At that point most of the railroads already had been unionized, some all the way back to the mid-19th century. The structure was therefore set up to regulate labor negotiations between unions and management, rather than oversee organizing campaigns for new unions and additional members.\n\nBecause of the law, the House was able to vote Wednesday to impose unpopular contracts on four rail unions whose members have already rejected the terms, followed by a vote by the Senate vote late Thursday that did the same.\n\nThe measure now goes to President Joe Biden, who has said he will sign it. When he does, there will no longer be a chance of a Dec. 9 strike that would have shut down about 30% of the nation’s freight shipments. A prolonged strike would have caused shortage of a wide range of items, from food to gasoline to automobiles, and likely resulted in a spike in prices.\n\nA group of steam locomotives pour steam and smoke into the air in St. Paul, Minnesota in this file photo from 1925. The Railway Labor Act, passed in 1926, is the reason Congress could intervene this week to block a strike by freight railroad unions. Minnesota Historical Society/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe House also passed a law that would give the unions paid sick days, addressing the issue they said led members to reject the deals. But the efforts to pass that same measure in the Senate fell short, even though 52 of 95 senators voted for it. The measure needed 60 votes to pass the senate.\n\nUnder the Railway Labor Act, the federal agency that oversees railroad and airline labor relations is the National Mediation Board, which tries to bring the two sides together, and it set up a series of limits and cooling off periods during which unions can not strike and management can not lock out the workers. And if all those efforts fail, then Congress can step in and impose a contract under which both sides will have to operate.\n\nIn negotiations at other businesses, the workers’ ability to strike is the most powerful option unions have to achieve their goals at the bargaining table. And even the railroads admit that the law makes strikes extremely unlikely.\n\n“The goal of the Railway Labor Act was to reduce the likelihood of a work stoppage,” said Ian Jefferies, the CEO of the Association of American Railroads, the trade group that represents the railroads. “And it’s been remarkably effective in doing that.”\n\nAs much as management likes the law and its limits on strikes, the unions hate it. They say it would be far easier to reach a deal that their members can support if they had the leverage of a possible strike. And they say that management, when weighing the cost of that possible strike, would realize that they have the resources needed to meet those demands without an actual work stoppage.\n\nThe four major railroads — Union Pacific (UNP), CSX (CSX), Norfolk Southern (NSC) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA)’s Burlington Northern Santa Fe — reported some form of record profits in 2021. Wall Street analysts expect even better profits in 2022, at least for the three railroads they cover.\n\nIf they were covered by the National Labor Relations Act, the labor law that oversees worker-management relations at most of the nation’s businesses, the unions could threaten to go on strike. But under the Railway Labor Act, management can fall back on hopes that Congress will give them the deal it wants.\n\n“This action prevents us from reaching the end of our process, takes away the strength and ability that we have to force bargaining or force the railroads to…do the right thing,” said Michael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, one of the four unions whose members voted against the tentative agreements reached last fall that Congress is now poised to impose on members.\n\nThe railroads deny they wanted this to end up with Congress, and they preferred to reach a deal with the unions that could be ratified by membership.\n\n“I don’t think it’s anyone’s goal to get Congress involved, but Congress has shown a willingness historically to intervene if necessary,” said AAR’s Jefferies.\n\nBut Biden, in his statement calling on Congress to act to impose the rejected tentative agreements on the rail workers to keep them on the job, seemed to acknowledge that there was no chance that rail management would reach a deal with the unions.\n\n“During the ratification votes, the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, and Transportation have been in regular touch with labor leaders and management,” he said. “They believe that there is no path to resolve the dispute at the bargaining table.”\n\nThe railroads refused to accept union demands for paid sick days. Jefferies also said the railroads would only agree to make changes in sick day rules if it was within the “framework” of the proposal put forth by a presidential panel this summer that was charged with trying to find a compromise agreement.\n\nThat means for the unions to get the sick pay they wanted, they’d have to give up some other pay or benefit in order to keep the overall economics of the package unchanged. The likelihood that Congress will impose a deal along the lines of the presidential panel’s recommendations, or the tentative agreements, means that management has little incentive to agree to union demands.\n\nThe decision to urge Congress to take action was politically difficult for Biden, who is often referred to as the most pro-union president in recent history. When he served in the Senate, Biden voted against an earlier effort to impose a contract on the rail unions to keep them on the job.\n\n“As a proud pro-labor President, I am reluctant to override the ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the agreement,” he said in his statement Monday night calling for Congressional action.\n\nBut he said he couldn’t ignore the economic upheaval that a rail strike could cause, and that he had no choice but to turn to Congress and the powers it has.\n\n“In this case – where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families – I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal,” he said.\n\nAnd he said the deals, while they weren’t everything the unions wanted, were good ones for the unions, with the biggest pay increases in more than 50 years, and some improvements in other contract terms.\n\n“On the day that it was announced, labor leaders, business leaders, and elected officials all hailed it as a fair resolution of the dispute between the hard-working men and women of the rail freight unions and the companies in that industry,” Biden said. “The agreement was reached in good faith by both sides.”\n\nBut the unions and their allies say that it’s wrong to force members to accept a deal they rejected because it denies the workers the basic sick days they are demanding.\n\n“During the first three quarters of this year, the rail industry made a record-breaking $21.2 billion in profits,” said a group of a dozen Democratic senators, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders. “Guaranteeing seven paid sick days to rail workers would only cost the industry $321 million a year – less than 2 percent of their total profits. Please do not tell us that the rail industry cannot afford to guarantee paid sick days to their workers.”\n\nBut only 4 of the 12 senators who issued the statement - Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - voted against imposing the unpopular contracts. The other eight who signed onto the statement - Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Alex Padilla of California, Tina Smith of Minnesota and Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island - all joined in the 80-15 vote in favor of imposing the contracts to block the strike.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/business/rail-strike-threat-recedes/index.html", "title": "Rail unions decry Biden's call for Congress to block strike ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nPresident Joe Biden was in the unusual position Tuesday of being praised by business interests and attacked by his normal allies in the labor movement after calling for Congress to move immediately to block a strike by more than 100,000 union members at the nation’s freight railroads set for the end of next week.\n\nThe move was a serious setback for the unions, who say they needed the right to strike in order to get railroad management to negotiate over their major demand to give workers sick days that are not in the current contracts. They say the railroads, many of which reported record profits last year, are enjoying even stronger profits this year and can afford to meet the union’s demands.\n\nBiden said he is sympathetic to the union’s demand, but he said a rail strike would cause too much economic damage and must be avoided.\n\n“I share workers’ concern about the inability to take leave to recover from illness or care for a sick family member,” he said in his statement. “No one should have to choose between their job and their health – or the health of their children.”\n\nHe said that the tentative deals that were rejected by rank-and-file members of the unions were good deals for the workers, even in the face of those concerns. They include 24% wage increases over the four-year life of the deals, the biggest pay increases won by the unions in more than 50 years. Biden pointed out that union leadership had agreed to the tentative deals in September when they were negotiated and called them good deals for the rank-and-file members.\n\nUnion anger at deals, and at Biden\n\nBut the membership of four of the unions rejected the tentative deals. The other eight unions are prepared to honor their picket lines and go on strike as well without a deal or Congressional action, and Biden’s voiced sympathy for the demands about sick time didn’t satisfy some of the union leaders Tuesday.\n\n“It is not enough to ‘share workers’ concerns,’” said a statement from the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division, which represents about 23,000 track maintenance workers, making it the third largest rail union. “A call to Congress to act immediately to pass legislation that adopts tentative agreements that exclude paid sick leave ignores the railroad workers’ concerns.”\n\nOther union officials also were critical of Biden’s move to impose the unpopular contracts. Asked by CNN if he felt Biden had let down unions and their members, Michael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, replied, “Yes, to some extent.”\n\n“We’re trying to address the issue here of sick time. It’s very important,” Baldwin told CNN Tuesday. “This action prevents us from reaching the end of our process, takes away the strength and ability that we have to force bargaining or force the railroads to…do the right thing.”\n\nBaldwin said the unions do not want to go on strike, but it’s the only way to win deals at the negotiating table that would have the support of rank-and-file members.\n\nHe said if there is a strike it would be the fault of railroad management, not the unions.\n\n“The railroads have the ability to fix this problem If they would come to the table and do that, we could move forward without Congressional action,” he said.\n\nHe said this is an issue that the rail unions have been seeking to address for decades, but it has received more attention from membership recently.\n\n“This became a glaring issue during the pandemic when we had members who were forced by their employers, the railroads, to stay home and quarantine without pay,” he said. “But really it comes down to simple things like the flu for a day or two, or a sick child, and the ability to take a day or two paid.”\n\nWhile the leadership of the unions were unhappy with Biden, some of the rank-and-file members were far more angry.\n\n“Joe Biden blew it. He had the opportunity to prove his labor-friendly pedigree to millions of workers by simply asking Congress for legislation to end the threat of a national strike on terms more favorable to workers,” said Hugh Sawyer, treasurer of the Railroad Workers United, a caucus of union activists that had been campaigned against ratification of the tentative labor deals. “Sadly, he could not bring himself to advocate for a lousy handful of sick days. The Democrats and Republicans are both pawns of big business and the corporations.”\n\nAny legislation to stop workers from going on strike needed to be passed with bipartisan support, though, so it’s not clear that an effort to impose a more labor-friendly contract would have been able to get the Republican votes it would need to pass the Senate.\n\nBusiness groups relieved\n\nWhile union leaders were attacking Biden, business groups were praising his call for Congressional action, saying a strike would be a serious blow to the economy by bringing 30% of the nation’s freight movements grinding to a halt.\n\nA strike, set for December 9, would snarled still-struggling supply chains and caused shortages and a spike in prices gasoline, food, automobiles and other goods, causing a body blow for the economy that many fear is already at risk of tipping into a recession. A week-long strike could cost the economy $1 billion, according to an estimate from Anderson Economic Group. The White House estimated that as many as 765,000 workers could temporarily be out of work within two weeks if the rail workers went on strike.\n\nMore than 400 business groups had joined Monday to plead with Congressional leaders on Monday for quick action. Several echoed those concerns Tuesday at a press conference organized by the Association of American Railroads, the industry’s trade group. They all praised Biden’s action, calling it appropriate.\n\n“Truly the only thing standing in the way of insuring the American economy doesn’t take a major hit is the United States Congress,” said Mike Sommers, CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying group for the oil industry that depends on rail shipments, who has clashed with Biden over high gasoline prices over the course of the last year.\n\nBiden and Democrats had been unwilling to block a strike in September when negotiations were nearing a previous strike deadline. As another strike deadline approaches, they felt there was no choice but to act.\n\nRailroads poised to get what they want\n\nBiden’s statement Monday night suggested that railroad strategy had worked.\n\n“During the ratification votes, the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, and Transportation have been in regular touch with labor leaders and management. They believe that there is no path to resolve the dispute at the bargaining table and have recommended that we seek Congressional action,” he said.\n\n“As a proud pro-labor President, I am reluctant to override the ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the agreement,” he said. “But in this case – where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families – I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal.”\n\nThe fact that Congress will move to impose the rejected tentative deals could be considered a limited victory for the unions: Congress could have instead voted to impose contracts that were worse off for the workers than the ones their members rejected.\n\nRepublicans in Congress who had introduced legislation before a September strike deadline to keep workers on the job were looking to impose a contract that would have been worse for union members, one based on recommendations of a panel that had been named this summer to try to reach a deal acceptable to both sides. The unions had been able to negotiate improvements in that proposal at the negotiating table in September.\n\nThe unions meanwhile are calling for Congress to include sick days in any contract imposed on the unions. They say that will be better for both workers and rail customers who have regularly complained over poor service that even the railroads admit is inadequate.\n\n“Passing legislation to adopt tentative agreements that exclude paid sick leave for railroad workers will not address rail service issues,” said the BMWED’s statement. “Rather, it will worsen supply chain issues and further sicken, infuriate, and disenfranchise railroad workers as they continue shouldering the burdens of the railroads’ mismanagement.”\n\nBut Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the only legislation that can get through a narrowly divided Congress in time to avert a strike is one that mirrors the rejected tentative agreements.\n\n“Some in Congress want to modify the deal to either improve it for labor or for management,” said Biden’s statement. “However well-intentioned, any changes would risk delay and a debilitating shutdown. The agreement was reached in good faith by both sides.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Matt Mcfarland", "Chris Isidore", "Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/08/11/1994-mlb-strike/13912279/", "title": "1994 strike most embarrassing moment in MLB history", "text": "Bob Nightengale\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nIt abruptly ended Michael Jordan's baseball career.\n\nIt killed the Montreal Expos franchise.\n\nIt stopped Tony Gwynn's march towards baseball immortality.\n\nIt was the 1994 Major League Baseball strike.\n\nTwenty years ago Tuesday, baseball came to a screeching halt and didn't return for 232 days. The strike canceled the rest of the 1994 season, and for the first time since 1904, even the World Series.\n\nIt forever changed the course of history.\n\n\"I never felt the same way about baseball again after that,'' Dave Stewart, a four-time 20-game winner and then pitching for the Toronto Blue Jays, tells USA TODAY Sports. \"Even today, after all of my years in baseball, the passion I have for the game has never been the same. All because of that strike.\n\n\"It was one of the most embarrassing moments that's ever happened to Major League Baseball. I wish I had never come back.''\n\nStewart stayed around for another three months once baseball returned in April 1995, back with the team for which he had his best years, the Oakland Athletics. He then retired after 19 seasons, before becoming an assistant general manager, a pitching coach and now an agent.\n\nYet for so many others, from Hall of Famer Goose Gossage to Bo Jackson to Sid Bream to Lloyd McClendon, they never would play another major league game.\n\n\"The strike got me, man,'' Gossage told USA TODAY Sports. \"It got a bunch of us. We faded in, and we faded out.\n\n\"I never did announce my retirement. Even today, 20 years later, I still haven't announced my retirement.\n\n\"You don't leave the game. The game leaves you.''\n\nGossage and former pitcher Charlie Hough are the only two players in baseball history who endured all eight work stoppages, while many of today's greatest stars, such as New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, never have lived through one.\n\n\"Most of these guys in the big leagues today,'' Gossage says, \"they don't have any freakin' clue on how they're being paid all of this money. Not one clue. They have no idea the blood, sweat and tears we went through.''\n\nGossage's Hall of Fame career began with a strike as a rookie in 1972 with the Chicago White Sox and ended with the 1994 strike with the Seattle Mariners, with six work stoppages in between.\n\n\"They were all ugly,'' Gossage says. \"The owners always tried to stick it to us, but we weren't going to let them break that union. We didn't have the money like the guys today. When I made the White Sox as a rookie, I was literally broke.\n\n\"I remember getting to Chicago, opening day was the next day, and we went on strike. I was just a kid. I didn't have a credit card. I had no place to stay. No money for a hotel room. I remember going to Joe Pepitone's bar. He bought me some beers, and I wandered the street all night.\n\n\"That's what it was like back in those days.''\n\nBy the time 1995 rolled around, the strike gave players an option most never had considered.\n\nEarly retirement.\n\n\"They should never, ever let a baseball player have the summer off,'' says Dave Henderson, the Boston Red Sox's 1986 playoff hero. \"As a baseball player, (1994) was my first summer off. Ever. And I liked it.\n\n\"Once I got introduced to the thing they call Labor Day, and had a family barbecue and everything, I said, 'Hell with it, I'm not going back.'\n\n\"I had pretty much done everything in baseball,\" says Henderson, who ended his career with the Kansas City Royals. \"I didn't have anything left to prove. It was my fifth strike or lockout, and I was pretty much done, but I was proud what we were able to accomplish.\n\n\"Guys like me and Rickey (Henderson), we paved the way for all of these big salaries and the money they're' making today. If we hadn't gone through all that and the union had been broken, we would have been like football.''\n\nTom Brunansky, who helped lead the Minnesota Twins to the 1987 World Series title with 32 homers, also planned to play one more season after 1994 and return to the Red Sox, thinking they had the team to finally end their World Series drought. The longer the strike dragged out, and the more he hung around his three young kids, he told his agent he was done.\n\n\"We were playing our last game against the Orioles in Baltimore,'' Brunansky says. \"And I remember walking up to the plate, and thinking, 'This could be my last at-bat ever. I'm going to go up there and try to hit a home run.' I ended up walking.\n\n\"It's weird, of all of the walks I ever had in my career (770), that's the only one I remember.''\n\nWhile free agents worked out at local high schools during the offseason, and others headed to Homestead, Fla., there was Jordan, who had retired from the Chicago Bulls in 1993 after nine seasons and three NBA titles.\n\nJordan began playing baseball in 1994 for the White Sox, also owned by Bulls' owner Jerry Reinsdorf. Jordan spent the season at Class AA Birmingham (Ala.), hitting just .202 with three homers and 51 RBI. He refused to give up, played in the Arizona Fall League and vowed to return to the White Sox's spring training camp in 1995.\n\nYet with the strike still going on, Jordan refused to cross the picket line and play with the replacement players. He sat out and then announced in March he was returning to the NBA, winning three more titles with the Bulls, but giving up his dream of playing in the major leagues.\n\n\"I think he would have definitely given it one more year if not for the strike,'' Reinsdorf told USA TODAY Sports. \"When the strike hit and we decided to go with replacement players, Michael could not be part of that.''\n\nWe will never know whether Gwynn could have hit .400. He ended his season with a .394 batting average, the highest of any player since Ted Williams in 1941.\n\nWe'll never know if Matt Williams, who had 43 homers and was on pace for 61, could have been the first to break Roger Maris' home-run record, squashing the great juiced homer race of '98 between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.\n\nWe know the Montreal Expos had the best record in baseball (74-40) and wonder if the Expos had won the World Series, would there still be a franchise in Montreal today, instead of relocating to Washington, D.C.?\n\n\"It makes you kind of sick to think about everything that could have been,'' says Gossage, who pitched three scoreless innings and was the winning pitcher his final game. \"It wasn't that I wanted to go out on my own terms. I'd rather make an ass of myself try to play another year or two than ever leave the game early.\n\n\"I wanted keep playing this game until they tore my uniform off. The strike tore it off for me.''\n\nNow, after eight work stoppages in a 22-year span, baseball has had 20 consecutive years of labor peace.\n\n\"It would have been a damn shame if baseball didn't learn from that,'' Gossage says. \"Hopefully, no one ever again has to experience what we went through.\n\n\"Enough is enough.''", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/economy/freight-railroad-strike/index.html", "title": "Massive rail strike next week could deal another blow to America's ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nFreight railroads have been around since the 19th century, but you can’t run a 21st century economy without them.\n\nThe looming possibility of a strike by unions representing more than 90,000 workers at the nation’s freight railroads has businesses nationwide worried. The unions are poised to go on strike on September 16, a move that could bring nearly 30% of the nation’s freight to a grinding halt, according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\n\nIt’s about the last thing the US economy needs as it struggles to get over several years of supply chain issues. A prolonged strike could mean empty shelves in stores, temporary closures at factories that don’t have the parts they need to operate, and higher prices due to the limited availability of various consumer goods.\n\n“We’re hearing more and more that shippers and the railroads are getting anxious,” said John Drake, vice president for transportation, infrastructure and supply chain policy for the US Chamber of Commerce. The chamber is calling on the two sides to reach a deal that avoids the first national rail strike in 30 years.\n\nThe unions and the National Railway Labor Conference, which represents management at the negotiating table, met with federal mediators and US Labor Secretary Martin Walsh Wednesday to see if they could move closer to an agreement. The unions said there was no progress.\n\nThe freight railroads have generally thrived during the pandemic, so a key dispute is not over pay, but rather the rules controlling worker scheduling. Many of the engineers and conductors who make up the two-person crews on each train have to be “on call” to report to work seven days a week, preventing them from making their own plans, depriving them of time with their families and creating a high turnover rate.\n\nTime running out\n\nSince railroad workers are under a different labor law than the one that control labor relations at most businesses, it’s possible that Congress could act to prevent or quickly stop a strike. But that would require a level of bipartisanship that is rare in Washington just weeks ahead of midterm elections.\n\nPresident Joe Biden prevented a strike two months ago by imposing a cooling off period during which a panel he appointed, known as a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB), looked at the disputed issues in the negotiations and issued a recommended settlement.\n\nThat 60-day cooling off period is due to expire at 12:01 am ET Sept. 16, and Biden does not have the power to prevent a strike at that time. Only Congress can act to prevent a work stoppage, either by imposing a deal on the two sides or to extending the current cooling off period.\n\nThe PEB recommended multiple annual raises back to July 2020, when the previous contract had been set to expire.\n\nThey would give workers an immediate 14% raise, as well as additional back pay for the hours they worked since 2020. There would be more raises going forward, resulting in a 24% pay increase over the five-year course of the contract that would run from 2020 to 2024, as well as annual cash bonuses of $1,000.\n\nThe PEB’s wages recommendations are somewhat less than the unions requested, and somewhat more than management had previously offered.\n\nBut it was a lucrative enough that five of the smaller unions that represent more than 21,000 railroad workers agreed to a tentative labor deals based on the panel’s recommendations, although they still need to be be ratified by their rank-and-file members to go into effect. And the PEB’s wage recommendations would probably have been enough to win the approval of the other unions, even though they were asking for more.\n\n“We’re not going to sit here and argue about [wages] or health care. We’re beyond that,” said Jeremy Ferguson, president of the union that represents the conductors, one of the two workers on freight trains along with the engineers.\n\nAnger over work rules\n\nThe conductors’ union and other six unions poised to strike, which includes the one representing engineers, are not satisfied with the work rule recommendations, and how the “on call” requirement will affect the quality of their members’ lives, denying them any free time with their families even when off of work.\n\nThe unions are urging allies in Congress not to act, arguing that a strike is the only way to reach a deal that can improve what they say are intolerable work rules driving employees to quit the business, causing staff shortages and well documented service problems in freight rail service.\n\n“The fact is they [the railroads] are counting on Congress to act,” said Dennis Pierce, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. “We’ve let them [the union’s allies in Congress] know we need them to stay out of it.”\n\n“This is a chance for the Democrats to stand up for something they say they support, the working class and labor,” Ferguson said.\n\nWill Congress act?\n\nIf Congress does act, it would pose a difficult political choice for the Biden administration. Biden is as pro-union as any president in history, but he doesn’t want to see any problems for supply chains, prices and the economy ahead of crucial midterm elections.\n\nAsked about risk of a strike, a White House official did not address the possibility of Congressional action, instead stressing the need for a negotiated settlement to avoid a shutdown it hopes to avoid.\n\n“After the pandemic and supply chain disruptions of the past two years, now is not the time for more uncertainty and disruption,” the official told CNN’s Betsy Klein.\n\nThe official said the White House “stands ready to support the parties as they work toward an agreement or a voluntary extension of the cooling off period.”\n\n“We take no position on what the elements of an agreement should be,” the official added. “We are confident the parties will make every effort to negotiate in good faith toward a mutually acceptable solution, and we urge both sides to do so promptly.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress could impose a contract more to the unions’ liking than what was recommended by the presidential panel. But that might have trouble getting the necessary Republican support to pass. Republicans could potentially benefit if there was a prolonged rail strike causing problems in the economy right before the election, especially if it could be blamed on the Democrats.\n\nEven some businesses that would like to see the dispute settled without a strike are nervous about turning to Congress.\n\n“Quite frankly, it’s not a good sign if it ultimately goes to Congress,” said one business official closely monitoring the potential for a strike, who spoke on the condition his name not be used.\n\n“You don’t know what you’re going to get. You could have members that could hold up legislation to demand one thing or the other…Once Congress gets involved, it’s a mess.”\n\nThis executive believes that Congress will kick the can down the tracks, extending the cooling off period, perhaps past election day, rather than imposing a contract. But that’s still no solution.\n\n“Here’s the rub, it’s been 30 days since the [presidential panel’s] recommendations. Only five of the 12 rail unions have signed onto the recommendations,” he said.\n\nAt this point the railroads are still urging the unions to agree to the terms recommended by the presidential panel, rather than calling on Congress to act.\n\n“It is in the best interest of all stakeholders and the public for the railroads and rail labor organizations to promptly reach agreements that provide pay increases to employees and prevent rail service disruptions,” said the National Railway Labor Conference “Now is the time to use the PEB’s recommendation as the basis for a prompt and voluntary agreement.”\n\nThe railroad’s trade group put out an estimate Thursday that a halt to freight rail service would cost the US economy $2 billion a day. It did not specifically call for Congressional action, encouraging the parties to settle the dispute through negotiations, although it’s statement said, “ultimately, Congress has the power to intercede and avert a shutdown.”\n\nRecord profits for railroads\n\nThe strike threat comes as several railroads, including Union Pacific (UNP), Norfolk Southern (NSC) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA)’s Burlington Northern Santa Fe have reported record earnings.\n\nThe unions argue the companies are making the profits on the back of their employees, creating conditions that are driving workers to quit. Employment at the nation’s major railroads is down by more than 30,000, or about 20% of the workforce, since the last contract was reached in 2017.\n\nLeaders of the unions say their members are now at a breaking point and that they are eager to strike to win changes.\n\n“This isn’t a personal choice by the presidents of the unions,” said the engineers union president Pierce. “Our membership has made it loud and clear that this is not a deal membership would ratify.”\n\n– CNN’s Betsy Klein contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/09/21/when-will-writers-actors-strike-end-2023/70919542007/", "title": "Are the Hollywood strikes over? Screenwriters and studios make deal", "text": "Hollywood is getting back to work.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America and Hollywood studios, represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, reached a tentative deal to end the 146-day screenwriters' strike late Sunday night.\n\nCEOs of Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal's studios stepped in last week to avert a stalemate, holding meetings with the writers' union through the weekend to settle thorny issues of pay, benefits and guaranteed work.\n\nBut the strike, which has largely shuttered work on American movies, TV dramas and sitcoms, and late-night talk shows, was followed by another walkout by actors on July 14. Screen Actors Guild president Fran Drescher (\"The Nanny\") took a hardline stance and laid plans for a six-month walkout, acknowledging that many others − from caterers to makeup artists − were caught in the crossfire and left jobless.\n\n\"The gravity of a commitment like this is not lost on any of us. It's major,\" she told USA TODAY in July. \"But we also see that we have no future and no livelihood unless we take this action, unfortunately.\"\n\nWhat's happening now, and when will your entertainment diet go back to normal? We explain.\n\nAre the Hollywood strikes over yet?\n\nNo, not quite.\n\nThe writers' battle with the AMPTP, which handles labor negotiations on behalf of eight major studios and streaming services, has ended. Picketing has been suspended, and the writers were permitted to return to work Wednesday while the full WGA membership votes on the settlement terms, expected by early October.\n\nWhile writers can resume penning scripts, the actors, represented by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, have to negotiate their own settlement. Labor experts expect they will use some of what WGA agrees to as a template.\n\n\"We look forward to reviewing the terms of the WGA and AMPTP’s tentative agreement,\" a SAG-AFTRA statement, posted Sunday on X, formerly Twitter, read. \"And we remain ready to resume our own negotiations with the AMPTP as soon as they are prepared to engage on our proposals in a meaningful way. Until then, we continue to stand strong and unified.\"\n\nWhat's at stake? Both say they are earning less money as TV seasons grow shorter in an age of streaming: Where a network sitcom would guarantee 22 episodes a year, streaming shows often produce as few as eight or 10 episodes. Actors and writers also earn fewer royalty payments from syndication or overseas runs of shows and movies as streamers demand worldwide exclusive rights to them.\n\nTerms of the tentative screenwriters' deal were not immediately made public.\n\nWill my favorite talk shows return when writers go back to work?\n\nYes. Late-night talk shows − the first to be noticeably missing when the WGA strike began − are expected back by Oct. 2. But Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers can't book actors to promote past or current movie or TV projects until the actors' strike is settled: Such promotion is explicitly banned by SAG, even on social media. But the restriction wouldn't hurt other shows that don't depend on such guests, including HBO's \"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\" and \"Real Time With Bill Maher.\"\n\nDaytime talk shows also can return, although some − including ABC's \"The View\" and the syndicated \"Live With Kelly and Mark\" − are produced under separate contracts and remained on the air. Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson and Drew Barrymore − who announced a plan to resume without writers but quickly backpedaled after an outcry by strikers, as did Hudson and CBS' \"The Talk\" − should also resume fairly quickly. NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" is unlikely to be back until both strikes are settled.\n\nHowever, getting writers back to work gives studios a head start on writing movies and scripted series, so that production can resume quickly when actors return.\n\nWhy did the studios suddenly want to settle?\n\nThe AMPTP and the unions took aggressive postures as the WGA strike dragged on (the last one, in 2007-08, lasted 100 days). The studios argued in previous contract talks that streaming has upended traditional business models, and they needed more time to sort out how that affects the economics of TV and movie production. A vast increase in the number of projects, dubbed \"Peak TV\" by one executive, followed streamers' desire to build subscribers at any cost. But their voracious appetites have cooled amid Wall Street's demands for profits, and fewer movies and TV shows are on the horizon. The unions say they've been patient, but view 2023 as an inflection point: If they don't share more of the fruits of their work now, they never will.\n\nYet pressure has mounted on studios, many of which have seen declines in their stock prices since the WGA strike began. While they're saving money they would otherwise spend to produce shows and movies, they're losing more revenue at the box office, as well as ad money from lower TV ratings. And streaming services risk losing subscribers if they run out of new programming.\n\nWhat happens if talks break down?\n\nIf the actors' strike isn't settled in the coming weeks ― no talks have been scheduled ― broadcasters will have a hard time salvaging the traditional TV season, which began Sept. 25. Their schedules are littered with reality competitions, game shows, reruns and foreign imports with few recognizable stars. (NBC produced and banked episodes of a handful of new and returning dramas, including reboots of \"Quantum Leap\" and \"Magnum, P.I.,\" before the strikes.)\n\nStreamers have longer lead times, and movie studios longer still, so you probably haven't noticed much change in the number of new and returning shows ... yet. But even after a settlement, an emptier pipeline means there'll be fewer shows next year while producers catch up. Some studios and networks have delayed premieres of new movies (\"Dune 2\") and series (\"Fargo\") to spread out their slates and fill empty spots on their calendars.\n\nWhat movies are delayed due to writers strike?\n\nSeveral movies and awards shows have been pushed back by the strike, with some films delayed by years.\n\nDisney postponed the release of the next three installments of James Cameron's blockbuster \"Avatar\" series: “Avatar 3” moves to Dec. 19, 2025, “Avatar 4” to Dec. 21, 2029, and “Avatar 5” to Dec. 19, 2031.\n\nMarvel has reshuffled its cinematic universe, with “Captain America: Brave New World” moving to July 26, 2024. \"Thunderbolts\" pushing back to Dec. 20, 2024, and “Blade” moving to Feb. 14, 2025.\n\nAside from delaying \"Dune 2,\" Warner Bros. has moved \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" a month to April 12, 2024, while animated \"Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\" is now slated for Dec. 13, 2024.\n\nSony moved “Kraven the Hunter\" to Aug. 30, 2024 (Labor Day weekend), and “Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse” was taken off the release calendar for now. The untitled sequel to \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife\" moved to March 29, 2024.\n\nWhat's on, what's off:Where are my TV shows? Frustrated viewers' guide to strike-hit, reality-filled fall season\n\nWhen will 'Grey's Anatomy,' 'NCIS' and 'SNL' come back?\n\nIf actors follow writers back to work, production could resume late this year and new TV episodes could begin airing by February. Sitcoms require a shorter production schedule, and can air three to four weeks after they're shot; dramas take longer to produce and edit. But shows like \"Grey's\" and \"NCIS\" are likely to air 10 to 13 episodes at most, compared to 18 to 22 in a typical season. \"SNL\" is written the same week it airs, so its return would be much speedier, but there's no chance its customary 21-week season would remain intact.\n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander and Charles Trepany, USA TODAY, and The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/us/washington-state-schools-closed-as-teachers-strike/index.html", "title": "Seattle teachers vote to officially end strike that had delayed start of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Seattle Education Association voted Tuesday afternoon to suspend its strike and return to classrooms starting Wednesday.\n\nThe vote came after Seattle Public Schools earlier announced a tentative, three-year contract agreement with the educators’ union amid a strike that delayed the start of the school year by five days as they negotiated over improvements to classroom sizes, pay and health services.\n\n“Our strike shows the power that educators and community have when we unite and call for what our students need,” said SEA president Jennifer Matter. “We should all be proud of what we’ve accomplished here for our students and our schools.”\n\nThe five days students missed will need to be made up during the school year, the district said in a statement.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome students and educators back into our classrooms to start this new school year. We are excited to engage fully in our mission – our moral imperative – of high-quality teaching and learning,” said Superintendent Brent Jones.\n\nThe strike began Wednesday, which was scheduled as the first day of school for about 50,000 students in the Seattle school district.\n\nThe action came as schools around the country face shortages of teachers, who are increasingly voicing frustration at being underpaid and underappreciated, teaching in crowded classrooms and in challenging conditions made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn Seattle, educators went on strike to demand more support for students, including interpretation and translation services for those receiving multilingual education, and improved special education staffing ratios, according to the Seattle Education Association, which represents about 6,000 employees.\n\nTeachers from Seattle Public Schools picket outside Roosevelt High School on what was supposed to be the first day of classes Wednesday.

We want to be in our schools with our students,” teacher Ellen Santarelli said in a Facebook video. “However, to get what our students need … we are willing to go outside of our comfort zones – thousands of steps outside of our comfort zones.”\n\nThe union also advocated for higher wages and more support and controls to prevent educator burnout, including capping some class sizes.\n\nDetails of the agreement won’t be released until it is ratified, but the SEA said the contract maintains Special Education ratios and improves them in some areas, adds baseline mental health staffing in all schools and raises pay every year.\n\nThe vote to ratify the tentative agreement will take place later this week, the union said.\n\nEducators were on the picket lines for days, holding up signs that read “make mental health a priority,” “fund essential supports,” and “students should be able to see a nurse any schoolday.”\n\nStudents did not go to school Tuesday at another district in Washington state – the Ridgefield School District – as bargaining teams continue monthslong negotiations.\n\nRidgefield teachers went on strike Friday, calling for more mental health supports, improvements for special education students and a better program for student interventions at the district, which enrolls about 3,850 students near the Oregon border.\n\nThey joined thousands of other educators around the country who in recent weeks have also taken to the picket lines to negotiate for better contracts and improved classroom conditions.\n\nMath teacher Royce Christensen pickets outside Roosevelt High School in Seattle Wednesday. Jason Redmond/AP\n\nLast week, another Washington state public school district – the Kent School District – ended talks that had similarly delayed the academic year since getting underway in July.\n\nTeachers in Kent, represented by the Kent Education Association, ended their strike after reaching an agreement with the school district.\n\nTwo weeks prior, a Columbus, Ohio, teacher’s union ended a dayslong strike over classroom conditions and teacher pay after reaching an agreement, which included guarantees that classrooms will be climate controlled by the beginning of the 2025-2026 academic year, as well as a reduction in class sizes.\n\nTeachers at Ohio’s largest school district had complained that students in some cases had to learn in classrooms with no functional air conditioning.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Chuck Johnston Hannah Sarisohn Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Chuck Johnston", "Hannah Sarisohn", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}]}

The White House hopefuls addressed the spread of fentanyl in the United States and workers' rights.\n\nBut the debate also turned personal Former President Donald Trump didn't attend the debate, but his Republican rivals took time to launch new attacks against the GOP frontrunner. As former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley sparred with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, she told him to \"bring it\" on the debate stage.\n\nThe Republican hopefuls started off the debate by discussing the United Auto Workers strike, with several criticizing President Joe Biden for joining the workers on the picket line earlier this week.\n\nSen. Tim Scott showed a feistier side in this debate, taking on Vivek Ramaswamy for having done business with China.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis jabbed at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for not participating in the debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here,\" DeSantis said.\n\nChris Christie: Kick Donald Trump 'off the island'\n\nNone of the Republican debaters wanted to vote one of their fellow candidates \"off the island,\" though Chris Christie suggested running Donald Trump out of the GOP primary.\n\n\"This guy has not only divided our party, he's divided families all over this country,\" Christie said. \"He needs to be taken out of this process.\"\n\nOther candidates balked at the last question of the evening, one borrowed from the game show \"Survivor:\" Who would you vote \"off the island.\"\n\nDeSantis voiced his objection, calling it \"disrespectful\" to the candidates who showed up to the debate.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRon DeSantis takes on Donald Trump over abortion\n\n“He should be here,” Ron DeSantis said of Donald Trump during Wednesday's debate, calling on the former president to explain his stance on abortion.\n\nTrump recently called the Florida governor’s six-week abortion ban “a terrible mistake” and refused to state his position on a federal ban, while on NBC’s Meet the Press.\n\nDeSantis, who has also fielded criticism from anti-abortion advocates for not taking a strong enough national abortion stance, called out Democrats for what he said are extremist abortion rights positions.\n\n“We’re better off when everybody counts,” he said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\n'Bring it, Tim:' South Carolina candidates Haley, Scott argue about experience\n\nThe two South Carolina candidates in this race went after each other over who has the better experience: Former Gov. Nikki Haley or current Sen. Tim Scott.\n\n\"Twelve years - where have you been?\" Haley asked Scott, citing the Senate's uneven record on issues like debt and federal spending.\n\nScott responded that Haley's experience as governor is inadequate, and the two drowned out each other in argument. It was broken up by DeSantis, who touted his own record as governor of Florida.\n\nHaley shot back at Scott \"Bring it, Tim.\"\n\nBoth Haley and Scott are aiming for the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24 - if they can make it that far.\n\n– David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy spar over Ukraine, China\n\nAnother fight broke out between Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy over foreign policy, this time over Russia’s war against Ukraine, as he said the candidates need to “level with the American people” on the issue.\n\n“Just because…Putin’s an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good,” he said, bringing up the country’s ban on 11 political parties with ties to Russia.\n\nInterrupting him, Haley said, “A win for Russia is a win for China.” She added, “But I forgot, you like China.”\n\nRamaswamy hit back that “hurling personal insults” were not helping.\n\nMike Pence also got in on the action, arguing that letting Russian President Vladimir Putin have Ukraine would be a “greenlight” to China to invade Taiwan. “Peace comes through strength,” Pence responded, in a nod to Reagan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nNikki Haley criticizes Donald Trump on his handling of China\n\nNikki Haley, who served as an ambassador to the United Nations under the Trump administration, took a jab at her former boss for his handling of China.\n\nShe said that she would end all normal trade relations with China until it stops contributing to the spread of fentanyl.\n\n“This is where President Trump went wrong,” Haley said. “He focused on trade with China. He didn't focus on the fact that they were buying up our farm and he didn't focus on the fact that they were killing Americans. He didn't focus on the fact that they were stealing $600 billion in intellectual property.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley tells Vivek Ramaswamy 'Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber'\n\nVivek Ramaswamy tried to defuse the biggest criticism of him: That he's a young and arrogant \"know-it-all\" who doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\n\"I'm here to tell you, I don’t know it all,\" Ramaswamy said, adding that he knows how to use staff and develop a strong organization.\n\nHis rivals didn't seem convinced, especially Haley.\n\nNoting that Ramaswamy has joined TikTok while pledging to confront Chinese spying, Haley told the upstart candidate: \"Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber for what you say.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMike Pence: ‘I’ll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American’\n\nWhen asked how he would protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination and violent attacks, Mike Pence said “I’ll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American from every background.”\n\nBut Pence quickly turned to transgender children and their rights at school.\n\n“We've got to empower parents at the state level with the ability to choose where the kids go to school, whether it's public, private, parochial or homeschool,” Pence said. “You empower parents, and our schools will straighten up and reflect our values and focus on the basics faster than you can possibly imagine.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'How it's done': Ron DeSantis touts education record\n\nRon DeSantis answered controversy around Florida’s new history curriculum, which requires teachers to instruct students on “how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” The Florida governor called criticism and response to the change a “hoax” led by Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDeSantis turned his comments to Florida’s other education policies, including the Parental Rights in Education Act, dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by opponents. The law bans instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in grades K-12.\n\n“Florida is showing how it’s done,” DeSantis said, boasting his administration’s focus parents’ rights and having “eliminated critical race theory.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence takes on 'former running mate' Trump\n\nMike Pence also got in a few digs at Donald Trump on Wednesday, faulting him for proposals that would expand government.\n\nReferring to the ex-president as \"my former running mate,\" Pence said that \"Donald Trump has a plan to consolidate more power to the government.\"\n\nIt looked like a planned attack: Pence dragged in Trump after a question about whether former President Barack Obama's health care would survive all Republican efforts to repeal it. However, Pence did not address Obamacare.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley calls for transparency in the healthcare system\n\nNikki Haley told a story about her mother being in the hospital, and when healthcare workers tried to bring her Tylenol and she refused, they said ‘honey, go ahead and take it because you're paying for it anyway.’\n\n“Why is it that when we got the bill, the insurance company in the hospital negotiated the bill for her without her having anything to do with it?” Haley said. “When I'm president, we will bring all that from the insurance company to the hospitals.\n\n\"We will make it all transparent because when you do that, you realize that's what the problem is,\" Haley added.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Address fentanyl crisis by sealing border, addressing mental health\n\nWhen asked how he would stop fentanyl brought into the country through ports of entry, Vivek Ramaswamy said that there’s two sides to the issue: seal the southern border and address the mental health epidemic in America.\n\nHe referenced two parents he met whose son died after buying Percocet on Snapchat.\n\n“It is our job to make sure that never happens,” Ramaswamy said. “But it's also our job to make sure that 17 year olds don't turn to Percocet via Snapchat. We have to bring back mental health care in this country, not with pumping pharmaceuticals but with faith based approaches.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMore politics, in your inbox. Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter.\n\n'Donald Duck': Chris Christie calls out Donald Trump for absence\n\nWhile answering a question on crime rates in America, Chris Christie took time to address Donald Trump directly, calling him too afraid to join the debate stage.\n\n“We’re going to call you Donald Duck,” Christie, who turned directly to the camera to address the former president, said Wednesday night.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTim Scott criticizes Vivek Ramaswamy after he says he's not ‘bought and paid for’\n\nIn the first Republican debate, Vivek Ramaswamy said that he was the only GOP candidate “not bought and paid for.” Scott invoked those comments in the Wednesday's debate when he criticized Ramaswamy over business in China.\n\nRamaswamy pushed back by saying that while he opened a subsidiary in China, what he did differently from other companies is that he “got the hell out of there.”\n\nWhat's the CCP? It's a reference to the Chinese Communist Party\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRon DeSantis: Donald Trump is 'missing in action'\n\nFollowing Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis also invoked Donald Trump's absence from the debate by saying that Biden and others are \"missing in action\" when it comes to national leadership.\n\n\"You know who else is missing in action?\" DeSantis said, referencing the former president's choice to skip the second GOP debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Missing in action':Ron DeSantis blast Donald Trump for skipping the GOP presidential debate\n\nVivek Ramaswamy veers from Tim Scott, sides with workers\n\nWhile saying he agrees with the “spirit” of Tim Scott’s comments on the ongoing UAW strike, Vivek Ramaswamy added that he sympathizes with workers.\n\n“I understand that hardship is not a choice,” Ramaswamy said, referencing his own family and upbringing. He added, though, that he believes “victimhood\" is a choice and told workers to picket outside the White House in Washington in a message to President Joe Biden.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence: Joe Biden should be on the unemployment line, not the picket line\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence pulls out the first pre-planned line of the night, saying that Biden \"doesn't belong on the picket line - he belongs on the unemployment line.\"\n\nLike the other candidates, Pence hits Biden for the condition of the economy. The group of GOP hopefuls quickly zeroed in on inflation, jobs and other economic issues.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTim Scott weighs in on UAW strike, blasts Biden\n\nTim Scott, when asked about his previous comments that striking workers should be fired, said that the president can’t fire anyone in the private sector.\n\nHowever, he criticized workers for wanting additional benefits and fewer hours, saying that this will simply not stand.\n\nHe also blasted Biden for being on the picket line in Michigan to show support to striking autoworkers and said the president should be at the southern border instead.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump praises unions, attacks Joe Biden, mocks GOP rivals before debate\n\nSeeking to divert attention from a debate among his Republican opponents, Donald Trump traveled to Michigan for a speech extolling union members, attacking President Joe Biden, and mocking his GOP campaign opponents.\n\n\"You know, we're competing with the job candidates,\" Trump said at one point during an event in Clinton Township, Mich., adding he didn't even see a potential vice president or Cabinet secretary in the group.\n\nTrump designed his speech on \"economic nationalism\" to take advantage of the ongoing auto workers strike. He blamed it on Biden, saying his emphasis on electric cars will lead to the elimination of auto workers' jobs.\n\n\"Yesterday, Joe Biden came to Michigan to pose for photos at the picket line,\" Trump said. \"But it's his policies that send Michigan auto workers to the unemployment line!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTim Scott needs a breakout moment. Will this debate be his chance?\n\nTim Scott, who is lagging in the Republican primary polls, struggled to have a breakout moment on stage in the last debate, often disappearing into the background as other candidates sparred over issues like Ukraine aid and abortion.\n\nThis debate, however, could look different.\n\nModerators could contrast Scott's positions with Nikki Haley, since both candidates are from South Carolina. The senator will also likely face questions about a complaint filed by the UAW over his comments supporting the idea that striking workers should be fired.\n\nBut Scott has said he doesn’t think he needs a standout moment on stage in the second debate\n\n“What I need to do is continue to do what I have been doing — showing up,” Scott told “Fox News Sunday.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate fact check: Follow along live\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data? An accurate description or a baseless conspiracy theory?\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will dig into key claims from the candidates as they make them during tonight’s Republican primary debate. Follow our live fact-check file as we dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nGOP debate live fact check: What the candidates get right – and wrong\n\n– Eric Litke\n\nWill the economy take center stage?\n\nThe Republican candidates onstage in California will likely spend swaths of the debate talking about jobs, inflation and other economic issues impacting Americans' wallets.\n\nAnd one of the sponsors of the debate is the Fox Business Network, so expect a lot of discussion of the economy. You can also expect a lot of attacks on President Joe Biden on these issues, many of which will follow the campaign for the next 13-and-a-half months.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia’s violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ description of the conflict as a “territorial dispute” helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a “war criminal.” Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a previous proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nRepublican debate in the shadows\n\nThe Ronald Reagan presidential library is nestled in the mountains of Simi Valley, Calif., but the candidates who debate here Wednesday night will be in some political shadows.\n\nAs much or more attention is being given to Donald Trump's speech in Michigan, and a prospective government shutdown is also soaking up media coverage.\n\nThat means the GOP challengers will have to work extra hard to get attention, perhaps on the topics of Trump and the shutdown.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRepublican candidates on immigration\n\nOfficials in New York City and San Diego have recently warned about the migrant crisis in their cities that have overwhelmed shelters, schools and other services.\n\nAnd Republican White House hopefuls will likely discuss immigration and the U.S. southern border during Wednesday's debate.\n\nOne candidate has already vowed to bring up the issue. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday that his first action if elected to the White House will be to send the National Guard to the border. He has also criticized Trump and Biden’s border policies and said he would be the only candidate willing to address the issue head on at the second debate.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nAnd then there were 7: Asa Hutchinson, other candidates aren't debating in Simi Valley\n\nThe debate stage in Simi Valley will be a little less crowded than the last time the GOP candidates went up against one another.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson barely made the August debate and did not meet the threshold for the September match. He’ll be watching on Wednesday evening from a Washington, D.C. hotel.\n\nHe is the only candidate who qualified for the first debate who missed the mark the second time.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, pastor Ryan Binkley, radio host Larry Elder and businessman Perry Johnson have not qualified for any of the primary debates yet.\n\nGOP frontrunner Donald Trump has met the donor and polling requirements, but he has declined to go head-to-head with his opponents so far.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates try to appeal to \"maybe Trump\" voters while he's in Michigan\n\nThe Republican debaters are looking for any slivers of good news in the polls, and they found a little bit this week: Many self-proclaimed Trump voters also say they are open to other candidates.\n\nIn Iowa and New Hampshire, \"most voters are still considering multiple candidates,\" CBS News said about its most recent survey of those states. These \"maybe Trump\" voters will be big targets in the debate.\n\nMany of the Republican presidential candidates have hesitated to criticize Trump for fear of alienating the many Republican voters who have backed him in the past. Those are voters they'll need if they are to somehow wrest the GOP presidential nomination away from him in 2024.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWill there be a Democratic primary debate?\n\nJoe Biden probably won't take the debate stage with his Democratic rivals.\n\nIf an incumbent president is running, political parties usually rally around that person's reelection bid. There's no formal rule, but at this point, Biden is the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nGavin Newsom: Republican debate is ‘vice presidential debate at best’\n\nThe second Republican presidential primary debate is nothing more than a try out to be Donald Trump’s running mate in 2024. At least that’s how California Gov. Gavin Newsom sees things.\n\n“This is a vice presidential debate at best,” he told CBS News. “This is the JV team.”\n\nNewsom, whose state is where Wednesday’s discussion is taking place, has been a surrogate for the Biden campaign and has vigorously defended the president and Democratic Party's record. He emphasized how Trump is “running away” with the primary in every poll.\n\n“This is the XFL, and it’s entertainment, I guess,” he said.\n\nNewsom is also set to debate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis later this year in Georgia in a Fox News event\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nHow will the Republican candidates line up?\n\nThere's a new debate lineup tonight, and not just because there are only seven candidates on stage.\n\nJust like the first Republican debate in Milwaukee, poll averages helped determine where the candidates will stand on stage: Nikki Haley and Tim Scott have moved up, while Mike Pence has moved down.\n\nOnce again, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy are listed first and second, and will be in the middle of the pack on stage at the Ronald Reagan library.\n\nHaley and Tim Scott will be on either side of those first two, in the 3 and 4 slots. Chris Christie is in the fifth position, Pence is in sixth, and the late-qualifying Doug Burgum is in seventh.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhich candidates would pardon former President Trump?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is facing four sets of criminal charges, and it has raised questions among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected president − and he's found guilty.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, who has defended Trump on the campaign trail, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have leaned towards a pardon, though Haley noted in interviews that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis indicated he would be pursuing pardons aggressively if he's elected but hasn’t given a definitive answer on Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDoug Burgum will appear on the debate stage - this time without an injured leg\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, the final candidate to qualify for the debate, will appear on stage with six other candidates vying for the Republican nomination. But with this debate, he won't have just injured his leg.\n\nBurgum, 67, was rushed to a emergency room after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball a day before the first GOP debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin last month. But he still made it on stage the next day.\n\n“I think I took them a little too literally when they said go to Milwaukee and break a leg,” he joked on stage that day.\n\nSudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Republican candidates clash with Ramaswamy again?\n\nVivek Ramaswamy will again be near the center of the debate stage, ensuring high-profile skirmishes with other candidates, according to Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and co-author of \"Debating The Donald.\"\n\nIn the last debate, many candidates sparred with Ramaswamy over his lack of experience and some of his controversial stances on foreign policy and former President Donald Trump’s indictments, which will likely resurface in the second debate.\n\nRamaswamy has leaned on ultra-conservative values to try to appeal to voters, but he has also reached out to younger Republicans as the youngest Republican candidate in the field.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGOP debate live updates:Republicans face off for 2nd time at Ronald Reagan library\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on abortion?\n\nNikki Haley reiterated her abortion stance in the first Republican debate, arguing that leaders need to find consensus on the issue, including agreeing to not jail women who have the procedure. A self-described “pro-life” candidate, Haley said Republicans need to be honest about a national ban, which would require 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nMike Pence, abortion’s harshest opponent among the Republican candidates, took immediate issue with Haley’s comments during the event, saying abortion is “a moral issue.”\n\nMost Republican candidates, including Chris Christie and Doug Burgum, have dodged the question by saying they would leave the issues to the states.\n\nRon DeSantis has touted his record on the issue as Florida governor, having signed a statewide six-week ban into law earlier this year.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nNikki Haley seeks to keep the debate spotlight\n\nMany Republicans said Nikki Haley \"won\" the first debate − she certainly garnered the best reviews − and they are watching to see if the former South Carolina governor can do it again.\n\nAfter the Aug. 23 set-to in Milwaukee, Haley saw a spike in fundraising and poll numbers. She passed DeSantis for second place in a few national and state polls.\n\nThat may make her a target tonight for other Republican candidates, as the former United Nations ambassador seeks to make it two in a row.\n\n\"America deserves a choice, not an echo,\" Haley said in a pre-debate post on the social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on transgender rights?\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed multiple anti-trans bills in Florida earlier this year targeted at gender-affirming care for minors, instruction of gender identity in schools and more.\n\nHe isn’t alone among the Republican candidates. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has signed a law that allows schools and government employees to ignore pronouns that transgender individuals use.\n\nOther GOP candidates have also been vocally opposed to transgender rights. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has made disparaging remarks about transgender individuals, and former Vice President Mike Pence said he wouldn’t allow transgender Americans to serve in the military.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie stands apart. He has said he opposes transgender health care bans, along with other measures.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat are the candidates saying about Donald Trump's criminal indictments?\n\nDonald Trump’s four sets of criminal charges in both federal and state cases have led some of his rivals to fiercely defend him – while others have knocked him.\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has taken the former position, alleging without evidence that the indictments are politically motivated. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have also condemned the indictments on the campaign trail.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about the indictments.\n\nMeanwhile, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, two of Trump's most vocal critics, have argued that the Republican Party can't stand behind Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said in response to federal allegations that Trump tried to steal the 2020 presidential election that anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate moderator Dana Perino: The 'rubber meets the road' for GOP debaters\n\nFor students of political history, one of tonight's debate moderators will look familiar: She's a former White House press secretary.\n\nDana Perino, the chief spokeswoman for President George W. Bush and now a Fox News host, says tonight's showdown is where \"the rubber meets the road\" for GOP candidates who are struggling to catch the front-running Trump.\n\n\"This is the moment where all of them realize, 'if I don't have some sort of break-out moment to show that I could be the rival, the alternative to President Trump, their campaigns probably start to lose even more steam,'\" Perino told Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe other moderators tonight are Fox Business Network host Stuart Varney and Univision anchor Ilia Calderón.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates. “It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,” then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped. What a difference a few years makes. The nation’s highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Earlier this year, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. – John Fritze\n\nNikki Haley, Tim Scott and others oppose student debt forgiveness\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court had struck down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt for hundreds of Americans, a move that many of the 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president “cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy supported the court’s decision.\n\n“We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do: more $$ to stay at home than to work, more $$ to be a single mother than married, more $$ for those who *fail* to repay loans than those who do,” Ramaswamy wrote on X.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is the third Republican debate?\n\nThe third Republican debate will be held in Miami on Nov. 8, the day after Election Day 2023.\n\nThe Republican National Committee announced that the requirements to participate in the debate will the strictest yet: participating candidates must secure 4% of the vote in multiple polls and 70,000 unique donors.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nRepublican primary polls: Trump still leads, DeSantis a distant second\n\nDonald Trump continues to lead Republican primary polls by about 40 points in most national surveys heading into the debate night. The frontrunner will not be on the stage, though, opting instead to hold a rally for United Auto Workers members in Detroit.\n\nSecond and far behind Trump in polls is Ron DeSantis, who will stand at the center of the debate stage. Next in the polls, each less than ten points behind DeSantis and standing on either side of him on stage, are Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMike Pence and Chris Christie are close behind Ramaswamy in most polls, followed by Tim Scott and Doug Burgum.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nRepublican debate ratings ahead of 2024\n\nMillions of Americans may be tuning into the GOP debate on Wednesday night Approximately 12.8 million people watched the first Republican presidential primary debate last month, when GOP candidates faced off in Milwaukee.\n\nEight Republican candidates pitched their vision for the country’s future during the event, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nCandidates focused on issues like climate change, the war in Ukraine and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. But the debate also got personal, with Republican hopefuls targeting Ramaswamy’s lack of political experience, Haley’s perspective on abortion restrictions in the U.S. and more.\n\nDonald Trump did not participate in the event, instead opting for an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolitical groups divide their forces between Trump speech, non-Trump debate\n\nSome political interest groups seem more interested in Donald Trump’s speech in Michigan this week than in the challengers' debate in California.\n\nFor example: American Bridge 21st Century, a progressive group, financed a plane to fly over the site of Trump's union event with a banner saying \"Trump Sold Us Out.\"\n\n“It’s obvious that, barring something drastic, Donald Trump is going to be the GOP nominee next year,\" said Pat Dennis, president of American Bridge 21st Century. \"The Republicans on the debate stage know that, too.\"\n\nGroups that flooded Milwaukee for the first Republican debate are not much in evidence in Simi Valley, though the Reagan library is a fairly remote location compared to Wisconsin's Fiserv Forum.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhere is the second Republican debate?\n\nThe seven Republican presidential candidates will take the stage in Simi Valley, California, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nNorthwest of Los Angeles, the library opened in 1991 with a ceremony that at the time boasted the largest ever gathering of former presidents and their families. The site is also the final resting place for the 40th president and his wife, Nancy Reagan.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhy is Donald Trump not debating?\n\nNo, Donald Trump won’t go head-to-head with his Republican rivals on Wednesday night.\n\nInstead, Trump, the current Republican frontrunner, is traveling to Michigan to speak with supporters in a battleground state. It's also the epicenter of the ongoing United Auto Workers strike, where workers are protesting the nation's largest auto companies.\n\nTrump also skipped the first Republican debate last month, explaining that he didn’t want to give opponents free shots at him.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nFox's Stuart Varney and Dana Perino, UNIVISION's Ilia Calderón are moderating\n\nFox News Media's Stuart Varney and Dana Perino and UNIVISION's Ilia Calderón will co-moderate the second Republican presidential primary debate.\n\nCalderón will be the first Afro-Latina to moderate a Republican Primary Debate, according to the network.\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nGOP debate participants\n\nSeven Republican candidates are expected to participate in the Wednesday debate: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who qualified for the first GOP debate last month, did not make the stage this time.\n\nFormer GOP Rep.

It will begin at 8 p.m. Milwaukee time and wrap up around 10.\n\nWill candidates give opening statements?\n\nCandidates won't give opening statements, though they will have 45 seconds for closing remarks, according to the format details obtained by Semafor.\n\nHow long will candidates talk?\n\nCandidates will have one minute to answer a question and 30 seconds for follow-up questions.\n\nWhat kind of debate is it?\n\nAll signs point to the first debate in Milwaukee following a traditional format, where candidates answer questions from moderators.\n\nOther types of debates include the town hall, during which candidates take questions from audience members. Candidates may also speak at forums that are hosted by private organizations, not political parties.\n\nWho will ask the questions?\n\nFox News anchors Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier are co-moderating the debate.\n\nSemafor reported that some of the questions will involve \"sound or video, including pre-taped questions submitted by students\" through the Young America's Foundation, which is a partner of the debate.\n\nThe group, which organizes young conservatives, is headed by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Republicans are trying to make inroads with college-age voters, who have overwhelmingly turned out for liberals in recent statewide elections.\n\nHow many questions will be asked?\n\nIt's not clear at this point whether each candidate will have a chance to answer every question, or if candidates will be asked separate, specific questions about the issues.\n\nAt the early Republican primary debates in 2016, questions were posed to individual candidates about issues like abortion and foreign policy. For the first few debates, so many candidates ran that the group was split and debates were aired separately. Twelve debates and nine forums were held during the Republican primary that cycle.\n\nWhat is the 'spin room'?\n\nCandidates or their campaign representatives also make themselves available after the debate to meet with reporters and attempt to \"spin\" their performances.\n\nReporters and networks may conduct and air interviews from the spin room after the main debate event wraps up.\n\nWho will be onstage?\n\nWhile Trump plans to skip the debate and instead participate in an online interview with Tucker Carlson, eight other candidates have qualified and will appear onstage.\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nNikki Haley\n\nTim Scott\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nChris Christie\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nMike Pence\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nCandidates will be placed onstage according to polling, with the highest polling candidate in the center.\n\nA few other candidates failed to meet the requirements, including Texas Rep. Will Hurd, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and radio host Larry Elder. Candidates had until 48 hours before the debate to meet the criteria.\n\nDo candidates need to sign a pledge?\n\nYes. Those who attend the Milwaukee debate must sign a series of pledges, including a promise to support the eventual Republican nominee.\n\nSome candidates, including Christie and Hutchinson, have criticized the pledge or suggested they won't follow it. Trump said Wednesday he wouldn't sign the pledge in an interview with Newsmax.\n\nIs this the only Republican debate?\n\nNo. The Aug. 23 debate in Milwaukee is only the first Republican debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle. Fox Business will host a second debate Sept. 27 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.\n\nThe qualifications to participate in that debate are tightened from the Milwaukee debate. A candidate will need 50,000 individual contributors, up from 40,000. A candidate also needs to poll at least 3% in two national polls or one national poll and two early-voting state polls, up from 1%.\n\nIn addition to letting voters hear from candidates about issues and allowing them to compare choices, debates also give candidates trailing in the polls opportunities to break out.\n\nMore debates will likely be announced ahead of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which takes place July 15-18, 2024. Fiserv Forum will be the centerpiece of the convention, and the site of the debate.\n\nWill the candidates attend a town hall?\n\nMoms for Liberty, designated as an extremist antigovernment organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center, had planned a town hall with unnamed presidential candidates earlier on Aug. 23. That event has since been canceled.\n\nThe group will instead host a discussion with Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson that afternoon at the Pfister Hotel, which will focus on Wisconsin students' proficiency in reading and math.\n\nTyler Katzenberger of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/23/when-next-gop-debate-presidential-race/70654885007/", "title": "When is the second GOP debate?

The first event also only required candidates to be backed by 40,000 unique donors from 20 different states or territories.\n\nAdditionally, the candidates must also have signed the “Beat Biden” pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee, even if it's one of their political rivals.\n\nWhich candidates were at the first 2024 presidential debate?\n\nEight GOP candidates were present at the first debate including Florida Gov.

Nikki Haley and biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who have both seen polling bumps since then. Haley spent much of her time on offense against competitors as she focused on her vision for the country. Ramaswamy played defense most of the night, targeted by fellow Republicans on stage as he has attracted larger campaign crowds and more media coverage.\n\nHere's a look at what to watch for in the second debate.\n\nWho has qualified for the second GOP debate?\n\nSo far, the six candidates who have qualified for the second debate include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Ramaswamy, Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nIt is unclear whether North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson will be on stage. GOP frontrunner Donald Trump also said he will skip the debates, citing his large lead in the polls.\n\nRamaswamy will likely be the other candidates' punching bag − again\n\nRamaswamy remains in the upper tier of candidates and will again be near the center of the stage, ensuring high profile skirmishes with other candidates, according to Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and co-author of \"Debating The Donald.\"\n\n“Ramaswamy did an excellent job in the first debate of being extremely blunt and interjecting himself into a lot of important exchanges,” Kall said. “This earned Ramaswamy a lot of airtime, but he also absorbed a tremendous amount of political punches.”\n\nNotably in the last debate, many candidates sparred with Ramaswamy over his lack of experience. For instance, Haley shot back at Ramaswamy after he said the U.S. should cede eastern Ukraine to Russia, arguing he has “no foreign policy experience and it shows.”\n\nPence also said during the first debate that “we don't need to bring in a rookie” to the White House - a direct nod to Ramaswamy - and later added the country needs a president who’s been there and knows how the government works.\n\n“His weakness is that he spouts a lot of nonsense and comes across as the kid who reminds the teacher to collect everyone's homework,” David Niven, a political scientist at the University of Cincinnati, told USA TODAY. “Expect even more of his competitors to expose Ramaswamy's lack of depth and sincerity in the next debate.”\n\nBut as a newcomer, Ramaswamy declared in the last debate that he's the only one “not bought and paid for” on stage and leaned on Trump-style, far-right values to try to appeal to voters. This divide between populism and traditional conservatism embraced by candidates like Pence will likely emerge as a theme in the second debate, said Michael Traugott, a political scientist at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"This is the most important problem that the party is facing now, as Trump leads the populist faction - and Ramaswamy knows this - while Pence is trying to steer it back to its recent historical roots,\" Traugott said.\n\nTopics that could be discussed: economy, natural disasters and Trump\n\nBecause Fox Business and the Reagan Foundation are hosting the debate along with other partners, a more nuanced focus on business and economic issues could be in store, Kall said.\n\n“Ramaswamy and Burgum - if he qualifies - both have overseen wildly successful startup businesses and these experiences may come up during the debate,” Kall said. He added that the candidates will continue to knock Bidenomics, inflation and high interest rates.\n\nThe regulation of private companies like TikTok and Disney could be ripe for discussion given “traditional Republican orthodoxy regarding regulation,” and attention on union strikes or a future shift to electric vehicles could also be debated given the timeliness of events, he said.\n\nNatural disasters and climate change could also crop up as topics of interest. Hurricane Idalia’s recent damage to Florida and DeSantis’ handling of events at the time, including his decision not to meet with President Joe Biden, could be a talking point for some candidates like Christie.\n\nWhile Trump is not expected to show up at the second debate, his four indictments will likely take center stage as it did in the first GOP primary debate when six candidates raised their hand that they would support the former president if he gets chosen as a Republican nominee even if he was convicted.\n\n“The most compelling question for the second debate is how many of these candidates are actually running against Donald Trump, and how many are deferentially running behind him in hopes of being asked to join the ticket,” Niven said.\n\nChristie and Hutchinson will likely criticize the former president while Ramaswamy will fiercely defend him.\n\nDeSantis and Scott could have their big moments on stage\n\nTraugott said he thinks both DeSantis and Scott’s performances in the first debate didn’t stand out.\n\n“They had a cautious approach to the event, which explains that - no harm no foul,” he said. “Even though both are well funded, they have yet to attract many new supporters. Without any movement, their funding will decline.”\n\nDeSantis came into the first debate with the “greatest degree of difficulty and biggest target on his back given Trump’s absence,” Kall said, but he stayed above the back and forth attacks between other candidates.\n\n“DeSantis appeared confident and engaged during the first debate and showed some leadership by initially criticizing ‘hand-raising’ questions from the moderators. He was well-prepared and came with a catchy basket of debate zingers that were competently timed and delivered,” Kall said.\n\nNiven, on the other hand, said he thought the governor was “awkward, boring, and reactive instead of polished, compelling, and dominant.” Either way, DeSantis could likely face a moment of conflict on stage with other candidates based on recent events. For instance, he recently hit back against a man who blamed his policies for the Jacksonville, Florida, shooting last month.\n\nKall said he thinks Scott delivered a “strong closing statement\" in Milwaukee. If Burgum and Hutchinson fail to qualify for the second debate and more opportunities exist for lower-tier candidates to be given a spotlight, Scott could potentially make a comeback.\n\n“I would expect the moderators to contrast the positions of Haley and Scott, so both candidates should be prepared for this likely battle,” Kall said.\n\nScott will likely face questions about faith - a central theme in his campaign - as he did in the first GOP debate.\n\nNikki Haley: Lone wolf or part of the pack?\n\nHaley, the only woman running in the GOP primary, stood apart from other candidates in the first debate when she acknowledged that climate change was real, criticized Republicans on their spending and called for finding a middle ground on abortion.\n\nBefore the first debate, Haley was leading behind Pence in the polls for the Republican nomination, according to an average calculated by RealClearPolitics. Now, she has surpassed him.\n\n“Nikki Haley was the pragmatic voice in the first debate, offering an assessment of issues like abortion that was much more grounded in practical politics,” Niven said.\n\nKall said that Haley’s background as a U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and her experience debating others as a gubernatorial candidate contributed to her performance.\n\n“She benefited from low expectations heading into the first debate and will undoubtedly be a larger target in Simi Valley,” Kall said. “Some recent polling has indicated that Haley could be the toughest general election opponent for Biden and this electability argument will feature prominently during the next debate.”\n\nBut whether she will gain more momentum in the second debate with her moderate perspective or take a more right-view approach on policies like her other rivals to appeal to GOP voters remains to be seen.\n\n“Haley’s more moderate positions on abortion and climate change could be an asset in a general election against Biden, but could prove problematic to Republican primary voters,” Kall said. “Pence will likely continue to lead the charge here on the social issue front.”\n\nAsa Hutchinson and Doug Burgum might not make an appearance\n\nThere’s a chance two GOP candidates might not make an appearance to the second debate this time around: Hutchinson and Burgum.\n\nPolitico first reported the requirements candidates must meet to qualify for the second GOP debate include having a minimum of 50,000 unique donors and polling at a minimum of 3% in two national surveys or one national poll and two polls conducted in two early states.\n\nWhile both Burgum and Hutchinson remain confident that they will qualify, they are still polling at low numbers in the race for the Republican nomination compared to their rivals, according to an average calculated by RealClearPolitics.\n\nBurgum was the sixth candidate to qualify for the first debate - using an unusual tactic of giving away $20 gift cards for everyone that pitched in $1 to his campaign - while Hutchinson was the last.\n\n\"Whether the final roster of candidates will include Doug Burgum and Asa Hutchinson will be interesting and genuinely impact the tenor and flow of the debate,\" Kall said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/27/how-to-watch-the-second-gop-debate-tonight-vivek-ramaswamy/70980792007/", "title": "How to watch the second Republican presidential debate including ...", "text": "Republican presidential candidates will face off tonight in the second primary debate of the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe debate, which takes place at Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California, will air live tonight, Wednesday night, on both Fox Business Network and Univision.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about how to watch the next GOP debate, including where to watch and who will be in attendance.\n\nMore:Republican debate tonight: Could Vivek Ramaswamy be America's new president?\n\nWhere can I watch the Republican debate tonight?\n\nThe second Republican presidential debate of the 2024 election will air live on Fox Business Network and Univision tonight, Wednesday, at 9 p.m. ET.

Mike Pence got backup for the issue that has been the biggest weight on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes on Jan. 6, 2021 as Trump wanted.\n\nRepublican hopefuls make their pitch to voters\n\nDuring a 14-minute discussion, most of the GOP candidates said they would still support Trump, even if he is convicted of crimes and still wins the Republican nomination. They also said GOP voters are tiring of all the drama surrounding the former president.\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" said former South Carolina Gov.

Rivals like former Vice President Mike Pence hit Ramaswamy on his lack of government experience. Ramaswamy called than an asset.\n\nDeSantis, who is second to Trump in many polls, emerged from the debate relatively unscathed, but had no memorable quotes. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum used the debate to promote their own platforms.\n\nSome highlights from debate day:\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy spar about age on the debate stage\n\nWhen asked whether an elected president should pass a mental or physical test if above a certain age, Pence, 64, said Americans can make their own judgment. But he added that the country doesn’t need a president who’s too old, or a president who’s too young.\n\nRather, he said that the country needs a president who’s been there and knows how the government works.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, 38 and the youngest candidate on the debate stage, said that there needs to be a person of a different generation leading the country forward, and that he is the only candidate to do that.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican candidates push to eliminate Education Department\n\nSeveral of the Republican candidates showed their support for eliminating the federal Department of Education.\n\n“We need education in this country, not indoctrination in this country,” Ron DeSantis said.\n\nRamaswamy agreed that the Department of Education should be shut down and said he supports parents choosing where they send their kids to schools. He said he believes high school students should have to pass a civics test, like individuals in the process of becoming American citizens.\n\nDoug Burgum, also in favor of removing the Department of Education, said the country forgets that education differs by state. He emphasized the need for schools to innovate.\n\nNikki Haley pushed for transparency in the classroom.\n\n“There’s a lot of crazy, woke things happening in schools,” she said, later adding, “Parents need to be deciding which schools their kids go to because they know best.”\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\n'C'mon, man': Chris Christie doesn't like UFO question\n\nThe former governor of New Jersey took umbrage at a \"lighting round\" question on whether presidents should \"level\" with the American people about UFOs.\n\n\"I get the UFO question? C'mon, man,\" Christie told Fox News' Martha MacCallum.\n\nHe did answer the question by saying: “The job of the president of United States is to level with the American people about everything.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nSparks fly over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence tore into entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for saying he’d freeze the current lines of control in Ukraine in return for a promise from Russia that it would not form a military alliance with China.\n\nPence told Ramaswamy “if we do the giveaway that you want to” and give Putin eastern Ukraine, “it's not going to be too long” before he rolls across the border into a NATO nation.\n\n“Ukraine is not a priority for the United States of America,” Ramaswamy argued, raising China as a bigger threat.\n\nHaley argued that a win for Russia is a win for China and said Ukraine is the first line of defense.\n\n“You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows,” Haley told Ramaswamy.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nOther GOP candidates said Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6\n\nMike Pence got some back up for the issue that has been the biggest anchor on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes as Donald Trump wanted.\n\nAsked if Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6, 2021, other candidates said he did – though it took longer for some to get there than others.\n\nAfter Ron DeSantis tried to dodge the question, Pence said the American people deserve to know if everyone on stage would’ve done what he did.\n\n“Answer the question,” Pence said.\n\n“Mike did his duty,” DeSantis responded. “I’ve got no beef with him.”\n\nPence got his biggest backing from Chris Christie who said the former vice president stood up for the Constitution and deserves thanks, “not grudging credit.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says he would pardon Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump’s indictments over his handling of classified documents and the 2020 election have raised the question among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy said on the debate stage that he would pardon Trump, a position he has long held. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she was \"inclined in favor\" of a pardon in an interview, though Haley noted that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Trump’s two most vocal critics, have leaned against a pardon.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley targets Donald Trump's electability\n\nDuring the 14-minute discussion of Donald Trump's legal problems, Nikki Haley was the only candidate who mentioned a political issue: His ability to win a general election.\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" Haley said. \"We can’t win a general election that way.\"\n\nTrump will no doubt disagree with this assessment, but don't be surprised if other GOP candidates echo Haley's argument in the coming weeks.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump finally comes up: Most candidates will support him even if he is convicted, but not Chris Christie\n\nThe first Trump question came at 9:56 p.m., eastern, nearly an hour in: Would you support him if he is convicted?\n\nMost of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie said, drawing boos from the crowd and criticism from Ramaswamy, who said the Justice Department is being weaponized against Trump.\n\nScott also criticized the Justice Department. So did DeSantis, though he said the party also needs to stop talking about this and look forward - presumably with him as president.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says we are in a \"dark moment;\" Mike Pence disagrees\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy went at it again, this time over the moral climate of the nation.\n\nPence bashed Ramaswamy over his negativity, saying \"we just need government as good as our people.\"\n\nRamaswamy's reply: \"It is not morning in America. We are living in a dark moment and we have to confront that,\" an apparent reference to former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nGOP lacks uniform abortion message\n\nNikki Haley and Mike Pence’s exchange on abortion shows the hopscotch Republicans have to deal with since the Supreme Court knocked down Roe v. Wade.\n\nSix states have had reproductive rights questions on their ballot since then, and liberals have won all of those.\n\nOn the stage, most of the GOP contenders talked about a 15-week national ban being the standard, but Ron DeSantis talked up signing a 6-week ban in Florida. At one point Tim Scott, who often talks about his anti-abortion views, said that Congress should aim for a 15-week ban at least.\n\nBut others such as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, don’t support a federal prohibition at all, saying it should be left up to the states.\n\nEach touted how they are a “pro-life” candidate, but there isn’t a uniform standard.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNikki Haley, Mike Pence tangle on abortion\n\nNikki Haley tried to argue to Republicans that they need to be honest with Americans when discussing a national abortion ban. Because any federal legislation will require 60 votes in the Senate, she said, party leaders should be trying to find a consensus on abortion issues, such as banning later abortions and agreeing not to jail women who get them.\n\nMike Pence, the strongest anti-abortion advocate on the stage, wasn’t having it.\n\n“Nikki, you’re my friend,” Pence said, “but consensus is the opposite of leadership.”\n\nPence said abortion is not an issue for the states to decide.\n\n“It’s a moral issue,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMore than 45 minutes in − and no discussion of Donald Trump\n\nAfter more than 45 minutes, the debate moderators, and the candidates, have yet to discuss a big campaign issue: Donald Trump.\n\nMike Pence made passing references to the president who put him on the ticket in 2016, but neither he nor his rivals mentioned Trump's indictments or big poll leads.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy falsely claims climate change agenda is a hoax\n\nVivek Ramaswamy during the debate claimed that climate change is a hoax, but that is inaccurate.\n\nThere is a wide range of proof that climate change is real, including research on increasing global temperatures, rising sea levels and and decreasing Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nScientific data show warming has accelerated since the mid-20th century and that human activities have contributed to that trend.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nChris Christie on Vivek Ramaswamy: ‘A guy who sounds like ChatGPT’\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie didn’t hesitate to attack entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy after the candidates were asked whether they believe in climate change.\n\n“I’ve had enough already tonight of a guy who sounds like Chat GPT stand up here…” Christie said, interrupting Ramaswamy.\n\n“The last person at one of these debates who stood in the middle of the stage and said, 'what’s a skinny guy with an odd last name doing here' was Barack Obama, and I’m afraid we’re dealing with the same type of amateur,” Christie added.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nTim Scott tells opponents to stop being childish\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott sought to bring order to all the noise, telling colleagues that \"going back and forth\" and \"being childish\" will not help the American people.\n\nHis opponents are likely to continue being feisty.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHaley draws attention to being sole woman on stage\n\nAs several of the candidates traded insults, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley saw a chance to draw attention to her status as the only woman on stage.\n\n“This is exactly why Margaret Thatcher said, `If you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman,’” Haley said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nNo one has 'the sway': South Carolina young Republicans on the GOP debate\n\nPedro Mateo, 29, said he thinks the debate will be more about setting the stage for determining a vice president or even 2028 candidate.\n\n“I don’t think anyone on the stage really has the sway to upend Trump,” Mateo said.\n\nMateo is the chairman of the political engagement committee for Young Greenville, a Republican club in South Carolina. He said regardless of who ultimately wins the nomination, he’ll support any candidate over the Democratic opponent.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nVivek Ramaswamy takes heat from Mike Pence\n\nSo far, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is getting the most heat, with former Vice President Mike Pence attacking him for a lack of government experience.\n\nAfter Pence called the rising Republican a \"rookie,\" Ramaswamy said his business background is a better asset to lead a \"revolution.\"\n\n\"We're just going to have some fun tonight,\" he said.\n\nLater, several candidates hooted at Ramaswamy for claiming he is the only candidate not \"bought and paid for.\" Chris Christie compared him to another guy with a \"funny name:\" Barack Obama.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley comes out swinging\n\nWhereas the other candidates played nice when they first spoke, Nikki Haley wasn’t having it.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor, who is the lone women running for the GOP nomination, drew first blood by attacking her rivals for supporting COVID-19 stimulus spending.\n\n“The truth is that Biden didn't do this to us, our Republicans did this to us too,” she said.\n\nHaley mentioned multiple candidates on the stage by name and Trump when slamming Republicans for raising the U.S. debt and supporting earmarks.\n\n“You tell me who are the big spenders,” she said. “I think it’s time for an accountant in the White House.”\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nRon DeSantis starts with an attack on Joe Biden\n\nThe moderators opened with a question about a song that bemoans the state of the nation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used it as an excuse to bash President Joe Biden, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed suit.\n\nThe eight candidates on stage were quick to criticize Biden over a slate of economic issues, from inflation to job opportunities.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nThe lineup: The candidates' positions on the stage - and the polls\n\nThe candidates were introduced in the order of their place in political polls: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former Vice President Mike Pence, former South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.\n\nDeSantis and Ramaswamy are first and second, so they are in the center. They are flanked by Pence, Haley, Christie, Scott, Hutchinson and Burgum.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBrian Kemp chides Donald Trump for skipping debate\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp remains one of the few popular Republicans who won’t spare Donald Trump a criticism.\n\nKemp, who is mentioned as a possible 2024 contender, trekked to Wisconsin for the first GOP debate. He said the former president, who remains the clear front-runner, is making a big mistake by not joining the discussion.\n\n“Fight it out,” Kemp said on a podcast appearance.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNew Hampshire voters turn to Republican debate: ‘I’d like to see how everybody conducts themselves’\n\nEven though Kenneth Biel has narrowed down his vote for a few specific candidates in New Hampshire’s crucial first-in-the-nation primary, the debate he said, could sway him.\n\n“I’m open to hearing somebody change my mind,” said the 47-year-old software engineer from Chester. Biel said he is eyeing former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. But if a different candidate has a standout performance, the debate could change his mind.\n\n“I’d like to see how everybody conducts themselves,” Biel said, adding he’s open to “people who I disagree with.”\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWill Donald Trump attend the Republican debate?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will be skipping the first Republican primary debate, citing his lead in GOP polls.\n\nThe former president had previously hinted he would not attend the event in Milwaukee, saying he did not want to give trailing rivals free shots at him on a debate stage.\n\n“The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his Truth Social platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!”\n\nMeanwhile, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson posted his taped interview of Trump on the X social media site at 8:55 p.m., eastern.\n\n– Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden's campaign mocks Donald Trump for ‘softball’ interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nAhead of Wednesday’s debate, the Biden campaign mocked former President Donald Trump for taking part in a “softball” interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that will air online simultaneously.\n\n“In his softball 'interview' posting tonight, Donald Trump will again make clear that he’s running on the same extreme and deeply unpopular MAGA agenda the American people have rejected time and time again,” Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said in a statement.\n\nMunoz said that instead of explaining his “broken promises” to bring manufacturing jobs to Wisconsin, Trump will likely “double down on his most out-of-touch positions, including his support for wild, debunked conspiracy theories and a national abortion ban.”\n\nThe Biden campaign has circled the first Republican primary debate as an opportunity to ramp up their attacks against the GOP field after staying mostly quiet since Biden announced his reelection bid in April.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on student loan forgiveness?\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt, a move 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president “cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy also supported the court’s decision, sharing at the time: \"We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do.\"\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFollow along as we fact-check the first Republican debate\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data? An accurate description or a baseless conspiracy theory?\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will dig into key claims from the candidates as they make them during tonight’s Republican primary debate. Follow our live fact-check file as we dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate: What the Republican candidate hopefuls get right and wrong\n\n− Eric Litke\n\nBashing Biden: Democrat likely to be a GOP punching bag\n\nGOP candidates will be eager to demonstrate they have the best chance of beating President Joe Biden in the general election.\n\nA strategy memo put together by Ron DeSantis’ political action committee, which the candidate and his campaign have denounced, suggested the Florida governor focus his attacks on the Democratic president.\n\nDebaters will need little prompting to criticize Biden, although entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and several others have said they intend to use the primetime event to introduce themselves to voters and make the case for their own candidacies. Vice President Kamala Harris is also likely to be a target. DeSantis has been sparring with Harris over slavery, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has been critical of the vice president’s record. Haley has made a point of arguing that if anything happens to Biden, who is 80, Harris would succeed him as president.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nA crowd gathers in Milwaukee for Republican debate night\n\nIt's party time in Milwaukee: the Republican Party. As the debate approaches, ticket holders, Republican supporters and curious bystanders are enjoying the restaurant-and-bar areas near the city's sports arena.\n\nOthers have more organized activities.\n\nMore than 100 union members marched behind the arena, promoting labor rights and chanting \"we are the union/the mighty, mighty union.\" Another chant included the line \"Republicans hear our call!\"\n\nDown the avenue, an old-fashioned fife-and-drum corps led a group of Vivek Ramaswamy supporters dressed in Revolutionary War-era garb, topped by bonnets and tri-cornered hats, all in 99 degree weather.\n\nSpecial guests gathered in the plaza right beside Fiserv Forum, the home of professional basketball's Milwaukee Bucks. Food trucks, television tents, and a bandstand dotted the \"Block Party\" hosted by Young America's Foundation, one of the debate sponsors.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump declared Republican debate victory hours ago\n\nHours before the first Republican presidential debate even began, Donald Trump’s campaign was claiming victory, mocking his rivals and the network hosting the event.\n\n“President Trump has already won this evening’s debate because everything is going to be about him,” Chris LaCivita, who serves as a campaign senior adviser, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nLaCivita added how Fox News hosts will \"show an unnatural obsession\" with Trump by asking the other GOP contenders their reaction to the front-runner's policy positions. He said the campaign will even be looking for how many times the former president's name is brought up.\n\n“In fact, tonight’s Republican undercard event really shouldn’t even be called a debate, but rather an audition to be a part of President Trump’s team in his second term,\" he said.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nVivek Ramaswamy Googled most, Mike Pence least before Republican debate\n\nWhich candidate were Googlers most curious about leading up to the debate? That would be political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nHe was the subject of 40% of searches for candidates by name this past week, according to Google. Former President Donald Trump was next at 33%.\n\nThen there was a drop-off in interest with everyone else appearing in no more than 10% of searches.\n\nMike Pence, Trump’s former running mate, was last at 1%.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhich Republican candidates go beyond bashing Biden over inflation?\n\nWhen the candidates go after Joe Biden on the debate stage tonight, there’s a good chance they’ll bring up inflation. Although price increases have cooled over the past year, pocketbooks are still pinched and Republicans love to blame Biden.\n\nSome of the candidates have been more specific than others about what they would do differently.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence has an entire “Ending Inflation” plan that includes specific spending cuts, such as eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency. Both Pence and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy want to change how the Federal Reserve manages the economy.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has backed a proposal to bar Congress from passing any legislation that would increase inflation when the inflation rate is 4.5% or higher.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nHow have the GOP candidates prepared for the Republican debate?\n\nFrom the tennis courts – entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy called his tennis practice this week “three hours of solid debate prep” – to the basketball courts – North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. GOP candidates employed a range of tactics to prepare for the debate.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis brought in debate coach Brett O’Donnell, who has experience prepping former President George W. Bush, former Arizona Sen. John McCain and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney for debates.\n\nOthers like former Vice President Mike Pence and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley relied on their prior political experience, with Pence falling back on the way he approached one-on-one vice presidential debates in 2016 and 2020 and Haley relying on her experience from 80 town halls she held in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nSen. Tim Scott will likely lean into his faith and role as the \"nice guy” in the race. Scott campaign spokesperson Nichole Morales told USA TODAY earlier this week he “will share his positive, conservative message on the debate stage in Milwaukee.”\n\n– USA TODAY staff\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate:What the Republican candidate hopefuls got right and wrong\n\nConservative advocacy groups descend on Milwaukee before presidential debate\n\nThe Republican presidential campaigns aren't the only political organizations in town for the debate − advocacy groups are also hanging around the city's pro basketball arena promoting their issues.\n\nEconomic conservatives, like the Club For Growth, and social conservatives, like the Faith & Freedom Coalition are represented in Milwaukee to lobby lawmakers and candidates, many of whom they back with money and voter turnout.\n\n\"We want to make sure they hear what our message is,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nIt's not just conservative groups taking advantage of the big political event.\n\nDeath Penalty Action, which describes itself as the only national organization strictly focused on stopping the death penalty, is also in town solicitating support for a national ban on capital punishment.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nWhat to know ahead of the debate: Here's where candidates stand on China, potential invasion of Taiwan\n\nRepublicans agree on what they argue is an urgent need to combat the military and economic threat from China. But that’s where their agreement on the issue ends.\n\nThe United States has traditionally had a policy of strategic ambiguity on whether it would send troops to Taiwan to defend the island in the face of a Chinese invasion. Former Vice President Mike Pence supports this policy and says the U.S. should keep providing Taiwan with military assistance.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has described China as the “most dangerous foreign threat we face since the second world war” and said it’s clear that Beijing is preparing for war. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he would do everything he could to avoid using the U.S. military against China, “but if it was unavoidable, I would do what needs to be done.”\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy says he would aggressively defend Taiwan – but only until the U.S. has semiconductor independence, which he has pledged to do by 2028. At that point, he said, would not risk war for “some nationalistic dispute between China and Taiwan.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates who won't be at presidential debate blast polling requirement\n\nGOP candidates Larry Elder and Perry Johnson announced on Tuesday that they planned to sue the Republican National Committee after not making the debate stage.\n\nElder alleged on X that the RNC notified him after he turned in his debate qualification package that one of the polls he cited would not count. Johnson’s campaign also sent an email claiming that the committee had rejected him because they weren’t accepting certain polls.\n\nGOP candidate Francis Suarez said on X that his campaign also faced a similar issue on Monday night, though he added that he respects the rules set forth by the RNC.\n\n“I am sorry that this debate will not include my perspectives from the largest growing voting block in our country - young, conservative Hispanics,” Suarez wrote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFlying the flag: Donald Trump aides, supporters and surrogates swarm presidential debate site\n\nDonald Trump himself may not be in Milwaukee, but Trump World has a definite presence at the debate site.\n\nSurrogates like U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are out and about, giving television interviews promoting their favorite absent candidate. Trump campaign aides are also milling about the area around the Fiserv Forum and speaking to reporters.\n\nEveryday supporters have also flocked to downtown Milwaukee, despite temperatures in excess of 90 degrees, adorned in red or white Trump t-shirts and carrying signs. Part of their job, apparently: Wave the signs while standing behind television correspondents during live shots.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPlanned Parenthood highlights Mike Pence, Tim Scott and other GOP candidates’ position on abortion\n\nPlanned Parenthood launched this week its first ad in the 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting what five of the GOP candidates have said about abortion.\n\nThe first clip is of former Vice President Mike Pence, who has for decades tried to end government funding for Planned Parenthood and has taken the strongest anti-abortion stand in the 2024 field.\n\n“Every Republican candidate for president should support a ban on abortion,” Pence says in the clip.\n\nThe ad is running on social media and in Wisconsin.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the large group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia’s violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ description of the conflict as a “territorial dispute” helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a “war criminal.” Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nAsa Hutchinson, Chris Christie and other GOP candidates weigh in on Trump's indictments\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s indictments in both federal and state criminal cases have led some of his rivals to defend him, while others have sharply criticized him over the charges.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have condemned the indictments on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about his criminal cases.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson have been some of Trump's most vocal critics, particularly after he was indicted for allegedly trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden. After Trump's federal indictment over the 2020 election, former Vice President Mike Pence said anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: The newcomer on the presidential debate stage\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has faced scrutiny in recent days over conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attack, something his rivals could use to their advantage during the debate.\n\nIn an interview on CNN earlier this week, Ramaswamy claimed he was misquoted in an article about his 9/11 comments, though that wasn’t the case according to a recording released later.\n\nRamaswamy, a Trump-loving candidate who embraces meritocracy and anti-wokeness, has previously drawn scrutiny over comments on the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, Juneteenth and more.\n\n– Rachel Looker and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into GOP debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates.\n\n“It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,” then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped.\n\nWhat a difference a few years makes.\n\nThe nation’s highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Last month, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nPresident Biden hopes to watch ‘as much as I can’ of Republican debate\n\nPresident Joe Biden is among the millions of Americans expected to tune in to tonight’s Republican primary debate.\n\n“I’m going to try to see — get as much as I can, yes,” Biden, who is vacationing in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, told reporters when asked if he plans to watch the debate.\n\nAsked about his expectations, Biden smiled and laughed. “I have none,” he said.\n\nWhile Republican frontrunner Donald Trump skips out on the debate in Milwaukee, Biden’s reelection campaign is going on the offensive during the event.\n\nThe Biden campaign launched a $25 million television ad blitz to coincide with the first Republican debate and dispatched surrogates to Milwaukee as Democrats seek to paint the eight Republicans on the debate stage as part of an extreme “MAGA” Republican Party.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump opts for interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nTrump may not be on the stage in Milwaukee, but he is expected to weigh in on the proceedings.\n\nA pre-taped interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson is scheduled to be posted at 9 p.m., eastern, the same time as the debate.\n\nTrump - who has also threatened to skip a second GOP debate scheduled for Sept. 27 in California - will likely comment on whatever happens in Milwaukee on Truth Social.\n\n“The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his social media platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!”\n\n- Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nTrump, absent from the debate, remains frontrunner in GOP primary polls\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is still leading the polls for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, according to an average calculated by RealClearPolitics.\n\nHe has garnered 55.4% in an average of polls, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails behind him with 14.3%. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is in third with 7.2%, and former Vice President Mike Pence leads behind with 4% of support.\n\nIn line after those candidates are former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nTrump aides are all over media set-ups outside the debate venue in Milwaukee, promoting those polls and proclaiming the race all but over. “You can’t stop the Trump Train,” senior adviser Jason Miller said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and David Jackson\n\nDoug Burgum rushed to emergency room a day before the GOP debate\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, 67, was rushed to a Milwaukee emergency room on Tuesday after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. He is currently using crutches.\n\nHowever, he will still be on the debate stage, according to a post he shared on X, the platform previously known as Twitter.\n\nBurgum, who did an early afternoon “walk through” said he wants to debate. A candidate with little name recognition, Burgum previously told USA TODAY his focus in the debate will be to introduce himself to Americans.\n\n– Francesca Chambers,David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDemocrats look to get in a word at the Republican debate\n\nDemocratic Party officials are also zeroing in on the Milwaukee debate, trying to promote their messages in favor of President Joe Biden.\n\nSpeakers are doing national and local media hits, arguing that the Republicans are too extreme and too beholden to the missing debater, Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats also have paid advertising on local and national media, as well as billboards on highways surrounding Milwaukee. The signs feature Biden answering various Republican proposals.\n\nOne section of the billboard says \"tax cuts for yacht owners?\" Biden's response: \"Good luck with that, champ.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGOP debate location: Why it's in Milwaukee\n\nThe debate will take place at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin is one of several swing states that could decide the presidency in 2024.

Nikki Haley struck aggressive stances, lashing out at their opponents on stage and even at Donald Trump, the party's frontrunner who chose to skip the event.\n\nIt was the type of fierce in-your-face tone that has proven popular with the GOP base.\n\nA riskier approach: Mike Pence making a joke about sleeping with his wife.\n\nAt the end of the showdown at the Ronald Reagan presidential library, there were no clear winners and losers in the crowded GOP field that Trump is leading by a landslide. But DeSantis and Haley stood out among GOP candidates as the most aggressive on the debate stage.\n\nAs was the case at the first presidential debate, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy took much of the incoming, and found himself on the defensive by his opponents.\n\n\"Every time I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber for what you say,” Haley sniffed to Ramaswamy.\n\nHere is a look at the possible winners and losers of the debate.\n\n'Bring it': Nikki Haley spars over TikTok, and her political record\n\nHaley sparred with just about everyone on the stage Wednesday night. She took the fight to Sen. Tim Scott, a fellow South Carolinian, over their political tenures.\n\n“Bring it, Tim,” she said as they went at it.\n\nHaley also shot back at Ramaswamy after he defended his use of the popular video app TikTok.\n\n“I have a radical idea for the Republican Party: We need to win elections,” he said. “Part of how we win elections is reaching the next generation of young Americans where they are.”\n\nBut Haley told Ramaswamy on the debate stage “TikTok is one of the most dangerous social media assets that we can have.”\n\nDeSantis versus Trump: Number two in the polls goes after number one\n\nDeSantis took aim at GOP frontrunner Trump early in the debate. The governor accused President Joe Biden of “missing in action,” especially as the nation faces a looming government shutdown, the United Auto Workers strike and other challenges.\n\n''You know who else is missing in action?'' DeSantis said, referring to the former president's choice to skip the second GOP debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here!\"\n\nSleeping with a teacher? Mike Pence gets spicy\n\nPence, the former vice president, had one of the most memorable one-liners of the debate, telling his fellow Republican candidates and voters at that he has “been sleeping with a teacher for 38 years.”\n\nThe moment came after former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie criticized Biden and said he was “sleeping with” a union member, an apparent reference to first lady Jill Biden, a professor.\n\n“By way of full disclosure, Chris, you've mentioned the president's situation,” Pence said. “My wife is not a member of the teachers union, but I got to admit, I have been sleeping with a teacher for 38 years.”\n\nWho won the Republican debate?\n\nPollster Frank Luntz, who has long done focus groups of Republican voters, said the “chaos” of the argumentative debate made no one a winner.\n\n“Tonight just makes it more likely that Donald Trump is the Republican nominee,” Luntz said.\n\nHe added: “Several times the debate devolved into chaos. This format is not conducive to anyone other than Trump because it rewards soundbites rather than substance.”\n\nBut the pollster did make one prediction: “Trump won by not participating. And it irritates me to say that.”\n\nMark your calendar:USA TODAY to host town halls with six GOP presidential candidates in New Hampshire\n\nContributing: David Jackson, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/21/trump-leads-gop-field-iowa-poll/70639433007/", "title": "Iowa Poll: Donald Trump holds commanding lead 5 months to ...", "text": "© Copyright 2023, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nDonald Trump holds a commanding lead over the rest of the 2024 Republican presidential field in Iowa — and a more than 2-to-1 lead over his closest rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — with about five months to Caucus Day, a new Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\nThe poll of Iowa’s likely Republican caucusgoers comes as the former president grapples with the fallout of a fourth criminal indictment and a pack of other top contenders prepares to gather for a high-stakes GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee on Wednesday.\n\nAmong those likely caucusgoers, 42% say they plan to support Trump — a lead of 23 percentage points over DeSantis, who is at 19%. U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina follows in third place with 9%.\n\nFormer United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence tie at 6%, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at 5% and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy follows with 4%.\n\nThe poll finds many indicators of Trump’s strength, but the race is not settled and may be “closer than it may first seem,” said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., the firm that conducted the poll.\n\nMore:See where presidential candidates are campaigning in Iowa\n\nSixty-three percent of likely GOP caucusgoers say they support Trump as their first or second choice in the caucuses or are actively considering him. That footprint is on par with the 61% who say the same for DeSantis.\n\nPlenty could shift by Caucus Day on Jan. 15.\n\nA majority, or 52%, of likely GOP caucusgoers have a first choice for president and say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate, while 40% say their minds are made up. Seven percent do not have a first-choice candidate.\n\nIn addition, just 7% of poll respondents say they are considering only one candidate for president. Seventeen percent say they are considering two candidates; 19% say three; and 55%, four or more.\n\nThe poll of 406 likely Republican caucusgoers was conducted Aug. 13-17 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nIt is the Iowa’s Poll’s first test of the field of 14 Republican candidates vying for their party’s chance to take on Democratic President Joe Biden in 2024.\n\nIn addition to the top contenders, seven other candidates are polling at 2% or lower.\n\nThey include North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who is at 2%, and former U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, who has 1%.\n\nBusinessman Ryan Binkley, conservative radio host Larry Elder, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, businessman Perry Johnson and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez all register below 1%.\n\nAs they think about which candidate to support, 65% of poll respondents say it’s most important to find a candidate who comes closest to their own views on issues, while 29% say it’s most important to pick a candidate who has the best chance of defeating Biden.\n\nDonald Trump’s legal challenges may be helping him in Iowa\n\nEven as Trump faces mounting legal troubles, his support appears only to grow.\n\nA grand jury in Georgia indicted Trump Aug. 15 for allegedly attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election there.\n\nThe Iowa Poll, which was conducted Aug. 13-17, showed greater support for Trump in the days after the indictment was unveiled.\n\nIn the days before the indictment, Trump led DeSantis 38% to 20%. In the days after, his lead grew to 43% over DeSantis’ 18%.\n\nTrump’s Iowa footprint, combining his first-choice support, second choice and those actively considering him, also increased 12 percentage points after the Georgia indictment was announced — from 55% to 67%.\n\nDonald Trump leads, but Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott have room to grow\n\nAlthough Trump leads overall, the poll measures candidates’ full footprint of support in Iowa, where caucusgoers are known for considering many candidates before slowly zeroing in on one person by Caucus Day.\n\nThe footprint adds together those who say the candidate is their first choice for president, those who say the candidate is their second choice and those who are actively considering supporting the candidate.By that measure, about as many likely GOP caucusgoers are considering DeSantis as are considering Trump.\n\nTrump’s Iowa footprint includes the 42% who say he is their first choice for president, 10% who say he is their second choice and 12% who say they are actively considering him. That’s 63%, or nearly two-thirds of likely Republican caucusgoers, who are considering caucusing for Trump.\n\nDeSantis’ support includes the 19% who name him as their first choice, 20% who say he is their second choice and 22% who say they are actively considering him — totaling 61%.\n\nScott is the only other candidate whose Iowa footprint tops 50%.\n\nIn addition to the 9% who say Scott is their first choice for president, 15% say he is their second choice and 29% say they are actively considering him. That gives him an Iowa footprint of 53%.\n\nHaley’s Iowa footprint totals 40%, Ramaswamy’s is 34% and Pence’s is 31%.\n\nSelzer said other candidates have the opportunity to gain on Trump and turn people who are actively considering them into firm supporters, but “there’s a lot of work to be done.”\n\nTrump’s support is more firmly locked in than DeSantis’; 66% of those who name Trump as their first choice say their minds are made up, while 34% say they could be persuaded to support someone else.\n\nFor DeSantis, it’s nearly the inverse, with 31% who say their minds are made up and 69% who could be persuaded.\n\nMore:Donald Trump, at Iowa fair, woos crowds, rebuffs 'wise guy' question on taking plea deal\n\nTrump also leads DeSantis among self-identified Republicans, the core of caucusgoers, 51% to 20%.\n\nAmong those who say they will be attending their first caucus in January, Trump leads the Florida governor 47% to 18%.\n\nAnd among evangelicals, an influential group in Iowa that’s often key to a caucus win, Trump leads with 47% who say he is their first choice for president. He’s followed by DeSantis, who gets 20% of evangelicals and Scott who gets 7%.\n\nPhil Marchand, a 42-year-old Sergeant Bluffs resident and poll respondent, said he caucused for Trump ahead of the 2016 election and has been “on the Trump train” ever since.\n\nMarchand is steadfast in his support for Trump in the current election cycle. He said he considered other Republican candidates, including DeSantis and Scott, but ultimately decided to caucus again for the former president come January.\n\n“The more time I spend listening to DeSantis and the more I listen to the things Trump is saying, the more I think that it has to be (Trump). It can’t be anyone else,” he said.\n\nMore:Trump is wrestling with 5 big legal cases. Here's how they may collide with the campaign calendar.\n\nMarchand said he appreciates Trump’s “America first” approach to foreign policy and his efforts to grow the economy and jobs.\n\nIf Trump does not receive the Republican nomination, Marchand said he would likely register as an independent and vote for a third-party candidate.\n\nIndependent caucusgoers could be ‘the way in’ for Trump challengers\n\nAmong independents, Trump and DeSantis are nearly evenly split, with 21% supporting Trump as their first choice and 19% supporting DeSantis.\n\nAnother 13% of independents support Scott, 12% support Christie, 10% support Haley and 6% each support Pence and Ramaswamy. No other candidate tops 5% with independents.\n\nSelf-identified independents who say they will likely caucus with Republicans make up 25% of the poll’s respondents.\n\n“To me, that's a little bit of something to be paying attention to,” Selzer said. “Because we've seen this happen in the past. A non-Trump candidate could say, 'I've got to get people to come to the caucus who are outside of the GOP base.’ So, if a candidate can grow the people who are coming to the caucuses, that is the way in, because Trump is strong with that base.”\n\nBrian Alstrom, a 48-year-old independent voter and poll respondent, said he would consider caucusing in January — if it looks like some of the candidates opposing Trump have a chance.\n\n“I did vote for him both times because it was the lesser of two evils,” Alstrom said of Trump’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns. “But it was hard to even listen to him speak. I’m just done with him. Hopefully I don’t have to vote for him again, because I’m not going to vote for Joe Biden.”\n\nAlstrom, who is a Dorchester resident, said he’s soured on Trump’s personal approach to managing conflicts and his combative attitude. He said DeSantis is his top choice for president, followed by Scott.\n\nIn DeSantis, Alstrom sees an appealing candidate with a “common sense approach” to issues that are important to him, such as the economy and national security.\n\n“Florida speaks for itself in how successful they’ve been,” he said. “... I’d love to see that transfer to the rest of our country.”\n\nDonald Trump has never been viewed favorably by more Iowa Republican caucusgoers\n\nSince his presidency ended and as he has mounted a third campaign for the White House, Trump has been criminally indicted four times, has attacked Kim Reynolds, Iowa’s popular Republican governor, and has held relatively few campaign events in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\nAnd yet, Trump has never been viewed favorably by more of Iowa’s likely Republican caucusgoers than he is now, the Iowa Poll shows.\n\nIn August 2015, Trump was viewed favorably by 61% and unfavorably by 35% — his best showing among likely GOP caucusgoers during the 2016 caucus cycle. Trump went on to finish second in Iowa’s Republican caucuses behind U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nMore:Candidates try to clear GOP debate fundraising hurdles. Is it changing their Iowa strategy?\n\nNow, Trump is viewed favorably by 65%. That includes 42% who view him “very favorably” — the best showing of any of the 2024 candidates. Another 33% view him unfavorably, and 2% are not sure.\n\nTrump’s best showing is among self-identified Republicans, with 77% viewing him favorably and 21% viewing him unfavorably.\n\nHe also does well with those who make less than $70,000 a year (74% favorable, 25% unfavorable) and among evangelicals (74% favorable, 25% unfavorable).\n\nDeSantis’ overall favorability numbers are about on par with Trump’s.\n\nThe Florida governor is viewed favorably by 66% of likely GOP caucusgoers and unfavorably by 29%. Another 5% are not sure.\n\nAmong self-identified Republicans, DeSantis is viewed favorably by 74% and unfavorably by 21% — numbers that are about equal to Trump’s.\n\nMore:Republican presidential candidates woo Iowa's pivotal evangelicals to pry them away from Trump\n\nPoll respondent Rick Williams, a 72-year-old Holstein resident and self-identified Republican, said he considers himself a Trump supporter and believes the former president is being unfairly targeted in the series of criminal indictments that have been unveiled this year.\n\nStill, he plans to support someone else in the caucuses. Right now, he prefers DeSantis.\n\n“Trump supporters are going to support him no matter what if he's the nominee,” Williams said. “But we need the independents. We can't win with just us. We've got to get the independents, and I don't know if he can swing them.”\n\nThe Florida governor has higher favorability ratings with independents than Trump: 52% view him favorably, and 43% view him unfavorably.\n\nMore:Mike Pence is asking Iowans to choose him for president. Some say Jan. 6 is 'holding him back'\n\nFor Trump, it’s the inverse: 44% of independents view him favorably, while a majority, 53%, view him unfavorably.\n\nWilliams, a semi-retired paramedic, said Scott is currently his second-choice candidate.\n\nScott is viewed favorably by 59% and unfavorably by 17%. But a higher percentage — 24% — are unsure, indicating they don’t know enough about him to say one way or the other.\n\nGenevieve Hefel, a 63-year-old Dubuque resident and poll respondent, said she voted for Trump in the 2020 election but has felt her support for the former president wane.\n\nBecause of the recent indictments, Hefel, a retired Army sergeant, said she believes there’s “too much noise” around Trump for him to be able to defeat a Democratic opponent in the general election.\n\nHefel said she’s still considering other Republican contenders in the race, but she’s drawn to Scott’s “positive message and Christian beliefs” and plans to caucus for him.\n\n“He's able to carry on a conversation to get his point across without having to be ignorant or raise his voice,” Hefel said, reflecting on an interview she saw Scott give recently. “He handled it very professionally and calmly, and I thought he made very good points.”\n\nScott does best with those age 55 and older, with 70% viewing him favorably and 16% viewing him unfavorably.\n\nHaley is viewed favorably by 53% and unfavorably by 26%. Another 21% are not sure.\n\nMike Pence, Chris Christie among those with highest unfavorable ratings\n\nSeven candidates are underwater, meaning more likely Republican caucusgoers view them unfavorably than favorably.\n\nThey include Binkley (12% favorable, 21% unfavorable), Hurd (13%-22%), Hutchinson (20%-32%), Johnson (18%-22%) and Suarez (12%-23%).\n\nPence is viewed favorably by 42% and unfavorably by 53%, with 5% who aren’t sure. Even though he’s underwater, a plurality — 33% — say they have a “mostly” favorable view of the former vice president.\n\nBut he holds no advantage with evangelicals, despite his efforts to highlight his own faith and connect with Iowa’s religious conservatives: 43% view him favorably and 51% view him unfavorably — numbers that mirror his overall favorability numbers.\n\nAmong all the candidates, Christie is viewed unfavorably by the greatest share of poll respondents, with 60% saying they view him unfavorably, including 31% who view him “very” unfavorably. Another 28% say they view him favorably and 12% say they’re not sure.\n\nNo 2024 presidential candidate performs better than Iowa’s own Republican elected officials.\n\nReynolds commands the highest numbers, with 81% viewing her favorably (including 50% who view her very favorably), 18% who view her unfavorably and 1% who are not sure.\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley is viewed favorably by 73%, unfavorably by 22%, and 5% are not sure.\n\nU.S. Sen. Joni Ernst is viewed favorably by 72%, unfavorably by 24%, and 4% are not sure.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register. Reach her at bpfann@dmreg.com or 515-284-8244.

The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect their proportions among voters in the list.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 406 voters likely to attend the 2024 Iowa Republican caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register, NBC News and Mediacom is prohibited.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/09/27/republican-gop-debate-california-live-updates/70922686007/", "title": "GOP debate recap: Arizona's abortion-rights initiative draws questions", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nSeven Republican presidential contenders faced off a second time Wednesday in a debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library & Museum in Simi Valley, Calif.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the 2024 GOP front-runner, was not participating. On stage were North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum; former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley; former Vice President Mike Pence; businessman Vivek Ramaswamy; and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who was in the first debate, did not meet the second debate's criteria.\n\nArizona's abortion-rights ballot initiative was brought up at the event, which started at 6 p.m. Arizona and California time on Fox Business, Univision and streamed on Rumble.\n\nCandidates discuss how they will lower energy prices\n\nAs gas and oil costs rise again, the moderators asked Republican candidates how they plan to bring energy prices down.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy said he would ensure America takes advantage of its domestic natural resources despite limitations in the courts and the administrative state.\n\nPointing to energy policies in the Trump-Pence administration, Mike Pence pledged to open federal lands for drilling and promote an “all of the above” energy strategy.\n\n“I believe in the next 10 years with the right policies and leadership experience in the White House, we can reclaim our role as the leading energy producer on Earth,” Pence said. “That will grow the American economy for generations to come.”\n\nNikki Haley also favored energy independence, saying energy security ensures national security. She accused Ron DeSantis of banning oil fracking and drilling in Florida, which DeSantis adamantly denied. He cited his commitment to American energy dominance in west Texas that favors oil and gas production over environmentally friendly policies.\n\nDoug Burgum spoke on his North Dakota track record for opposing the Biden administration in court to allow oil and gas leases on public lands.\n\n“We are fighting the Biden administration on 20 fronts. Energy economy, national security I’ve been talking about it since day one,” he said. “We’ve got the answer in North Dakota.”\n\n— Hayleigh Evans\n\nArizona's abortion-rights ballot initiative comes up late in debate\n\nArizona was invoked about an hour and 45 minutes into the debate when Ron DeSantis was asked how he would appeal to voters in the state who will also likely be deciding a ballot measure that would enshrine the right to abortion in the state, which likely will be supported by Democrats and bring many to the polls.\n\nA coalition of advocacy groups launched a campaign to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot next year asking Arizona voters to protect and expand abortion rights in the state. DeSantis said he had success in Florida even in places typically thought of as liberal.\n\n\"We were winning in places like Miami Dade County, Palm Beach,” he said. “I reject the idea that pro-lifers are to blame for midterm defeats.”\n\nHe turned back to Donald Trump and again criticized him for not showing up to defend his record for electoral losses during his tenure.\n\nThe question then went to Christie, with Dana Perino adding that Republicans have lost elections on the abortion issue.\n\nHe emphasized that he was the only Republican on the stage who was elected in a Democrat or blue state.\n\n\"That is where the fight is really tough for Republicans,” he said, adding that he has experience winning over voters while fighting abortion.\n\nDeSantis said Republicans need to hold Democrats accountable for “extremism” supporting abortion “all the way up to the moment of birth.”\n\n\"What we did is 14 times in eight years I vetoed Planned Parenthood funding. I kept saying no because I believe in life,” Christie said.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\nCandidates talk about education controversies\n\nThe candidates were asked about some of the hot-button issues related to public education and offered their takes on the most challenging issues.\n\nNikki Haley took a question on how to improve education and responded by saying that she would strive to improve performance on reading and other subjects before jumping into more controversial social issues regarding education.\n\n“We’ve got to quit spending time on this DEI and CRT,” she said, referring to the acronyms for “diversity, equity and inclusion” and “critical race theory.”\n\nChristie was asked about school performance in New Jersey being low, and responded by saying that the gap between minority student performance improved during his tenure.\n\nHe said the problem was unions.\n\n\"This public school system is no longer run by the public. It is run by the teachers' unions in this country,” Christie said before referring to first lady Jill Biden, who teaches at a community college. “When you have the president of the United States sleeping with a member of the teacher’s union there is no chance you can take the stranglehold of the teachers union away.”\n\nDeSantis was asked about his previous comments about education in his state and how it addresses slavery.Florida’s education standards have been criticized for emphasizing that some Black people benefited from slavery.\n\nDeSantis, responding to reporter questions in July, said, “They’re probably going to show that some of the folks that eventually parlayed, you know, being a blacksmith into doing things later in life.”\n\nDeSantis responded to the question saying his comments were a “hoax” promoted by Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe said changes he’s made in Florida now emphasize civics and the U.S. Constitution.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\n2 candidates suggest ending birthright US citizenship\n\nVivek Ramaswamy took a question on his previous statements that he would like to end birthright citizenship as one way to address illegal immigration.\n\nIlia Calderón of Univision asked him about his comments that he would deport families, including the children born in the U.S. who are citizens.\n\n\"You are right about that, Ilia. I favor ending birthright citizenship,” Ramaswamy said.\n\nHe said his reading of the 14th Amendment could be used to argue that people who have broken the law to cross the border are not protected by that amendment.\n\nTim Scott agreed, and said that the 14th Amendment was written to address the issue of slavery, not illegal border crossing, and he agreed that its protections should not be extended to the children of people who cross the border.\n\nThe 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 and granted citizenship to people “born or naturalized in the United States,” including formerly enslaved people.\n\nIt also banned people who “engaged in insurrection” against the United States from holding any elected office without the approval of two-thirds of the House and Senate.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\nCandidates brawl over immigration and border policy\n\nImmigration took center stage early on in the second Republican presidential primary debate. Moderators asked questions of the candidates tied to the border and immigration 20 minutes into the start of the debate in California. That stands in contrast to the first debate, where immigration didn't come up for more than an hour.\n\nThe moderators asked the candidates pointed questions about their stances and past comments on immigration and the border.\n\nModerator Ilia Calderón kicked off the section on immigration playing comments from President Ronald Reagan talking about a law he championed that provided amnesty to roughly 3 million undocumented immigrants in 1986.\n\nShe asked Chris Christie whether he should support a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.\n\nChristie said he supported legal immigration, saying millions of jobs are available to those who entered the country lawfully. But he said security at the border needed to be beefed up and called for the deployment of additional National Guard troops. Anyone who crossed illegally should be sent back, Christie said.\n\nNikki Hailey accused Biden of encouraging illegal immigration with his policies. She also called for tougher measures at the border and internally, calling on the U.S. government to defund so-called “sanctuary cities” and instead use that money to strengthen security at the northern and southern borders.\n\nRon DeSantis largely sidestepped a question about China’s growing influence in Latin America but used that time to rail against China and what he called a “surrender” by the Biden administration.\n\nDeSantis said the U.S. needs to be tougher on China and cited his work as governor to prevent China from buying land in Florida.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy called for the militarization of the border, as well as defunding sanctuary cities and pressuring Mexico to do more. But he notably also called for a change to the 14th Amendment, which allows for birthright citizenship in the United States.\n\nTim Scott leaned into the idea of doing away with birthright citizenship, arguing that the 14th Amendment was drafted to deal with the end of slavery, not with immigration. He argued that individuals who entered the country illegally are not subject to the Constitution and that their children are therefore not eligible for birthright citizenship.\n\nMike Pence once again boasted about his work with immigration as vice president, including negotiating the creation of the Migrant Protection Protocols. He also called for greater border security measures and said he would pressure Congress to do more, such as finding a permanent solution for undocumented youth known as Dreamers.\n\nLater in the debate, Ramaswamy was asked about how to stop fentanyl smuggling that largely comes through the ports of entry at the border. His response was to seal the deal and use the military to seal drug tunnels. He also said more needed to be done to stop the demand, particularly from young people using social media.\n\nDeSantis also echoed past comments saying that he supported using the U.S. military to go after drug cartels.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s campaign issued a statement rebuking all of the Republican candidates, accusing them of supporting failed immigration policies championed by Donald Trump, calling them political gimmicks.\n\n\"If MAGA Republicans actually cared about securing our border, they would not stand with House Republicans' proposed devastating cuts to border security that would eliminate hundreds of CBP staff and would surge thousands of pounds of drugs into the country,\" campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said. \"Not one person on that stage is serious about enacting meaningful immigration reform, and it shows.\"\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\nTrump criticizes electric vehicles in speech ahead of debate\n\nFormer President Donald Trump criticized electric vehicles Wednesday during his prime-time speech at Drake Enterprises, a Michigan auto-parts supplier ahead of the GOP debate.\n\nThe United Auto Workers union is in a pitched battle for higher wages and other concessions from major automakers, and President Joe Biden walked with union workers Tuesday. The business Trump visited is not unionized.\n\nTrump said he supported the union workers and that they would be harmed by Biden’s policies.\n\n\"In two or three years you will not have one job in this state,” Trump said.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Drake Enterprises makes automotive and heavy-duty truck components, including gear shift levers for big trucks that could become obsolete if the industry incorporates electric vehicles.Trump hit directly on that point throughout his remarks, repeatedly criticizing electric vehicles and Biden’s policies incentivizing them.\n\n\"If you want to buy an electric car that’s absolutely fine I’m all for it but we should not be forcing consumers to buy electric vehicies,” Trump said. “They are going to destroy the supply chain.”\n\nIn his characteristic, wandering style, Trump tied that issue to school choice.\n\n“I want choice in schools and in the purchase of automobiles,” Trump said.\n\nHe also said the electric batteries on semitrucks are so large they leave little room for cargo.\n\n“The auto industry is being assassinated,” Trump continued. “These are built specifically for people who want to take very short trips.”\n\nHe accused Biden of wanting to outlaw electric vehicles, which Trump said he would not do.\n\nThe Biden campaign immediate replied to Trump’s comments, issuing a lengthy statement that criticized Trump’s record for allowing U.S. companies to offshore labor during his presidency.\n\nIt also said the Inflation Reduction Act Biden signed into law was specifically aimed at keeping U.S. manufacturing strong by incentivizing U.S. made products.\n\n“Donald Trump is lying about President Biden’s agenda to distract from his failed track record of trickle-down tax cuts, closed factories, and jobs outsourced to China,” Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said in a written statement.\n\nThere is no ‘EV mandate.’ Simply put: Trump had the United States losing the EV race to China and if he had his way, the jobs of the future would be going to China. President Biden is delivering where Donald Trump failed by bringing manufacturing back home, and with it, good-paying jobs for the American people.”\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\nDebate's bilingual message signals importance of Latino voters\n\nThe Republican primary debate kicked off at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, Calif., with a bilingual message for viewers.\n\nThe event is moderated by Stuart Varney and Dana Perino from Fox News and Ilia Calderón from Univision, which is broadcasting the debate in Spanish with dubbed translations from the seven candidates.\n\nThis signals the importance that the Republican Party is placing on Latino voters in the United States. There are an estimated 34.5 million Latinos who are eligible to vote, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nCalifornia is home to nearly a quarter of eligible Latino voters, about 8.3 million. Texas, Florida, New York and Arizona round out the top 5 states with the largest number of eligible Latino voters. Pew estimates about 1.3 million Latino voters live in Arizona.\n\nWhile most Latino voters have cast ballots for Democrats historically, Trump increased his share of the Latino vote in 2020. Ahead of the 2022 elections, the Republican National Committee opened Hispanic Community Centers targeting Latino voters in cities around the U.S., including one in Tucson.\n\nThat year, voters in southern Arizona elected Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., flipping a swing district that helped Republicans retake the House.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\nDeSantis PAC targets Ramaswamy ahead of debate\n\nJust hours before Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy would face off on the GOP debate stage, the political action committee backing the former launched an ad comparing Ramaswamy to former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe clips by the Never Back Down PAC advertisement include Ramaswamy’s introduction from the first debate, when he described himself as a “skinny guy with a funny last name.” That is juxtaposed with a clip of Obama referring to himself as a “skinny guy with a funny name,” words he included in a 2004 speech to the Democratic National Convention when he was running for Senate that launched his political career.\n\nThe PAC isn’t the first to notice that apparent cribbing from Obama, a Democrat, but the ad runs more than a minute in length and includes several other nearly identical phrases used by Ramaswamy that first were used by Obama.\n\nDuring the first debate last month, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie criticized Ramaswamy for sounding like Obama.\n\n“I’m afraid we’re dealing with the same type of amateur,” Christie said after making that comparison, drawing boos from the crowd.\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\nWhat have the GOP candidates said about immigration?\n\nContenders for the Republican nomination will meet Wednesday to present their views on several policies. With the second debate taking place in California, the situation along the U.S.-Mexico border is sure to come up again.\n\nMonthly apprehensions have once again reached record numbers, after a few months of decreases when the U.S. ended pandemic restrictions at the border.\n\nDuring the first debate in Milwaukee, candidates spent just a few minutes discussing the border and immigration.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and several other candidates, said the U.S. government should consider military strikes against the cartel operations in Mexico. And that the military aid given to Ukraine should be redirected to the border.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott vowed to invest in additional barriers along the border, to continue the work by former President Donald Trump, who will once again not take part in the debate.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence cited his work under the Trump administration in pressuring Mexico to do more by deploying its National Guard and taking back migrants while they claimed asylum under several programs that have since been scaled down. He said a similar approach was needed.\n\nWednesday’s debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif., will be hosted jointly by Fox News and Univision. It's the first time a Republican primary debate has been broadcast in Spanish.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection released Sept. 22 its latest monthly report showing that the number of migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border passed 232,000 in August, a 26% increase compared to the previous month.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Border Patrol agents have resumed street releases along border communities given the increase and the lack of holding space at border facilities. The arrival of released migrants has also begun to strain cities in the interior of the country, where many of them are headed, including cities like New York and Chicago.\n\n— Rafael Carranza\n\nHow to watch Trump instead of the debate\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has again decided he doesn’t need to debate his Republican primary rivals, and instead will deliver a prime-time speech in Detroit at 5 p.m. Arizona time, which it appears will be viewable online via C-SPAN and other outlets online.\n\nPresident Joe Biden visited union workers in Michigan on Tuesday and became the first sitting president in history to walk a picket line when he joined the United Auto Workers. The union is pushing for higher wages and other concessions from top manufacturing companies.\n\nThe union has issued a statement rebuking Trump for his planned visit, but he’s doing it anyhow, and will speak at Drake Enterprises, a non-unionized auto parts supplier in Clinton Township.\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain appeared on CNN this week and called it a “pathetic irony” that Trump would appear a the nonunion factory to appeal to union voters, and said Trump’s record has been decidedly anti-union.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the company makes automotive and heavy-duty truck components, including gear shift levers for big trucks that could become obsolete if the industry incorporates electric vehicles. Trump’s audience will include several hundred current and former UAW members, as well as members of plumbers and pipefitters unions, according to the AP.\n\nThe FOX 2 Detroit television station also plans to carry the live broadcast of Trump online at https://www.c-span.org/video/?530700-1/fmr-pres-trump-holds-rally-detroit\n\n— Ryan Randazzo\n\nWhere do the GOP candidates stand on climate change?\n\nAbout 20 minutes into the first Republican debate in Milwaukee, moderators posed a question from a member of Young America's Foundation — a conservative environmental organization — asking how candidates would address young people’s fears that the Republican Party does not care about climate change.\n\nFour candidates spoke on the issue. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criticized President Joe Biden’s response to the Maui wildfire in August. Nikki Haley, former governor of South Carolina, acknowledged that climate change exists but believes the United States should take action once fellow polluters China and India curb their emissions, too. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott said bringing jobs back to America from China will improve the economy and benefit the environment.\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy took the strongest stance and denied climate change exists.\n\n“The climate change agenda is a hoax and we have to declare independence from it,” Ramaswamy said. “The anti-carbon agenda is the wet blanket of our economy. The reality is, more people are dying of bad climate change policies than they are of actual climate change.”\n\n– Hayleigh Evans\n\nMeet Wednesday’s GOP debate moderators\n\nThe second Republican presidential debate on Wednesday has three moderators. They are Dana Perino and Stuart Varney of Fox News and Ilia Calderón of Univision.\n\nPerino, who was one of former President George W. Bush’s White House press secretaries, said that without former President Donald Trump, the GOP front-runner on stage, the other candidates are competing to be the best alternative to him.\n\n“This debate is where the rubber meets the road,\" Perino told the Ventura County Star, which is part of the USA TODAY network. \"One of them has to show they can be the main rival to Trump.”\n\nEach candidate gets 60 seconds to answer a moderator’s question. If a candidate criticizes an opponent, the other candidate gets 30 seconds to respond, which is when Varney expects some personality clashes and raised voices.\n\n“We have a very loud buzzer,” Varney told the Star. “It’s up to us to retain control. The audience does not want a free-for-all.”\n\nThe debate starts at 6 p.m. Arizona and California time.\n\n— Ventura County (Calif.) Star\n\nWho will be Trump's 'main rival?'Fox moderators discuss GOP debate at Reagan Library\n\nChris Christie signals he will again target Trump\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is a former ally of former President Donald Trump who has reemerged as one of Trump’s fiercest Republican critics.\n\nOn Twitter Wednesday, Christie signaled that he again will try to take it to Trump on stage at the second GOP presidential debate in Simi Valley, Calif.\n\nHe was responded to a writer for SBNation.com who had posted on the social-media platform X a photo of Christie in the stands at Sunday’s Arizona Cardinals vs. Dallas Cowboys game in Glendale.\n\n“Ooooh who on the Cowboys is Chris Christie dating?!” James Dator tweeted.\n\nChristie reposted Dator’s tweet with the comment: “I was just a guy in the bleachers on Sunday... but after tonight, Trump will know we are never ever getting back together.”\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\nWho hasn’t made the debate stage yet this year?\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson failed to meet the criteria for participating in Wednesday night’s Republican presidential debate in California. He did take part in the first GOP debate.\n\nSome candidates failed to qualify for either debate. They are pastor Ryan Binkley; libertarian radio personality Larry Elder; former U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas; and businessman Perry Johnson\n\nTheir failure to make the debate stages raises serious questions about the continued viability of their candidacies.\n\nHurd acknowledged that Wednesday in a written statement. He said he was running for the White House to confront “generational-defining challenges” such as artificial intelligence; the border crisis; and what he called “our new Cold War with China.”\n\nHurd warned that if Republicans nominate former Trump or someone else who imitates Trump’s “divisive, crass behavior,” they will lose in 2024.\n\n“My team and I are constantly evaluating whether we have the resources to chart a path to victory. I'm headed to New Hampshire to spread my message to the Granite State ahead of the First In the Nation primary. Educating voters on how to solve these existential issues is important, and hopefully other candidates will follow my lead.”\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\n5th GOP presidential debate for the Reagan Library\n\nThe GOP debate on Wednesday night will be the fifth hosted at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library & Museum in California.\n\nPast Republican White House hopefuls clashed there in 2007, 2008, 2011 and 2015.\n\nThe museum opened on Nov. 4, 1991. Five living U.S. presidents for the first time were in attendance together at the same place and time. Then-President George H.W. Bush, who was Reagan's vice president, joined Reagan and former Presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon.\n\n— Ventura County (Calif.)

After high school, he attended Harvard to study biology and began honing his political views. He graduated Yale Law School the same year as U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, who's also a native of southwest Ohio. He now lives outside of Columbus.\n\nRamaswamy entered the race earlier this year promising to out-Trump former President Donald Trump, who will not participate in Wednesday's debate. He has since campaigned heavily in Iowa and New Hampshire, and some recent polls show him gaining on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for second place nationally.\n\nRamaswamy then entered the world of biotech investing, founding the pharmaceutical research company Roivant Sciences in 2014. He later abandoned Roivant after he clashed with colleagues over how they should respond to the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in 2020. Ramaswamy would not back a show of support for the Black Lives Matters movement.\n\nMore recently, Ramaswamy founded Strive Asset Management, an investment firm that aims to persuade companies to stay out of politics and social issues.

During both rounds, people could order a maximum of four tests per household. This third round doubles that.\n\nThe administration has delivered approximately 350 million free tests so far, the fact sheet said, and this round of tests is being funded with money made available in last year’s stimulus package. The White House has pushed for $22.5 billion in additional funding for for testing, treatment and vaccines, and warned on Tuesday that more tests would not be forthcoming without additional spending.\n\n“Due to Congress’s failure to provide additional funding for the nation’s Covid-19 response, the Administration cannot continue making the types of federal investments needed to sustain domestic testing manufacturing capacity, and this may jeopardize the federal government’s ability to provide free tests moving forward,” the fact sheet said.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly warned of negative effects to the federal Covid response as part of its push for more funding, including what it says are threats to the production of new vaccines. At one point earlier this month, the administration asserted that 100 million infections were possible in the fall and winter, though the White House has not released underlying data to support the projection, raising questions about whether political considerations helped shape the figure.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance to endorse Covid-19 testing for all domestic travelers.

Even though you might not see it on the packaging, the federal government has extended expiration dates on many of these home tests. Consumers can check this Food and Drug Administration website to find extended expiration dates for home coronavirus tests.\n\nHow can I order free home COVID tests from the federal government?\n\nConsumers can now order four free coronavirus home tests per household through the government-run website CovidTests.gov.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has tests on hand that will be shipped to homes by the United States Postal Service beginning the week of Oct. 2. HHS also said it will award $600 million to a dozen domestic coronavirus test manufacturers to shore up the government's supply of home tests. The investment will deliver about 200 million new over-the-counter coronavirus tests over the next 18 months, officials said.\n\nHow can I tell if my test has expired?\n\nThe coronavirus home test kits have an expiration date printed on the box. Yet the test kits will include multiple reminders for consumers to check the FDA website for extended expiration dates. The test kits will be delivered with a sticker on the box and a leaflet in the box informing consumers to check the FDA for extended expiration dates. Consumers also can call the agency's hotline at 1-888-INFO-FDA for more information.\n\nHow long have COVID test expiration dates been extended?\n\nThe FDA extends expiration dates when the manufacturer has data showing the test can deliver accurate results beyond the original expiration date.\n\nThe length of the extension varies by test maker for 37 approved home coronavirus tests, which are mostly \"antigen\" tests to detect a viral protein on the surface of the coronavirus. The shortest shelf life is four months for the 3EO Health COVID-19 Test. Tests from these six companies have the longest shelf life of 24 months: ACON Laboratories, Azure Biotech, Celltrion USA, GenBody, Princeton BioMeditech and Siemens Healthineers.\n\nThe shelf life for the popular Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self Test has been extended to 22 months. You can view the lot number of your Abbott BinaxNow test to find the updated expiration date.\n\nMy COVID test is beyond the extended expiration date. Can I still use it?\n\nThe FDA advises people to not use a coronavirus test beyond the extended expiration date. The test parts may degrade or break down, so kits used beyond the extended expiration date could give inaccurate test results, the agency said.\n\nMy home test was left outside in hot or freezing temperatures. Can I still use it?\n\nTest makers must perform stability testing to show the tests will work after being shipped in summer or winter. Still, extreme temperatures can affect test performance, the FDA said.\n\nIf you get a test kit that was delivered during hot or cold weather, you should bring the package inside to room temperature and not open it for a minimum of two hours. From there, consult the test's instructions. For example, if the control lines don't appear in the right locations, the test might not deliver accurate results.\n\nWhat can the antigen COVID tests detect?\n\nMost home tests are antigen tests that typically deliver results in about 15 minutes. Antigen tests are less sensitive than molecular PCR tests and less likely to detect the virus early in the infection, but experts say the tests can detect the virus when a person is infectious and likely to pass it to others.\n\nFor antigen tests, the FDA recommends consumers repeat testing following a negative result to reduce the risk an infection may have been missed. Those with symptoms should test again 48 hours after a negative test. If you don't have symptoms, the FDA recommends taking up to three tests over four-plus days with negative results, with 48 hours lapsing between each test.\n\nContributing: David Robinson, USA TODAY Network New York State Team", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/09/20/free-home-covid-tests-at-covidtests-gov/70913833007/", "title": "Four free home COVID tests at CovidTests.gov starts Monday", "text": "Consumers can once again get four free coronavirus home tests per household through the government-run website CovidTests.gov.\n\nThe Biden administration reopened the free test program beginning Monday, as the Department of Health and Human Services announced it will award $600 million to a dozen domestic coronavirus test manufacturers to shore up the government's supply of home tests.\n\nThe investment will deliver about 200 million new over-the-counter coronavirus tests, officials said.\n\nDuring four previous rounds, HHS secured and the Postal Service delivered more than 755 million tests free to households. The program ended at the conclusion of the COVID-19 public health emergency earlier this year. The federal government has continued to ship tests to nursing homes, low-income senior housing, the uninsured and underserved communities, officials said.\n\nHHS' Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response announced the contracts will range from $167 million to iHealth in California to $4.5 million to Advin in California. The a dozen test manufacturers employ hundreds of workers in seven states, officials said.\n\n“The Biden-Harris Administration, in partnership with domestic manufacturers, has made great strides in addressing vulnerabilities in the U.S. supply chain by reducing our reliance on overseas manufacturing,” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. “These critical investments will strengthen our nation’s production levels of domestic at-home COVID-19 rapid tests and help mitigate the spread of the virus.”HHS officials said the tests will detect the COVID-19 variants now circulating and can be used through the end of 2023.\n\nConsumers who order a new test will get a warning that the free tests might show expired dates on the box. The Food and Drug Administration extended expiration dates for home coronavirus tests.\n\nThe Biden administration launched CovidTests in early 2022 as long lines and home test shortages made it difficult for Americans to get checked for the contagious omicron variant, then the dominant strain. The federal government initially purchased 500 million home tests to be mailed to households so people could test themselves at home without a lab.\n\nCOVID-19 infections have been rising since early July, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. Hospitalizations are up 7.7% as of Sept. 9 and deaths 12.5% as of Sept. 16, but totals remain far below previous peaks.\n\nThe share of positive coronavirus tests climbed from about 4% in early June to 12.5% as of Sept. 16.

Several have written to CNN in recent days to vent their frustration that their kits have yet to arrive, some nearly a month after they requested them.\n\nAmericans have been able to order four free Covid-19 tests per residential address at covidtests.gov since January 18. The White House is distributing 1 billion tests, which had been in short supply at many retailers and online vendors during the surge of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in December and January.\n\nThe majority of CNN readers praised the ordering process, saying it was easy and swift.\n\nBut others ran into roadblocks. Most of them received messages saying orders had already been placed for their addresses, but some said they couldn’t get the tests delivered to PO boxes, mobile home parks, boats or rural addresses. Still others said the US Postal Service didn’t recognize their addresses or disqualified them because they run small businesses from their homes.\n\nStill waiting for their tests\n\nThose who requested tests received confirmation emails that said they’ll get tracking numbers and updates on expected delivery dates once their orders ship. But for some folks, that’s the last they heard about their tests.\n\nIrene DiCaprio, who placed her order on January 18, has not received any information about when her tests will arrive at her Orange, Connecticut, home. Several friends who live elsewhere in the state received their kits within a week or two of signing up.\n\nDiCaprio, 70, would like to have the tests in hand before she and her husband travel to Las Vegas in a few weeks for a family reunion that’s been on hold for two years. She has only one home test left from a box she bought at Walgreens. As a Medicare enrollee, she is not yet eligible to have the cost of home tests bought at retailers covered.\n\n“When I saw that it was $24 for the two of them, I thought, well, I’m not going to be buying many at the pharmacy,” said DiCaprio. “If I have to, I will. But I prefer not to, especially since I’m not going to get reimbursed.”\n\nMedicare has said it will start covering home tests bought at retailers in the early spring.\n\nDavid Baize of Rutherfordton, North Carolina, is surprised that federal officials have not put more of a focus on rapid delivery.\n\n“I would think something of this importance would have a high priority, and there would have been greater attention and effort as to how distribution would unfold,” said Baize, 67, who ordered the tests on January 19 but has yet to receive them.\n\nHe opened a case with the Postal Service on Sunday to try to get some answers but has yet to hear back. Meanwhile, his family in the Detroit area were sent their free federal tests soon after ordering them.\n\nAsked at a news conference Wednesday about the progress of the free home test program, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients commended the job the Postal Service is doing.\n\nOnce the package ships, more than 60% are delivered within 24 hours, and 90% within 48 hours, he noted.\n\n“This is an effort that has no precedent,” Zients said. “There’s been incredibly strong demand and incredibly strong execution shipping 200 million tests directly to Americans’ doorsteps.”\n\nFalling case counts\n\nSome of the urgency to get the free federal kits has passed. Home tests are more widely available at retailers now, and many Americans with private insurance can receive up to eight free tests per covered individual each month.\n\nAlso, the Omicron wave is receding. When the covidtests.gov site opened on January 18, the average number of new Covid-19 cases reported daily in the US was nearly 750,000. That number has since fallen to just over 136,000 per day.\n\nStill, tests will be needed to interrupt the spread of Covid-19 over the long term since they allow people to get quick diagnoses and access treatment, as well as protect more vulnerable Americans, Inglesby told CNN.\n\n“We’re very happy to see that subsiding,” he said of the Omicron surge. “But we’re going to need these tests for the long run.”", "authors": ["Tami Luhby Naomi Thomas", "Tami Luhby", "Naomi Thomas"], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/12/15/winter-surge-likely-administration-steps-up-covid-19-effort/10899434002/", "title": "Free COVID tests among new Biden measures ahead of winter surge", "text": "As COVID-19 cases rise again with the arrival of winter and holiday gatherings, the White House on Thursday announced its plans for controlling cases this winter.\n\nThe plans include:\n\nOffering Americans four more free coronavirus tests per household\n\nCollaborating with communities to open pop-up or mobile vaccination sites\n\nPre-positioning critical supplies like masks gloves and gowns from the Strategic National Stockpile\n\nProviding more support to nursing homes and long-term care facilities to protect the most vulnerable.\n\nAlthough the administration had said it couldn't afford to continue COVID-19 support without additional funding from Congress, it has managed to pay for these measures out of the 2021 American Rescue Plan, an administration official said in a Wednesday news conference.\n\nCOVID-19 cases have climbed across 90% of the country in recent weeks, with nearly 459,000 cases reported the week of Dec. 7, including nearly 3,000 deaths. COVID-19 in wastewater has fallen nationally in recent days, suggesting infections are likely to fall, although it has been climbing in some states, including Massachusetts.\n\n\"While COVID isn't the disruptive force it once was, we are focused on ensuring that the U.S. is prepared for this winter, no matter what the virus throws at us,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House Coronavirus Response coordinator, told media in a Thursday briefing.\n\nHere are some of the major initiatives:\n\nHow to get free tests\n\nPeople will be able to order four more free at-home coronavirus tests to be mailed to them. The tests will begin to ship starting the week of Dec. 19 and can be ordered via COVIDTests.gov, or by calling 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489) between 8 a.m. and midnight Eastern time any day of the week.\n\nMore free tests will also be made available at schools, community health centers, rural health clinics, long-term care facilities, and other locations.\n\nPeople with health insurance can also access eight free tests per month.\n\nPublic health officials have said that anyone visiting vulnerable friends or relatives this holiday season should take a coronavirus test ahead of time to ensure they are not passing on the virus.\n\nProtecting the most vulnerable\n\nThe administration is providing testing, vaccinations and treatments for nursing homes and long-term care facilities, whose residents are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19.\n\nWhile most of the Americans dying of COVID now are over 65, Jha said fewer than half of nursing home residents have received an updated vaccine and the government is hoping to change that.\n\nThey also plan to release a \"winter playbook\" for administrators of nursing homes and long-term care facilities, summarizing important actions to reduce severe illness, including vaccinations, testing and improving indoor air quality.\n\nNursing home staff will now be able to administer COVID-19 vaccines to all residents.\n\nMaking sure treatments like Paxlovid are available at no cost\n\nAlthough monoclonal antibodies are no longer effective, the government expects to have sufficient doses of the antiviral Paxlovid available at no cost for anyone who needs it.\n\nPaxlovid and other prescription antivirals are recommended for people at risk of severe disease and are extremely effective at preventing hospitalization and death if given within the first five days of showing symptoms.\n\nJha emphasized that Paxlovid and other antivirals have been extremely effective at preventing severe disease. Anyone over 60 or who has a chronic disease, \"there should be a good reason not to treat,\" he said.\n\nStaying on top of the spread of variants BQ.1, BQ.1.1 and XBB\n\nThe administration promises to continue closely monitoring emerging variants and assess their potential impacts on testing, treatments and vaccines. The BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 variants dominate U.S. cases, with a variety of other variants accounting for the remaining one-third of the total infections.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently expanded its variant reporting from wastewater and international travelers at major U.S. airports, providing an early warning of variants and trends.\n\nThe XBB variant has been raising concerns recently because it evades some natural protection against COVID-19, but \"in many ways, it's more of the same,\" said Dr. Jacob Lemieux, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Mass General Research Institute, both in Boston.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday, Lemieux and other members of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness said they are not particularly worried about any of the circulating variants. They are still effectively treated by antivirals and seem no more likely to cause severe disease in vaccinated or previously infected people than other variants.\n\nWhile the BA.1 variant jumped from 10% of cases nationwide to 90% in 10 days earlier this year, \"we're not seeing a rate of increase anything like that\" now, said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nMaking COVID vaccines and boosters accessible to everyone\n\nAdministration support will include helping communities set up mobile and pop-up vaccination sites, as well as accessible vaccine clinics and at-home vaccine administration. Many of these pop-up sites will also offer free testing and treatments.\n\nThe administration is also calling on hospitals to encourage vaccination before a patient is released.\n\nMany of those dying of COVID-19 today are those who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, particularly older people.\n\nVaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of death eight-fold in people ages 65 to 80 and four-fold in those over 80, according to a recent CDC study, \"which is a really good thing and is one of the reasons why you want to keep people up to date with vaccination,\" Hanage said.\n\nEncouraging masking\n\nThe administration has given out hundreds of millions of masks for free at pharmacies and now will expand that distribution to include food banks and community health centers among other locations.\n\nLemieux said he would encourage people to wear masks indoors in dense gatherings or where there are people at high risk. \"I would definitely consider it,\" he said, adding that he wears a mask himself when indoors with others.\n\nOverall, he and other public health experts say, America has the tools to fight COVID-19 this winter – if people will use them.\n\n\"Our toolkit is about as good as it's going to get for COVID-19 for the foreseeable future,\" Lemieux said. \"We need to make sure these tools are available to people.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

The video, circulating on social media, shows a seemingly distressed inmate on the edge of a roof at a building at Elmore Correctional Facility, while a group of prison staff look at him from the ground. An officer walks across the roof and drags the inmate back from the edge, then appears to punch him several times. Officer Ell White has been placed on mandatory leave pending investigation, a spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Corrections wrote in an email. The prison system said Jimmy K. Norman, a 44-year-old inmate, “had climbed on top of the facility chapel, prompting Officer White and other correctional officers to attempt to escort Norman off the roof.” The Law Enforcement Services Division of the Alabama Department of Corrections is investigating the incident and response by staff, the prison system said. The U.S. Department of Justice has an ongoing civil lawsuit against Alabama over conditions in its prisons, saying the state is failing to protect male inmates from staff and other incarcerated men and calling the system one of the most understaffed and violent in the country, violating the ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Nearly every single Alaskan got a financial windfall amounting to more than $3,000 Tuesday, the day the state began distributing payments from its investment fund that has been seeded with money from the state’s oil riches. The payments, officially called the Permanent Fund Dividend, amounted to $2,622 – the highest amount ever. Alaska lawmakers added $662 as a one-time benefit to help residents with high energy costs. A total of $1.6 billion in direct deposits began hitting bank accounts Tuesday, and physical checks will arrive later for those who opted for them. Residents use the money in various ways – buying big-screen TVs, vehicles or other goods; using it for vacations; or putting it in savings or college funds. In rural Alaska, the money can help offset the enormous costs of fuel and food, like $14 for a 12-pack of soda, $4 for a celery bunch and $3 for a small container of Greek yogurt. “We’re experiencing record high inflation that we haven’t seen since the first PFD was paid in 1982,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a video. The timing of the checks couldn’t have come at a better time for those living on the state’s vast western coast, which was devastated over the weekend by the remnants of Typhoon Merbok. Damage to homes and infrastructure was widespread along 1,000 miles of coastline.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Wildfires torching areas of the state are threatening the Sonoran Desert’s iconic saguaro cacti, in turn threatening the lives of the birds and other wildlife that depend on them. To help replace the many saguaros burned in wildfires, the Tucson Audubon Society is launching a three-year restoration and replanting project that will bring approximately 14,000 saguaros to southern Arizona. According to the Tucson Audubon, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting birds and their habitats, 100 species of animals use saguaros, including bats, birds, mammals and insects, while 14 species of birds nest in saguaro cactus cavities, including elf owls, pygmy owls and desert purple martins, among others. Saguaros are like apartment buildings of wildlife activity. Bats feed on the nectar of the flowers sprouting at the top of the saguaro, while in other parts of the plant, bird species live inside cavities carved by other birds. Then, as food sources become scarce later in the summer, animals and insects will feed on the saguaro’s fruit, according to the National Park Service. The entire project will receive an initial investment of $300,000 that will be given to the organization over the next three years from the Wildlife Conservation Society. The project also will receive U.S. Forest Service grants for about $209,000 for post-burn fire recovery in areas torched during the Bighorn fire that occurred in the Santa Catalina Mountains and the Bush fire that occurred in the Tonto National Forest in 2020.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The owner of an alternative-meat purveyor is accused of biting a human nose after a Razorbacks football game. Beyond Meat Chief Operating Officer Doug Ramsey was arrested over the weekend after a physical altercation in a parking garage following a University of Arkansas football game. Ramsey, 53, was charged with terroristic threatening and third-degree battery Saturday, according to booking records at the Washington County Jail. He was released Sunday on $10,000 bond. According to the preliminary campus police report obtained by local Arkansas television station KNWA/Fox 24, a road rage altercation saw Ramsey punch through the back windshield of another man’s Subaru in the parking garage after the vehicle made contact with the front tire of Ramsey’s car. According to the preliminary report, once the Subaru owner got out of the vehicle, Ramsey punched him repeatedly and bit his nose, “ripping the flesh on the tip of the nose.” The man also claimed Ramsey threatened to kill him. A responding police officer found “two males with bloody faces” at the garage just outside Razorback Stadium after the game against Missouri State. Occupants of both vehicles got out to help separate the two men. Ramsey was named Beyond Meat’s COO in December after spending three decades at Tyson Foods.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Supervisors in the city voted Tuesday for a trial run allowing police to monitor in real time private surveillance cameras in certain circumstances, despite strong objections from civil liberties groups alarmed by the potential impact to privacy. San Francisco, like many places across the country, is struggling to balance public safety with constitutional protections. The ability to monitor in real time was requested by San Francisco Mayor London Breed and supported by merchants and residents who say police officers need more tools to combat drug dealing and retail theft that they say have marred the city’s quality of life. It is temporary and will sunset in 15 months. The vote was 7-4, with some supervisors astonished that the governing board of politically liberal San Francisco would consider granting more powers to law enforcement in a city that celebrates its activism. Others pushed back, saying they were tired of sophisticated criminal networks taking advantage of San Francisco’s lax attitude toward retail theft and other property crimes. Supervisor Aaron Peskin, a privacy advocate who successfully passed legislation in 2019 to ban the use of facial recognition software by San Francisco police and other city departments, said they worked hard to negotiate safeguards, including strict reporting requirements when live monitoring was used.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: An attorney for a state lawmaker has asked El Paso County prosecutors to dismiss a felony charge that he voted outside the district he lives in and represents in 2020, citing incorrect information presented to a grand jury before his indictment. Dan Kaplan, an attorney for Democratic state Sen. Pete Lee, filed a motion to dismiss Tuesday, saying the wrong residency information was provided to prosecutors by the state Office of Attorney Registration, The Colorado Sun reports. The office told prosecutors of the mistake last week, and the El Paso County District Attorney’s Office is reviewing the case, spokesman Howard Black said. Lee, whose website says he practiced law for 25 years, chairs the state Senate Judiciary Committee. He was indicted in August. “We believe that the erroneous information would have resulted in no indictment being issued,” said Lee, who previously denied any wrongdoing. The felony charge carries a possible penalty of one to three years in prison and a possible fine of up to $100,000. Lee’s next court hearing is set for Oct. 18. Lee is not seeking a second term in November’s election after being elected to represent his El Paso County district in 2018. He previously served in the House.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Two parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre and the daughter of the school’s slain principal testified Wednesday of the fear and pain they have suffered from being targeted with threats by those who believe the lie that the shooting was a hoax. David Wheeler, Jennifer Hensel and Erica Lafferty are among those suing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for promoting the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on his media platforms, including his Infowars web show. The plaintiffs, who gave often emotional testimony, say Jones’ promotion of Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on his show led the them being threatened by deniers of the shooting, including some who claimed their loved ones never existed. They say they’ve endured death threats and in-person harassment, video recording by strangers and abusive comments on social media. Some families moved to avoid harassment. “There are days when grief is just so awful,” said Hensel, whose 6-year-old daughter, Avielle Richman, was among those slain. “Then you add on the idea that people think you made all this up for money or that your child didn’t exist. That compounds everything.” One of the jurors wept as Hensel testified and was comforted by another panel member.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A judge ruled Monday that the Port of Wilmington’s financially ailing operator must pay a ship loading company more than $28million – an amount that piles onto a string of hefty bills already weighing on a company with operations that generate thousands of jobs in the state. The ruling - a $21.5 million payment, plus interest - comes four years after Delaware privatized the port through a 50-year lease with Gulftainer, a shipping and logistics company based in the United Arab Emirates. As state officials negotiated the lease in early 2018, they also pressured Gulftainer and Murphy Marine Services – a local ship loading company already doing business at the port – to combine operations, according to court documents. The companies obliged but ultimately could not agree on a price that Gulftainer’s local subsidiary, GT USA Wilmington, should pay to take over the smaller operation. At the time, Murphy Marine wanted roughly $26 million. Gulftainer officials saw the company as far less valuable. The dispute quickly became hostile, and the next month Murphy Marine filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court, claiming Gulftainer’s officials had carried out “bulldogged” efforts to strip it of millions of dollars.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A 44-year-old man was arrested after allegedly using paint to vandalize the Washington Monument on Tuesday evening, WUSA-TV reports. According to a statement from the United States Park Police, the man defaced an area at the base of the monument. The National Mall landmark is temporarily closed. National Park Service conservators are working on restoring the monument but say that process could take several weeks. Locals and tourists came out to the monument to see the vandalism. Reactions to the painted message were mixed. “No matter what people think and feel, they have no right to destroy historical property like this,” one woman said. “I don’t know how someone could just walk up and completely vandalize the Washington Monument, of all things,” a man said. “Not that I support this, but I understand that sometimes you got to make a statement,” one woman said. Mike Litterist of the National Park Service said crews were on site Wednesday morning to begin the cleanup process. Park Police identified the man arrested as Shaun Ray Deaton, of Bloomington, Indiana. Deaton was charged with trespassing, tampering and vandalism. Police said it was an initial criminal charge, and as the investigation continues, there may be additional charges.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The judge overseeing the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz refused to step down Monday, rejecting a motion by his attorneys who accused her of being biased against their client and prejudicing the jurors who will decide if he should die for murdering 17 people four years ago. Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer denied the motion, saying only that it was legally insufficient. Scherer last week chewed out lead defense attorney Melisa McNeill and her team outside the jury’s presence, accusing them of being “unprofessional” when they unexpectedly rested their case after only about 25 of the 80 witnesses they had told her and prosecutors they intended to testify had been called. The defense said in court documents filed last week that those comments and ones the judge later made to the jury were “the zenith of the cumulative disdain” they allege Scherer has shown throughout the case toward Cruz and themselves. The defense had no obligation to call all its proposed witnesses or notify the judge or prosecution when they planned to rest, legal observers have said. Prosecutors argued in court documents that Scherer’s comments didn’t rise to the level of demonstrating bias against Cruz. They cited a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says a judge’s “expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance and even anger” against the defense are not grounds for stepping down.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMacon: If approved by Congress after a three-year federal review wraps up this fall, mounds built by Muscogean people who were forcibly removed from their homeland 200 years ago would serve as the gateway to a new Ocmulgee National Park and Preserve, protecting 54 river-miles of floodplain where nearly 900 more sites of cultural or historic significance have been identified. Efforts to expand an existing historical park at the mounds site are in keeping with Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s “Tribal Homelands Initiative,” which supports fundraising to buy land and requires federal managers to seek out Indigenous knowledge about resources. “This kind of land acquisition represents the best of what our conservation efforts should look like: collaborative, inclusive, locally led, and in support of the priorities of our country’s tribal nations,” Haaland said at last weekend’s 30th Annual Ocmulgee Indigenous Celebration. In an era when some culture warriors see government as the enemy, years of coalition-building have eliminated any significant opposition to federal management in the reliably Republican center of a long-red state. Hunting will still be allowed, even encouraged, to keep feral hogs from destroying the ecosystem. Georgia’s congressional delegation is on board, and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation has been welcomed as an essential partner.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Maui County Council is pushing a resolution that would allow counties to set higher minimum wages than the state, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Maui leaders endorsed the idea from council member Gabe Johnson, who pointed to variances in the cost of living from one area to another in advocating for the move. Three other county councils would have to approve before the resolution could be considered in the Legislature next year, according to the news outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The University of Idaho’s plan to build the nation’s largest research dairy and experimental farm cleared a big hurdle Tuesday. Gov. Brad Little and two other statewide-elected officials on the Idaho Land Board approved the university’s plan to use $23 million to buy roughly 640 acres of farmland in south-central Idaho, the heart of the state’s dairy industry. That would be the main focus of the school’s proposed Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment. The dairy industry – Idaho’s is the third largest in the nation – faces a range of challenges with greenhouse gas emissions from animals, land and water pollution, and waste systems from dairies that can have thousands of cows that produce tons of manure. University of Idaho President Scott Green said the school hasn’t been able to do the large-scale research the industry needs to find solutions for those and other complex problems. If CAFE succeeds as envisioned, the operation would include an experimental farm and 2,000-cow research dairy in Minidoka County. Classrooms, labs and faculty offices would be constructed in Jerome County near where Interstate 84 and U.S. Route 93 intersect. A food processing pilot plant with a workforce training and education facility would be located at the College of Southern Idaho campus in Twin Falls County.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A jury has awarded $363 million to a woman who alleged that a now-shuttered suburban Chicago plant that sterilized medical equipment exposed residents to a toxic industrial gas and gave her breast cancer. After a five-week trial, the Cook County jurors on Monday awarded Sue Kamuda $38 million in compensatory damages for the past and future loss of a normal life, emotional distress, disfigurement and shortened life expectancy, plus $325 million in punitive damages. Kamuda, 70, developed breast cancer in 2007 despite having no predisposition to it, her lawyers said. She is the first of more than 700 people seeking damages from Oak Brook-based Sterigenics to go to trial over health claims over the plant’s releases of ethylene oxide gas. Those lawsuits have been filed against Sterigenics since 2018, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published research showing people living near the plant in the DuPage County village of Willowbrook faced some of the nation’s highest cancer risks from toxic air pollution. Sterigenics, the former plant’s most recent owner, was ordered to pay Kamuda $220 million in punitive damages; parent company Sotera Health was directed to pay $100 million and Griffith Foods, the current name of the plant’s original owner, $5 million.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The number of fatal overdoses last year in the city soared, eclipsing the number of people who died in shootings and other methods to become the leading cause of death in cases examined by the coroner’s office, according to new data. In its annual report examining trends among the decedents it takes in, the Marion County Coroner’s Office recorded 799 people last year died from accidental drug intoxication. The alarming statistics surpassed the number of people examined by the office who died from heart disease - long at the top of the list - blunt force trauma and firearms for the second year in a row. When accounting for people who died by suicide from an overdose or with an undetermined manner of death, the number of people climbs to 826. While the coroner’s office does not examine every death in the county, meaning some “natural” deaths are not included in the report, officials say the skyrocketing number of overdoses illustrates the worsening drug crisis in the county. “It’s unfortunate that these deaths are rising at such a significant rate,” said Alfarena McGinty, chief deputy coroner. The majority of deaths are linked to the highly lethal synthetic opioid fentanyl, the report shows, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. Fentanyl has increasingly been cut in other street drugs in the past few years.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Concerns about air quality and workplace safety at a correctional facility have led a labor union to file a grievance and the facility to conduct air quality testing. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union Council 61, which represents workers in Iowa, Missouri and Kansas, filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleging unsafe working conditions at the Fort Des Moines Corrections Complex building. In the complaint, filed Aug. 29, the union alleges mold and asbestos in the building are adversely affecting the health of workers and residents. It poses an emergency health risk that officials are not taking seriously, union President Rick Eilander said. Pictures submitted to OSHA as part of the complaint show apparent mold growing on air vents and on floors and pipes. The images also show a pipe leaking a blue and yellow liquid. Eilander wrote in the complaint that the images were taken in the basement and first floor of building 65/66 of the Fort Des Moines Corrections Complex. Jerry Evans, the director of the Fifth Judicial District Department of Correctional Services, said given the alleged mold is located in an unoccupied part of the building, it does not pose a direct health risk to employees or residents of the facility.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A state law enforcement oversight board reprimanded a sheriff’s deputy who used his Taser on a 12-year-old boy with autism while the boy was handcuffed and hogtied in the deputy’s vehicle but chose not to revoke his law enforcement certification. Former Jackson County Deputy Matthew Honas was found to have used excessive force against the boy and terminated from the Jackson County Sheriff’s Department in March. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training said Feb. 23 that Honas tied up the boy, who had run away from foster care, in a way that threatened his ability to breathe properly. Honas was not wearing a body camera, but the encounter was captured on his in-car camera. Honas knew the boy, identified as L.H., was autistic and had struggled with him during a previous encounter, the commission said. Honas “struggled with, shoved, elbowed, applied pressure points, carried, pulled, ‘hog-tied’ and ultimately tased L.H.,” the commission said. The commission said Honas used the Taser on the boy without warning as he was sitting in the patrol vehicle with his feet outside the vehicle. At the time, L.H. was handcuffed behind his back, with the handcuffs connected to shackles on his ankles. Among other things, Honas also refused help from other available officers, did not call a transport van, used profanity and threatened to use his Taser on the boy again, the commission said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A new website highlights how archaeological sites across the state have contributed knowledge about Kentucky’s history, officials said. Discover Kentucky Archaeology, at archaeology.ky.gov, was launched by the Kentucky Heritage Council/State Historic Preservation Office in partnership with the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, a statement from the Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet said. It includes information on more than 100 prehistoric and historic archaeological sites across 64 counties. The site was launched in September, which is celebrated as Kentucky Archaeology Month. Prehistoric sites include a Native American rockshelter in the Daniel Boone National Forest, and historic sites include Saltpeter Cave, a frontier-era niter mine in Carter County, the statement said. Each archaeological site includes a summary, findings, a focus on “what’s cool” and links to related materials.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Three small insect-eating raptors called Mississippi kites have been released by Louisiana State University’s wildlife hospital. The release Friday in Baton Rouge was timed so that the birds, which are known for their aerobatics as they chase and grab insects while flying, can migrate to South America, where they winter in Brazil and Argentina. Two flew into nearby trees, but one – brought to the Wildlife Hospital of Louisiana in 2020 as a nestling with a broken leg – excited veterinary students by soaring for a bit before landing, Dr. Mark Mitchell, the hospital’s director, said Friday. He said it almost seemed as if a bird that had taken wing only in a flight cage was saying, “Now I know what these things on my sides are for.” The three had been living in the same flight cage and were held close to each other, then released simultaneously in hopes they would stay together over a journey of 5,000 to 9,000 miles, Mitchell said. The bird brought in as a nestling apparently had fallen from its nest in July 2020, Mitchell said in an interview. He was named Burreaux after quarterback Joe Burrow, who won the Heisman Trophy while at LSU and now plays for the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state of Maine and a fishing group are appealing a federal judge’s decision that new rules intended to protect rare whales must stand. The judge earlier this month denied a request from fishermen to stop federal regulators from placing the new restrictions on lobster fishing. The rules are intended to protect North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340. Gov. Janet Mills and the Maine Lobstermen’s Association said this week that they’re appealing that decision. Lobstermen have long contended the new rules are based on flawed data and are too punitive to the fishing industry. The fishermen sued the National Marine Fisheries Service in the lawsuit. The fishing group is “escalating its fight to save Maine’s lobstering heritage from a plan that the agency itself admits is not needed for the species to survive,” said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the lobstermen’s association. The whales are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and have declined in population in recent years. The state and the fishermen have appealed their case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nMaryland\n\nPrincess Anne: A historic inn where President George Washington reportedly once stayed is on the market. The historic Washington Inn & Tavern, the centerpiece of the Eastern Shore town of Princess Anne, is said to have housed the late president, said Town Manager Clayton Anderson. Built in 1744, before America’s independence from Great Britain and during the reign of King George II, the structure is brimming with history. Now, the town of Princess Anne has put the famed Washington Inn & Tavern up for sale, with a current listing of $1.25 million. Situated in the the Somerset County seat, the two-story colonial structure is located in an area prioritized for economic and community development. Throughout the years, the inn has served as a catalyst for business growth in a district committed to historic preservation, community growth and economic expansion, according to Anderson. The inn was purchased by the town in 2013 after it was found to be in a state of disrepair. Through a public-private partnership among Princess Anne, the state of Maryland and investors, the building underwent significant renovations. Restored to its full glory, it later reopened in 2016. Established public-private agreements require the town to sell the property by 2023, according to a news release this August.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: A man will be sentenced to 18 months of probation after pleading guilty to vandalizing the “Bewitched” statue by dousing the tourist attraction with red paint over the summer. The 32-year-old resident was originally sentenced to a year in jail, but a Salem district court judge suspended the sentence on conditions the man repay the cost of repairing the damage inflicted on the bronze statue, The Salem News reports. The statue depicts actor Elizabeth Montgomery – as lead character Samantha Stephens in the 1960s sitcom – sitting on a broomstick in front of a crescent moon. In June, a prosecutor said the man was “going through a rough time and wanted to do something to get arrested” and was held on bail. His attorney said he had been living in a shelter for two weeks since his marriage ended and had been looking for a new job. He was also charged with disorderly conduct, which will be dismissed after 30 days. The statue was erected in the city famous for the 1692 witch trials in 2005, despite protests from some who said it trivializes the tragedy of the trials.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city sued the U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday over population estimates from last year that show it lost an additional 7,100 residents, opening another front against the agency in a battle over how Detroit’s people have been counted in the past two years. Mayor Mike Duggan told reporters that the city wants the Census Bureau to reveal how it produced its population loss estimates for Detroit. Duggan claimed the bureau was going against its own policy by refusing to divulge to Detroit the way the estimates for the city were calculated and not allowing challenges this year. The lawsuit appears to be the first litigation to challenge population results since the release of 2020 census data, which traditionally has formed the foundation of the annual population estimates. The Census Bureau’s refusal this year to consider evidence that the 2021 population estimates were wrong perpetuates racial inequality and threatens the city’s reputation, Detroit said in its lawsuit. “The Bureau’s failure to consider evidence of its inaccurate 2021 estimate costs the City and its residents millions of dollars of funding to which they are entitled while threatening the City’s historic turnaround by advancing the narrative that Detroit is losing population,” the lawsuit said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A federal grand jury has indicted a man accused of threatening to kill a U.S. senator. Brendon Daugherty was being held in the Sherburne County Jail, in Elk River, on charges of threatening to murder a U.S. official and interstate transmission of a threat. Court records do not identify the senator other than to say it was not someone who represented Minnesota. According to the indictment, Daugherty left two threatening voicemail messages at the senator’s field office in June. Field office staff contacted U.S. Capitol Police. FBI agents spoke with Daugherty at his Coon Rapids home Sept. 2. He told the agents that he made the calls because the senator was “doing a bunch of stupid (expletive) with gun control” and that he wants politicians to “feel a little bit pressured,” the Star Tribune reports. According to court records, the 35-year-old Daugherty was convicted in October 2018 of two felony counts for threatening to burn down a Pearl Vision store in Maple Grove and harm the employees. Daugherty was angry that he owed $80 for replacement glasses, according to charges.\n\nMississippi\n\nPhiladelphia: The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians has been awarded a $5.8million grant for the construction of an Advanced Workforce Training Center. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo announced that the department’s Economic Development Administration is awarding the $5.8 million grant to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians for the construction of the Advanced Workforce Training Center. The grant is funded by the American Rescue Plan’s Indigenous Communities Program, a press release said. “Workforce development is a primary focus for our Tribe,” Chief Cyrus Ben said in the press release. “We have undertaken many projects to help our community members prepare to face a challenging and ever-evolving job market. This Workforce Training Center is a key component of our strategy to increase the skills of our Tribal members, whether they choose a career on or outside of our Tribal lands.” Anna Denson, project manager of economic development, said the planning process took more than a year. “As of today, our National Center for construction education and research offers HVAC, electrical and industrial maintenance to tribal employees with very little room, but the goal is to expand with the new center,” Denson said.\n\nMissouri\n\nHartville: A small hamlet in the Ozarks has found itself in the middle of everything. Officials from the nation’s capital unveiled a marker Wednesday designating a spot in tiny Wright County as the center of population in the United States. Dignitaries from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Census Bureau officially debuted the red granite marker in Hartville. With a population of 594 residents in 2020, the county seat is located 14.6 miles from the actual spot calculated following the 2020 census. Bypassed by interstate highways and railroads, Hartville doesn’t have a big tax base or large industry. The local school, a nursing home, the gas station and the Dollar General store are the largest employers. The nation’s population center is calculated every 10 years after the once-a-decade census shows where people are living. The heart of America has been located in Missouri since 1980. Previously located in Plato, in the neighboring county, it moved only 11.8 miles southwest from 2010 to 2020. It is the smallest distance shift in 100 years and second-smallest in U.S. history. To calculate the center of the U.S., the Census Bureau figures out which spot would be “the balance point” if the 50 states sat on an imaginary, flat surface with weights of identical size – each representing the location of one person – placed on it.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: The state’s fishing economy has proven resilient amid the impacts of drought, but a new study suggests 35% of its cold water habitats could become unsuitable for trout by 2080, costing the state an estimated $192 million in annual revenue. Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the University of Montana contributed to the new study titled “Socioeconomic resilience to climatic extremes in a freshwater fishery,” which ran in the journal Science Advances this month, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. “Trout fisheries have enormous cultural, economic and ecological importance in Montana and worldwide, yet even Montana’s resilient trout fisheries could be vulnerable to future climate change,” Timothy Cline, a USGS scientist and the paper’s lead author, said in a news release. The authors used Montana FWP’s recreation monitoring data to analyze how climate change affected 3,100 miles of the state’s rivers between 1983 and 2017. They found that the concentration of anglers doubled overall within that 34-year time period, and severe drought conditions, which drive stream flows down and water temperatures up, significantly affected how that fishing pressure was distributed across the landscape.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Regents at the University of Nebraska are poised to consider allowing beer sales permanently for Husker events at Pinnacle Bank Arena, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The NU Board of Regents plans to vote on the exemption next week.\n\nNevada\n\nTonopah: A sprawling southern Nevada county that embraced misinformation about electronic voting machines is set to conduct its midterm election this fall using hand-counted paper ballots, a county official confirmed Tuesday. “This is very locked in,” said newly appointed Nye County Clerk Mark Kampf, a 2020 election denier, of his plans to implement the old-fashioned process in a county with roughly 33,000 active registered voters. Nye, the largest county by area in Nevada and the third-largest in the United States, has been at the forefront of the Republican Party’s push to ditch electronic voting – an ongoing effort fueled by ex-President Donald Trump’s false claims that widespread voter fraud cost him the 2020 presidential election. Now, less than 50 days before the midterm election, the rural county remains committed to that disinformation campaign despite warnings from experts who say counting ballots by hand could invite more error and fraud. All active registered voters will still receive a mail-in ballot for the general election, Kampf, the county’s top voting official, said in a presentation Tuesday to Nye’s five-member Board of Commissioners. But at the polls, according to Kampf, those casting their votes in person this fall will now fill out paper ballots instead of using a touch screen, although one voting machine will be available at every voting site for people with disabilities and “special needs.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is using $5 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to support homeless shelters this winter. The funds, approved earlier this month by the Executive Council and the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee, will provide one-time grants to support shelter providers, including short-term cold weather shelters, to address pandemic-related increased costs and anticipated demand as the winter months approach. In a request for the funds, Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette wrote that the state contracts with 19 shelter providers for 791 emergency shelter beds, but the health department does not fund temporary cold weather shelters. She wrote that preliminary data for the 2022 Point-in-Time count for New Hampshire shows 1,605 people experiencing homelessness, an increase of 7.6% from 2021. The federal funds will provide $4 million in grants to the existing shelters under contract with the department and $1 million to each county, municipality, nonprofit or coalition to assist with cold weather shelters.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRidgewood: Will students make it to class more alert and on time if high school starts 45 minutes later? The school district’s parents and teachers were more skeptical than students about any positive outcomes of a later school day start in a 24-page report by K-12 Insights that was presented to the Ridgewood Board of Education on Monday. The report analyzed the results of a district survey distributed in May to parents, students, teachers and community members seeking input about a proposed move of the high school start time from 7:45 to 8:30 a.m. The later starting time is the subject of a nationwide educational debate. Multiple studies indicate it’s not video games, computers and cellphones that keep adolescents up late at night – it’s a temporary, puberty-induced shift in teen circadian rhythms that causes them to be “dazed and confused” in the mornings but dissipates in their early 20s. California has taken the lead and introduced a statewide mandate this fall to start high school classes no earlier than 8:30 a.m. and middle school no earlier than 8 a.m. New Jersey has introduced a similar bill. So far, only a few districts, including Tenafly, Princeton and South Orange/Maplewood, have adopted the later start time.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A politician and Trump supporter who was removed and barred from elected office for his role in the U.S. Capitol riot Jan. 6, 2021, is attempting to appeal that decision to the state Supreme Court. Cowboys for Trump co-founder and former county commissioner Couy Griffin on Tuesday notified the high court of his intent to appeal. The ruling against Griffin this month from a Santa Fe-based District Court was the first to remove or bar an elected official from office in connection with the attack on the U.S. Capitol building that disrupted Congress as it was trying to certify President Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral victory. Griffin was previously convicted in federal court of a misdemeanor for entering the Capitol grounds Jan. 6, without going inside the building. He was sentenced to 14 days and given credit for time served. Griffin has invoked free speech guarantees in his defense and said his banishment from public office disenfranchises his political constituents in Otero County. He was barred from office under provisions of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which holds that anyone who has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution can be barred from office for engaging in insurrection or rebellion. The provisions were put in place shortly after the Civil War.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: An inmate who jumped into the East River from a jail barge has died, the city Department of Correction announced Wednesday. Gregory Acevedo, 48, was pronounced dead about 11 p.m. Tuesday, 11 hours after he climbed a fence at the Vernon C. Bain Center and jumped into the water, officials said. “Mr. Acevedo’s tragic passing is an immense loss,” Correction Commissioner Louis A. Molina said in a statement. Acevedo had been in custody on a robbery charge since Feb. 27. Police officers pulled him from the water after his jump Tuesday and took him to a hospital, where efforts to revive him failed. He was the 15th person to die this year who was a New York City jail inmate or who had just been released. “Once again, their system failed,” Acevedo’s attorney, Warren Silverman, told the New York Post. “I mean, he shouldn’t have been able to get to any position where he could have harmed himself, and clearly they dropped the ball, as usual.” The state attorney general’s office and the city Department of Investigation conduct separate investigations. The city medical examiner’s office will determine the cause. The Bain Center is a 625-foot barge that was supposed to be temporary when it opened as a jail in 1992. It is docked in the East River near Rikers Island, the city’s main jail complex.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state has made one more pitch to host the 2027 World University Games, as the committee evaluating North Carolina’s bid visited the region Tuesday. A panel of the International University Sports Federation visited the Executive Mansion, where Gov. Roy Cooper presented its members with an official bid book. The other finalist is Chungcheong province, South Korea. A final announcement is expected in November. North Carolina’s proposal would cover the “University Hub” region designated as including Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, Cary and Greensboro. There are more than 130 colleges, universities and community college statewide. The summer World University Games attracts 7,000 athletes from ages 18 to 25 from more than 150 countries and 600 universities. The nearly two-week event features 15 required sports, including swimming, track and field and basketball, as well as optional sports proposed by the local host city. The state has set aside $25 million to support the games if North Carolina is named the host.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMcHenry: A driver charged with fatally striking a teenager allegedly told investigators he purposely hit the teen with his SUV after they had a political argument, according to court documents. Cayler Ellingson, 18, was struck and killed following a street dance in McHenry early Sunday. The driver accused of striking Ellingson in an alley, Shannon Brandt, 41, is charged in Foster County with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of an accident that resulted in death. Jail records from Stutsman County, where Brandt was being held, show he posted $50,000 bond Tuesday and was released. His attorney did not immediately return a call for comment. Brandt told investigators he left the scene after striking Ellingson, returned briefly, called 911 and then left again, according to a probable cause affidavit. The court document said Brandt told investigators he had been drinking alcohol before striking Ellingson, thought the teen was calling people to do him harm after they argued, and felt threatened. Ellingson was rushed to a hospital in Carrington, where he was pronounced dead. Investigators arrested Brandt at his home in Glenfield later Sunday. Officials said he consented to a chemical breath test that showed his blood alcohol content was above 0.08%, the legal limit to drive.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A conservative podcaster who embraces ex-President Donald Trump’s discredited claims of a stolen 2020 election is eligible to run for Ohio secretary of state this fall, the state’s high court ruled Tuesday. Terpeshore “Tore” Maras, who calls President Joe Biden “resident not president” and embraces aspects of the QAnon conspiracy in her “Tore Says” podcast, will appear on ballots as an independent. She faces Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Democratic challenger Chelsea Clark. The Ohio Supreme Court split 4-2 in its ruling, with Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor, a Republican, joining the court’s three Democrats, Justices Pat DeWine and Pat Fischer dissenting, and Justice Sharon Kennedy not participating. The decision marks the latest twist in Maras’ roller-coaster bid to seek the office overseeing Ohio elections. She previously met the deadline to run as a Republican candidate for the ballot back in February but fell short of the required valid signatures. LaRose’s office later cleared her to run as an independent, but a Republican official – acting in his capacity as an Ohio voter – filed a challenge, asserting a number of her signatures were invalid. A judge ruled in the official’s favor, and LaRose’s office upheld that decision and invalidated her candidacy.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWynnewood: Joe Exotic is suing a songwriter who revealed in media interviews that Exotic was lip-syncing the catchy tune “I Saw a Tiger” in a music video seen in the Netflix documentary about his life. He accuses songwriter Vince Johnson of copyright infringement for releasing an album in 2020 featuring that song and four others. The former zookeeper was convicted at trial in 2019 of hiring two men to kill his chief critic, Carole Baskin, and of crimes involving his animals. He became well-known worldwide a year later after Netflix released “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness.” He was ordered in January to serve 21 years in federal prison after an appeals court threw out his original sentence. He claims he is innocent and is seeking a new trial on newly discovered evidence and other grounds. His attorney, John M. Phillips, filed the lawsuit Monday seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages and a permanent ban on further “unauthorized use” of his songs. In the lawsuit, he goes by the name Joseph Maldonado. In interviews, Johnson said he began writing songs for the zookeeper in 2013. He said a bandmate, Danny Clinton, who died in 2019, was the singer. “I had no idea he was going to Milli Vanilli the songs,” he told Vanity Fair for an article about his involvement.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Thousands of families who expected their children to start tuition-free, state-provided preschool this month remain in limbo because of staffing shortages that caused delays getting contracts to nearly 250 involved preschools. The Early Learning Division, which has overseen the Preschool Promise program since its 2016 inception, took over contracting duties from the Oregon Department of Education this year and has struggled to get contracts inked. It has yet to send paperwork to most of the 248 preschools in the program that serves families living at or below 200% of the federal poverty line, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Many facilities new to the program or those expanding services are hesitant to accept children enrolled in Preschool Promise until they have a signed contract and payment for the care is assured, the newspaper reports. The agency now says the preschools chosen to serve an estimated 6,381 children must open no later than Oct. 30. It could not say when all contracts would be signed. The total number of children marks an expected increase of more than 2,000 slots from last year. “It’s super hard on families,” said Molly Day, director of Early Learning Multnomah, one of 16 regional hubs that helps coordinate Preschool Promise enrollment.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMiddletown: A prosecutor announced charges in juvenile court Tuesday against 10 students in connection with alleged hazing of high school football players that prompted cancellation of the team’s season. Dauphin County prosecutors said two Middletown players will face attempted sexual assault charges, and eight others face other counts in connection with hazing that authorities said targeted at least six players from ages 14 to 17. “This investigation did not involve just hazing or ‘boys will be boys’ conduct,” Chief Deputy District Attorney Jennifer Gettle said in a news release from the office of District Attorney Fran Chardo. “Rather, two of these individuals committed repeated sexual assaults and encouraged others to participate under the guise of hazing.” Superintendent Chelton Hunter earlier said that team members had been in the high school turf room used for heat acclimation practice sessions when an Aug. 11 cellphone video showed “a group of students restraining two of their teammates and using a muscle therapy gun and another piece of athletic equipment” to poke their buttock areas. The players remained fully clothed, and no penetration appeared to have occurred, he said, calling the video difficult to watch and the acts “completely unacceptable, offensive, and highly inappropriate.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nWoonsocket: Former Mayor Susan Menard, whose body was found Monday in her home, was “a strong leader” who was especially good to the city’s senior citizens, the current mayor recalled Wednesday. “She certainly had her own style, but the people of the city of Woonsocket certainly liked and enjoyed her leadership, electing her to seven terms,” Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt said in an interview. The Woonsocket police went to Menard’s residence Monday after a neighbor called and said he hadn’t seen Menard or the man who also lived in the house for “a couple of weeks,” police said. Officers forced their way in through a rear window and found two bodies in separate rooms, Woonsocket Police Chief Thomas F. Oates III said Tuesday, but they were decomposed, and the medical examiner needed to identify the remains. The state Medical Examiners office said Wednesday morning that it had identified one of them as Menard. The identity of the second person, described as a man in his 70s, has not yet been confirmed, and the causes of death for both are still being investigated, the office said. The police saw no evidence that a crime had been committed, Oates said. “She was and is the longest-serving mayor in the city’s history,” Baldelli-Hunt said, noting that Menard was also the city’s first woman to be elected mayor and first female City Council president.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Seven mothers have given up their babies in South Carolina so far in 2022, more than any year since the state passed its safe haven law more than two decades ago. The babies were all given up at hospitals, according to data from the Department of Social Services obtained by The State newspaper. Daniel’s Law allows babies younger than 2 months old to be turned over to the state at safe places like hospitals, fire stations, police departments or churches if someone is there. Before 2022, the most babies given up in a year was six, in 2016 and 2019. Four babies have been adopted, while the last three are currently in the Family Court system, DSS spokesperson Danielle Jones said. The agency isn’t guessing why 2022 has been the busiest year for Daniel’s Law. The babies turned over to the state have been twins in Anderson County, a boy in Greenville County, a girl in Spartanburg County, a boy in Dorchester County, a boy in Greenwood County and a girl in Lexington County. The General Assembly passed Daniel’s Law in 2001 after a newborn boy was found abandoned at an old dump in Allendale County, alive but covered in fire ant bites, by a mother who never told her parents she was pregnant or went to the doctor and who gave birth in her bathroom.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem is facing a lawsuit after her office refused to release expense records on five out-of-state trips this year to a liberal watchdog group. American Oversight, an organization that files open records requests and litigation against Republican officials, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Noem, who is in the midst of a reelection campaign and eyeing a bid for the GOP’s 2024 presidential ticket. It alleges that the governor’s office did not follow the state’s open records law by claiming that releasing the records would create a threat to the governor’s safety. In May, the organization had requested expense records, including lodging and travel, for 2022 trips Noem had taken to a Las Vegas hunting convention, a pair of Republican Party events in Wyoming and New York, the Conservative Political Action Conference, and a campaign event for Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Lee in Utah. American Oversight also said that South Dakota’s Department of Labor and Regulation has not responded to its records request for legal expenses associated with negotiating a $200,000 settlement agreement with a former state employee, Sherry Bren. She had filed an age discrimination complaint after she was pressured to retire by Marcia Hultman, Noem’s labor secretary. Hultman began asking for Bren’s retirement in the weeks after Noem’s daughter, Kassidy Peters, completed her real estate appraiser licensure – a process in which Noem took a hands-on role.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Vanderbilt University will be the host campus for the Clinton Global Initiative University annual meeting in 2023, the Clinton Foundation said Tuesday. Chelsea Clinton, the foundation’s vice chair, made the announcement at the Clinton Global Initiative’s two-day meeting of international dignitaries in New York. The initiative aims to create partnerships among political, business and philanthropic leaders. According to a news release, next year’s gathering at Vanderbilt will allow students to collaborate with leaders, innovators and experts on solving “humanity’s most pressing problems,” ranging from social to economic to environmental challenges. “Our university and the Clinton Foundation share the beliefs that collaboration brings out the best in humanity and that diverse perspectives and open dialogue are needed to drive innovation and discovery,” Daniel Diermeier, chancellor of Vanderbilt University, said in a statement. More than 11,000 students have participated in the Clinton Global Initiative University program, coming from 163 counties and all 50 states. Previous hosts include the University of Chicago, Howard University, and member schools of the American Association of Community Colleges.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: Alarmed parents converged on a high school Tuesday after a classroom shooting report that ultimately proved to be false. The siege at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio began about 1 p.m. Tuesday after police received a call of a possible shooting in progress at the school, according to a police statement. The school was placed on lockdown as police entered and began clearing the campus but found no evidence of an active threat or shooting. “Our department and San Antonio Police Department established there was no shooting, but then we had to do a methodical search room by room with our strike teams,” said Chief Johnny Reyes of the San Antonio Independent School District police. “We went to the place where they said the shooting had occurred, and we were able to quickly establish that no shooting had happened.” Instead, some students were found to have had an altercation, but they denied having or displaying a weapon at any point, Reyes said. But frightened students already had made alarming telephone calls to their parents, who descended en masse on the school where 29 school district officers and 58 city police officers were on hand. One man shoved his fist through a window in an effort to gain entry to the school, lacerating his arm. Others were handcuffed and detained after physically struggling with officers.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A family has reached a $3 million settlement with the city in a lawsuit filed after officers shot a 13-year-old boy with autism, leaving him badly wounded after responding to his mother’s 911 call for help when he had a breakdown. The September 2020 shooting drew widespread scrutiny and was one of several around the U.S. in recent years that have fueled questions how police respond to calls involving people with mental illness. The boy, Linden Cameron, now 15, survived but suffered life-changing injuries and emotional trauma that still “haunt him and his family,” said family attorney Nathan Morris in a statement Tuesday announcing the settlement. Cameron’s family accepted the settlement to avoid more emotional trauma that would have come over years spent waiting for the lawsuit to reach trial, Morris said. A separate probe by prosecutors to determine if criminal charges will be filed against the officer is ongoing and could have delayed the family’s lawsuit even longer, he said. “There are mixed emotions by the family,” Morris said. “It is a huge relief to be done with this case, but at the same time we would liked to take this case forward to shine light on some of the issues.” After the shooting, Salt Lake City began providing training for police, fire and dispatch officers about how to best engage with people who have sensory needs like Cameron. That training will continue, said Salt Lake City spokesman Andrew Wittenberg.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Mandatory testing for lead in drinking water – and repairs to keep that water safe – has been completed at 98% of the state’s schools and child care centers, the Vermont Health Department said Wednesday. The state passed a law in 2019 requiring schools and child care facilities to test their drinking and cooking water for lead, a highly toxic metal. Roughly 1 in 5 taps had elevated lead levels out of the more than 15,000 taps tested between June 2019 and December 2021. Lead exposure can slow children’s growth, impair development and learning, and cause behavioral problems. Lead was more frequently found in water fixtures, rather than plumbing, which made fixes both easier and less expensive. The state provided funding to reimburse schools and child care centers for remediation costs, 90% of which cost less than $500. “We take very seriously our responsibility to protect and promote the health and safety of children in early care and education programs,” said Commissioner Sean Brown of the Agency of Human Services’ Child Development Division. “Collaborative efforts like this help ensure that children in Vermont have positive, safe learning environments in which they can grow and develop.”\n\nVirginia\n\nMartinsville: A marker has been dedicated in front of the old Henry County Courthouse recognizing the Martinsville Seven, a group of Black men executed in 1951 over an alleged rape. “Here in 1949, six all-white, all-male juries convicted seven Black men of the rape of a white woman. All seven men were sentenced to death. On appeal, NAACP attorneys submitted the first petition to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that capital punishment had been disproportionately applied against African Americans in violation of the 14th Amendment. Despite international attention and petitions for clemency, the Commonwealth of Virginia executed the men in Feb. 1951, the most executions for a rape in U.S. history,” the marker says. The old Henry County Courthouse is now the Martinsville-Henry County Heritage Center and Museum, inside which a display recounts the day in 1949 when Ruby Floyd told police she had been raped. Francis Grayson, Frank Hairston Jr., Howard Hairston, James Hairston, Joe Hampton, Booker Millner and John Taylor were arrested and confessed. The defense argued the encounter was consensual, and the confessions were coerced, but all seven men were found guilty and sentenced to death. The NAACP failed in its appeal, and over just four days, the seven were put to death by the electric chair in Richmond.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Next year voters will decide whether the city should set up a public developer to create affordable housing. The Seattle Times reports the City Council unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday to allow King County Elections to put the proposed Initiative 135 on the ballot of a special election to be held Feb. 14, 2023. If I-135 passes, it would create a public development authority, called the Seattle Social Housing Developer, to construct homes and take over existing properties using government and philanthropic funding to create renter-governed housing. Those who favor the initiative say housing would be protected from rental market forces in one of the nation’s most expensive cities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Walmart and CVS Pharmacy have settled with the state of West Virginia for a combined total of $147 million in a lawsuit over the companies’ roles in contributing to the oversupply of prescription drugs that fueled the opioid epidemic in the country’s most impacted state, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced Tuesday. Walmart and CVS were two lawsuits that were part of a larger trial that was pushed back to June of next year along with Kroger and Walgreens. Morrisey recently announced a settlement with Rite Aid for up to $30 million to resolve similar litigation. The lawsuits allege the pharmacies’ contributions to the oversupply of prescription opioids in the state have caused “significant losses through their past and ongoing medical treatment costs, including for minors born addicted to opioids, rehabilitation costs, naloxone costs, medical examiner expenses, self-funded state insurance costs and other forms of losses to address opioid-related afflictions and loss of lives.” It brings the total settlements by the state in opioid lawsuits to $875 million, including $296 million with manufacturers, $400 million with wholesalers and $177.5 million involving pharmacies.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels has called on Gov. Tony Evers to halt all paroles in the state, even though a governor can’t unilaterally order them to stop, and some paroles are mandated by law. Michels has been hitting Evers as being soft on crime, accusing the Democrat in a letter Monday of sympathizing with and coddling “brutal, convicted criminals.” Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said it would be illegal to do as Michels wants and called the request “an uninformed stunt to score political points by someone who has no regard or appreciation for the laws of our state.” Michels and Evers are knotted in a tight contest in the battleground state that polls show is about even. Michaels, who is endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump and is the co-owner of the state’s largest construction company, has been attacking Evers over his parole policies and his response to violent protests in Kenosha two years ago that followed the shooting of Black man Jacob Blake by a white police officer. Wisconsin’s parole commission, which operates independently of the governor, has granted about 460 discretionary paroles not required by law, something that both Republican and Democratic governors before Evers also routinely granted.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Rockslides have seemingly been ramping up in the Tetons, mountain guides say, and scientists are pointing to climate change as a likely culprit, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. The anecdotal increase in rockfall in the mountain range comes as warmer temperatures take their toll on glaciers, which long covered the Tetons. Simeon Caskey, head of the physical science branch at Grand Teton National Park, told the newspaper that so-called weathering is behind much of the rockfall, with shifting water and ice leading to changes in the geologic structure of the area. “We’ve seen from some studies in the Alps that rockfall is happening more frequently at higher elevations as a result of climate change and increased temperatures and increased extreme rainfall events,” he said, calling that European mountain range an “appropriate analogue for what’s happening in the Tetons.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}]}

Any damage? Latest on ...", "text": "Editor's note: Having trouble connecting? Read USA TODAY's text-only storm updates.\n\nFleets of boats, high-water vehicles and helicopters rescued hundreds trapped by Hurricane Ida’s floodwaters across southern Louisiana on Monday and utility repair crews rushed in to restore the power grid after the storm left a path of destruction on its way out the state.\n\nMore than 1 million homes and businesses were without power in Louisiana and another 90,000 in Mississippi as Ida, downgraded from a furious Category 4 hurricane to a tropical storm, remained a danger with its heavy rains and storm surge.\n\nTwo deaths have been confirmed -- a person hit by a falling tree outside Baton Rouge and later a male driver who drowned in New Orleans. The Louisiana Department of Health said the motorist drowned after trying to drive through floodwater.\n\nRelated:Ida was one of the strongest hurricanes to hit US mainland. Here are some stronger ones.\n\nA third person was attacked Monday by an alligator in flood waters caused by the storm near Slidell, located just across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans, according to Jason Gaubert, a spokesman for the St. Tammany Fire District No. 1.\n\nThe man's wife witnessed the attack, which took the man's arm off, Gaubert told USA TODAY. When his wife went to call for help, the man disappeared into the flood waters. His body hasn't been recovered and officials were investigating, Gaubert said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he expected the death toll to rise \"considerably.''\n\nThe governor’s office said damage to the power grid appeared “catastrophic” – dispiriting news for those without refrigeration or air conditioning amid the stifling heat and humidity. Forecasts call for temperatures in the mid-80s to near 90 by midweek.\n\n\"I can’t tell you when the power is going to be restored. I can’t tell you when all the debris is going to be cleaned up and repairs made,” Edwards said in a news conference. “But what I can tell you is we are going to work hard every day to deliver as much assistance as we can.”\n\nEdwards said at least 671 people had been rescued by Monday afternoon.\n\nIda, which roared onto the Gulf Coast near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, on Sunday with 150-mph winds, knocked out power to the entire city of New Orleans before heading northeast toward Mississippi.\n\nLevees failed or were overtopped along some rivers and bayous south of New Orleans but held up in the city. Some people posted their addresses and locations on social media to direct rescue teams. Roofs were torn off some buildings by the powerful winds, which decreased to about 35 mph by mid-afternoon. Still, tropical storm-force winds extended out 150 miles.\n\n\"Heavy rainfall and flash flooding threat continues to spread inland,'' the National Hurricane Center said in its 4 p.m. Central Time update, when Ida was 20 miles northwest of Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nThe storm was inching north at 9 mph, the slow roll driving up rainfall totals and toppling power lines along Ida's path.\n\nAt least 1 death in Louisiana as New Orleans loses power; Biden approves major disaster declaration\n\nEPA relaxes fuel rules for Louisiana, Mississippi\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, responding to requests from Louisiana and Mississippi, temporarily suspended requirements related to fuel volatility to make sure residents have easy access to fuel.\n\nReid Vapor Pressure requirements govern fuel volatility, which refineries change according to the seasons to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.\n\nEPA Administrator Michael S. Regan issued emergency fuel waivers effective immediately to allow Louisiana and Mississippi residents access to the widest range of fuels. The waivers end Sept. 16.\n\nHeat, water contamination among top concerns in Ida's wake, ex-FEMA head says\n\nCraig Fugate, the former head of FEMA under President Barack Obama, said with the threat of flooding diminishing as waters recede in Louisiana, the loss of electricity poses a serious danger to residents. Temperatures in New Orleans for the next two days are predicted to hit 88 degrees with high humidity -- conditions that can be dangerous for some without air conditioning, he said.\n\n\"We're still in summer and so without electricity, it's going to be very dangerous for the elderly, for those with pre-existing conditions, on top of dealing with COVID,\" Fugate said.\n\nHe said reports of the loss of water pressure in Jefferson Parish suggests downed trees have ripped open water and sewer lines, raising concerns about access to clean drinking water and sewage pollution.\n\n\"That will be driving a lot of FEMA response after the initial rescues,\" Fugate added.﻿\n\nLines for gas at station damaged by storm\n\nAbout 24 hours after Hurricane Ida made landfall in southeast Louisiana, lines of people waited Monday to fill cans with gas at a station and store called Veillon’s in Prairieville.\n\nThe building had sustained damage, with metal roofing peeled and lying twisted on the ground, and its doors and windows remained boarded. But the pumps were still working and accepting credit cards, and the word had gotten around Facebook, prompting Monday's lines.\n\nPeople came with multiple cans to get fuel for their generators at home. The whole town seemed to be without electricity after the Category 4 storm hit the state. Prairieville seemed to miss the rain but not the strong winds.\n\nLinemen working the area said they were addressing outages at hospitals, police stations and other emergency locations before they head into the community to restore power.\n\nNew Orleans' $14 billion risk-reduction system passes major test\n\nThe memories of endless miles of flooded streets still haunt some New Orleans residents who lived through the Hurricane Katrina disaster 16 years ago.\n\nThough Hurricane Ida was technically stronger with winds of up to 150 mph -- making it a Category 4, one level higher than Katrina -- the frequent scenes of people getting rescued from the roof of their New Orleans homes as the floodwaters surged appear not to have been replicated this time.\n\nThat's because the levee system for the most part withstood the test of the storm.\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards said no major levees failed during Ida, thanks to a $14 billion hurricane risk-reduction system that was built in the greater New Orleans area following Katrina in 2005. The system was activated Sunday morning for just the second time, and even though the floodwaters overtopped some levees and other minor ones did fail, more extensive flood damage was averted.\n\nKatrina survivor on riding out Ida: 'It was horrible'\n\nPaten Neville and his family have weathered hurricanes before, including the legendary Katrina in 2005. So Neville's words as a seasoned hurricane survivor carry extra weight after he stayed at his mother's house in Houma with at least six other family members, ranging from children to adults. They spent at least half the storm underneath the carport.\n\n“It was horrible,” said Neville, 34. “The tree fell first. Boom. Then after a while, the roof (was) flying off (and) water started pouring through.”\n\nNeville said Katrina was worse because of the massive flooding. Ida seemed to be more of a wind event, at least in the Houma area, but he added an observation that lent some perspective: The amount of water that came inside during Ida could be measured in buckets.\n\nOfficials ask residents who fled not to return home yet\n\nMany Louisiana residents who fled Ida are clamoring to return home, but even though the storm is no longer a hurricane, the devastation it left behind has created plenty of dangers.\n\nOfficials in the affected areas are asking for patience, pointing out conditions are still hazardous and some roads remain unpassable.\n\n\"If you evacuated before Hurricane Ida, we request that you DO NOT RETURN until further notice,'' Jefferson Parish Councilman Scott Walker tweeted Monday. \"Power remains out with hazards on the road.''\n\nSaid Terrebonne Parish President Gordon Dove: “We completely understand the desire of our residents to return to their homes and loved ones. We also want this to happen as soon as possible, but in a safe and orderly manner.”\n\nBiden says federal government won't abandon storm-hammered region\n\nPresident Joe Biden pledged to stand with people in the affected areas for as long as necessary during the recovery. Biden named senior adviser and former congressman Cedric Richmond as his liaison with authorities in the Gulf, and instructed his team to get storm victims the assistance they need. Biden lauded the resilience of people of Louisiana and Mississippi but said that \"in moments like these we can see the need for government to respond.\"\n\n\"When folks get knocked down, we're here to help you get back on your feet,\" he said.\n\nLouisiana officials fear COVID-19 spike\n\nGov. John Bel Edward's office said over 2,200 evacuees were staying in 41 shelters as of Monday morning, a number expected to rise as people were rescued or escaped from flooded homes.\n\nChristina Stephens, Edwards' spokeswoman, said the state will work to move people to hotels quickly so they can keep their distance from one another. Even before Ida hit, Louisiana was battling a fourth coronavirus surge sparked by the highly contagious delta variant and relatively low vaccination rates across the state.\n\n“This is a COVID nightmare,” she said. “We do anticipate that we could see some COVID spikes related to this.”\n\n4 hospitals damaged by storm\n\nFour Louisiana hospitals were damaged and 39 medical facilities were operating on generator power, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Monday. Scores of patients were being evacuated to other cities. Lady of the Sea General Hospital in Lafourche Parish, near where Hurricane Ida made landfall, was among those hard-hit.\n\n“All patients and staff are fine at this time without injury, although our hospital has sustained significant damage,” Lady of the Sea CEO Karen Collins said.\n\nIn Houma, the Terrebonne General Health System hospital sustained major damage and had to transfer patients right away to other healthcare facilities, officials said.\n\nEdwards said 22 nursing homes and 18 assisted living facilities have been evacuated, though evacuating the largest hospitals was not an option because there aren’t other places to send the patients. Warner Thomas, president and CEO of Ochsner Health, said the system evacuated a smaller hospital in St. Charles Parish on Sunday. He said 35 patients were moved to other hospitals.\n\nNYC sends team to aid recovery\n\nAn 83-member team of specially trained New York City police officers and firefighters has been sent to Louisiana to assist Ida response and recovery efforts. New York Task Force 1, managed by the city Emergency Management Department, brought six dogs, four water rescue boats, equipment to support rescues from collapsed structures and confined spaces, and hazardous materials equipment.\n\n\"After Hurricane Katrina, our members were proud to bravely serve in New Orleans and help the people of Louisiana,” Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said. \"I know they will make us proud once again.\"\n\nHundreds of boats, high-water vehicles to the rescue\n\nRescuers across southern Louisiana began launching hundreds of boats into the floodwaters Monday. New Orleans and several parishes said their 911 systems were experiencing technical difficulties, so some trapped residents sought help via social media. The Louisiana National Guard said it activated 4,900 personnel and lined up 195 high-water vehicles, 73 rescue boats and 34 helicopters. Local and state agencies brought in hundreds more.\n\nJefferson Parish in suburban New Orleans knew of 500 people who said they were going to stay in areas that were flooded, Parish Council member Deano Bonano told WWL-TV.\n\n\"We know we have people we need to rescue. We've been getting calls all night,\" he said. \"We're going to methodically go up and down every street transporting individuals out to buses and putting them in shelters.\"\n\nPower outage could last 6 weeks for some\n\nMore than 1 million utility customers in Louisiana and almost 130,000 in Mississippi were without power Monday. The utility Entergy, citing Ida's \"catastrophic intensity,\" said all eight transmission lines that deliver power into the New Orleans area were out of service. The company said it had provided back-up generation to the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board, but that some homes could be without power for weeks.\n\n\"It will likely take days to determine the extent of damage to our power grid in metro New Orleans and far longer to restore electrical transmission to the region,\" Entergy warned.\n\nJoe Valiente, director of emergency management in Jefferson Parish, said Monday that the outages could last up to six weeks: \"100% of the grid is smashed,\" Valiente told NPR. \"We are estimating six weeks based on numbers that Entergy gave us.\"\n\nDark New Orleans reawakens after brunt of storm passes\n\nNew Orleans residents who didn't flee the storm began emerging from their homes Monday, ducking and dodging downed light poles, pieces of roofs and branches.\n\n“I had a long, miserable night,” said Chris Atkins, who was in his New Orleans home when he heard a “kaboom” and all the sheetrock in the living room fell into the house. A short time later, the whole side of the living room fell onto his neighbor’s driveway.\n\n“Lucky the whole thing didn’t fall inward. It would have killed us,” he said.\n\nIda's center crosses into Mississippi\n\nHurricane Ida crossed into Mississippi's Amite County from Louisiana and was headed north, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm slowed down slightly as it made its way over land and across the Mississippi River, causing massive power outages in southwestern Mississippi, primarily in Adams, Wilkinson, Amite and Pike counties. A state of emergency for the city of Jackson was in effect – winds of up to 65 mph were forecast for the area Monday night.\n\nCentral Mississippi into far western Alabama could see 4 to 8 inches of rain with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches before the weather passes Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n– Clarion Ledger in Jackson, Miss.\n\nResidents in rural areas report major damage\n\nAbout 68 miles southwest of New Orleans, Albert Naquin sheltered in Pointe-aux-Chênes with seven others. Naquin, the Traditional Chief of the Isle De Jean Charles Tribe, watched Ida rip shingles from his home and peel away the front side of his house.\n\n\"I saw bits and pieces,\" Naquin said. \"My neighbor's house broke in half.\"\n\n– Melissa Brown, Lafayette Daily Advertiser\n\nSheriff warns against sightseeing in battered Terrebonne Parish\n\nIn Terrebonne Parish, southwest of New Orleans, Sheriff Timothy Soignet said electricity and water utilities are not functioning and all roads are blocked by downed trees, utility poles and other debris. Terrebonne Parish is under a curfew until further notice and Soignet said no one should attempt to sightsee. Crews are working to clear debris and additional vehicles on the road will hinder progress, the sheriff said. First responders have not yet been able to reach certain parts of the parish, he said.\n\n“Prayers are with the citizens and business owners of Terrebonne Parish in this difficult time,\" Soignet said. \"If you have evacuated, please don’t try to return yet, and if you are in the parish, shelter in place.”\n\n– Keith Magill, The Courier\n\nIda was so powerful it reversed the flow of the Mississippi River\n\nA U.S. Geological Survey gauge at Belle Chasse, south of New Orleans, detected the Mississippi's flow moving backward around midday Sunday because of the amount of water Ida whipped up. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Ricky Boyette confirmed engineers detected a “negative flow” on the Mississippi River as a result of storm surge. Although rare, the river changing course is not unprecedented, occurring during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Isaac in 2012.\n\n\"I remember, off hand, that there was some flow reversal of the Mississippi River during Hurricane Katrina, but it is extremely uncommon,\" Scott Perrien, a UDGS hydrologist, told CNN.\n\n– Ryan Miller\n\n'People are in attics' in small Louisiana town\n\nMayor Tim Kerner said much of the Town of Jean Lafitte, a community of 2,000 people just outside the Jefferson Parish levee protection system, was underwater. Kerner told WGNO the levees were overtopped by rapidly rising water. Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng told the station that \"people are in attics in Lower Lafitte.\"\n\n\"Total devastation, catastrophic\" Kerner said. \"This is a very dangerous situation. I’ve never seen so much water in my life. We’ve lost our school and everything ... People’s lives are I believe at stake now.''\n\nKerner said the water swept over a 7.5-feet-high flood wall protecting the town, leaving some people at the mercy of the rushing water. When the weather breaks \"we are going to send an army to them,\" he said.\n\nFirst death reported in Louisiana\n\nThe Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office said deputies received a report Saturday night of a resident injured from a fallen tree in Prairieville. Deputies arrived on scene and confirmed that the victim had been killed, the office said on social media posts. More than 250 roads in the parish were closed because of downed trees or power lines, and the office urged everyone to stay home.\n\nIda could drop 24 inches of rain in some areas\n\nThrough Tuesday morning, Ida could bring total rainfall accumulations of 10 to 18 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 24 inches, the National Weather Service said. Heavy rain combined with storm surge resulted in catastrophic impacts along the southeast coast of Louisiana, with life-threatening flash flooding and \"significant\" river flooding continuing farther inland.\n\nWhere Ida is headed next\n\nThe center of Ida is forecast to move over central and northeastern Mississippi on Monday afternoon and night and move across the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday. Additional rapid weakening is forecast during the next day or so. \"Considerable\" flash flooding is possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley through the Middle Tennessee Valley, Ohio Valley, Central/Southern Appalachians and into the Mid-Atlantic in coming days, the weather service said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/weather/fourth-of-july-weekend-weather-forecast/index.html", "title": "Weather forecast: Fourth of July weekend to see heavy rain, flight ...", "text": "Programming note: CNN’s annual Fourth In America special features musical performances from artists including the B-52s, Machine Gun Kelly and Pitbull, as well as fireworks shows from across the US.

Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against.\n\nThe accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports. Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work.\n\nOver eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work. Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game.\n\nBut their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation.\n\nAccording to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated. His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit.\n\n“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”\n\nIn his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode. According to him, they had consensual “phone sex.”\n\n“Ms. Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator. “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.”\n\nMichigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint. She finished her investigation in July. A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week.\n\nThe stakes are high for everyone.\n\nTracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports. She fears he will undo her legacy.\n\nTucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches.\n\nReached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case.\n\nHours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case.\n\n“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference. “These actions are not taken lightly.”\n\nUSA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment. Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents.\n\nTitle IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity. Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history.\n\nFor nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U.S.A. Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments. He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison.\n\nAmid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence.\n\nFor some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress.\n\n“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence. “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people.”\n\nThe meeting: Spartans coach, rape survivor forge professional bond through shared mission\n\nTracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them.\n\nStanding before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two.\n\nAt the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior.\n\nBy then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches. Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee.\n\nTucker was in his second season as head coach. A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018. Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary.\n\nMel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timeline\n\nTucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator. They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls.\n\nTucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator. They discussed her coming back to campus in the future.\n\nTracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator. He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person.\n\nOver the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players.\n\nDuring that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour. They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said. They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives.\n\nThey spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time.\n\nIn November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance. The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University.”\n\nIt was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator.\n\nWhether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge.\n\nThe disputed call: 'You're touching yourself?'\n\nTucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it.\n\nThey frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said. Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married.\n\nTucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them.\n\nBy contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided. She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her.\n\nTucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said. Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit.\n\nOnce, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime. He was in bed, shirtless. He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single.” Then, during a Nov. 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”\n\nTracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries. She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec. 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree.\n\nThen, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show. Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him. She said no.\n\nTwelve days later came the call.\n\nTracy was in her home office in Oregon. Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a.m. EST, phone records show. The call lasted 36 minutes.\n\nAccording to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on. They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed.\n\n“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show. “She was the one who said we’ll do it.”\n\nTracy denies all of that. The call started off normal, she said. But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man.”\n\nShe remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks. She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself.\n\n“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report. Tucker responded, “Yes.”\n\nTracy said she thought to herself, \"Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it.\" In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up. Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it.”\n\nWhen he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart.” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up.\n\nThen she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying.\n\nThe aftermath: Perceived threat prompts Tracy to file sexual harassment complaint\n\nThree months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke.\n\nAt first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened. Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that.\n\nTucker, however, was not responding to her text messages. And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place. A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason.\n\nWhen Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems.\n\nTracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about.” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him.\n\nTucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong. According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened.”\n\nTucker recalled the Aug. 2 phone call much differently. He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted. Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy.\n\nThe training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again.\n\nTracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said. Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable.\n\nShe filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call. In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day.\n\nTucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator. In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain.\n\n“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22. “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness.”\n\nThe investigation: Tucker moves to halt case as investigator gets to work\n\nThe university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation.\n\nA former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan.\n\nVeidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits.\n\nTracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker.\n\nJacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad.\n\nAhlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone.\n\nAlvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem. She shared a screenshot of a Dec. 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends.\n\n“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote.\n\nTracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone.\n\nAlthough Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March. In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation.\n\nTracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no.\n\nTucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint. In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy.\n\nThey later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent.\n\n“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote. “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”\n\nMichigan State was not persuaded. The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship.\n\nThe case would go forward.\n\nThe findings: Records refute Tucker's story; his attorney alleges bias\n\nTucker sat down for his interview on March 22.\n\nHe said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight. But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies.\n\nFor instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school.\n\nVeidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime.\n\nAn expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel. The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane.\n\nTucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program. But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28.\n\nDuring the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona. The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business.”\n\nVeidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation.\n\n“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY. “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.”\n\nTucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity. That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied.\n\nVeidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July.\n\nAlong the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other. Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him.\n\nPer Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing.\n\nAt the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules.\n\nAmong the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado. She died in a car accident in June.\n\nMeanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed.”\n\nLetters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly.\n\nOne letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses. They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies.\n\nA fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University.”\n\n“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed.”\n\nKenny Jacoby is an investigative reporter for USA TODAY covering sexual harassment and violence and Title IX.

A county judge, however, denied the request, saying that while some voters may have been confused or faced difficulties, he “does not have any evidence” voters were unable to vote.\n\nMaricopa County officials said tabulators had tech issues in about 20% of its voting locations. Maricopa County chairman Bill Gates and recorder Stephen Richer advised voters experiencing issues to put their ballots inside a secure box attached to the tabulators and assured they would be counted by bipartisan vote counters after polls close.\n\n“There was no one who came today with a valid ID who was turned away from the polls,” Gates told reporters Tuesday afternoon. “Even when we had this [issue] and we hadn’t figured out the solution, people were still able to vote. It was just a matter of maybe not voting in the way they wanted to.”\n\nBut the tabulator problems were baselessly played up as signs of voter fraud in right-wing media, including by Donald Trump Jr., after a post showed an election worker in the Phoenix suburb of Anthem explaining the problem to voters.\n\nElection officials have particularly faced newfound pressures from the conspiratorial right. Led by former President Donald Trump, a growing number of Republican politicians have attacked the legitimacy of the vote and repeated false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. On Tuesday, Trump and his allies were quick to launch similar baseless attacks.\n\n“Same thing is happening with Voter Fraud as happened in 2020???” Trump wrote Tuesday afternoon on his Truth Social platform. Trump also amplified a false claim about voter fraud in Michigan through his social media.\n\nThere was no evidence of widespread or outcome-changing voter fraud in the 2020 election, and there was no early sign on Tuesday of any significant voter fraud in the 2022 midterms. Voter fraud typically represents a tiny fraction of ballots cast in US elections.\n\nIn addition to the conspiracies about vote tabulators in Maricopa County, Charlie Kirk, the founder of right-wing group Turning Point USA, falsely tweeted there was a “2 hour wait minimum” at most polling places in the county. Maricopa County debunked the claim, and the county’s online wait-time tracker showed dozens of polling locations had waits of under five minutes.\n\nState and local officials and voting rights advocates have raised the alarm that the political attacks, including a marked rise in threats of violence against election workers, have sparked an exodus of local elections officials in charge of the vote.\n\nAmong the most serious issues was in a suburb of Milwaukee, where a 38-year-old man was arrested after threatening voters with a knife, briefly forcing one polling place to close.\n\nThe man demanded that staff “stop the voting,” the West Bend Police Department said in a statement. He was arrested without incident and no injuries were reported, police said.\n\nDespite these concerns, the vast majority of the tens of millions who cast ballots on Tuesday will do so without issue, in an election where early voting has been ahead of 2018 levels. Roughly 8 in 10 of voters in this year’s midterms said they were at least somewhat confident that elections in their state are being conducted fairly and accurately, according to the preliminary national results of the exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nWhile multiple states reported attempted cyberattacks on their websites on Election Day – including a “sustained outage” of a website in Mississippi – none of the hacks have prevented anyone from voting, federal officials told reporters Tuesday evening.\n\n“What we are seeing are things that we usually see on Election Day,” said Susannah Goodman, director of election security at Common Cause. “Sometimes voters are going in and one of the voting machines isn’t working, or lines are a little longer.”\n\nSecretaries of state reported few problems. “I would say this was a very smooth election,” Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals told reporters Tuesday evening.\n\nMichigan Department of State spokesperson Jake Rollow said Tuesday that “things are going smoothly” with elections in the state. Pennsylvania’s acting Democratic secretary of state, Leigh Chapman, said Tuesday that while it would take “a few days” for the state to finish counting its results, as expected, there were just “a handful of typical Election Day incidents,” including a few polling places opening late, power outages and a gas leak.\n\n“All were quickly handled,” she said.\n\nCynthia Nogar, who voted for Democratic candidates in Rochester, Minnesota, told CNN her voting location at a local church was organized and went smoothly despite her own concerns.\n\n“I couldn’t help but be a little concerned about what might happen … but it was just as quiet as usual,” she said. “That was really nice. It was kind of a relief, you know?”\n\nHandful of polls to stay open late\n\nThe vast majority of voting issues were decidedly minor and small scale, such as long lines, bad weather or tech glitches.\n\nIn a handful of counties across the country, there were problems that prompted precincts to stay open later.\n\nSix precincts across Georgia were ordered to remain open later because they opened late Tuesday morning, according to Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s acting Deputy Secretary of State.\n\nIn Bell County, Texas, polls were kept open an additional hour after some check-in machines at voting centers were not working Tuesday morning due to synchronization issues tied to the switch from Daylight Saving Time. A judge in Houston ordered voting locations in Harris County to stay open for an additional hour after several polling locations didn’t open on time.\n\nThe North Carolina Board of Elections voted unanimously to allow three polling precincts to close an hour later in North Carolina after their opening was delayed.\n\nAnd in Pennsylvania, approximately 44 polling places were impacted by a paper shortage in Luzerne County, prompting an extension of in-person voting, according to a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State.\n\nFurther, an extra verification process to ensure voters didn’t vote both by mail and in person could delay counting ballots and getting election results in Philadelphia, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia City Commissioners told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nCornelius Whiting fills out his ballot at an early voting location in Alexandria, Virginia, on Monday, September 26. Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nIn Florida’s Palm Beach County, officials are vowing to keep their main elections office open “as long as we possibly can” to count ballots with Tropical Storm Nicole expected to make landfall late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning. The storm is currently expected to become a hurricane and remain a hurricane when it reaches Florida.\n\n“At this point, we’re thinking we can make it through without a big effect on the election,” the county’s Supervisor of Elections Wendy Sartory Link told CNN on Tuesday, while noting that worsening road conditions could cause some delays as officials retrieve ballot drop boxes.\n\nIntimidation issues\n\nIn North Carolina, roughly 15 incidents of alleged intimidation have been reported to the state Board of Elections since the start of early in-person voting.\n\nIncidents included some individuals outside of a county board of elections shooting video of an election worker’s license plate and one situation where an election worker was followed from the voting site to the elections office and then followed to their neighborhood.\n\nIn Arizona, the secretary of state’s office has sent 18 referrals to law enforcement related to drop-box intimidation, including a threatening message toward a government worker and several voters reporting being filmed at drop box locations in Maricopa County last week.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Judge restricts how right-wing group can patrol drop boxes 04:13 - Source: CNN\n\nA federal judge earlier this month imposed new restrictions against a right-wing group in the state following complaints about aggressive patrols of ballot boxes in the state, including blocking the members from openly carrying guns or wearing body armor.\n\nIn Beaumont, Texas, a federal judge barred poll workers at an election site from engaging in conduct that Black voters said was intimidating.\n\nUS District Judge Michael J.

Sonic: Up until 2014, Sonic relied on local laws \"to guide how we address the display of guns at drive-ins.\" However after open-carry activists brought rifles and shotguns into its establishment, the restaurant began requesting that patrons leave the weapons at home.\n\n3. Panera Bread: The bakery-cafe chain said in 2014 that it asks customers not to bring firearms into any of its outlets across the country. Panera said in a statement that it strives to create cafes \"where customers and associates feel comfortable and welcome.\"\n\n4. Chili’s: The dine-in restaurant chain said in a 2014 statement that it \"kindly\" asks guests to refrain from openly carrying firearms.\n\n5. Starbucks: The coffee chain wrote in a 2013 open letter that it appreciates \"that there is a highly sensitive balance of rights and responsibilities surrounding America’s gun laws.\" However, its stores are \"respectfully requesting that customers no longer bring firearms\" inside the establishment or in outdoor seating areas \"even in states where “open carry” is permitted.\"\n\n6. Target: The retail giant addressed firearms in a 2014 blog post saying that its approach has \"always been to follow local laws.\" Target added that it requests guests not to bring guns inside.\n\n7. Costco: The company's website says that it doesn't \"believe it's necessary to bring firearms into its warehouses, except in the case of authorized law enforcement officers.\"\n\n8. Trader Joe's: In a 2016 announcement, the company said it would like to \"make clear we do not welcome weapons of any kind in our stores.\"\n\n9. Chipotle: The Mexican fast-food company began asking customers not to bring firearms into its restaurants after gun-rights advocates brought assault-style weapons into a downtown Dallas store in 2014.\n\n10. HEB: The grocery chain's policy has always been no open carry on its premises, even before a 2015 Texas law that allowed open carry, the company said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\n11. CVS:The drugstore chain announced the change Sept. 5 and said it was \"requesting that our customers, other than authorized law enforcement personnel, do not bring firearms into our stores.”\n\n12. Walgreens: On Sept. 5, the chain said it was \"asking our customers to no longer openly carry firearms into our stores other than authorized law enforcement officials.\"\n\n13. Wegmans:New York-based Wegmans Food Markets announced Sept. 5 it too was changing its policies and said \"we prefer that customers not openly carry firearms into our stores.\"\n\n14. Aldi: The discount grocer tweeted Sept. 9 that it was \"asking that our customers refrain from openly displaying firearms in any of our stores, except for authorized law enforcement personnel.\"\n\n15. Meijer: The Midwestern grocery store chain also announced the change on Twitter Sept. 9 and said \"we respectfully request that our customers do not open carry firearms at Meijer. We’ve made this decision because open carry can create an environment that makes our customers and team members feel unsafe.\"\n\n16. Publix: The Lakeland, Florida-based grocery store chain confirmed to USA TODAY Wednesday that \"Publix respectfully requests that only law enforcement officials openly carry firearms in our stores.\"\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Davlin_Brown.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/05"}, {"url": "https://college.usatoday.com/2012/08/29/hurricane-isaac-prompts-student-evacuations-canceled-classes/", "title": "hurricane-isaac-prompts-student-evacuations-canceled-classes", "text": "Jordan Friedman\n\ncollege.usatoday.com\n\nHeavy rains and strong winds whip through New Orleans on Wednesday, as forecasters predict the threat of major flooding will last through the night.\n\nWith heavy rain and high winds in New Orleans, Tulane University senior Rebecca Friedman wasn’t sure whether she should evacuate the city this weekend or stay on campus.\n\nAdministrators required students to remain indoors and Friedman was uncertain of what damage Hurricane Isaac might bring. She ultimately decided to fly home.\n\n“We didn’t have a mandatory evacuation, but I just really wanted to get to New York to be safe,” Friedman says. “I thought about staying, but I really didn’t want to be stuck without power for who-knows-how-long if the power goes out.”\n\nSome of Friedman’s friends decided to stay at Tulane, while others traveled home or to nearby cities such as Atlanta and Houston, she says.\n\nFriedman is one of many college students in the United States who are feeling the effects of Hurricane Isaac -- which started as a tropical storm during the weekend and was declared a Category 1 hurricane Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAt schools, such as the University of Miami, classes have been canceled and students in dry areas are hoping family and friends fare well through the storm. In parts of Mississippi and Alabama, officials have ordered mandatory evacuations.\n\nIsaac, which sustained winds as high as 75 miles per hour as it reached the southeast Louisiana coast Tuesday, initially sparked some concern at Florida institutions. The University of Miami announced Saturday that all classes and events on its Coral Gables and Rosenstiel campuses were closed Monday. The University of West Florida also remained closed through Wednesday. But, some institutions such as the University of Florida stayed open.,\n\nDespite canceled classes, students in Florida -- like University of West Florida sophomore Venise Evans -- say they weren’t too worried about Isaac because the storm didn’t hit Florida as hard as originally expected. A resident advisor in one of the school’s residence halls, Evans says many students stayed on campus while only a few left.\n\n“I’ve been going around to all of my residents and asking what they are going to do,” Evans says. “I’ve been trying to get a head count for people who are leaving.”\n\nStill, college students in affected areas are facing mandatory curfews and are advised to stay indoors. The University of Southern Mississippi has a 12:01 a.m. curfew in place for all students Wednesday, requiring them to remain in their residence halls until noon, the school said in a statement.\n\nOfficials at Tulane say that they will assess the condition of the campus before deciding when to reopen the university. Tulane was closed Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n“The two biggest issues that could impact the timing are the possibility of widespread power outages and street flooding,” Tulane said in a statement on its website. “Those situations will be readily apparent post-storm and will inform our decision.”\n\nDespite the storm, Emory sophomore Stephanie Fang, who lives in New Orleans, says she “isn’t particularly worried” about the hurricane. Her family and friends aren’t evacuating and a lot of them have bought perishable foods and other supplies to board up their houses and stay safe.\n\n\n\nJordan Friedman is a Fall 2012 USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent.

Haven’t we evolved to a point where we’re past that?”\n\n“It's still frightening and shocking that in this day and age, we still have this in the United States, in my hometown, in my home state.“\n\nThe Jacksonville shooting comes as Black communities are still reeling from other racial attacks, including last year’s killing of 10 Black grocery shoppers in Buffalo, New York, and the murder of nine churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Some say they worry media attention and intense rhetoric may have emboldened more extremists. And they worry the racially motivated attacks, which hark back to more violent times in the nation’s history, will continue.\n\nRenee Watson, director of the Bexar County small business and entrepreneurship program in San Antonio, said statewide efforts to resist gun control measures and restrict discussion of racism and the effects of slavery in the classroom have heightened fears among communities of color.\n\n“As more of these incidents come to pass, people really have to be prepared in their communities,” Watson said. “It’s not just in one place. It’s not just in the supermarket. It’s everywhere.”\n\nBlack Floridians worry about racial tensions\n\nKhalil Gibran Muhammad, a historian at the Kennedy School at Harvard University in Massachusetts, said there is a long history of racial strife in Florida, and recent attacks on Black history education in public schools have further fueled concerns about equity and inclusion in Florida.\n\n”For many Black Floridians right now, things feel very much like they've not only gone backward, but that it's a dangerous place,’’ Muhammad said.\n\nThe Rev. Rhonda Thomas, executive director of Faith in Florida, a coalition of churches advocating for social justice, said many people don’t feel safe.\n\n\"It doesn't end at all, especially here in Florida,\" she said. \"I’ve got a lot of feelings and emotions going on when I see this repeated cycle of hate that I feel has been legislated.\"\n\nDesmond Meade, president and executive director of the Orlando-based Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, said he feels somewhat “scared” as a Black man in Florida.\n\n“It makes you think about the state we’re in. I mean, just to think I could be sitting in a car and someone can shoot me just based on my race, there’s definitely a heightened level of concern,” he said.\n\n“There has to be a courageous stand taken against this.”\n\nThomas said she’s worried the younger generation will not tolerate some of the racial violence their elders did. She pointed to Montgomery, Alabama, where mostly young Black people earlier this month came to the defense of a Black riverboat co-captain who was being beaten by several white men.\n\n“What took place in Alabama was a spirit of liberation,’’ she said.\n\nThomas launched a project last month with about 200 Black churches in Florida that will teach African American history outside the classroom, including in Sunday school. “It’s on the church to teach it raw and real,’’ she said.\n\n'Walking with our ancestors'Thousands fighting for civil rights attend March on Washington\n\nHate crimes target Black people across US\n\nOutside Florida, many Black people have expressed concern about where the United States is headed.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, who headed the hearings on the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and served as former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said racial attacks, including the shooting in Jacksonville, are part of a growing trend of violence against Black communities.\n\n\"The rise is coming based on evidence from the right, in terms of right-wing extremists targeting not just houses of worship and institutions frequented by African Americans, now they moved it into grocery stores, supermarkets,\" said Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi who held a hearing last year on threats against historically Black colleges and universities. “It just continues to escalate in violence.’’\n\nThere’s data to back up Thompson’s sentiments. The Jacksonville shooting comes about a month after a new study by Tulane University researchers in New Orleans found mass shootings disproportionately target Black people and occur more often in U.S. cities with high Black populations, suggesting structural racism may be at play.\n\nHate speech has been much more intense since Barack Obama was elected the first Black president more than 10 years ago, Muhammad said.\n\n“There's no question that the notion that there are groups in this society that want to protect the interests of the white Christian community has been the major driver for supremacist groups and organizations to gain adherents and more local power that has contributed to a number of issues, including the Jan. 6 insurrection,’’ he said.\n\nKamm Howard, executive director of Reparations United, a Chicago-based organization, said there is no easy solution to racial hatred in the United States.\n\n“Some Americans want us to continue living in a state of fear. There’s a new wave of extremists who are bringing terror right into Black communities,” he said. “This has been building and building, and there’s no short answer or quick fix to this.”\n\nArthur Reed, founder of Stop the Killing, an organization based in Houston that works to extract people from gang life and into education, said that while hate crimes should prompt caution, they shouldn’t be allowed to frighten Black people.\n\n“We cannot let it strike fear into us, because that is what it’s designed to do,” Reed said. “I don’t think we can change our daily activities because of these painful acts. We have to remain as we have and make sure we stand on the principles of America that everyone has a right to be here – including the haters.”\n\nHe noted some shootings have been committed by people gripped by white supremacist ideologies of the far right.\n\n“There are people in America that have a mindset that is so sick that they believe civil war is coming,” Reed said. “Blacks could care less about that. People are paying attention to their daily lives, holding down employment and keeping a roof over their head. They’re too busy trying to survive than to plot a civil war.”\n\nHe said the rhetoric of former President Donald Trump and the lingering tensions from the Jan. 6 insurrection have fed worries and confusion among the Black community.\n\n“Why is there this constant hate for us even after all we’ve been through?” Reed said. “We are a people that have moved on. We never tried to overthrow the government. The constant attacks are mind-boggling.”\n\n'We have to remain vigilant'HBCU leaders ask Congress for help against bomb threats\n\nBlack business owners fear becoming targets\n\nSome Black business owners are also worried about their safety.\n\nAt an outreach event by Watson’s business office Monday morning in Texas, business owners expressed concerns during a presentation by a Bexar County Sheriff’s Department representative about programs that could help increase security. Such worries were higher among retail business owners, Watson said, given their greater accessibility to the public.\n\nSome Black business owners, she said, have said they feel compelled to play down their ownership to avoid attention from those who might want to do them harm.\n\n“They don’t want to be a target,” she said.\n\nThompson noted that the gun used by the killer in Jacksonville was legal there. “In Florida, the only thing that guy did wrong was he started killing people,’’ he said.\n\nThompson said it’s not enough for politicians to show up at the scene of a shooting and express their sympathies when they then turn around and support policies that allow people to go out and buy a gun.\n\n“That’s not the answer,” he said, adding that, among other things, there should be more legislation reducing access to assault weapons. “For a civilized society, we have to absolutely start the movement of what we need to do to stop this assault on American citizens.’’\n\n‘Tell ’em about the dream, Martin!’Memories from the crowd at MLK’s March on Washington\n\nOnline hate is sparking violence across US\n\nOfficial statistics back up concerns that life has become more dangerous for Black Americans in recent years.\n\nA report this year by national civil rights group Leadership Conference Education Fund found the number of hate crimes has jumped 80% since 2015, with FBI data clearly illustrating that such crimes spike during presidential elections.\n\n“From white supremacist and anti-government movements coalescing and moving more into the political mainstream, to conspiracy theories circulating online and public officials amplifying hate, there are few − if any − signs that tensions will lessen,” the report reads.\n\nAccording to the FBI, there were nearly 13,000 victims of hate crimes in 2021, an 11.6% increase over the previous year. Black people were the most targeted of all groups, accounting for nearly 4,000 of those victims, the agency said in a revised report, with the number of anti-Black incidents rising 14% to 3,277.\n\nAs such, Blacks account for about 30% of all victims, despite comprising just under 14% of the U.S. population.\n\nThe statistics reflect just a fraction of actual incidents because many crimes are not reported, and the agency’s initial report, released in December, was criticized for a lack of data collected as the FBI shifted to a new crime-reporting program with slow or non-participation by law enforcement agencies nationwide. The revised report reflects data from nearly 15,000 law enforcement agencies, or about 80% of all such agencies.\n\nAbout a third of Black adults said they were worried daily or nearly daily that they might be threatened or attacked because of their race or identity, according to a Pew Research Center survey in April 2022. In comparison, 21% of Asian American adults and 14% of Hispanic adults felt similarly, while just 4% of white adults reported feeling the same.\n\nThe survey found that nearly 3 in 10 Black adults (28%) said they had changed their daily routine or schedule in the previous year because of those fears.\n\nHate crimes and violence against Black people in the United States are not new. The nation’s history has been marred by such attacks, from centuries of slavery to the lynchings of thousands of Black men, women and children in the early 20th century. While many of those attacks happened in the South, there was also racial violence in Northern communities.\n\nMany of the attacks were part of a backlash from whites in power, including lawmakers, and happened in the wake of Reconstruction and later the Jim Crow era.\n\nFlorida Gov. DeSantis accused of feeding racial divisions\n\nMuhammad, of Harvard University, said it struck a chord that while thousands gathered in the nation’s capital Saturday for the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, three Black people were killed hours later because of the color of their skin.\n\nMany speakers, including lawmakers and civil rights activists, at the march talked about the need to address violence against communities of color and the impact of toxic rhetoric. Many of those comments were aimed at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is also running for president in the GOP primary.\n\n“There's no history of anti-racist struggle in America, Black freedom movements or civil rights history that doesn't connect the dots between political leaders and the kind of hateful and racist behavior that we saw in Jacksonville over the weekend,’’ Muhammad said. “So there's no reason to disassociate those two things at this moment. Gov. Ron DeSantis has made it painstakingly clear that he is not committed to protecting the rights of Black people in Florida when it comes to how their children learn, what their children experience if they happen to be part of the LGBTQ+ community.’’\n\nAt a vigil Sunday in Jacksonville, DeSantis condemned the shooting. \"Perpetrating violence of this kind is unacceptable, and targeting people due to their race has no place in this state of Florida,\" DeSantis said. \"We are not going to allow in the state of Florida our HBCUs to be targets for hateful lunatics.\" He was booed at times during his appearance.\n\nDesantis’ battle against “woke” culture in Florida has included blocking an Advanced Placement African American studies course in high schools and attempting to restrict conversations about race in schools and businesses.\n\nHoward, of Reparations United, said it’s no surprise the latest mass shooting happened in Florida, which he considers “a hotbed” right now in large part because of DeSantis’ rhetoric.\n\n“DeSantis is a leading voice for an anti-woke movement, and for many that means an anti-Black movement,” Howard said. “You can start talking about not teaching history and the other rhetoric, but his ultimate message is ‘anti-Blackness.’”\n\nMelina Abdullah, a professor of Pan-African studies at California State University, Los Angeles, and a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, said DeSantis has “enabled” violent actions such as the shooting through both his rhetoric and policy.\n\nOn Monday, DeSantis announced that $1 million would go to strengthen campus security at Edward Waters University, the historically Black institution where the shooter first arrived and was ordered by security to leave, through the Volunteer Florida Foundation. The governor also said $100,000 will be donated to the charity supporting the victims’ families.\n\n‘Don’t want murder to be normalized’\n\nWashington, of the MaliVai Washington Youth Foundation, said he’s still getting messages and calls from friends and family asking whether his organization was affected by the shooting.\n\n“Hey, are you OK?’’ some ask.\n\n“We can’t accept this kind of hatred,’’ he said. “We absolutely don't want murder to be normalized. I think it's incumbent upon all of us to do little things, every single day, every week, every month, every year in our communities, to make our communities a little bit better, and a little bit safer.’’", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/05/05/teachers-appreciation-week-2023-ideas-companies-donate/70179499007/", "title": "Teacher Appreciation Week 2023: Food deals, discounts for educators", "text": "With the end of the school year approaching, teachers are being recognized with specials at retailers and restaurants across the U.S. for Teacher Appreciation Week.\n\nFormer first lady Eleanor Roosevelt began the effort to create Teacher Appreciation Week and National Teachers Day when she urged Congress in 1953 of the need for a day recognizing teachers, according to School Specialty.

The state Department of Public Health’s official death count stands at six, but those numbers did not include most of the six deaths over the weekend reported by the East Alabama Medical Center, a hospital in Opelika. The hospital said four of the patients were from Chambers County and two from Lee County. The hospital said Sunday that only one of the deaths was on the state count, “as there’s an official process that ADPH must complete prior to adding to the COVID-19 state death count.” Lee County Coroner Bill Harris, who first announced the East Alabama deaths, said he did not have ages for all the victims, but one was 51, and another was in their 80s. Johns Hopkins University listed Alabama’s death count as 10 on Monday.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. Rep. Don Young now says the coronavirus is an “urgent public health emergency,” the degree of which he did not grasp weeks ago. Young, in a speech earlier this month to older Alaskans and members of the Palmer and Wasilla chambers of commerce, characterized virus concerns as overblown. The virus “attacks us senior citizens. I’m one of you. I still say we have to as a nation and state go forth with everyday activities,” he said, as reported by the Anchorage Daily News. Young is 86. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says adults 65 and older are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. In a video released by his office Thursday, Young did not specifically reference the speech. But he said the virus’s impacts are real. “Weeks ago, I did not fully grasp the severity of this crisis, but clearly, we are in the midst of an urgent public health emergency,” he said. He urged Alaskans to follow CDC recommendations and any state or local government directives.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Schools will remain closed through the end of the academic year after Gov. Doug Ducey and schools chief Kathy Hoffman on Monday extended closures that had been scheduled to expire April 13. Ducey and Hoffman said the decision is a response to new federal guidance to maintain social distancing practices through at least the end of April. Health authorities recommend people avoid congregating in large groups and maintain at least 6 feet for separation from others to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. “Today’s announcement is intended to give parents and educators as much certainty as possible so they can plan and make decisions,” Ducey and Hoffman said in a statement released by the governor’s office. The order applies to public and charter schools. Private schools must be remain closed through April 30, and administrators can decide what to do after that.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state will temporarily waive penalties for late registration on vehicles and tag renewal, the state Department of Finance and Administration announced Monday. The agency said it will waive penalties for late registration and renewal through April 16. The announcement comes as cases of the coronavirus continue to rise in the state. On Monday, the state reported 449 cases of the illness linked to the coronavirus, up from 426 a day earlier. Six people have died in Arkansas so far.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Californians endured a weekend of stepped-up restrictions aimed at keeping them home as much as possible as health officials got ready for a week likely to see a dramatic surge in coronavirus cases. The mayor of the nation’s second-largest city warned that families should prepare for isolating themselves at home in ways so they will not infect others in their households. Anticipating a surge in COVID-19 cases this week that may overwhelm health care systems, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti urged people who test positive not to rush to hospitals unless they have serious symptoms. Instead, he asked the city’s 4 million residents to think about how to separate themselves from family members while quarantining at home. He acknowledged physical distancing may be hard for those in tight quarters and said local officials were working to set up quarantine spaces for them. Meanwhile, National Guard troops set up beds in the sprawling Los Angeles Convention Center, converting it into a field hospital.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Health has released the names and locations of nine of the 10 nursing homes and long-term care facilities that are facing outbreaks of COVID-19 in response to a public records request filed by The Denver Post. The facilities include two each in Weld and Larimer counties and one each in El Paso, Chaffee, Arapahoe, Adams and Jefferson counties. The name and location of the 10th facility has not been released. State health officials announced outbreaks at five facilities March 22 but declined to identify them or say how many residents and staff members had tested positive for COVID-19. The state is still not saying how may positive tests are tied to the care centers. Through Sunday, Colorado had reported 2,307 positive tests or likely cases of COVID-19, with 327 people hospitalized and 47 deaths.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: An arena will be set up to house patients as hospitals in the region brace for an increase in the number of people with the coronavirus, the mayor said. Medical equipment will arrive by Tuesday at the Webster Bank Arena, Mayor Joe Ganim said. The arena will hold 128 beds to accommodate the overflow from hospitals and will take in ambulatory or mildly symptomatic patients, he said. Connecticut has reported nearly 2,000 people with the virus. Fairfield County has been home to more than 1,200 of them and to 21 of the 34 deaths reported statewide so far. “In the last week, two of our residents succumbed to the virus, and the number of positive coronavirus cases in Bridgeport tripled,” Ganim said. “We need to take as many proactive measures as we can to support government and health care officials by ensuring that emergency plans are in place to stay ahead of further devastating effects and support the health care system.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The governor issued an order Sunday telling out-of-state visitors to self-quarantine for two weeks. The order by Gov. John Carney, which took effect Monday morning, requires anyone entering the state from elsewhere to self-quarantine for 14 days. It does not apply to people who are only passing through the state. “Now’s not the time to visit Delaware. We’re facing a serious situation here that is getting worse,” Carney said in a statement. Those who disobey the order, which has some exceptions for health care workers and other essential tasks, could face criminal charges. Statewide, health officials said there were more than 200 coronavirus cases and 31 hospitalizations as of Sunday morning.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Federal Emergency Management Agency has granted a major disaster declaration request for D.C., which has recorded nine deaths and 401 confirmed cases of coronavirus, WUSA-TV reports. “Our message remains the same: Stay home,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. The only reasons residents can leave their homes are to go to grocery stores, pick up medicine, exercise with their own family, seek medical attention if advised or perform an essential job. A testing site was opened Monday for personnel and first responders from the Department of Corrections, Metropolitan Police Department and D.C. Fire & EMS. A drive-thru and walk-up testing site are to open by the end of the week at United Medical Center for residents whose doctors ordered a test. Residents who need medical treatment and are advised by their doctors to get tested should do so regardless of their immigration status, Bowser said.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Gardens: Gov. Ron DeSantis doesn’t want the people on a cruise ship where four people died and others are sick to be treated in the state, saying it doesn’t have the capacity to treat outsiders as the coronavirus outbreak spreads. DeSantis also told a press conference he expects South Florida’s four counties – Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Monroe – will be on near-lockdown until mid-May. DeSantis said it would be “a mistake” to bring the passengers from Holland America’s Zandaam onshore for treatment because South Florida already has a high number of new coronavirus infections, and that rate is growing. He said the area’s hospital beds need to be saved for residents and not “foreign nationals.” “We would like to have medical personnel dispatched to the ship,” DeSantis said as he visited a test site at the Miami Dolphins stadium in Miami Gardens. He wants the cruise line to arrange that.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The number of coronavirus cases in the state continues to rise quickly and steadily. Georgia reported nearly 2,700 cases of COVID-19 as of Sunday evening, with a quarter of them requiring patients to go to the hospital and 83 deaths, according to the state Department of Public Health. President Donald Trump declared a federal disaster in the state Sunday, clearing the way for federal aid. Fulton County continues to lead the state with more than 420 cases. But hard-hit Dougherty County in southwestern Georgia still leads in deaths, with 17, and has reported nearly 250 cases despite a population 11 times smaller than Fulton County. Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany, which is treating the majority of cases in the area, said it would require everyone who enters to wear a mask starting Monday. Medically trained troops from the Georgia National Guard have been brought in to help the hospital, whose intensive care unit is full as emergency patients continue to stream in.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Like many cities across the world, Honolulu came to an eerie standstill over the weekend as officials implemented measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic throughout the islands. Hawaii officials went beyond the standard stay-at-home orders and effectively flipped the switch on the state’s tourism-fueled economic engine in a bid to slow infections. As of Thursday, anyone arriving in Hawaii must undergo a mandatory 14-day self quarantine. The unprecedented move dramatically reduced the number of people on beaches, in city parks and on country roads. It’s too soon to know the total impact the shutdown will have on the tens of thousands of Hawaii residents who rely on tourism dollars to pay for the high cost of living in the state. The mandatory self-quarantine rules apply to both residents and visitors. But the prospect of being forced to stay in a hotel room or other accommodations for 14 days while on vacation effectively ended the daily influx of tourists. Airlines dramatically reduced their service to the islands. Nearly 100 hotels across the archipelago closed, with more expected to follow this week.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A scenic Idaho county known as a ski-vacation haven for celebrities and the wealthy has a new, more dubious distinction: It has one of the highest per-capita rates of confirmed coronavirus infections in America. Numbers from Johns Hopkins University on Friday showed that with more than 80 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, Blaine County has the highest rate of cases outside New York City and its surrounding counties. The numbers themselves are far smaller in the Idaho region than in New York City but still dire for residents. At least 14 of the cases in the rural county of roughly 22,000 people involved health care workers, and at least two people have died from COVID-19. The county includes tony Sun Valley Resort and draws skiers and outdoor enthusiasts from around the world.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Sunday that the state will soon more than double the number of daily COVID-19 tests it can administer as the number of cases surged. Public health officials reported 1,105 new cases Sunday, including 18 deaths. Overall, Illinois has more than 4,500 cases with 65 deaths. Pritzker said Illinois will increase its daily testing capacity from about 4,000 to 10,000 within 10 days. He said more workers are being added at labs, along with new technology. He said he spoke with Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories, which has made a portable rapid test, to ask that the state gets first dibs. The medical device maker says its cartridge-based test, approved Friday, delivers results within minutes. The first-term Democrat, who is critical of the federal government’s response to the pandemic, said he had no choice. Cases are expected to peak next month. “I’m not going to wait on promises from the federal government that will not be fulfilled,” he said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Three more people have died from coronavirus-related illnesses, increasing the state’s virus death toll to 35, health officials said Monday. Indiana’s number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, grew by 273 to 1,786, the Indiana State Department of Health said. The state now has nearly seven times the number of confirmed cases as a week ago, while the number of deaths is five times greater. Two of the new deaths involved Indianapolis residents, while the other person who died was from southeastern Indiana’s Franklin County. Dr. Kristina Box, the state health commissioner, said Friday that Indiana’s peak of coronavirus illnesses is expected in mid- to late April. A statewide stay-at-home order issued by Gov. Eric Holcomb took effect Wednesday, with exemptions for essential businesses to remain open and for necessary trips for food and medicine.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The coronavirus pandemic has claimed the lives of two more residents, raising the state’s death toll to six, health officials said Monday. The Iowa Public Health Department said in a news release that it’s been notified of 88 more positive COVID-19 tests, taking the state total to 424. Nearly 6,200 people have tested negative for the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The two dead people were described as age 81 or older. One lived in Linn County and the other in Washington County, the department said. The state reported 38 new cases Sunday and the fourth death of an Iowa resident. Gov. Kim Reynolds has ordered bars, dine-in restaurants, theaters, casinos, and businesses that sell furniture, books and clothing to remain closed until at least April 7 to help limit the virus’s spread. Schools have been closed statewide.\n\nKansas\n\nTonganoxie: A school district is suspending its grab-and-go sack lunch program for a week after a worker with the district’s drive-thru program tested positive for the coronavirus. The Tonganoxie school district said in a statement that it is placing staff members who came in contact with the fellow worker in a 14-day quarantine. The eastern Kansas district said it also is following all infection control protocols, including thoroughly sanitizing the meal preparation area before and after meal preparations. District officials say that the person did not come in direct contact with students or families and was only involved with meal preparations. Following the closure of Kansas schools for the year, districts across the state have continued to provide meals to students through meal pickup programs similar to Tonganoxie’s.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The town launched a neighborhood “safari” for children during the coronavirus pandemic by displaying stuffed animals in the windows of their homes. The “Cumberland Hill Zoo Walk” was kicked off Sunday morning in Lexington after 60 houses in the community signed up, WKYT-TV reports. “I have challenged kids to have a zoologist notebook and then go around and record the animal sightings,” said Marian Guinn, the organizer of the zoo walk. Throughout the week, families in the Cumberland Hill neighborhood will look for animals and submit their findings for a chance to win different prizes. Events like these have been a way for the community to step up and try to help each other through unusual times while also following official guidelines, Guinn said. The community will “make these days be the best they can be,” she said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The number of residents dead from the COVID-19 disease jumped significantly higher Monday in one of the state’s largest spikes in the death toll since recording its first coronavirus case in early March. Louisiana’s health department reported that 185 residents have died from the disease caused by the virus, an increase of 34 in the death toll from a day earlier. Gov. John Bel Edwards has said Louisiana has the second-highest COVID-19 death rate per capita among states, and he’s warned the New Orleans region is running low on ventilators that the hardest-hit patients need. Two-thirds of the people who have died lived in New Orleans and neighboring Jefferson Parish, according to the figures. More than 4,000 people statewide are confirmed to have the virus, according to the health department data. The state is creating a new 1,100-bed hospital at the convention center in New Orleans, for recovering patients who no longer need ventilators or intensive care. Edwards said the facility will open by April 5.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: About one-sixth of the state’s 275 positive cases of the coronavirus have been health care workers, the head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. Maine CDC director Nirav Shah said the state is investigating the workers’ exposures at different health care facilities around the state. Maine’s health care workers, as well as health care facility workers such as custodians and environmental care workers, are keeping the state’s health system functioning at great personal risk, Shah said. “As thousands of people are staying home, health care workers are doing the exact opposite. They are racing to care for those who are ill and who are in need,” he said. Three Maine residents have died from the virus. The state hasn’t identified them beyond stating their ages and county of residence.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan issued a “stay-at-home” directive in response to the coronavirus pandemic effective at 8 p.m. Monday. Hogan said the region around the nation’s capital has reached “a critical turning point in the fight” to slow the outbreak. “No Maryland resident should be leaving their home unless it is for an essential job or for an essential reason, such as obtaining food or medicine, seeking urgent medical attention or for other necessary purposes,” Hogan said at a news conference on the Maryland State House lawn. The state has reported at least 1,413 confirmed cases of the virus. Hogan said confirmed cases have increased 397% in the past week in Maryland. Also, he said the number of deaths tripled from five to 15 over the weekend. The governor also said residents should reschedule all nonessential appointments. “We are no longer asking or suggesting that Marylanders stay home,” Hogan said. “We are directing them to do so.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state’s bar exam has been postponed due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. The Supreme Judicial Court and the Board of Bar Examiners announced Monday that the exam will not be administered as planned July 28-29. The exam will instead be administered in the fall. The new dates for the exam have yet to be determined. The SJC and the Board of Bar Examiners said if limits on large gatherings continue into the fall, alternative means for administering the exam will be devised. The number of people in Massachusetts who have died from COVID-19 has risen to 56 since the start of the outbreak, an increase of eight since Sunday. Public health officials said the number of residents who have so far tested positive for the disease stands at more than 5,700. Nearly 42,800 have been tested, and more than 450 have been hospitalized.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state desperately needs thousands of ventilators to treat victims of the coronavirus and more health care workers willing to pitch in during the crisis, state officials said Monday. TCF Center in downtown Detroit soon will be turned into a 900-bed field hospital for COVID-19 patients who are not critically ill. “There’s a shortage of acute care physicians. But I’d say it’s certainly nurses. We are definitely having a shortage of nurses to take care of COVID-19 patients right now,” said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s medical executive. The number of coronavirus cases statewide reached nearly 5,500 over the weekend, while deaths rose to 132. The state has 1,700 ventilators – critical equipment to help people breathe – and needs 5,000 to 10,000 more, Khaldun said. “That’s going to be a pressure point,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said when asked about people to operate them. “That’s precisely why we’ve called out to people who have perhaps retired from the medical field to consider coming back. That’s why we’ve made it easier for people to join the front lines.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state’s students began learning from home Monday, a new normal that may last the rest of the school year, as the state tries to slow the spread of COVID-19. Minnesota had 576 confirmed cases of the disease as of Monday, which was 73 more than Sunday. The state’s death toll from COVID-19 rose by one, to 10. At least 260 patients have recovered and no longer need to be isolated. According to the Minnesota Department of Health, 56 patients were hospitalized as of Monday, including 24 in intensive care. Gov. Tim Walz gave the school closing order two weeks ago to allow administrators and teachers time to figure out how to make distance learning work for the state’s nearly 900,000 public and charter school students. “Our educators are ready for this,” Deputy Education Commissioner Heather Mueller said. “As educators and as professionals, we have been trained to not only be experts and professionals in our context but also how it is that we can deliver instruction through a variety of platforms.”\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: The mayor ordered child care centers in his city to close Monday for at least a week to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, setting a stricter standard than the one set statewide by Gov. Tate Reeves. Vicksburg Mayor George Flaggs Jr. also ordered that liquor stores and convenience stores allow no more than 10 people inside at a time, including employees, and that gas stations allow no more than 10 people at a time in their outdoor areas. His new orders took effect at noon Monday and are an expansion of some limits that Vicksburg set earlier in March. Reeves has not issued a statewide stay-at-home order, and he has said he was allowing day care centers to remain open because some people who work in health care or in other essential jobs need supervision for their children. The state Health Department on Monday updated Mississippi’s confirmed coronavirus caseload to at least 847 people and 16 deaths.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The state’s attorney general on Monday announced he’d issued subpoena-like demands for information from third-party Amazon sellers in an attempt to fight price gouging amid the coronavirus pandemic. Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office is investigating eight Missouri-based Amazon sellers who allegedly have been charging two to 19 times the prices charged before the COVID-19 outbreak for hand sanitizer, masks and respirators. Schmitt issued civil investigative demands requiring the third-party sellers to provide his office with details on pricing. “Price gouging is something that we’re taking incredibly seriously, and we’re exploring all avenues in order to protect Missourians during these unprecedented times,” Schmitt said in a statement. The attorney general’s action came after the death of William “Al” Grimes, the Henry County Democratic Party chairman, pushed the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the state to 12 and the total confirmed cases past 900.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state confirmed two more deaths due to the coronavirus Monday, bringing its total to four. The Toole County Health Department said two county residents have died. “Losing two more Montanans to COVID-19 is a blow to our statewide community,” Gov. Steve Bullock said in a statement. “Today’s news is a heartbreaking reminder to us all that we must continue to do everything we can to slow the spread of this disease. Montanans in every corner of our state are keeping the family and friends of these Montanans in our hearts.” Two earlier deaths were reported in Lincoln and Madison counties. Bullock said he’s aware of the positive tests among the senior community in Toole County and has been working to send additional resources to their health care system. Montana had 171 positive cases of COVID-19 as of Monday morning.\n\nNebraska\n\nGering: The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been reported in far western Nebraska’s Scotts Bluff County, the state said. The patient is a man in his 30s who has been in isolation at his home since Tuesday, local health officials said. His case and 10 other newly reported cases brought the state total to 120, the Nebraska Health and Human Services Department said late Sunday. More than 2,200 people have tested negative. The department said earlier Sunday that it was working with the operators of an assisted living center in Blair to empty it because several workers and residents had tested positive for COVID-19. A ninth confirmed case in Washington County has been related to the outbreak at the facility, Carter Place. Residents who tested positive and those considered to have been exposed to the new virus have been moved out and are in isolation at other health care facilities, the department said.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Several alcohol distilleries in the state unable to make liquor under current coronavirus shutdowns are turning their attention to another product to help soothe customers. They’re combining their key ingredient – ethanol, which kills germs – with aloe vera or other chemicals to make hand sanitizer. The Centers for Disease Control website reports that alcohol-based solutions of at least 70% alcohol are effective for disinfecting. Distilleries such as Seven Troughs, Ferino, Verdi Local Distillery, The Depot and Damon Industries are all ramping up production of sanitizer. Seven Troughs in Sparks is already turning out sanitizer, 175 gallons last week, most of which is going to Renown Hospital, as well as to first responders. Tom Adams, owner of Seven Troughs, said hand sanitizer is a critical supply, and the distillery is operating 24 hours a day to produce ethanol for Renown. Ethanol is combined with glycerol and hydrogen peroxide to make the sanitizer. Adams said the World Health Organization provides the guidelines to make it.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: College campuses are being turned into makeshift medical spaces as the state responds to the new coronavirus. Several more alternative care sites are being set up to serve as overflow and surge spaces for hospitals. The University of New Hampshire is working with Wentworth-Douglass, Frisbie Memorial and Portsmouth Regional hospitals to accommodate 250 people. The Durham campus also is offering resources for drive-thru testing, and its dining hall will provide takeout meals for anyone staying on campus. At the New Hampshire Technical Institute in Concord, the community college system is working with Concord Hospital and others to accommodate up to 300 patients in its gymnasium, wellness center and student center. The first such site was established at Southern New Hampshire University in Manchester.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state agency that operates the Atlantic City Expressway has scheduled a public meeting for Wednesday to consider toll increases despite the governor’s order for residents to stay home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The South Jersey Transportation Authority has two meetings planned for Wednesday and a third Thursday to consider capital projects financed by average toll increases of 57 cents at most. The authority is also considering automatic toll increases of at most 3% annually beginning in 2022. It’s unclear how the public is expected to attend the meetings amid the coronavirus outbreak and given Gov. Phil Murphy’s March 21 order that people stay home. Messages seeking comment and an explanation were left with the authority and Murphy’s office. The governor has the power to veto state boards’ and authorities’ actions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Officials say a Metropolitan Detention Center inmate in the city has tested positive for COVID-19. Bernalillo County said Monday in a statement that the jail learned of the positive test Sunday and that the inmate is in isolation and receiving treatment. Officials say the 39-year old male inmate was booked into the Metropolitan Detention Center on Thursday. Upon entry, the inmate was screened and did not have COVID-19 symptoms. Two days after arriving at the jail, officials were informed that the inmate’s mother was hospitalized and tested positive for novel coronavirus. The inmate had been caring for his mother before being booked. Officials say staff who came in contact with the inmate are also self-isolating at home for 14 days as a precaution.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds arrived in the city Monday as the number of deaths in the state from the outbreak climbed quickly. Meanwhile, Mayor Bill de Blasio said President Donald Trump’s suggestion that thousands of medical masks are disappearing from New York City hospitals is “insulting” to front-line medical workers. The state’s number of reported coronavirus deaths shot up by 253 in a single day to just over 1,200, a number Gov. Andrew Cuomo called “staggering.” State officials expect the number of deaths to continue to rise as the outbreak reaches its projected peak in the coming weeks. The USNS Comfort, which was sent to New York City after 9/11, will be used to treat non-coronavirus patients while hospitals treat people with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s new stay-at-home order won’t show any conclusive effect on blunting the intensity of the new coronavirus for about two weeks, the state epidemiologist said Monday. New restrictions on business operations and prohibitions of gatherings of more than 10 people issued by Gov. Roy Cooper on Friday were set to take effect at 5 p.m. Monday. Several urban counties and some cities already began enforcing similar orders late last week. The incubation time between an individual being exposed to COVID-19 and getting sick can be up to 14 days, with an average of five to seven days, said Dr. Zach Moore, the state epidemiologist. So the uptick in laboratory-confirmed cases or other illness surveillance in the next several days will likely reflect the period before movement rules were put in place, he said. The virus’s spread is still just beginning, and “every indication is that this is really ramping up now,” Moore said. “We’re still on our way up.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A second person has died from complications of the coronavirus, state officials said Monday. The victim was a woman in her 80s from McHenry County in north-central North Dakota. She had underlying health conditions and acquired COVID-19 through community spread. Health officials also said Monday that 11 additional people have tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the state to 109 cases. State Health Officer Mylynn Tufte on Sunday amended a confinement order for people coming into the state from out of the country or from states with widespread community cases. The original order issued Saturday said people must stay at home for 14 days after arriving in North Dakota. The amended order removes the quarantine requirement for those who already had returned but requires it for all current and future travel. Workers who are exempt from the order include those working in health care, law enforcement, agriculture and energy.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A prison employee tested positive for the coronavirus, the state reported Sunday night, marking the first such occurrence in Ohio at a time of growing national fears about the impact of the virus in crowded jails and prisons. The employee at Marion Correctional Institution in north-central Ohio last worked March 24, began showing symptoms March 25 and reported the positive test Sunday, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said. The person is at home recovering. The employee is part of the prison’s “custody staff,” spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said Monday, a category that can include guards and supervisors such as lieutenants and captains. The prison is prohibiting inmate and employee transfers out of the facility and is restricting movement inside, the agency said. Systemwide, the prisons department is now allowing alcohol-based hand sanitizer and limiting prison access to employees and necessary contractors who undergo health screens, said agency Director Annette Chambers-Smith.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More than 50 new cases of coronavirus and one additional death due to COVID-19 were reported Monday by the Oklahoma State Department of Health. There are now 17 deaths due to the virus and at least 481 cases, the department said, up from 16 deaths and 429 cases on Sunday. The virus was confirmed in three additional counties, and 47 of the state’s 77 counties now have at least one confirmed case. The report comes after Gov. Kevin Stitt on Sunday joined other governors in requiring air travelers from New York and other virus hot spots to quarantine when traveling to the state. Travelers who fly from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Washington state and Louisiana must self-quarantine for 14 days if they head to Oklahoma, according to Stitt’s executive order.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: In the past couple of weeks, tens of thousands of Oregonians have sought unemployment benefits, but the workers vetting those claims worry the state Employment Department has not put strict enough measures into place to prevent them from getting the new coronavirus. The agency operates call centers in Bend and Beaverton. “We’re not getting treated the same as the public, and they expect us to help the public,” said Leslie Vincent, an adjudicator at the Beaverton call center. Adalia McDonald, a fraud investigator at the Bend call center, said workers there share cubicles in close quarters – not even 3 feet apart. The latest health guidance from state and federal officials says people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance from each other to avoid getting sick. McDonald said she has also raised concerns about the office’s ventilation system and the shared cubicles.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf announced Monday that all schools will remain closed indefinitely. Wolf also extended his order to stay at home to more counties – Carbon, Cumberland, Dauphin and Schuylkill – and said the social distancing guidelines will be extended until April 30. “We’re going to keep our schools and businesses closed as long as we need to keep them closed to keep Pennsylvania safe. Right now, it isn’t safe,” he said. Under Wolf’s order, people in the 26 affected counties may leave their homes to work at a business that’s still open, go to the grocery store or pharmacy, visit a doctor, care for a relative, get outside to exercise or for several other reasons. COVID-19 cases reported by the state Health Department on Monday rose by 693 to nearly 4,100. There were 10 new deaths, bringing Pennsylvania’s total to 48.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is using space at public colleges to set up coronavirus testing stations. The National Guard is setting up mobile testing sites in parking lots at the Community College of Rhode Island’s Warwick campus and at the University of Rhode Island in South Kingstown. Testing at CCRI is expected to begin by the middle of the week. Testing at the National Guard’s site at the Plains Road parking lot on URI’s campus is scheduled to begin Tuesday. It will be by appointment only and is only available to prescreened patients who must show a form provided by their physician or the state Department of Health. The goal is to test 600 people per day.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Whether all of the state should go under a stay-at-home order to slow the spread of the coronavirus continued to be debated by cities and towns and by lawmakers at both the state and federal level Monday. The ultimate decider, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, did not weigh in Monday. He has said before that a stay-at-home order closing nonessential businesses like gyms and hair salons is on the table, but he won’t issue it until he sees data from state health officials supporting it. But plenty of others have offered their opinions. On Monday, Republican state House Speaker Jay Lucas said cities need to lay off issuing their own orders and trust the governor’s response to the coronavirus. Also Monday, Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham, on quarantine in his Charleston home after contracting COVID-19, said the governor needs to issue a statewide stay-at-home order to end the uncertainty of beach communities that don’t want hundreds of outsiders visiting.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials reported Monday that they have confirmed 101 cases of COVID-19, more than doubling the number of cases since Thursday. The South Dakota Department of Health says there are 11 new, confirmed cases of the coronavirus. The state health lab has also cleared a backlog of tests. Between the state lab and commercial labs, over 3,400 people have been tested. Gov. Kristi Noem doesn’t expect the number of infections to peak until at least May. State epidemiologist Josh Clayton says health officials are recommending tests for people only if they exhibit symptoms of the coronavirus and may have come into contact with someone with the disease. So far, 34 people in South Dakota have recovered after contracting the coronavirus, while one has died.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Monday issued a two-week statewide order closing nonessential businesses and telling Tennesseans to stay home in an effort to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The “safer at home” order, filed Monday afternoon, enacts similar restrictions put in place by mayors in Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville and governors in at least 30 other states. In recent days, some smaller cities in Tennessee have also implemented such orders. “This is not a mandated ‘shelter in place’ order because it remains deeply important to me to protect personal liberties,” Lee said at a Monday afternoon news briefing. The order takes effect at 11:59 p.m. Tuesday and lasts through April 14, during which time only essential businesses are to continue operating and residents are to stay home “as much as possible.” Another order filed Monday specifically orders the temporary closure of salons, spas, concert venues, theaters and other indoor recreational facilities.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A North Texas ambulance provider is partnering with health officials so that its paramedics can go into homes and perform coronavirus testing on previously screened patients. Specially trained paramedics with MedStar will be sent to homes of residents in Tarrant County who are being investigated by the county public health department as possibly having the virus and are under quarantine at home, said Matt Zavadsky, a spokesman for the ambulance provider. MedStar is a governmental entity that is the 911 ambulance provider for Fort Worth and 14 other cities in Tarrant County, located west of Dallas. The Tarrant County Public Health Department will provide MedStar with testing kits. Paramedics will go to a resident’s home, take a swab and deliver that to the health department, which will do the testing. The home testing visits are expected to last about 30 minutes, Zavadsky said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Former speaker of the Utah House, auto executive and philanthropist Robert Garff died Sunday of complications from COVID-19, his daughter and the automotive group said. Rep. Melissa Garff Ballard, R-North Salt Lake, posted on Facebook: “My loving dad passed away peacefully today from COVID-19. He has lived a long and happy life, full of vigor and love for our state and our families.” Garff, 77, was the third Utah resident to die of the virus. Garff was a prominent Utah businessman and chairman of the Ken Garff Automotive Group, which was started by his family. He served as speaker of the Utah House from 1985 to 1987 and chaired the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Games. Ken Garff Automotive released a statement saying that Robert and his wife, Katharine, tested positive for the virus after driving back from Palm Springs, California.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott on Monday ordered anyone arriving in the state to self-quarantine for 14 days to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The governor’s order applies to both Vermonters and out-of-staters arriving for anything other than “an essential purpose.” The governor took the additional action after federal guidance that advised residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to refrain from nonessential domestic travel for 14 days. “We need everyone entering Vermont to be a good neighbor and abide by the self-isolation directive and then to follow afterward the stay-home, stay-safe order,” Scott said during his regular Monday briefing. He said the order does not apply to people who are going to the grocery store or who work across the border.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The governor on Monday ordered all higher education institutions to stop any in-person instruction amid the coronavirus pandemic, a move likely directed at Liberty University. The evangelical college in Lynchburg led by President Jerry Falwell Jr. has faced intense criticism over its decision to welcome students back to campus last week after the end of their spring break. The vast majority of classes have been moved online, but the university has said publicly that in-person instruction was necessary for a few select courses. “We are currently reviewing what the governor said but aren’t able to make a comment at this moment,” Liberty spokesman Scott Lamb said. Falwell, one of President Donald Trump’s earliest and most ardent high-profile supporters, has generally characterized concerns about the virus as overblown. He has accused the news media of stoking fear and suggesting coverage has been politically motivated to hurt the president.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Firefighters and first responders in the state are seeking donations of protective gear and asking the public to be honest about their symptoms when they call for help so that workers can prepare. People may not be forthcoming or truthful about their condition and fail to report a fever or cough when they call 911. For this reason, all EMS workers in Seattle are responding to calls with full protective gear, including masks, gloves and gowns, said Kristin Tinsley, spokeswoman for Seattle fire department. Six Seattle firefighters have tested positive for COVID-19, and 86 have been through isolation or quarantine since the outbreak began in February, she said. Eastside Fire and Rescue in Issaquah is conducting a message campaign to let people know they will respond to calls for help regardless of the person’s symptoms, Capt. Steve Johnson said Monday. “If we know you have symptoms, we can prepare to help stop the spread of the virus,” he said. “We have the protective gear, so we’re not going to not respond to a call.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported its first death linked to the new coronavirus pandemic Sunday. The fatality involved an 88-year-old woman from Marion County, the Department of Health and Human Resources said in a news release. The statement said the death was confirmed through the Marion County Health Department and United Hospital Center. “I ask all West Virginians to join Cathy and I in praying for the family, friends, and loved ones of this individual,” Gov. Justice said in a statement. “It is truly a sad day in West Virginia.” West Virginia was the last U.S. state to report a confirmed case, on March 17, a fact attributed by Justice to a lack of testing. It also was among the last states to report a death. Justice, a Republican, has repeatedly warned of the virus’s potential damage in a state where about 20% of the population is 65 or older, and a high percentage of people have existing health problems. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation study found that West Virginia has the nation’s highest percentage of adults at risk of developing serious illnesses from the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state is preparing to open field hospitals and voluntary isolation centers in anticipation of a surge in COVID-19 patients, with cases expected to peak in another week or more, Gov. Tony Evers and state health leaders said Monday. “We are headed into the worst of this, folks,” Evers said on a conference call. “I’m sure many of us would like to wake up from this nightmare tomorrow morning and say it never happened. But the responsible thing is to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.” There had been more than 1,200 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections in the state as of Monday, with 20 deaths, based on state and local health department numbers. Andrea Palm, secretary of the state Department of Health Services, said the effects that the stay-at-home order have had on the spread of the disease won’t be seen until next week at the earliest. “We really do believe it’s another 10-plus days before were going to see evidence of a flattening off of the new daily cases,” she said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Wyoming Board of Medicine is warning physicians against hoarding and misusing a pair of drugs touted as potential treatments for the coronavirus, its executive director said. Kevin Bohnenblust told the Casper Star-Tribune the board met after hearing reports that physicians were writing prescriptions for family and friends for medications usually used to treat malaria, lupus and arthritis. “(The board is) saying, ‘We need to take this seriously; if you’re inappropriately prescribing this and giving it to people who aren’t symptomatic, that’s a violation of the (medical practice), act and we’ll take action,’ ” Bohnenblust said. The two drugs – chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – were shown to be effective in a limited study in Europe, and they are being studied in the U.S., but physicians have cautioned against writing prescriptions for the drugs before the science supports it.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/30"}]}

The company is not at risk of being dismantled because there is no mechanism under New York law that would dissolve the company. However, a felony conviction could impact its ability to do business or obtain loans or contracts.\n\nThe guilty verdict comes as Trump is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors for his handling of classified documents, the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, and the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s business records and financial statements. He is also facing a $250 million civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general alleging he and his adult children were involved in a decade-long fraud. The attorney general is seeking to permanently bar them from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York state, among other penalties.\n\nTrump Org. attorneys said they plan to appeal.\n\n“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “The Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes. Today’s verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.”\n\nWhen asked on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday why charges weren’t brought against the former president, Bragg said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“This was a chapter in it. A case against the corporations,” Bragg said.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said Bragg’s approach has been vindicated.\n\n“Obviously, this is a setback for the Trump Org. – a major setback for the Trump Org. They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less. It’s a win-win – unless you’re the tax authorities.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Lauren Del Valle", "Kara Scannell", "Lauren Del Valle"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/trump-new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james-fraud-lawsuit/index.html", "title": "New York attorney general files civil fraud lawsuit against Trump ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe New York state attorney general filed a sweeping lawsuit Wednesday against former President Donald Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former President used to enrich himself.\n\nIn the more than 200-page lawsuit, Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, alleges the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.\n\n“This conduct cannot be brushed aside and dismissed as some sort of good-faith mistake,” James said at a news conference in New York.\n\n“The statements of financial condition were greatly exaggerated, grossly inflated, objectively false, and therefore fraudulent and illegal,” she added. “And as a result of that we are seeking relief, and Mr. Trump, the Trump Organization, his family – they should all be held accountable.”\n\nTrump and his children, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump, are named as defendants in the lawsuit. Allen Weisselberg, former CFO for the Trump Organization, and Jeff McConney, another longtime company executive, are also named.\n\nJames said she believes state and criminal laws may have been violated and referred the matter to the US attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe US attorney’s office declined to comment.\n\n“These acts of fraud and misrepresentation were similar in nature, were committed by upper management at the Trump Organization as part of a common endeavor for each annual Statement, and were approved at the highest levels of the Trump Organization – including by Mr. Trump himself,” the lawsuit states.\n\nAs part of the lawsuit, James is seeking $250 million in allegedly ill-gotten funds and to permanently bar Trump and the children named in the lawsuit from serving as the director of a business registered in New York state. She is also seeking to cancel the Trump Organization’s corporate certificate, which, if granted by a judge, could effectively force the company to cease operations in New York state.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Maggie Haberman breaks down New York AG's lawsuit against Trump 02:23 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump previously called James a “renegade prosecutor” who he said is running a “vindictive and self-serving fishing expedition.” The Trump Organization called her previously allegations “baseless” and denied any wrongdoing.\n\nResponding to Wednesday’s announcement, Trump attorney Alina Habba said in a statement to CNN: “Today’s filing is neither focused on the facts nor the law – rather, it is solely focused on advancing the Attorney General’s political agenda. It is abundantly clear that the Attorney General’s Office has exceeded its statutory authority by prying into transactions where absolutely no wrongdoing has taken place.”\n\nWeisselberg’s attorney, Nicholas Gravante, declined to comment.\n\nThe civil lawsuit comes as Trump is under increasing legal pressure as prosecutors are taking investigative steps that move ever closer to his inner circle.\n\nTrump is facing numerous criminal investigations from federal and state prosecutors involving the accuracy of his company’s financial statements, interference in the 2020 presidential election, and his handling of classified documents after leaving office. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nAG alleges that Trump lied 200+ times about the value of his assets\n\nJames alleges that the former President and his company made “scores of fraudulent, false, and misleading representations” over a 10-year period, according to the lawsuit, which specifically highlighted what it called “200 false and misleading valuations” of Trump’s assets.\n\n“The financial statements in question were issued annually; each contained a significant number of fraudulent, false, and misleading representations about a great many of the Trump Organization’s assets; and most played a role in particular transactions with financial institutions,” the lawsuit alleges.\n\n“The number of grossly inflated asset values is staggering,” the suit adds.\n\nAccording to James, Trump’s businesses prepared statements of financial condition every year to submit to banks and other financial institutions. The statements showed the financial position of the Trump businesses, James said, and were relied upon if the Trump Organization wanted to apply for loans.\n\nEach statement was personally certified as accurate by Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., or Weisselberg, James told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nTrump “made known” that “he wanted his net worth reflected on those statements to increase,” James said, “a desire Mr. Weisselberg and others carried out year after year in their fraudulent preparation of those statements.”\n\nAs an example of allegations Trump inflated valuations to increase his own profits. James highlighted what she says happened with 40 Wall Street, a property known as The Trump Building in New York City’s financial district, which is referenced dozens of times in the lawsuit.\n\nTrump’s company obtained appraisals for the property in 2010 and 2012, which found that it was worth $200 million and $220 million respectively, according to the lawsuit. But Trump’s company repeatedly claimed that the property was worth a lot more in its official financial statements, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIn 2011, Trump’s company said the property was worth $524 million. He said it was worth $527 million in 2012, and $530 million in 2013, according to the lawsuit, which argued that there was not a valid basis for these inflated valuations, and that Trump falsely claimed these numbers came from “professionals.”\n\nDuring Wednesday’s news conference James also said that Trump inflated the square footage of his Trump Tower triplex apartment in order to misrepresent the value at over $300 million.\n\n“Mr. Trump represented that his apartments spanned more than 30,000 square feet, which was the basis for valuing the apartment. In reality, the apartment had an area of less than 11,000 square feet, something that Mr. Trump was well aware of,” James said.\n\nShe added: “Based on that inflated square footage, the value of the apartment in 2015, in 2016, was $327 million. To this date, no apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount.”\n\nThree-year investigation\n\nThe announcement is the latest development in what has been a three-year investigation led by James into the Trump Organization’s finances.\n\nIn January, James’ office said it found “significant” evidence indicating the Trump Organization used false or misleading asset valuations in its financial statements to obtain loans, insurance and tax benefits. The following month, Trump’s long-time accounting firm resigned.\n\nJames’ launched her investigation in 2019 after Trump’s former fixer and personal attorney Michael Cohen testified before Congress alleging that Trump inflated the value of certain assets to obtain loans and insurance and undervalued others to gain tax benefits.\n\nCohen told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom” Wednesday that the allegations in James’ lawsuit represent a “complete destruction” to Trump’s image as a wealthy self-made businessman.\n\n“It’s like a nuclear bomb exploded. The man has a fragile ego, which we all know. His entire life is predicated on his net worth and him portraying himself as this wonderful businessman, this massive success, this incredibly wealthy guy. And what do we know? We know that it’s not true,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'The system protects the rich': Michael Cohen addresses new fraud lawsuit against Trump 01:55 - Source: CNN\n\nIn addition to the new fraud lawsuit, the Trump Organization is going on trial next month on charges it was engaged in a 15-year tax fraud scheme and its long-time chief financial officer has agreed to testify against the company.\n\nWeisselberg, who served as chief financial officer at the Trump Organization for decades, pleaded guilty in August to his role in a 15-year-long tax fraud scheme, and as part of the deal, he had agreed to testify against Trump’s real estate company at trial.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Trump Organization had offered to settle to ward off the lawsuit even as they denied any wrongdoing, but James’ office made it clear it wasn’t interested in a deal, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has been conducting a criminal investigation into the Trump Organization but has yet to bring any charges and former prosecutors have cast doubt that that would ever happen.\n\nThe burden of proof in civil investigations is lower than for criminal investigations, however, something that benefits James’ office. To bring a criminal case, prosecutors would need evidence of Trump’s state of mind and whether he intended to mislead or defraud anyone when he made statements embellishing the value of his properties.\n\nBragg’s office interviewed bankers, Trump Organization employees and Trump’s longtime accountant but it does not have a key insider cooperating with the investigation. One of the issues that gave Bragg pause from moving forward earlier this year was the lack of an insider who could tie Trump to the valuations, CNN has reported.\n\nAG: Trump’s oldest children ‘knowingly participated’\n\nEric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. “knowingly participated” in the alleged fraudulent schemes, the lawsuit states.\n\nThe alleged scheme “required the participation of Mr. Trump and his children,” the lawsuit said, adding that the children were “aware of the true financial performance of the company.”\n\nThe lawsuit, for instance, alleges that Eric Trump was involved in an approach to appraising properties in Las Vegas in a way that lowered their value for tax purposes while inflating their value on Trump financial statements.\n\nIt also quotes testimony from Trump Jr. as it describes how the value of Trump Park Avenue was allegedly inflated on Trump financial statements. An appraisal of the property by an outside firm in 2010 for a loan took into account how some of the units were rent-stabilized, lowering their value, according to James’ complaint. Yet, Trump financial statements put a value on the units roughly six times higher than what the appraiser had concluded, the lawsuit said.\n\nAnd the lawsuit pointed to Ivanka Trump’s involvement in securing a loan for purchasing the Doral golf course in Florida and Chicago properties in 2012 – loans that James claims were extended in part because of financial statements allegedly containing misrepresentations.\n\n“On each of those transactions with Deutsche Bank, Ms. Trump was aware that the transactions included a personal guaranty from Mr. Trump that required him to provide annual Statements of Financial Condition and certifications,” the lawsuit says.\n\nFamily was deposed by AG’s office\n\nIn April, after a protracted legal fight to enforce subpoenas for Trump and his adult children’s depositions, lawyers with James’ office saying they were nearing the end of the investigation and needed the Trumps’ testimony before making a decision.\n\nLast month, Trump did not answer questions and asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when deposed by the attorney general’s office. Eric Trump, who runs the business on a daily basis, also invoked his Fifth Amendment right in 2020 in response to more than 500 questions.\n\nSince Trump and Eric Trump declined to answer questions, if the case goes to trial, the jury can draw an “adverse inference” against them for not answering questions. That could result in a higher judgment against them or the company if they’re found liable.\n\nIvanka Trump and Trump Jr. both answered questions during interviews that spanned more than seven hours, sources told CNN.\n\nJames noted that Trump and Weisselberg invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege during her news conference.\n\n“When asked under oath if he, Mr. Trump, continued to review and approve the statements after becoming president of the United States in 2017, Mr. Trump again invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and refused to answer,” James said Wednesday.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Tierney Sneed Marshall Cohen Hannah Rabinowitz", "Kara Scannell", "Tierney Sneed", "Marshall Cohen", "Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/donald-trump-investigations-lawsuits/index.html", "title": "The notable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAll eyes are on former President Donald Trump, whose third White House bid has already become mired in controversy.\n\nProsecutors, investigators and lawmakers in Washington, DC, New York, Georgia, Florida and across the United States are among those interested in what Trump has to say about the myriad legal issues facing the former president, his business and his allies.\n\nMultiple federal and state investigations are ongoing regarding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, his handling of sensitive government documents and his family business.\n\nTrump and his company deny any wrongdoing or criminality in all matters, state and federal, and has aggressively maintained his innocence.\n\nHere’s an updated list of notable investigations, lawsuits and controversies:\n\nTax returns: House Democrats win court battle to view documents\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee finally got access to the former president’s tax returns after the Supreme Court dealt a massive defeat to Trump, paving the way for the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the documents to the Democratic-led House.\n\nA federal appeals court sided with a House Ways and Means Committee request – originally made in 2019 – to obtain the returns, upholding a ruling from a Trump-nominated district court judge.\n\nTrump appealed to the Supreme Court, which rejected his appeal with no noted dissents.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sought the tax returns from the IRS in 2019, and the agency, under the Trump administration, initially resisted turning them over. The case moved slowly until 2021, when, under the Biden administration, the Justice Department changed its legal posture and concluded the IRS was obligated to comply with the committee’s request.\n\nMar-a-Lago documents: Did Trump mishandle classified material?\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has appointed special counsel Jack Smith to oversee the Justice Department criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were brought to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury in Washington has been empaneled and has interviewed potential witnesses to how Trump handled the documents.\n\nRELATED: The big numbers from the Mar-a-Lago search\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago – including some classified records.\n\nAny unauthorized retention or destruction of White House documents could violate a criminal law that prohibits the removal or destruction of official government records, legal experts told CNN.\n\n2020 election and January 6: House select committee\n\nThe House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack has uncovered dramatic evidence of Trump’s actions before and on January 6, especially efforts to use the levers of government to overturn the election.\n\nThe committee is expected to issue a report and to vote on whether to make criminal referrals to the Justice Department later this month, marking the end of its investigation.\n\nDuring the panel’s hearings this summer, fingers were pointed at GOP lawmakers and Trump allies who tried to help overturn the election and Trump White House officials who failed to stop the former president’s actions.\n\nThe House panel and Trump are also enmeshed in a legal fight over whether the former president must comply with a subpoena for documents and his testimony.\n\n2020 election and January 6: US Justice Department\n\nThe Justice Department has an investigation of its own into the post-2020 election period.\n\nWhile DOJ has not acted publicly during the so-called quiet period leading up to the midterms, a grand jury in Washington has been hearing from witnesses.\n\nRecently, DOJ moved to compel additional testimony from former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin.\n\nTrump has been fighting to keep former advisers from testifying about certain conversations, citing executive and attorney-client privileges to keep information confidential or slow down criminal investigators.\n\n2020 Election: Efforts to overturn Georgia results\n\nFulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis is overseeing a special grand jury investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia.\n\nThe probe was launched last year following Trump’s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to “find” votes to overturn the election results.\n\nWillis, a Democrat, has also informed all 16 of the individuals who signed an “unofficial electoral certificate,” which was ultimately sent to the National Archives in late 2020, that they may be indicted in the probe.\n\nThe investigation may be drawing closer to Trump as well. Former New York City Mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani has appeared before the grand jury, as has Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham lost a court bid to avoid testifying.\n\nWillis had pledged to wait until after the midterms to make announcements about possible charges.\n\n2020 Election: Fake GOP electors\n\nThe Justice Department, meanwhile, is looking at an aspect of a plot to put forward fake GOP electors from seven states.\n\nFake certificates were created by Trump allies in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Mexico, who sought to replace valid presidential electors from their states with a pro-Trump slate.\n\nTrump Organization convicted of criminal tax fraud\n\nTrump’s namesake business, the Trump Organization, was convicted this week by a New York jury of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors allege was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees.\n\nManhattan prosecutors told a jury the case is about “greed and cheating,” laying out an alleged 15-year scheme within the Trump Organization to pay high-level executives in perks like luxury cars and apartments without paying taxes on them.\n\nFormer Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to his role in the tax scheme this summer. He testified in the trial but did not cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nTrump Organization: NY attorney general investigation\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, after a lengthy investigation, sued Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization in September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.\n\nJames alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.\n\nJames is seeking $250 million in allegedly ill-gotten funds.\n\nRetired Judge Barbara Jones has been named to serve as a monitor over the company. James said one is needed to prevent the real estate company from continuing what the state has alleged is a decade-long fraud.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has called the investigation politically motivated based on James’ electoral ambitions.\n\nA trial is set for October 2023.\n\nTrump Organization: NY DA criminal investigation\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg inherited that office’s probe into Trump’s businesses, but it has slowed significantly.\n\nProsecutors were focusing on the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s financial statements when seeking financing, people familiar with the matter have told CNN.\n\nEarlier this year, Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz, two senior prosecutors on the team, resigned after Bragg informed them that he wasn’t prepared to move forward with criminal charges, CNN’s Kara Scannell has reported.\n\nA special grand jury hearing evidence in the case expired in April, but a new one could be seated in the future.\n\nBragg has maintained the investigation is ongoing and prosecutors are reviewing new evidence. He said he will issue a public statement or an indictment when it’s completed.\n\nJanuary 6: Lawsuits by police officers\n\nSeveral members of the US Capitol Police and Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police are suing Trump, saying his words and actions incited the riot.\n\nThe various cases accuse Trump of directing assault and battery; aiding and abetting assault and battery; and violating local Washington, DC, laws that prohibit incitement of riots and disorderly conduct.\n\nA federal judge in February said Trump’s statements to his supporters before the riot are “the essence of civil conspiracy,” and lawsuits by the police officers have been allowed to proceed.\n\nTrump and his top advisers have not been charged with any crimes. Trump and others who are sued have argued they are not responsible for the actions of the people who stormed the Capitol.\n\nA federal appeals court this week heard Trump’s attempt to throw out the cases.\n\nE. Jean Carroll: Defamation suit over Trump’s denial of rape claims\n\nMagazine writer E. Jean Carroll alleged Trump raped her in a New York department store dressing room in the mid 1990s and defamed her when he denied the rape, said she was not his “type” and alleged she made the claim to boost sales of her book.\n\nTrump and the Justice Department said Trump was a federal employee and his statements denying Carroll’s allegations were made in response to reporters’ questions while he was at the White House. They argue the Justice Department should be substituted as the defendant, which, because the government cannot be sued for defamation, would end the lawsuit.\n\nIn September, a federal appeals court in New York ruled that Trump was a federal employee when he denied Carroll’s claim of rape and sexual assault.\n\nEarly next year, the Washington, DC, appeals court will determine if Trump was acting within the scope of his employment when he made the allegedly defamatory statements. Meanwhile, the judge overseeing the lawsuit has set a trial for early February.\n\nCarroll has also sued Trump for battery and defamation.\n\nMichael Cohen: Claims of retaliation against Trump and Barr – Trump victory\n\nTrump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, sued Trump, former Attorney General William Barr and others, alleging they put him back in jail to prevent him from promoting his upcoming book while under home confinement.\n\nCohen was serving the remainder of his sentence for lying to Congress and campaign violations at home, due to Covid-19 concerns, when he started an anti-Trump social media campaign in summer 2020. In retaliation, Cohen said he was sent back to prison and spent 16 days in solitary.\n\nA federal judge on November 14 threw out the lawsuit. District Judge Lewis Liman said he was empathetic to Cohen’s position but said Supreme Court precedent bars him from allowing the case to move forward.\n\nMary Trump: Accusations of deception regarding inheritance – Trump victory\n\nIn 2020, Mary Trump sued her uncle Donald Trump, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired judge, and the executor of her late uncle Robert Trump’s estate, alleging “they designed and carried out a complex scheme to siphon funds away from her interests, conceal their grift, and deceive her about the true value of what she had inherited.”\n\nOn November 14, a New York state judge threw out the lawsuit, saying that Mary Trump’s claims are barred by an earlier settlement she reached over 20 years ago.\n\nMary Trump has appealed the ruling.\n\nPersonal retaliation: Peter Strzok lawsuit\n\nFormer top FBI counter-intelligence official Peter Strzok, who was terminated by the FBI in 2018 after the revelation of anti-Trump texts Strzok exchanged with a top lawyer at the bureau, Lisa Page, has sued DOJ alleging he was improperly terminated. Strzok is now seeking to depose Trump for the case, though the judge has not said yet how she’ll rule on a DOJ request to block the deposition.\n\nStrzok and Page were constant targets of verbal attacks by Trump and his allies as part of the larger ire Trump expressed toward the FBI during the Trump-Russia investigation. Trump repeatedly and publicly called for Strzok’s ouster until Strzok was fired in August 2018.\n\nPersonal retaliation: Alexander Vindman – Trump allies victory\n\nA federal judge recently dismissed a lawsuit from star Trump impeachment witness Alexander Vindman, who had accused Donald Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani and former Trump White House staffers of smearing him so that he lost his federal job. Former President Trump was not named in the suit.\n\nVindman alleged the defendants conspired against him to cause him harm after Trump’s first impeachment proceeding.\n\nJudge James Boasberg of the DC District Court wrote that Vindman wasn’t able to show the group worked together with the “specific goal of intimidating Vindman from testifying or performing his job” or injure him by taking unlawful action.\n\nTrump-filed lawsuits: Hillary Clinton, Democrats, ex-FBI officials and more\n\nA federal judge in September dismissed Trump’s lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, several ex-FBI officials and more than two dozen other people and entities that he claims conspired to undermine his 2016 campaign by trying to vilify him with fabricated information tying him to Russia.\n\n“What (Trump’s lawsuit) lacks in substance and legal support it seeks to substitute with length, hyperbole, and the settling of scores and grievances,” US District Judge Donald Middlebrooks wrote.\n\nTrump is appealing the decision, but Middlebrooks this month also ordered Trump lawyers Alina Habba, Michael Madaio, Peter Ticktin, Jamie Alan Sasson and their law firms to pay $50,000 in penalties to the court and $16,274.23 in legal fees to Charles Dolan, one of more than two dozen people or entities named as defendants in the lawsuit.\n\nTrump-filed lawsuits: The New York Times, Mary Trump and CNN\n\nThe former president is suing his niece and The New York Times in New York state court over the disclosure of his tax information.\n\nDonald Trump’s lawsuit – which is seeking “damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be no less than One Hundred Million Dollars” – alleges that Mary Trump’s disclosure of the tax information to the Times amounted to an illegal breach of contract, among other claims, because the disclosure allegedly violated the 2001 settlement agreement among the Trump family.\n\nThe Times has planned to fight the lawsuit.\n\n“The Times’s coverage of Donald Trump’s taxes helped inform the public through meticulous reporting on a subject of overriding public interest,” the Times said in a statement. “This lawsuit is an attempt to silence independent news organizations and we plan to vigorously defend against it.”\n\nDonald Trump also sued CNN last month in a southern Florida court, accusing the network of a “campaign of dissuasion in the form of libel and slander” that “escalated in recent months.”\n\nA CNN spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Dan Berman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/donald-trump-new-york-attorney-general-lawsuit-analysis/index.html", "title": "Why this New York lawsuit is really going to anger Donald Trump ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump is not big on loyalty to anyone else – with one major exception.\n\nWhen it comes to his immediate family – especially his adult children – Trump is uncharacteristically loyal, demonstrating a fatherly pride and protectiveness that he shows to no one else in life.\n\n“I have a lot of good relationships,” Trump has said. “I have good enemies, too, which is okay. But I think more of my family than others.”\n\nIn all of his endeavors – from his real estate business to his reality TV empire to his White House tenure – Trump has installed his children as his deputies, a clear signal that he only really trusts the people who are related to him by blood.\n\nConsider that fact in light of the news on Wednesday that New York Attorney General Letitia James filed suit against Trump as well as his three eldest children (Don Jr., Ivanka and Eric), alleging they broke a variety of state laws including insurance fraud, the falsification of business records and false financial statements.\n\n“These acts of fraud and misrepresentation were similar in nature, were committed by upper management at the Trump Organization as part of a common endeavor for each annual Statement, and were approved at the highest levels of the Trump Organization – including by Mr. Trump himself,” the lawsuit reads.\n\nTrump’s attorney, Alina Habba, called the lawsuit an “unchecked abuse of authority.”\n\nWhich is what Trump and his allies say about pretty much everything – from Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election to his impeachment over his dealings with Ukraine to his role in the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol.\n\nHe’s also used similar language to dismiss convictions of those in his orbit and, at times, inner circle.\n\nIn commuting the prison sentence of Roger Stone, Trump’s one-time political svengali, the then-President blasted “overzealous prosecutors” who used “witch hunts” and the “Russia hoax” to initially convict Stone of seven felony crimes. When he pardoned his one-time campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Trump blasted what he believed to be “prosecutorial overreach.”\n\nBut even in spite of that past rhetorical largesse, this lawsuit will hit differently for Trump. This isn’t about his longtime CFO, Allen Weisselberg, pleading guilty to a 15-year-long tax fraud scheme. This is about his flesh and blood faced with the daunting prospect of having to defend themselves against a robust civil lawsuit that makes major claims – like that Trump valued his Mar-a-Lago estate as high as $739 million when it should have been closer to $75 million (among many other things).\n\nThat makes this threat to Trump different in kind than anything he’s ever faced before. In the past, there was always a fall guy who could be sacrificed as the one who made the mistakes – and maintain the notion that the family, the true inner circle, was unaware of what was really happening.\n\nThat is going to be very hard to do with this case. Because many of the people implicated here are family.\n\nAll of which makes this a moment uniquely situated to make Trump feel cornered. And when he is cornered, he gets angry. Often very angry.\n\nWitness his post on Truth Social in the wake of James’ announcement.\n\n“Another Witch Hunt by a racist Attorney General, Letitia James, who failed in her run for governor, getting almost zero support from the public,” wrote Trump. “She is a fraud who campaigned on a ‘get Trump’ platform.”\n\nExpect a lot more where that came from.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/31/business/trump-taxes-questions/index.html", "title": "Unanswered questions about Trump's tax returns | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nAfter years of legal battles, pontificating and theorizing, former President Donald Trump’s tax returns from 2015 to 2020 are now part of the public record. Many critics and political opponents have theorized that Trump fought the public disclosure of his tax returns because they potentially provided evidence of illegal or politically damaging behavior.\n\nIt’s not immediately clear that they do either.\n\nHowever, Trump’s tax returns raise numerous questions about the former president’s finances, his business activities, foreign ties and his charitable donations, among other issues.\n\nWhy did Trump work so hard to keep all of this secret?\n\nTrump broke with decades of tradition in becoming the first elected president since Nixon to refuse to disclose his tax returns to the public When Democratic lawmakers demanded them, Trump fought for years to keep them private, taking the battle to the Supreme Court – a legal fight he ultimately lost.\n\nHe frequently claimed during his 2016 presidential candidacy that he couldn’t release his taxes because they were being audited, a claim that was debunked last week when the House Ways and Means Committee disclosed that Trump’s 2015 and 2016 taxes weren’t audited until 2019.\n\nFor now, the thousands of pages of documents offer only more questions about what Trump’s finances, and may offer potential avenues for new investigations.\n\nWhat was Trump doing with a Chinese bank account?\n\nTrump reported having foreign bank accounts, including a bank account in China between 2015 and 2017, his tax returns show.\n\nThe tax returns do not show what the bank account was used for or how much money passed through it or to whom. The New York Times first reported about Trump’s Chinese account in 2020, and Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten told the Times that the account was used to pay taxes on the Trump International Hotels Management’s business push in the country.\n\nTrump did not report the Chinese bank account in personal financial disclosures when he was president, likely because it was listed under his businesses. Yet he may have still been required to report accounts to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).\n\nWhat’s the scope of Trump’s foreign business operations, and who are his partners?\n\nTrump’s companies and business interests span the globe. On his tax return, Trump listed business income, taxes, expenses or other notable financial items from or in Azerbaijan, Panama, Canada, India, Qatar, South Korea, the United Kingdom, China, the Dominican Republic, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, Grenada, US territory Puerto Rico, Georgia, Israel, Brazil, St. Maarten, Mexico, Indonesia, Ireland, Turkey and St. Vincent.\n\nBut the tax returns don’t explain what business ties he had in those countries and with whom he might have been working while he was president.\n\nUnlike previous presidents, Trump declined to divest his business interests while he was in office. Critics said his many foreign holdings compromised his ability to act independently as a politician.\n\nHis 2020 tax return showed zero charitable donations. Did Trump actually donate his presidential salary to charity, as he promised he would?\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump pledged he would donate the entirety of his $400,000 salary to charity each year. He frequently boasted about donating parts of his quarterly paycheck to various government agencies.\n\nIf he donated his 2020 salary, he didn’t claim it on his taxes. Among the six years of tax returns the House Ways and Means Committee released, 2020 was the sole year in which Trump listed no donations to charity.\n\nThat doesn’t mean his salary wasn’t donated, but it’s unclear if he made good on his promise in 2020.\n\nWhy was Trump loaning money to his adult children? And did Trump claim gifts to his children as loans?\n\nIn each year of Trump’s presidency, Trump claimed that he had loaned three of his adult children – Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric – undisclosed sums of money on which he collected interest.\n\nThe tax returns don’t say how much he lent them or why he gave them loans in the first place.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, Trump claimed he received exactly $18,000 in interest on a loan he gave his daughter Ivanka Trump and $8,715 in interest from his son Donald Trump, Jr.. In 2017 to 2019, Trump said he received exactly $24,000 from his son Eric Trump, and Eric paid him $19,605 in interest in 2020.\n\nThe bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said the loans and the amounts of claimed interest could indicate Trump was disguising gifts to his children. If the interest Trump claims to have charged his children was not at market rate, for example, it could be considered a gift for tax purposes, requiring him to pay a higher tax rate on the money.\n\nHow did Trump’s business operations and income change when he was president?\n\nTrump entered the US presidency with a vast web of business holdings, including hundreds of limited liability companies, corporations and partnerships with operations both domestically and overseas.\n\nThe massiveness and intricacy of his business operations – including companies nested within each other like Matryoshka dolls – brought a level of complexity not seen before in the US presidency and spurred concern about potential conflicts of interest, especially with foreign entities.\n\nFriday’s public release of Trump’s 2015 to 2020 personal and business tax filings may shed some additional light as to how those operations evolved during and shortly after his time in office. But they don’t spell out where money was going and to whom.\n\nWhy didn’t the IRS do its job?\n\nSince 1977, the Internal Revenue Service has had a policy of auditing every president’s personal tax returns while they are in office. But the IRS didn’t do any examination of Trump’s tax returns until the Ways and Means Committee requested an audit in April of 2019.\n\nWhen the committee asked Treasury Department representatives about the apparent lapse, they declined to provide information about the actual operations of the mandatory audit program, according to the committee’s report.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Trump received special treatment or, as the committee noted, the IRS was hamstrung by an acute lack of resources.\n\nThe lack of an audit looks especially suspect after representatives for Trump’s predecessor and successor said they had been subjected to annual audits by the IRS. A Biden White House spokesman told the AP that the IRS audited Biden in both 2020 and 2021. Representatives for former President Barack Obama told the New York Times that the IRS audited him each year he was in office.", "authors": ["David Goldman Allison Morrow Alicia Wallace", "David Goldman", "Allison Morrow", "Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/politics/trump-lawsuits-investigations-what-matters/index.html", "title": "How to keep track of Trump's legal issues | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

CNN reported earlier this week that former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann, who was featured in the House January 6 committee hearings, is just the latest White House official under Trump to be subpoenaed by a federal grand jury.\n\nJust hoping to stay out of jail\n\nTrump is plotting a path to reelection in 2024 while Giuliani is hoping to stay out of prison, according to a former spokesman for the latter.\n\nGiuliani’s exposure to legal trouble as a henchman of Trump’s election conspiracy theories and efforts to overturn the 2020 results weighs on the former New York mayor and US attorney, who knows a thing or two about prosecutions, according to Ken Frydman, Giuliani’s former press secretary.\n\n“He knows he lied for his client, and he knows we all know,” Frydman said on CNN’s “New Day” on Tuesday, suggesting Giuliani’s tactic will be to delay legal proceedings as much as possible. “I think, you know, at this point in his life, his goal is to die a free man.”\n\nGiuliani is among a number of Trump supporters – including Sen. Lindsey Graham and most of the slate of fake electors – who have been ordered to appear. Both Graham and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp have asked judges to reconsider.\n\nWe continue to learn more about how Trump’s allies pursued their effort to overturn the election. The Washington Post reported this week that lawyers working on behalf of Trump attempted to access Dominion voting machine data in several states Trump lost, including Michigan, Georgia and Nevada. State authorities have opened investigations into the propriety of the breaches in Michigan and Georgia.\n\nDefamation for 2020 conspiracy theories – Dominion is in the midst of Dominion is in the midst of suing Giuliani and another Trump-connected attorney, Sidney Powell, for defamation after they and other Trump allies claimed, without evidence, the Dominion election systems were somehow involved in rigging the election.\n\nThese are not like political prosecutions\n\nWhen he refused to answer questions from the New York attorney general, Trump labeled the investigation a “Witch Hunt,” as he does with all these separate investigations.\n\n“When your family, your company, and all the people in your orbit have become the targets of an unfounded, politically motivated Witch Hunt supported by lawyers, prosecutors, and the Fake News Media, you have no choice,” he said in a statement.\n\nHe has also portrayed these varied investigations as the kind of persecution you might find in an autocracy or dictatorship. Russia’s opposition leaders are routinely locked up, for instance.\n\nThat’s a flawed and dangerous comparison, however, since Trump and his legal problems are the anomaly among all previous presidents, and he has not yet been charged with any crimes. If anything, the US judicial system seems biased against putting him on trial, at least not without mountains of evidence.\n\nCNN’s Dan Berman has a running list of all the major Trump-related legal issues, including a defamation case against the former President. See the list.\n\nTrump’s power in the GOP is still strong\n\nWith Rep. Liz Cheney’s loss in the Wyoming GOP primary Tuesday night, that’s it for the “Impeachment 10,” as this CNN interactive calls the House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021.\n\nFinal score:\n\nFour are retiring.\n\nFour lost a primary.\n\nTwo will be on the ballot in November, after advancing in primaries in Washington and California.\n\nMeanwhile, another key Trump opponent, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted to convict him in his impeachment trial, advanced in her state’s top-four primary, along with a Trump-backed challenger.\n\nCheney said she will continue her work on the January 6 committee, hoping to uncover the full truth about efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nAnd if Trump runs in 2024, she has not ruled out a run of her own to give Republicans a non-Trump option.\n\nTrump’s warped 2020 election mindset has been channeled by a majority of the Republican nominees for governor, according to CNN’s Daniel Dale.\n\nHe writes: The Republican nominee in at least 21 of this year’s 36 gubernatorial races is someone who has rejected, declined to affirm, raised doubts about, or tried to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election. And the list will almost certainly get longer when the last batch of Republican primaries is completed over the coming weeks.\n\nWho beat Cheney?\n\nCNN’s Jeff Zeleny was in Wyoming covering the Cheney race and filed a profile of Harriet Hageman, the former Cheney friend and Trump opponent who later embraced Trump as she campaigned against Cheney.\n\nWhile Hageman played up her opposition to the January 6 committee at rallies, Zeleny found Republican voters who were most interested in moving on from 2020 and said they wanted a representative focused most on Wyoming. Read his report.\n\nWhile it does not appear that the 2020 results are what’s motivating most Republican voters – that would be the economy – it does appear there will be a fair amount of election denialism on the ballot for the midterm elections in November.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Liz Cheney said 30 individuals asserted their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in testimony before the Jan. 6 committee, and several did so related to questions about their “dealings with Donald Trump directly.”\n\nFormer White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said he was “stunned by the violence” as well as Trump’s “indifference” to it. “I thought he failed at a critical time to be the sort of leader that the nation needed.”\n\nThe committee showed footage of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer asking acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to get Trump to call off the rioters, as well as videos of Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence conferring on the state of the Capitol.\n\nWhite House security officials were “in a state of shock” about the idea of Trump walking from the rally to the Capitol, one official testified, because it meant the event was no longer a rally, but “this would move from a normal, democratic, public event into something else.”\n\nBy 9 a.m. Jan. 6, the Secret Service noted some of the crowd was gathered outside a security perimeter at the rally and speculated “they have stuff that can’t come through? Would prob be an issue with this crowd.”\n\nRepublican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel said Trump called her, along with John Eastman, who explained to McDaniel the need for the RNC to help Trump’s campaign gather “contingent electors” in case the results of any elections changed. That was part of fake electors scheme, Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., explained.\n\nTrump’s “false victory speech” was planned well in advance of Election Day, regardless of results, committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren said.\n\nTrump confidant Roger Stone told Danish filmmakers on Nov. 1, 2020, that then-president needed to declare victory no matter the results. “Possession is nine-tenths of the law,” he said.\n\nJan. 6 committees votes to subpoena Donald Trump\n\nThe House Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol took the extraordinary step of subpoenaing Donald Trump, voting unanimously 9-0 to call the former president to appear before Congress to testify.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, vice chairwoman of the committee, said the committee has enough evidence to “make criminal referrals for multiple individuals” to the Justice Department and recommend policy changes to Congress but a “key task” remains.\n\n\"We must seek the testimony, under oath, of Jan. 6's central player,\" said Cheney, vice chair of the committee. “We are obligated to seek answers directly from the man who set this all in motion.”\n\nIt’s very likely Trump will ignore the committee’s subpoena, similar to Steve Bannon, Mark Meadows and other Trump aides who have refused to testify.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nRaskin: Trump excused and glorified Jan. 6 attack\n\nCommittee member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., blamed an unrepetant Trump for the attack on the Capitol building.\n\n“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously and viciously stripped away from great Patriots,” Raskin said, reading a tweet from Trump.\n\n“Trump was telling us that the Vice President, the Congress and all the injured and wounded cops, some of whom are with us today, got what was coming to us,” said Raskin. “According to Trump, January 6 should not be a day that lives in shame and infamy in our history, but rather in glory.”\n\n“Trump did nothing to stop the deadly violence for obvious reasons,” Raskin continued. “He thought it was all justified. He incited it and he supported it.”\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nChao: It was impossible for me to continue given my personal values\n\nThe Jan, 6 committee is playing up criticism of Trump from fellow Republicans, a presentation that included new testimony from Elaine Chao, who resigned from the Cabinet right after the insurrection.\n\n“I think the events at the Capitol were shocking and it was something that as I mentioned that I cannot put aside,\" Chao said on videotape.\n\nChao, who is married to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, told the committee \"it was impossible for me to continue given my personal values. I came as an immigrant. I believe in the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nTrump has often criticized Chao, and made a racist crack about her just this month.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump tweet about Pence ignited security concerns, calls for execution\n\nWithin a minute of former President Donald Trump sending out a tweet calling Vice President Mike Pence weak for not overturning the results of the electoral college, a Secret Service agent became concerned about the vice president’s safety.\n\n“POTUS just tweeted about Pence, probably not going to be good for Pence,” the agent wrote in a message shared by the Jan. 6 committee. Five hours later, another Secret Service message read, ““Potus said he he lacked courage. Over 24k likes in under 2mins.”\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said the tweet ignited “violent hashtags” such as “execute Mike Pence.” Anika Collier Navaroli, a Twitter employee who testified in front of the committee, said, Twitter users were “literally calling for his execution.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nNew video shows Pelosi on phone with Pence discussing resuming election certification\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee showed never before seen video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling Vice President Mike Pence during the attack on the Capitol to determine whether lawmakers would be able to return to the building to resume certification of the Electoral College votes.\n\n“We’re trying to figure out how we can get this job done today,” Pelosi said on a call to Pence.\n\nPence later told Pelosi that law enforcement officials believed the House and Senate would be able to reconvene that evening.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\n‘They’re your people,’ McCarthy told Trump during attack\n\nRepublican House Leader Kevin McCarthy was among those urging former President Donald Trump to call back his supporters who were attacking the Capitol, according to testimony to the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nIn a phone call as the attack was happening, according to a witness, Trump told McCarthy that the rioters were members of the group Antifa.\n\nMcCarthy responded: “No, they’re your people.”\n\nTrump fired back to McCarthy, “I guess they’re just more upset about the election than you are.”\n\nThe committee showed video of McCarthy’s congressional staff in hiding as the attack unfolded.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nPelosi: 'Clean up the poo poo'\n\nThe Jan. 6 hearing featured same-day video of congressional leaders reacting to the attack on the U.S. Capitol, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi lamenting the rioters' damage to the U.S. Capitol – including defecation.\n\nIt will take time to \"clean up the poo poo that they’re making ... literally and figuratively in the Capitol,\" Pelosi said at one point.\n\nPelosi is shown speaking on the phone with local leaders about the security situation, saying at one point: \"Do you believe this?\"\n\nChuck Schumer, the Senate's top Democrat, is seen at one point telling the acting attorney general Jeff Rosen to tell President Donald Trump to call off the protesters at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPelosi, Schumer plead for National Guard reinforcements\n\nThe committee played never-before-seen video of congressional leaders calling for military reinforcements to the Capitol Police and how to resume counting Electoral College votes after evacuating the House and Senate chambers under siege from the rampaging mob.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was walking in a hallway at 2:23 p.m. – soon after the mob breached the building – and talking on the phone. “We have got to finish the proceedings or else they will have a complete victory,” she said.\n\nShe and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are shown at 2:57 p.m. urging military leaders to send National Guard troops from Maryland and Virginia. Pelosi urged military officials to treat the situation as if the White House or Pentagon were under siege.\n\n“We need them there now,” Schumer said at 3:46 p.m.\n\nTroops didn’t arrive until after 5 p.m.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchumer and Pelosi called multiple officials to send help to Capitol\n\nIn new footage revealed by the Jan. 6 committee, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer made calls to various officials to send help to the Capitol as rioters entered the building.\n\n“I’m gonna call up the effin Secretary of DOD,” said Schumer, before calling acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller and tellnig him: “We have some senators who are still in their hideaways. We need massive personnel now, can you get the Maryland National Guard too?”\n\nPelosi contacted Mayor of Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan and Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam.\n\n“They’re breaking windows and going in, obviously ransacking our offices and all the rest of that,” said Pelosi in a call to Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. “That’s nothing. The concern we have about personal safety just transcends everything but the fact is that they’re breaking the law in many different ways.”\n\n“Quite frankly, much of it at the instigation of the President of the United States,” said Pelosi.\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nTrump watched Fox News after learning about violence, Raskin says\n\nTrump watched Fox News in a dining room attached to the Oval Office for 2 hours and 40 minutes after he was told that there was violence ongoing at the U.C. Capitol, said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.\n\nTrump returned to the White House at 1:20 p.m. that day, Raskin said, and “was told right then about the onset of violence at the Capitol.” He went to the dining room and stayed until about 4 p.m. as he watched the event unfold.\n\n“President Trump refused entreaties from his closest advisors and family members to tell his supporters to stand down and leave the Capitol,” Raskin said, referencing testimony from White House staff, including Pat Cippollone, Cassidy Hutchinson, and “an employee with national security employee duties,” among others.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nSecret Service was ‘concerned’ Trump would go to Capitol even after returning to White House\n\nEven after Trump returned to the White House after his speech on the morning of Jan. 6, the former president wanted to lead his supporters into the Capitol, according to Secret Service agents and White House officials.\n\n“Front office concerned about OTR to (the Capitol)” one Secret Service agent wrote in an email to Bobby Engel, the head of the president’s security detail. OTR is short for “off the record.”\n\nFormer Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany testified to the Jan. 6 committee that Trump wanted to physically walk to the Capitol or ride “the beast,” the nickname for presidential limousine, if he needed.\n\n“The people sworn to protect the safety of the president of the United States and who routinely put themselves in harm's way were compared this was a bad idea,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., one of the committee members.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nJan. 6 panel to recall witnesses, conduct further depositions based on Secret Service material\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee will be reviewing testimony regarding potential obstruction, including testimony about advice given not to tell the committee about the events surrounding Jan. 6, Rep. Pete Aguilar said during the hearing.\n\nThe committee plans to obtain further information from witnesses who provided testimony and conduct further investigative depositions after obtaining “voluminous” material from the Secret Service.\n\nAguilar said the committee will provide greater details in their final report.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nTrump’s physical altercation with Secret Service was ‘water cooler talk’ in White House\n\nTrump’s physical altercation with the Secret Service on Jan. 6 later became “water cooler talk” among White House employees according to committee member Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.\n\nAn anonymous former White House employee told the committee that “they remember hearing in the days after Jan. 6, how angry the President was when he was in a limo that afternoon.”\n\nSecret Service Agent Robert Engel and former White House aide Anthony Ornato “expressed to me that the President was irate, you know, on the drive up,” the employee told the committee.\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nAgencies obtained tips of attack prior to Jan. 6\n\nIntelligence about the Jan. 6 attack was available to Secret Service and others in the White House more than 10 days before the march to the Capitol, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee found evidence that Trump was aware of the risk of violence along with the FBI, U.S. Capitol Police, Metropolitan police and other agencies through intelligence prior to the attack.\n\nTrump’s senior advisors at the Department of Justice and FBI received an intelligence summary days before Jan. 6 indicating certain people traveling to Washington were making plans to attack the Capitol.\n\nThe intelligence cited online calls to occupy federal buildings, rhetoric about invading the Capitol and plans to engage in political violence, Schiff said.\n\nOn a call with Trump’s White House national security staff in early January of 2021, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense David Norquist warned about an attack on the Capitol.\n\n“Norquist says during one of these calls the greatest threat is a direct assault on the Capitol, I’ll never forget it,” Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an audio recording played during the hearing.\n\nIn a report from the Secret Service field office, a tip that had been received by the FBI included information from a source that said the Proud Boys planned to march armed into Washington and outnumber police.\n\n“Their plan is to literally kill people. Please, please take this tip seriously and investigate further,” the source said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nSecret Service knew the crowd had weapons 'as early as the night before'\n\nThe Secret Service knew before the attack on the Capitol that the crowd forming for Trump’s rally had guns, as early as the night before the attack, according to evidence presented by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nA Secret Service briefing said that in demonstrations on the night of Jan. 5, 2021, there were “multiple weapon offenses to include Carrying a handgun w/out a license, possessing a high capacity feeding device, and unregistered ammunition.” The following day, the Secret Service and other federal agencies would find a similar situation.\n\nSchiff said the Federal Protective Service, a law enforcement agency that protects federal buildings, found a man with a handgun in his waistband. The U.S. Parks Police arrested a man with a rifle in front of the World War Two memorial that day, he said.\n\nSecret Service agents Jan. 6, 2021 texted with each other about all the weapons, with one saying, “With so many weapons found so far, you wonder how many are unknown. Could be sporty after dark.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\n‘Calm before the storm,’ Secret Service member texted Jan. 6 morning\n\nSecret Service members exchanged texts on the morning of Jan. 6, 2021 warning each other of weapons spotted among supporters of President Donald Trump and the threat of violence at the Capitol.\n\n“Calm before the storm,” one Secret Service agent texted another early that morning, according to evidence reviewed by the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nAnother wrote in a Secret Service chat, “Pulling up live-streams and watching the crazies.”\n\nBy 9:30 a.m. on Jan. 6, Secret Service agents reported more than 25,000 people outside the Ellipse, where Trump later gave a speech that encouraged his loyalists to march to the Capitol.\n\nAgents observed some Trump supporters with guns and others wearing body army, ballistic helmets, pepper spray, and holding riot shields.\n\n“The documents we obtained from the Secret Service make clear that the crowd outside the magnetometers was armed and the agents knew it,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., one of the committee members.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nGOP chairwoman was pressured on fake electors\n\nOne of the blockbuster witnesses the committee presented on Thursday was Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who testified via videotape how Trump, along with his attorney John Eastman, tried to recruit her to join the plan to overturn the 2020 results.\n\nThe plan, based on a debunked legal theory, relied on key states finding Trump-supporting electors who would go to Washington to swing the Electoral College.\n\nMcDaniel told the committee how Trump called her and turned the phone over to Eastman, who explained it was important for the national GOP to get behind the plan and help “gather these contingent electors.”\n\nThe plan also required former Vice President Mike Pence to toss out the real electors, which he refused to do and later called the idea “un-American.”\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nAfter Georgia call, Meadows said Trump ‘knew’ he lost 2020 election\n\nAfter Trump’s phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger where Trump pressured him to just “find 11,780 votes,” former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Trump “knew” he already lost the 2020 election.\n\n“He can’t possibly think we’re gonna pull this off. That call was crazy,” former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson told Mark Meadows after the call ended.\n\n“He (Meadows) started shaking his head and he’s like ‘No Cass, he knows this is over,'” Hutchinson recounted. “He knows he lost.”\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nHutchinson video:Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson says Trump didn't want people to know he lost\n\nCommittee: Trump knew he lost, but still lied to overturn the election\n\nIf there's one point the committee wants to drive home, it is this: Trump knew he had lost the 2020 election, yet still made improper - and possibly illegal - efforts to overturn that loss to President Joe Biden.\n\nThe hearing has included videos from a variety of former aides, from Attorney General William Barr to lower-level lawyers, explaining why Trump's claims of voter fraud were mistakes or simply lies.\n\nWho's on :Meet the members of the January 6 House select committee ahead of first public hearing Thursday\n\n“Donald Trump maliciously repeated this nonsense to a wide audience over and over again,\" said Rep. Elaine Luria. D-Va. \"His intent was to deceive.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nScalia told Trump to concede to Biden\n\nEugene Scalia, the Trump administration’s Labor secretary, told the committee he spoke with Trump on Dec. 14, 2020 – the day Electoral College votes for president were certified, and told him the time had come to concede.\n\n“I conveyed to him that I thought it was time for him to acknowledge that President Biden had prevailed in the election,” said Scalia, the son of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nScalia said the campaign was over if legal challenges were exhausted and fraud not established.\n\n“Unfortunately I believed what had to be done was concede the outcome,” Scalia said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump rushes to complete unfinished business, signs memo for large-scale troop withdrawal\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger said once Trump knew he had lost the election, he rushed to complete unfinished business.\n\nHe cited how Trump acted immediately and signed an order on Nov. 11 requiring immediate withdrawal of troops from Somalia and Afghanistan to be completed before the Biden inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\n“I personally thought it was militarily not feasible, nor wise,” said Gen, Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nGen. Keith Kellogg, the national security adviser for the president, said in video testimony he thought the memo “was a tremendous disservice to the nation.”\n\n“An immediate departure that that memo said would have been catastrophic,” Kellogg said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nAide: Angry Trump told Meadows 'I don’t want people to know that we lost.'\n\nAfter the Supreme Court stopped his lawsuit related to the 2020 election from going forward, Trump became angry and tried to stop people from finding out that they lost the election, according to evidence presented by the Jan. 6 committee.\n\n“Just FYI potus is pissed – breaking news – supreme court denied his law suit,” an email from a Secret Service agent on Dec. 11, 2020 said. “He is livid now”\n\nPOTUS is an acronym for President of the United States.\n\nFormer White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson said she and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows crossed paths with a “raging” and “fired up” Trump that day as he walked out of the oval office, who then told Meadows something to the effect of, “I don’t want people to know we lost, Mark. This is embarrassing. We need to figure it out. I don’t want people to know that we lost.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nTrump campaign aides repeatedly told him voter fraud claims were baseless\n\nTrump’s campaign aides exhaustively reviewed each of the former president’s baseless claims of voter fraud but found nothing to invalidate the results of the 2020 election results, according to witnesses who spoke with the committee.\n\n“There’s no ‘there’ there,” Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows told the former president, according to testimony.\n\nTrump campaign manager Bill Stepien also relayed the reality to the former president. The Trump campaign team lost 65 lawsuits between the November election and Jan. 20 that sought to overturn election results.\n\n“It's an easier job be telling the president about, you know, wild allegations. It’s a harder job to be telling him on the back end that, yeah, that wasn't true,” Stepien said to the committee.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nAides said Trump admitted he lost 2020 election\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., one of two GOP members on the panel, outlined how after the election the former president’s campaign aides knew his chances of pulling out a victory were slim.\n\nThe committee showed a videotape testimony by former Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller, who said how they told Trump, “the odds of us prevailing… were very small.”\n\nKinzinger then played a clip of Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, saying how he lost and letting the “next guy” deal with foreign affairs.\n\nOther former White House aides also told the committee how Trump acknowledged losing but wanted to keep fighting.\n\nAlyssa Farah, a former White House communications director, said a week after the election was called, she “popped in the Oval (Office)” and that Trump said: “Can you believe I lost to this f-ing guy?”\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nThe committee showed clips of Roger Stone, a Republican political operative who is a confidant of Donald Trump, from a Danish documentary from director Christoffer Guldbrandsen\n\n“I really do suspect it’ll still be up in the air,” Stone said of his expectations for election night 2020. “When that happens, the key thing to do is to claim victory. Possession is nine-tenths of the law. No, we won. You’re wrong.”\n\nStone was previously convicted of lying to Congress and other crimes, and sentenced to three years in prison. Trump pardoned him Dec. 23, 2020. Stone refused to answer questions from the committee by invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nBut Stone met with Trump allies at the Willard Hotel near the White House on Jan. 5 and 6, according to Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. And he posted his advice to Trump on social media Dec. 27.\n\n“I also told the president exactly how he can appoint a special counsel with full subpoena power to ensure those who are attempting to steal the 2020 election through voter fraud are charged and convicted and ensure Donald Trump continues as our president,” Stone said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nStone had close associations with Oath Keepers and Proud Boys\n\nIn the days leading up to and the day of the Capitol attack, longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone maintained direct connections to the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, far-right extremist groups that were on the Capitol on Jan. 6, according to the panel.\n\nMembers of those groups have been charged with seditious conspiracy – conspiring against the U.S. government.\n\n“Multiple associates of Roger Stone from both the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have been charged with this crime,” said committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.\n\nLofgren pointed to Stone’s associates who are currently under trial or who have already plead guilty to charges of seditious conspiracy such as Joshua James, leader of the Alabama Oath Keepers who pled guilty earlier this year.\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nPence staff did not want to declare victory prior to official results\n\nStaff members to Vice President Mike Pence were concerned with what Trump might do on election night regarding the results of the election, Rep. Zoe Lofgren said. She added that the vice president's staff took steps to ensure Pence would not echo a false victory announcement from Trump.\n\nThe vice president’s staff indicated there was a possibility that there would be a declaration of victory, prior to election results being known, within the White House, she said.\n\nVice President Pence’s counsel Greg Jacob worked with Chief of Staff Mark Short to avoid Vice President Pence from being thrust into a position of having to comment on the election results without efficient information.\n\n“It is essential that the vice president not be perceived by public as having decided questions concerning disputed electoral votes prior to the full development of all relevant facts,” according to a memo sent on election day that the Jan. 6 committee obtained from the National Archives.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDraft statement ahead of election urged Trump to declare victory\n\nAn outside advisor to former President Donald Trump sent a draft statement to aides Molly Michael and Dan Scavino days before the 2020 election with language Trump could use to declare victory.\n\n“We had an election today – and I won,” the draft statement from Tom Fitton sent Oct. 31 said. “The ballots counted by the Election Day deadline show the American people have bestowed up on me the great honor of reelection to President of the United States.”\n\nThere is no deadline to count ballots only on Election Day, and “everyone knew that ballot counting would lawfully continue past Election Day, said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. “Claiming that the counting on election night must stop was, as we now know, a key part of President Trump’s premeditated plan.”\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nLofgren: Trump's declaration of victory was part of plan to steal the election\n\nThe committee is revisiting one of the famous events of Election Night 2020 – Trump's false declaration of victory.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., noted that Trump and aides planned their \"victory speech\" well in advance, trying to convince Americans that the election was over and further counting of mail-in ballots was an effort to rig the result.\n\nCalling the false declaration part of an effort to steal the election, Lofgren noted that allies like Steve Bannon, Roger Stone, and Brad Parscale helped prepare Trump's premature declaration of victory.\n\n“It was a premeditated plan by the president to declare victory no matter what the actual result was,\" she said. \"He made a plan to stay in office before Election Day.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump had ‘pre-meditated plan’ to reject election results, committee says\n\nTrump campaign advisors told the former president on election night that it was premature to declare victory but he did anyway as part of a “pre-meditated plan,” according to the committee.\n\n“It was far too early to many any calls like that,” Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien told the committee in videotaped testimony.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a committee member, said Trump planned to exploit a “red mirage” that would show him ahead of Joe Biden before mail-ballots were counted. Trump attacked mail-ballots throughout the campaign, giving Biden a massive advantage among voters who voted absentee.\n\nAnd yet Trump advisors advised the former president in the months before the election that mail-ballots could actually help him win.\n\n“Mail-in ballots can be a good thing,” Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner told the committee, describing what was told to Trump\n\nStepien gave a similar account to the committee but said “the president’s mind was made up.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nCheney: Trump wasn’t ‘dupe’\n\nIn a blistering opening statement, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who serves as the panel's vice chair, warned that if some sort of action isn’t taken against the former president “another Jan. 6 could happen again.”\n\n\"President Trump knew from unassailable sources that his election fraud claims were false. He admitted he had lost the election,\" she said.\n\nCheney, who lost her reelection bid in a GOP primary to a Trump-backed contender in August, has been a chief target of the former president’s ire. She reiterated during Thursday’s hearing how the former president was solely responsible for the attack.\n\n\"There is no defense that Donald Trump was duped or irrational,” she said. “No president can defy the rule of law and act this way in a constitutional republic—period.\"\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nCheney says “no guarantee” institutions will hold next time\n\nVice Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., warned of future presidencies that could emulate Trump’s efforts to overturn the election.\n\n“A key lesson of this investigation is this: our institutions only hold when men and women of good faith make them hold, regardless of the political cost,” said Cheney.\n\n“Any future president inclined to attempt what Donald Trump did in 2020 has now learned not to install people who could stand in the way,” Cheney warned.\n\n- Ken Tran\n\nCommittee to present evidence from Secret Service\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee will present “new materials produced to the committee by the Secret Service,” Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said Thursday.\n\nThe committee found out after subpoenaing Secret Service records earlier this year that the agency had deleted text messages that staff made on Jan. 5 and 6, leading the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general to launch a criminal investigation.\n\nMore:Criminal probe of Secret Service texts a 'big deal' as agency draws Jan. 6 committee scrutiny\n\nHowever, since the last hearing, the committee received about 800,000 pages of documents from the Secret Service, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in September.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nCheney: Trump ‘central cause’ of Jan. 6 Capitol attack\n\nThe committee will explore during the hearing former President Donald Trump’s state of mind, intent and motivations in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to the vice chairwoman, Rep. Liz Cheney.\n\nShe said Trump made his claims of a stolen election without evidence in hand and then spurred aides to spread lies about fraud.\n\n“The vast weight of the evidence so far has shown us that the central cause of Jan. 6 was one man, Donald Trump, who many others followed,” said Cheney, R-Wyo. “None of this would have happened without him. He was personally and substantially involved in all of it.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nThompson hints at 'further investigative action' by the committee\n\nCommittee chairman Bennie Thompson previewed coming attractions by noting that this hearing is a also a \"business meeting\" – meaning the committee could take votes today on future investigative steps.\n\n\"In addition to presenting evidence, we can potentially hold a committee vote on further investigative action based upon that evidence,\" Thompson said.\n\nPossible actions range from new subpoenas to criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTestimony came mostly from Republicans, chairman says\n\nThe evidence obtained by the Jan. 6 committee is not partisan and testimony came almost entirely from Republicans, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in his opening statement.\n\nThompson said testimony came from former President Donald Trump’s closest aides and advisors, the highest officials in the Department of Justice, Republican state officials, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and members of Trump’s own family, among others.\n\n“It’s tough for any congressional investigation to obtain evidence of what we’ve seen, least of all such a detailed view into a president’s inner circle,” Thompson said.\n\n- Erin Mansfield\n\nJan. 6 panel promises ‘never-before-seen footage’ before hearing begins\n\nThe House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol says it will show “never-before-seen footage” during Thursday’s public hearing and “more details about the ongoing threat to American democracy.”\n\nThat’s according to a tweet from the Jan. 6 committee posted shortly before the hearing is set to begin at 1 p.m. EDT.\n\nThursday will mark the 9th hearing of the committee, which has worked to highlight the central role former President Donald Trump played ahead of and during the attack.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nWhat is the future for Jan. 6 committee members?\n\nWeeks away from the midterms, seven Jan. 6 committee members are gearing up for key races in their home districts while three others will not be returning to Congress next term.\n\nCommittee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., was defeated in Wyoming’s GOP primary race this August against Trump-backed candidate Harriet Hageman.\n\nBoth Republican Illinois Rep.

The next Jan. 6 hearing could tell us\n\nWho are the members of the January 6 committee?\n\nThe committee is composed of nine members of the House — seven Democrats and two Republicans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., appointed each member.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi serves as the committee chair. He previously worked on legislation to create a bipartisan commission to investigate Jan. 6, but it died in the Senate. Thompson, who also serves as chair of the Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump after Jan. 6 and accused the president of inciting the attack and conspiring with extremist groups.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., serves as the vice chair and is one of two Republicans on the committee. Cheney condemned Trump for his role in the attack and voted to impeach him, resulting in her being ousted from GOP leadership for criticizing the former president and those who remain loyal to him.\n\nIllinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger serves as the other Republican on the committee. Kinzinger was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. He has condemned members of his own party and has been an outspoken member of the GOP.\n\nAlso on the committee are Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Adam Schiff of California, who both served as lead impeachment managers for Trump’s first and second impeachments.\n\nOther Democrat House members include Stephanie Murphy of Florida who co-chairs the Blue Dog Coalition; Pete Aguilar of California, the only Latino representative on the committee; Zoe Lofgren of California, who was involved in prosecuting one of Trump’s impeachment trials and retired Navy commander Elaine Luria of Virginia.\n\nWho else is the committee seeking to testify?\n\nThe committee sought testimony from Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, specifically over a phone call Trump made to Vos asking to overturn the results of the election.\n\nThe committee expressed interest in speaking again with two Secret Service officials who protected Trump – Anthony Ornato and Robert Engel – after former Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony.\n\nNeither have testified under oath. Cheney said the committee received 800,000 pages of communication from the Secret Service after committee members filed a subpoena in July for text messages reportedly deleted.\n\nThe committee also requested former House Speaker Newt Gingrich provide information related to Jan. 6.\n\nMore:Former Proud Boys leader pleads guilty to seditious conspiracy in Jan. 6 Capitol attack\n\nWho has testified since the last hearing?\n\nMembers of the committee interviewed additional witnesses since the last public hearing in July.\n\nThe committee heard from Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, on Sept. 29. She voluntarily agreed to appear before the committee and repeated claims the 2020 election was stolen during her testimony.\n\nThomas's lawyer said she voiced concerns over election fraud, condemned the violence on Jan. 6 and answered the committee's questions.\n\nThe committee also heard from Kelli Ward, the head of Arizona’s Republican Party, who declined to answer questions during her subpoenaed testimony, according to a government attorney. Ward was part of a group that cast fake electoral votes for Trump after he lost the state.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee sought a log of her phone calls and text messages.

But once the questioning began, with the state attorneys saying he could repeat the “same answer,” the atmosphere turned professional and cordial.\n\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social earlier Wednesday morning that he would be “seeing” James “for a continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. history! My great company, and myself, are being attacked from all sides. Banana Republic!”\n\nThe scheduled deposition comes during an extraordinary legal week for the former President. On Monday, the FBI executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, his primary residence in Florida, in connection with an investigation into the handling of classified documents. On Tuesday, a federal appeals court denied his long-running effort to block a House committee from obtaining his tax returns.\n\nSome Trump advisers had advocated that the former President answer questions since he previously testified about his financial statements under oath, while others warned him against providing any answers because of the potential legal jeopardy he may face, people familiar with the matter tell CNN. The Manhattan district attorney has a separate ongoing criminal investigation into the Trump Organization.\n\nAnother consideration that had been discussed, the people familiar say, is the political implications of not answering questions as Trump is widely expected to announce that he will run for president in 2024. While campaigning in 2016, Trump suggested not answering questions was a sign of guilt. At a campaign stop in Iowa in 2016, Trump said, “If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?”\n\nIn his statement Wednesday, Trump said, “Now I know the answer to that question” and decried James’ investigation. The former President and the Trump Organization have previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'They even broke into my safe': Trump responds to search of his Mar-a-Lago home 02:06 - Source: CNN\n\n“When your family, your company, and all the people in your orbit have become the targets of an unfounded, politically motivated Witch Hunt supported by lawyers, prosecutors, and the Fake News Media, you have no choice,” the former President stated.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment guarantees that an individual cannot be compelled by the government to provide information that might be incriminating against themselves. When an individual declines to answer a question by “taking the Fifth,” he or she invokes that right. It is not an admission of guilt.\n\n“No person shall … be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,” the Fifth Amendment states.\n\nIn a statement, the attorney general’s office confirmed that Trump took the Fifth and said it will continue to investigate.\n\n“While we will not comment on specific details, we can confirm that today, our office conducted a deposition of former president Donald Trump,” the office said. “Attorney General Letitia James took part in the deposition during which Mr. Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Attorney General James will pursue the facts and the law wherever they may lead. Our investigation continues.”\n\nThe mood was tense at the outset of the deposition, but later turned cordial and professional, Trump attorney Ronald Fischetti told CNN. Fischetti was present along with co-counsel Alina Habba, a New Jersey-based attorney who has taken over many of Trump’s ongoing lawsuits.\n\nJames, a Democrat, attended the first half of the deposition and made a standard statement about the sworn testimony.\n\nAt the outset, Fischetti explained that Trump wanted to testify “very badly,” but that the former President had accepted his advice not to answer questions.\n\nUnder oath, Trump confirmed that he wanted to testify but he would not answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Much of his statement used similar language to the public statement he released earlier Wednesday, referencing a “witch hunt” and the FBI search of his home at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAssistant New York Attorney General Kevin Wallace squared off against Trump, flanked by 10 assistant attorneys general who handed him notes during the interview. The questions focused on valuations placed on various Trump properties that were included in the financial statements, according to Fischetti.\n\nWhen questioned during the roughly four-hour deposition – not counting breaks – Trump repeatedly said “same answer” when declining to respond by pleading the Fifth.\n\nJames left at the lunch break and Trump shook her hand as she was leaving. At the end of the day, when Trump left, he shook the hands of all of the state attorneys, Fischetti said.\n\nInvestigation and previous depositions\n\nIn January, James’ office said it found “significant” evidence indicating the Trump Organization used false or misleading asset valuations in its financial statements to obtain loans, insurance and tax benefits. The attorney general’s civil investigation is nearing the end and a decision over an enforcement action may come soon.\n\nThe showdown follows Trump’s failed attempt to block subpoenas for depositions from him and his children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump.\n\nIvanka Trump’s deposition took place last week and Trump Jr. had his deposition in late July, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nTrump Jr., who runs the Trump Organization with his brother Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump did not assert their Fifth Amendment rights and answered the state’s questions, the people said. It is not clear what they were specifically asked or what they said.\n\nTheir decision breaks with Eric Trump and former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, who both asserted their Fifth Amendment rights more than 500 times when deposed in 2020.\n\nTrump has testified under oath in civil lawsuits over the past decades and since leaving office he has also been deposed. Last year he provided videotaped testimony for a lawsuit involving an assault outside of Trump Tower. The case is set to go to trial in the fall. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nQuestions about Trump’s net worth\n\nTrump has been questioned about the accuracy of his net worth and financial statements in previous lawsuits, something some advisers say is one reason why he should answer questions in the current investigation.\n\nIn a 2007 deposition in a defamation lawsuit, Trump once said he calculated his net worth, to a degree, on his “feelings,” and that he put the “best spin” on some of the assets. “I think everybody” exaggerates about the value of their properties, he testified, adding: “Who wouldn’t?”\n\nDid he inflate values? “Not beyond reason,” Trump said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Michael Cohen on how Trump would inflate property values 04:12 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the past Trump has tried to push responsibility for his valuation decisions onto Weisselberg, while at the same time, documents and depositions appear to show that, even as Trump claimed that he left those valuation decisions to others, he was also deeply involved in running his business.\n\nTrump said in the 2007 deposition that the only person he dealt with in preparing the statements of financial condition was Weisselberg.\n\n“I would give my opinion,” Trump said in the deposition. “We’ll talk about it,” he said, adding that “ultimately” and “predominately” it was Weisselberg who came up with the final values, which Trump said he viewed as “conservative.”\n\nWhen questioned specifically about swings in values from one year to the next Trump had ready explanations.\n\nDuring the deposition, Trump was questioned over the family compound in Westchester County, New York, called Seven Springs where its value nearly doubled in one year from $80 million in 2005 to $150 million in 2006.\n\n“The property was valued very low, in my opinion, then and it became very – it just has gone up,” Trump said.\n\nHe was asked if he had any basis for that view, other than his own opinion.\n\n“I don’t believe so, no,” he said.\n\nIn addition to Weisselberg, two others involved in the preparation of the financial statements, Jeff McConney, the Trump Organization’s controller, and Donald Bender, the real estate firm’s external accountant, have both been interviewed by the attorney general’s office and Manhattan district attorney.\n\nTrump’s lawyers are likely to argue that the financial statements were not audited so anyone relying on them would be on notice. The financial statements reviewed by CNN show they have numerous disclosures indicating that they did not conform with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, none of the lenders lost money on the transactions, which could make it harder to allege that they were defrauded or misled.\n\nThe appraisals underlying the property values were in many cases provided by Trump’s longtime appraiser Cushman & Wakefield, which is also under investigation. Cushman, which broke ties with Trump after the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, has denied any wrongdoing and stands by its work.\n\nLegal risks to Trump\n\nThe depositions pose significant legal risks to the Trumps.\n\nIf Trump is sued by James and the case goes to trial, the jury can draw an “adverse inference” against him for not answering questions, which could result in a higher judgment against him if he’s found liable. If he answers questions, it could open the door to potential civil and criminal liability.\n\nThe criminal investigation, led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, has slowed but not stopped. Earlier this year, Bragg would not authorize prosecutors to present evidence before a state grand jury after raising concerns about the strength of the case, CNN has reported. A special grand jury hearing evidence in the case expired in April, but a new one could be seated in the future.\n\nBragg told CNN in an interview in April: “Anytime you have a parallel civil, criminal investigation, if there’s testimony in that proceeding, obviously we will look at it.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/13/donald-trump-letitia-james-lawsuit-new-york/11656580002/", "title": "Donald Trump gives deposition in civil fraud suit brought by New ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Donald Trump appeared for a deposition Thursday in a New York civil lawsuit alleging fraud in past business practices, the latest legal imbroglio for the recently indicted ex-president.\n\n\"This civil case is ridiculous, just like all of the other Election Interference cases being brought against me,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James sued Trump and his family-run business for fraud, alleging that they overvalued property holdings in order to obtain favorable bank loans.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks $250 million in damages and other sanctions that could shutter the former president's namesake business, the Trump Organization.\n\nTrump's civil case:Trump, family members sued by New York AG Letitia James, accused of massive fraud\n\nTrump's indictment:Read the Trump indictment: Donald Trump charged with crimes in New York\n\nTrump's legal troubles continue\n\nThe deposition comes less than ten days after Trump pleaded not guilty to criminal charges of falsifying business records in order to hide hush money payments that amounted to illegal campaign contributions.

It also attempts to block Trump and the Trump Organization from purchasing commercial real estate in New York for five years.\n\nThe claim accuses Trump, with the aid of his children and senior executives at the Trump Organization, of falsely inflating his net worth by billions of dollars \"to induce banks to lend money to the Trump Organization on more favorable terms than would otherwise have been available to the company.\"\n\nThe attorney general's legal action is based largely on annual assessments of Trump's net worth, known as Statements of Financial Condition, compiled by Trump Organization executives and issued by the former president's accounting firm.\n\nThose statements, according state officials, included inflated valuations of properties, ranging from Trump's Manhattan residence at Trump Tower, his golf courses and his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/24/us/new-york-adult-survivors-act/index.html", "title": "New York Adult Survivors Act: Lawsuits expected as window for ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nAdult survivors of sexual abuse now can sue their abusers in New York – even if the statute of limitations on their claims has expired – under a state law that goes into effect Thursday.\n\nThe new law gives adult survivors of sexual assault one year to file lawsuits against their perpetrators. It also allows people who were sexually assaulted at work or in the care of an institution like a hospital or jail to sue that entity, said attorney Doug Wigdor, who helped push for the law.\n\n“I think there will be some very interesting cases that come about in the employment cases where powerful men, who were supervising women or overseeing women, sexually assaulted them and they will be able to hold their perpetrator accountable but also their employers,” said Wigdor, who represented women who testified against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, whose convictions in New York for rape and criminal sex act convictions were upheld this year.\n\nOne suit filed early Thursday under the new law aims to hold former President Donald Trump accountable for allegedly raping then-magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s. Trump has denied the claims.\n\nThe new window to sue in New York gives adult sexual assault survivors who may not have been able to process what happened to them more time to seek recourse, said Jane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor and now head of the Women’s Equal Justice Project in the state.\n\nThe measure mirrors the 2019 Child Victims Act that for two years temporarily expanded New York’s statute of limitations in child sex abuse cases, yielding nearly 11,000 suits, New York State Office of Court Administration spokesperson Lucian Chalfen said.\n\n“Sexual assault is a highly traumatizing crime. Trauma by itself takes time to process,” Manning said. “Add to that the fact that our culture has loaded many of us up with rape myths about what a real rape looks like that don’t match real sexual assaults that happen in real life.\n\n“Because of that, there are survivors who don’t even identify what happened to them as sexual assault until some time has gone by. And there may be a lot of self-blame to grapple with, even though that self-blame is completely unwarranted,” she said.\n\nIt is important to give adult sex assault survivors an opportunity to seek recourse through the civil justice system, as they are often failed by the criminal justice system, Manning said.\n\n“All too often in the criminal justice system, we still have too many prosecutors who decline to take sex crime cases to trial simply because they think they will be difficult to win,” she said. “That is not a good reason to refuse to take a sex crime case to trial. But it’s a reason that survivors are still hearing from too many prosecutors.”\n\nSuits expected over alleged abuse in prisons\n\nSeparate suits under the new law are expected to be filed on behalf of more than 750 women who allege they were sexually assaulted in New York State prisons, attorney Adam Slater said.\n\n“The detainee-guard relationship is one of the most extreme power imbalances that exists today,” Slater said. “Under New York State law, a person in correctional custody is legally incapable of consent. Officers and guards in these facilities have an unmatched arsenal of methods for exerting their will upon victims: physical confinement, force, withholding of privileges and total control over their environments.”\n\nNew York’s Department of Corrections and Community Supervision has “zero tolerance for sexual abuse, sexual harassment, and unauthorized relationships,” the agency said in a statement, noting it “thoroughly investigates all reports of sexual victimization, including unauthorized relationships, and retaliation against any individuals who report incidents or cooperate with those investigations.\n\n“Staff have an affirmative duty to report any knowledge, suspicion, or information regarding an incident of sexual abuse or sexual harassment, and any unauthorized relationship,” it said. “Individuals who violate Department rules are disciplined by the Department and when there is evidence that a crime was committed, DOCCS refers those cases for criminal prosecution to the fullest extent permitted by law.”\n\nWhen asked for comment, the New York attorney general’s office referred CNN to the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision.\n\nCarroll on Thursday sued Trump for battery and defamation under the new law. It’s the second suit she’s filed against him and the first to seek to hold Trump accountable for battery for allegedly raping Carroll 27 years ago in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room. The suit also alleges a new defamation claim based on statements Trump made last month.\n\n“Trump’s underlying sexual assault severely injured Carroll, causing significant pain and suffering, lasting psychological harms, loss of dignity, and invasion of her privacy. His recent defamatory statement has only added to the harm that Carroll had already suffered,” the suit alleges.\n\nCarroll is asking a judge to order Trump to retract his defamatory statements and award compensatory, punitive and exemplary damages in an amount to be determined at a jury trial.\n\nTrump has denied all allegations against him.\n\nMore lawsuits are expected on behalf of about 40 more women with new claims against a Columbia University gynecologist Dr. Robert Hadden, said attorney Anthony DiPietro, who represented 230 women allegedly sexually abused by Hadden. Nearly 150 of those cases were settled before the Adult Survivors Act went into effect.\n\nHadden is due to go on trial next year on six counts of enticing and inducing victims to his medical offices in New York and subjecting them to unlawful sexual abuse from about 1993 to 2012, prosecutors have said; Hadden has pleaded not guilty.", "authors": ["Sonia Moghe"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}]}

The social network recently launched a suite of tools to help people better manage time on Facebook and on its Instagram app.\n\nThe new tools include an activity dashboard that shows you how much time you spend on the apps each day and over the course of one week, a way to set a daily reminder not to exceed a certain amount of time and a new way to limit distracting notifications that you get throughout the day.\n\nThe problem Facebook is trying to address is widespread. We’re all pretty much addicted to our smartphone screens and often feel powerless to do anything about it. Of the more than 2.5 billion people who use at least one of Facebook’s apps, three-quarters of them check the social network every day, according to a recent report from Pew Research Center. And “screenagers” are on social apps even more often, with nearly half of 13- to 18-year-olds telling Pew in a separate report that they check in “almost constantly.”\n\nThose kinds of statistics, especially among teens, fuel concerns that extended screen time could be linked to ADHD, sleep deprivation and depression.\n\nYou'll have to wait\n\nJust one percent of Facebook and Instagram users will gain access to these new features right away; it rolls out slowly to the rest of us over the next few weeks. Facebook admitted that these tools are – at least in part – in response to the outcry over tech addiction among adults and teens.\n\n“Our hope is that these tools give people more control over the time they spend on our platforms and also foster conversations between parents and teens about the online habits that are right for them,” Ameet Ranadive, product management director at Instagram, said in a statement.\n\nMore:Just say no to addicting kids to technology, former Facebook, Google employees, investors urge\n\nMore:12 reasons to upgrade to iOS 12 for iPhone, iPad if you just can't wait\n\nMore:Apple still makes it too hard to get kids to put down their iPhone\n\nFacebook is the latest company to offer tools to prevent tech overload. In its upcoming iOS 12 release, Apple is adding a new tool called Screen Time that shows you exactly how much time you’re spending on your smartphone and what you’re doing while using it. The feature allows you to set time limits for specific apps and will tell you when you’ve reached your limit, a lot like what Facebook is launching now.\n\nTesting them with my teen\n\nI was able to beta test an early version with my 17-year old daughter, Jeneva. She’s a big Instagrammer (she says Facebook is only for grandparents now), so we were both cringing before we took a look at her statistics for the first time.\n\nTo access the tools on Instagram, go to your Settings, then tap “Your Activity,” From there, you’ll see a dashboard showing your average time for that app on that device. (For Facebook, start at your settings, and then go to “Your Time on Facebook.”)\n\n“I honestly thought that I spend a lot more time on Instagram than I do,” Jeneva said the first time we checked. “I’m pretty surprised, in a good way.”\n\nI was, too. According to Instagram’s new tool, Jeneva spent just under one hour per day on Instagram the first week we tried it and was already down to less than 45 minutes a day the second week. She says just being aware of the time helped her cut back right away.\n\n“I thought I spent two or three hours a day on (Instagram),” she told me, “mainly because those are the statistics you always hear about (teens) and because you and dad bug me about it so much.” Jeneva admits that she splits her online time pretty evenly between Instagram, Snapchat and Netflix.\n\nWe have set rules and boundaries in our house: No devices at dinner, a requirement to pay attention to each other and take time to talk and go outside.\n\nAccording to Jeneva, having a tech tool remind her when enough's enough is better than a nagging parent. And she thinks social media sites need more management tools such as these. Self-policing, and just making people aware of how much time they’re spending lost down the social media rabbit hole, seems to be a good first step.\n\nHow much screen time is too much?\n\nAlong with the check-when-you-want activity stats, Facebook added a couple of other features that will help all of its us manage our time a bit more wisely, too. Both Facebook and Instagram now let you set time limits that will alert you whenever you reach a certain threshold – one hour a day, for example. A notification will let you know when you’ve hit your limit, and even though you can mute or just totally ignore it, it’s a great tool for self-checking your own social network addiction.\n\nI asked my daughter, \"Could Facebook do anything better?\"\n\n“I would like it to be more upfront, like right when you open your app versus having to go to settings and activity,\" she says. “I really think it’s good to make you aware of how time you’re spending on social media, and I definitely think (tech companies) are responsible for helping us manage them and making sure it’s used in a healthy way.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2021/02/21/smartphone-notifications-driving-you-nuts-how-turn-them-off/4490897001/", "title": "Smartphone notifications driving you nuts?

Steadiness\n\nWith your iPhone in your pocket, the Health app uses custom algorithms to assess your balance, strength, and gait. You can set up a notification if your level of steadiness drops. That’s important because that could mean you’re more at risk of falling.\n\nHere’s how to set up Steadiness Notifications:\n\n• Open the Health app and tap your profile at the top right. If you don’t see your picture or initials, tap Summary or Browse at the bottom, then scroll back to the top.\n\n• Tap Health Checklist.\n\n• Tap Set Up for Walking Steadiness Notifications and follow the onscreen instructions.\n\nIs carrying your phone in your pocket (guys) or your bra (ladies) safe? Here’s my answer.\n\n2. Heart rate variability\n\nHeart rate variability, or HRV, measures time intervals between heartbeats when you’re at rest. Your Apple Watch checks for irregular rhythms, sends you a notification and records the data in the Health app.\n\nIrregular rhythms could indicate atrial fibrillation (Afib), where the heart’s upper chambers beat out of sync with the lower chambers. Seriously dangerous stuff.\n\nHere’s how to check up on your HRV data:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Browse in the bottom right corner.\n\n• Tap Heart > Heart Rate Variability.\n\n• At the top, choose to view your data by day, week, month, half-year, and year.\n\nHere’s how to enable irregular rhythm notifications:\n\n• Open the Health app.\n\n• Tap Browse in the bottom right corner.\n\n• Tap Heart > Irregular Rhythm Notifications.\n\n• Once enabled, turn irregular rhythm notifications on or off in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Apple Watch app, tap the My Watch tab, then go to Heart > Irregular Rhythm.\n\nA nursing student said an Apple Watch notification helped detect a rare abnormality. Amazing stuff.\n\n3. High and low heart rates\n\nYour Apple Watch checks for low and high heart rates that could indicate an underlying condition. You can be notified when your heart rate goes above 120 bpm or drops below 40 bpm while inactive for 10 minutes.\n\nYou can turn on heart rate notifications when you first open the Heart Rate app on your Apple Watch or at any time from your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap the My Watch tab, then tap Heart.\n\n• Tap High Heart Rate and choose a BPM.\n\n• Tap Low Heart Rate and choose a BPM.\n\n4. Respiratory rate\n\nYour respiratory rate refers to the number of times you breathe in a minute. This goes up as you exercise and down as you sleep. When you wear your Apple Watch to bed, it automatically measures and records your respiratory rate.\n\nWhen your respiratory rate is significantly higher or lower than usual while you sleep, it could indicate illness or a health condition.\n\nTo track your respiratory rate, you’ll need to set up the sleep features on your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Get Started under Set Up Sleep and tap Next.\n\n• Follow the onscreen prompts.\n\n• Turn on Track Sleep with Apple Watch.

Parents are becoming increasingly savvy to the downside of smartphones, such as overuse and access to inappropriate content. Once a kid has a smartphone, it's hard to take it back.\n\nMore:Exclusive: Nearly half of parents worry their child is addicted to mobile devices\n\nMore:Addicted to your smartphone? Here's how to kick the habit\n\nThere are a handful of devices for those in-between years that aim to connect us with kids without pushing a preteen into adulthood with a smartphone.\n\nJohn Renaldi, a former Motorola Mobility vice president, parlayed his own experience losing sight of his then-6 year old into co-founding Jiobit. The heavily encrypted device (starting at $99, plus a $9.99 monthly data fee) lets you follow your child’s movements on a smartphone app.\n\nThe sugar-packet sized tracker slips into a pocket, clips onto a waistband or shoelace, pairs with an app on your smartphone and can track your kids in real time. It uses “progressive beaconing,” which is a combination of Wi-Fi, cell networks, GPS and Bluetooth. It’s water-proof and discrete, with the idea that your youngster will forget they’re even wearing it. Meanwhile, the tiny gadget delivers real-time location info for a full week on a single charge.\n\nTo periodically check-in on your child’s whereabouts, it’s as simple as opening the app. But you can also set up location alerts to tell you when the device crosses certain map boundaries. You can set those alerts for common places, and you’ll get a buzz when your son or daughter leaves the house and then again when they arrive at a friend’s place, the library, swimming pool, Grandma’s house or anywhere else.\n\nGiven a rash of headlines about data breaches, Jiobit recently doubled-down on keeping customers' personal data secure.\n\n“We encrypt all of the tracking data on both ends – the device and the app – at rest and at transit, so that it can’t be snooped on by anyone else,” said Lindsay Slutzky, Jiobit’s chief marketing officer and mom of four.\n\nThe tracker also has a tamper resistant security chip, and your child’s location data is never sold or viewed by anyone but you or people you give permission to view it through your account, she says.\n\nHigh-tech walkie-talkie\n\nChecking the location of your child is a great way to gain some peace of mind, but when you want to hear their voice you’re going to need something a bit different. Relay (starting at $99, plus a $6.99 monthly data charge) is a Post-It note-size, screen-free cellphone alternative that puts you in direct contact with your child, with the tap of your smartphone screen.\n\nThink of Relay kind of like a walkie-talkie, only smarter. You can connect to your child’s Relay whenever you want from either your smartphone or from another Relay device, and they can contact you by pressing the large button in the middle of the gadget. But unlike a walkie-talkie, Relay uses 4G LTE connectivity to keep you in touch with your youngster.\n\nThe kids we tested out the trackers with definitely love the walkie-talkie function – so much so that you have to be careful they don’t run down the battery, or your patience, using it non-stop. Similar to Jiobit, you can use an app on your smartphone to see their location on a map, and it’s great to tap the center of the gadget and tell them it’s time to come home. Right now, there’s no way to clip the device onto your child – you have to just slip it into a pocket or pouch – but Relay says they’ll have solutions to that soon.\n\nAlso like Jiobit, Relay is the result of experts in the mobility space who also happen to be parents.\n\n“We set out to make something fun for kids,” says Raleigh, North Carolina-based Relay senior vice president Jon Schniepp, father of two sons, ages 3 and 6. “When we tried all the other trackers with our own kids we realized that eventually the novelty wears off and they don’t want to have anything to do with it.\"\n\nIf neither the Jiobit nor the Relay are striking your fancy, there are a couple of wrist-worn watch-like options that we did not go hands-on with extensively for this review.\n\nOne we tried when it first launched was the HereO kids watch ($199, plus a $4.95 monthly data charge after the first six months). It serves a similar purpose as the Jiobit, with a built-in GPS tracker that sends location info right to your phone, and with its bright colors and fun design it’s probably something your kid will love to show off.\n\nFor almost-teens, the back-to-basics Nokia 3310 ($59.99) is a great almost-smartphone with a battery that lasts up to 27 days on a single charge and a durable design that won’t buckle under pressure. If it does meet with catastrophe, its price won’t break your bank, either.\n\nNone of these are an instant “easy button” for being a parent, but they sure can help for peace of mind. “Tracking technology is no substitute for good parenting,” Slutzky adds. “It’s an extra tool – a proactive way to help keep them safer in our increasingly connected world.”\n\nJennifer Jolly is an Emmy Award-winning consumer tech contributor and host of USA TODAY's digital video show TECH NOW.

Ping, ping, ping from your family WhatsApp group trying to organize a weekend gathering.\n\nWith all those smartphone notifications, it’s no wonder you lose focus on what you’re trying to do.\n\nYour phone doesn’t even need to ping to distract you. There’s pretty good evidence the mere presence of your phone, silent or not, is enough to divert your attention.\n\nSo what’s going on?

The trouble is, it can take several minutes to regain your concentration fully after being interrupted by your phone.\n\nIf you’re watching TV, distractions (and refocusing) are no big deal. But if you’re driving a car, trying to study, working or spending time with your loved ones, it could lead to some fairly substantial problems.\n\nREAD MORE: Why do we still not have waterproof phones?\n\n2 types of interference\n\nThe pings from your phone are “exogenous interruptions.” In other words, something external, around you, has caused the interruption.\n\nWe can become conditioned to feeling excited when we hear our phones ping. It is the same pleasurable feeling people who gamble can quickly become conditioned to at the sight or sound of a poker machine.\n\nFrequent interruptions from your phone can leave you feeling stressed by a need to respond. A_B_C/Adobe Stock\n\nWhat if your phone is on silent? Doesn’t that solve the ping problem? Well, no.\n\nThat’s another type of interruption, an internal (or endogenous) interruption.\n\nThink of every time you were working on a task, but your attention drifted to your phone. You may have fought the urge to pick it up and see what was happening online, but you probably checked anyway.\n\nIn this situation, we can become so strongly conditioned to expect a reward each time we look at our phone we don’t need to wait for a ping to trigger the effect.\n\nThese impulses are powerful.

Although push notification interrupted concentration for both groups, the heavy users took much longer to regain focus.\n\nFrequent interruptions from your phone can also leave you feeling stressed by a need to respond. Frequent smartphone interruptions are also associated with increased FOMO (fear of missing out).\n\nIf you get distracted by your phone after responding to a notification, any subsequent procrastination in returning to a task can also leave you feeling guilty or frustrated.\n\nThere’s certainly evidence suggesting the longer you spend using your phone in unproductive ways, the lower you tend to rate your well-being.\n\nREAD MORE: Are people lying more since the rise of social media and smartphones?\n\nHow can I stop?\n\nWe know switching your phone to silent isn’t going to magically fix the problem, especially if you’re already a frequent checker.\n\nWhat’s needed is behavior change, and that’s hard.

If you ever look at what they’re actually doing on there, you’ll likely see a lot of innocent “Snapstreaking,” some funny Buzzfeed videos and a bunch of letters and numbers that look like some kind of modern-day shorthand.\n\nYou probably use some of these yourself:\n\nLOL = laugh(ing) out loud\n\nGR8 = great\n\nIRL = in real life\n\nTYVM = thank you very much\n\nIMHO = in my humble opinion\n\nBRB = be right back\n\nJ/K = just kidding\n\nL8R = later\n\nNP = no problem\n\nWYD= what you doing?\n\nWhile most of these terms are completely innocent, some child safety experts warn there can be more than meets the eye with texting codes. Some strange texting lingo might double as code for suicidal thoughts, bullying, sex and drugs.\n\n“The stakes are high, and today’s parents need new ways to safeguard their teens from the harmful side effects of online interaction,” says Brian Bason, CEO of Bark, a safety app parents and teens download that monitors sites and services teens use for red flag words and the context they're using them in.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, suicide is the second leading cause of deaths for young adults and adults ages 15 to 34. In recent years, the problem of teen suicide has taken on a new dimension in part due to the proliferation of technology. \"We teach our kids to look both ways when they cross the street. Don't talk to strangers. We need to do the same thing for children with digital uses,\" Bason says.\n\nGet more like this delivered to your inbox: Sign up for the weekly Talking Tech newsletter.\n\nBark analyzes some 10-million teen messages per month across 21 different platforms including text, email, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube. Here’s the most recent list of the top “sneaky” terms that teens use, according to Bark’s data:\n\n53X = sneaky way to type \"sex\"\n\nKMS = kill myself\n\nLH6 = let’s have sex\n\nKYS = kill yourself\n\nMOS = mom over the shoulder\n\nPOS = parent over shoulder\n\nCD9 = code 9, parents around\n\nGNOC = get naked on camera.\n\n99 = parents are gone\n\nWTTP = want to trade photos?\n\nLMIRL = let’s meet in real life\n\n1174 = meet at a party spot\n\nIWSN = I want sex now\n\nCU46 = see you for sex\n\nFWB = friends with benefits\n\nADR = what’s your address\n\nMPFB = my personal f*** buddy\n\nPAL= parents are listening\n\nTWD = texting while driving\n\nGYPO = get your pants off\n\nI ran a bunch of these by own teenage daughter, who I’ve also tested the Bark service on recently, along with Netsanity,Net Nanny, TeenSafe, Limitly, and many “watchdog” apps over the years. (The perks of being the child of a tech reporter...) In her experience, teens use terms like KMS and KYS mainly to describe embarrassment — “I just spilled soda all over my jeans, I want to KMS” — most of the time it’s totally sarcastic and nothing for anyone to worry about.\n\nOne former data scientist agrees. “GNOC was typed a massive 4,384 times on Android phones in the U.S. in 2016,” says Brandon Wirtz, now the CEO of artificial intelligence and machine-learning service Recognant. “In 1,986 of those times the next word was ‘means,\" — suggesting people were curious about the lingo but not acting on it.\n\nBark’s Bason says that’s why it’s so important to add context and conversation to the shorthand teens use. He says spying on kids' conversations simply does not work, but a mix of education, communication, and modern tools, often can. “We’re not just flagging known texting code though, we’re using keywords, data science, and machine learning. If it detects potential issues, the app sends an alert to your phone via email or text, and then offers solutions to help with the presented issues.”\n\nWhether you plan to monitor your kids or are want help deciphering the latest text codes, online website Netlingo is a great resource.

The four social networks have since introduced more tools and parental control options aimed at better protecting younger users. Some have also made changes to their algorithms, such as defaulting teens into seeing less sensitive content and increasing their moderation efforts. But some lawmakers, social media experts and psychologists say the new solutions are still limited, and more needs to be done.\n\n“More than a year after the Facebook Papers dramatically revealed Big Tech’s abuse, social media companies have made only small, slow steps to clean up their act,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate’s consumer protection subcommittee, told CNN Business. “Trust in Big Tech is long gone and we need real rules to ensure kids’ safety online.”\n\nMichela Menting, a digital security director at market research firm ABI Research, agreed that social media platforms are “offering very little of substance to counter the ills their platforms incur.” Their solutions, she said, put the onus on guardians to activate various parental controls,such as those intended to filter, block and restrict access, and more passive options, such as monitoring and surveillance tools that run in the background.\n\nAlexandra Hamlet, a New York City-based clinical psychologist, recalls being invited to a roundtable discussion roughly 18 months ago to discuss ways to improve Instagram, in particular, for younger users. “I don’t see many of our ideas being implemented,” she said. Social media platforms, she added, need to work on “continuing to improve parental controls, protect young people against targeted advertising, and remove objectively harmful content.”\n\nThe social media companies featured in this piece either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment on criticism that more needs to be done to protect young users.\n\nFor now, guardians must learn how to use the parental controls while also being mindful that teens can often circumvent those tools. Here’s a closer look at what parents can do to help keep their kids safe online.\n\nInstagram\n\nAfter the fallout from the leaked documents, Meta-owned Instagram paused its much-criticized plan to release a version of Instagram for kids under age 13 and focused on making its main service safer for young users.\n\nIt has since introduced an educational hub for parents with resources, tips and articles from experts on user safety, and rolled out a tool that allows guardians to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits. Parents can also receive updates on what accounts their teens follow and the accounts that follow them, and view and be notified if their child makes an update to their privacy and account settings. Parents can see which accounts their teens have blocked, as well. The company also provides video tutorials on how to use the new supervision tools.\n\nAnother feature encourages users to take a break from the app, such as suggesting they take a deep breath, write something down, check a to-do list or listen to a song, after a predetermined amount of time. Instagram also said it’s taking a “stricter approach” to the content it recommends to teens and will actively nudge them toward different topics, such as architecture and travel destinations, if they’ve been dwelling on any type of content for too long.\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook’s Safety Center provides supervision tools and resources, such as articles and advice from leading experts. “Our vision for Family Center is to eventually allow parents and guardians to help their teens manage experiences across Meta technologies, all from one place,” Liza Crenshaw, a Meta spokesperson, told CNN Business.\n\nThe hub also offers a guide to Meta’s VR parental supervision tools from ConnectSafely, a nonprofit aimed at helping kids stay safe online, to assist parents with discussing virtual reality with their teens. Guardians can see which accounts their teens have blocked and access supervision tools, as well as approve their teen’s download or purchase of an app that is blocked by default based on its rating, or block specific apps that may be inappropriate for their teen.\n\nSnapchat\n\nIn August, Snapchat introduced a parent guide and hub aimed at giving guardians more insight into how their teens use the app, including who they’ve been talking to within the last week (without divulging the content of those conversations). To use the feature, parents must create their own Snapchat account, and teens have to opt-in and give permission.\n\nWhile this was Snapchat’s first formal foray into parental controls, it did previously have a few existing safety measures for young users, such as requiring teens to be mutual friends before they can start communicating with each other and prohibiting them from having public profiles. Teen users have their Snap Map location-sharing tool off by default but can also use it to disclose their real-time location with a friend or family member even while their app is closed as a safety measure. Meanwhile, a Friend Check Up tool encourages Snapchat users to review their friend lists and make sure they still want to be in touch with certain people.\n\nSnap gives parents the ability to see which new friends their teens have added and allows them to confidentially report concerning accounts that may be interacting with their child. It is also working on a tool to give younger users the option to notify their parents when they report an account or piece of content.\n\nThe company told CNN Business it will continue to build on its safety features and consider feedback from the community, policymakers, safety and mental health advocates, and other experts to improve the tools over time.\n\nTikTok\n\nIn July, TikTok announced new ways to filter out mature or “potentially problematic” videos. The new safeguards allocated a “maturity score” to videos detected as potentially containing mature or complex themes. It also rolled out a tool that aims to help people decide how much time they want to spend on TikToks. The tool lets users set regular screen time breaks, and provides a dashboard that details the number of times they opened the app, a breakdown of daytime and nighttime usage and more.\n\nThe popular short form video app currently offers a Family Pairing hub, which allows parents and teens to customize their safety settings. A parent can also link their TikTok account to their teen’s app and set parental controls, including how long they can spend on the app each day; restrict exposure to certain content; decide if teens can search for videos, hashtags, or Live content; and whether their account is private or public. TikTok also offers its Guardian’s Guide that highlights how parents can best protect their kids on the platform.\n\nIn addition to parental controls, the app restricts access to some features to younger users, such as Live and direct messaging. A pop-up also surfaces when teens under the age of 16 are ready to publish their first video, asking them to choose who can watch the video.

Some existing parental control tools include an option to prohibit a minor from receiving a friend request or a direct message from someone they don’t know.\n\nStill, it’s possible for minors to connect with strangers on public servers or in private chats if the person was invited by someone else in the room or if the channel link is dropped into a public group that the user accessed.

I heard my Internet service provider is starting a new policy called \"Six Strikes.\" How will it affect my surfing?\n\nA. It depends. If someone in your home is pirating movies, TV or music, you'll start receiving warning notices. The first couple of notices will be friendly emails or calls telling you someone is pirating copyrighted content on your connection. From there, your ISP could throttle your data speeds or block out certain sites. Your service would go back to normal once you've contacted your ISP. While this sounds like harsh punishment, it's actually better than the way piracy disputes are currently handled. It gives you a chance to talk to anyone in your house who is misusing the connection, or lock down your wireless network, instead of receiving a surprise lawsuit from the MPAA or RIAA.\n\nLimit Facebook distraction\n\nQ. I feel like Facebook is draining my productivity! Are there any tools that can help make the site not so addicting?\n\nA. You bet! Downloads like Facebook Nanny and Cold Turkey can restrict your access to the site for custom periods of time. You can block surfing through your router at certain times of the day, too. These are all industrial-strength solutions to the problem, though. Limiting notifications on your Facebook will do just as well to stop distractions while you're working. To do that, click the upside-down triangle in the top right corner of your profile page and go to \"Account settings.\" You'll see a Notifications tab in the left where you can edit how often you receive notifications. You can opt-out of notifications by hovering over any notification itself and clicking the X that appears, too.\n\nWhat to know before giving kids a gadget\n\nQ. I'm giving my granddaughter her first smartphone for Christmas. Are there any sort of parental controls I can set up to make sure she stays safe?\n\nA. There are built-in parental controls on most smartphones that can be found in their manuals. You can add third-party apps like Mobicip for safer browsing and Lookout to help keep their phone safe from viruses. However, teens have a habit of learning how to hack their gadgets to get around these and do things they're not supposed to do. The best way to avoid that isn't any app or setting. It's to have a chat with the child (and in other cases, a grandchild and their parents) and tell them what is and isn't OK, and then follow it up with regular check-ins. Kids are more likely to listen when they see that you trust and care about them.\n\nSecure your Windows 8 computer\n\nQ. I'm debating a Windows 8 upgrade, but I don't know if my security software will work. Are there options specifically made for Windows 8 or can I use what I already use?\n\nA. While Windows 8 is the first Windows build to come with full-featured security software, I don't recommend it. Hackers tailor attacks to the default options in Windows. Luckily, most popular anti-virus software should work fine in Windows 8. If you want to double-check a specific program, use Microsoft's compatibility scanner. I tested three of my favorites — Avast!, Spyboy Search & Destroy and MalwareBytes — and they all made the jump fine. According to Microsoft, third-party firewalls might not work in Windows 8. ZoneAlarm just released a version that it claims will work just fine, though. No matter whether you run that or the default option in Windows, make sure you never run both at the same time.\n\nAre shortened links safe?\n\nQ. A friend posted a link on Facebook that said Youtu.be instead of Youtube.com. Would this link be safe, or was I right to not click?\n\nA. Youtu.be is YouTube's official shortened link — you can find it in the share button underneath any video on the site. While this one is safe, you were right not to click on a shortened link without knowing where it goes. Scammers can hide all sorts of malicious things inside of them. If you see shortened links often on your social media, use Tweetdeck to read your social posts and switch \"Auto URL shortening\" to off. This allows you to see the full link. However, when you post a link, Twitter or other social sites will still shorten it automatically for you.\n\nKim Komando hosts the nation's largest talk radio show about consumer electronics, computers and the Internet.

Please read it and heed it before you head out for Memorial Day.\n\nOn iPhones running the current iOS 11 software, you should have gotten a prompt to enable Apple’s “Do Not Disturb while driving” option the first time your iPhone detected motion akin to driving. But if you ignored that, you should revisit this “do not disturb” feature, which suppresses notifications and only shows turn-by-turn navigation on the lock screen.\n\nIn the Settings app, tap “Do Not Disturb” and scroll down to change the feature's activation options. “Automatically” turns it on if the iPhone’s motion sensors pick up auto-like acceleration (so it will work if you’re in a rented or borrowed car), while “When Connected to Car Bluetooth” relies on the phone pairing to your car’s Bluetooth wireless (which avoids it being confused by non-car movement).\n\n“Manually” requires you to activate do not disturb-while-driving from the Control Center. By default, iOS’ Control Center doesn’t show an icon for this mode. To fix that, go to the Settings app, select “Control Center” and then “Customize Controls.”\n\nAt least most iOS users seem to be taking advantage of this help. A study released in February by the Cambridge, Mass., insurance marketplace EverQuote found that about 80% of iPhone users with its EverDrive safe-driving app installed were using Apple’s do-not-disturb feature at the start of last fall.\n\nThat study did not cover adoption of Google’s Android Auto app, but since that app isn’t installed by default, odds are the figure is lower. This program, not the same as the in-car interface many car manufacturers now ship, has offered drivers a stripped-down front end for Android since 2016.\n\nIt’s not as restrictive as Apple’s car-mode feature, since it can play music, lets calls through and will offer to read aloud incoming texts and invite you to voice-dictate replies to them. But it does hide other sources of distraction. No Facebook notifications or interoffice emails will pop up.\n\nYou can set Android Auto to launch automatically when your phone connects to your car’s Bluetooth. If your vehicle is Bluetooth-deprived, put this app’s icon right in the center of your phone’s home screen, but be aware that it won’t default to answering calls in speakerphone mode.\n\nThere’s also no option to have Android Auto launch every time a phone detects a car’s motion, although Google did add an automatic do-not-disturb mode to its Pixel 2 line of phones in November.\n\nSince the next version of Android is already set to include features to curtail your screen time, making Android Auto easier to discover would be a sensible addition to that upcoming release when it ships in the third quarter. Android Auto is a good app, but its 10 million-plus downloads mean it hasn’t even gotten out of the parking lot compared to Google’s Waze traffic-navigation app, which now touts more than 100 million downloads.\n\nAnd drivers unquestionably need the help. A second EverQuote study, released in April, found 37% of unsafe-driving trips recorded by EverDrive involved handheld smartphone use — as in, with no indication from the device’s motion sensors that it was being kept in a dashboard mount.\n\nUnaddressed by that study: how high the distracted-driving rate might be among people who don’t care enough about their driving to let an app monitor it.\n\nMore:Laurel or Yanny?

In U.S. school districts where digital device policies are all over the map, parents and teachers are divided on how to curb or permit phone use in the classroom.\n\nSome schools have students stash their phones in their lockers – as they do for middle schoolers in my Northern New Jersey town. Others have kids place them in a canvas \"pocket chart\" – essentially a hanging shoe organizer – in the classroom.\n\nWhat most everyone agrees on is that screen-time addiction is a problem for young and old, an issue that companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook are finally tackling with recently announced software updates. You hear all too often how kids who are fixated on smartphone screens are only modeling the behavior of their parents. (It’s also not unheard of that a teacher also may use a phone in the classroom, to check on his or her own family at home.)\n\nDebate rages on:Why you shouldn't let your kids have a cellphone in school\n\nAccording to nonprofit family media watchdog Common Sense Media, 24 percent of kids from 8 to 12 years old have their own smartphone and 67 percent of their teenage counterparts do, with tweens using an average of about six hours’ worth of entertainment media daily.\n\nCompounding the confusion is the age at which families give their kids a phone – often, but not always, when the youngster is about to enter middle school. But what effect does a kid who has a phone that’s visible at school have on a classmate who doesn’t have his or her own handset?\n\nSome schools implement “one-to-one” programs to provide computers, tablets or other mobile devices to each student. Other cash-strapped districts may have to share tech gear in the classroom. And some educators may even encourage students to bring their own devices for class use.\n\nIt’s safe to assume that most schools aren’t about to dictate to a parent that a kid can or cannot use a device on the way to or from school, though some do actually ask families to sign commitments to temper tech use.\n\nKeeping all this in mind, here are some of the arguments made for and against a stricter cellphone-use policy in schools.\n\nWhy cellphones should be permitted in schools\n\n“Have a plan, not a ban,\" says Liz Kline, vice president for education at Common Sense Education in the San Francisco Bay Area, a group whose mission is to help kids thrive in a world of media and technology. “There are legitimate learning contexts for using devices in the classroom,” Kline says, whether students are making movies or studying photography.\n\nKline acknowledges that digital distraction is “totally real,” and she recognizes that setting up the classroom norms for when it's appropriate to use a phone – and when it is not – is not a simple matter.\n\nLisa Highfill, an instructional technology coach at the Pleasanton Unified public and secondary school district in Pleasanton, California, believes letting students have phones helps them prepare for higher education and eventually the workplace. “How many people go to work each day and turn their phone in?\" she asks. \"To me, getting ready for career and college is learning how to avoid the distraction of your phone.”\n\nEducators should have dialogs with students about when and why kids feel compelled to pick up their devices, she says. “Teach students how to refocus, how to take care of something that is really nagging at them and then move on and put it away ... Self-monitoring is a lifelong skill that we have an opportunity to integrate into our lessons.”\n\nOf course, there ought to be times when phones are put away or even collected by teachers, no questions asked, namely during test time. Indeed, some students use the devices to cheat.\n\nSafety concerns are also often given as a reason to let kids have devices at school. When there’s an accident or tragic incident, the presence of phones lets parents get in touch with the kids, and the kids can get in touch with a parent.\n\n“Phones are as much for peace of mind of parents as they are for kids,“ says New York City-based social media coach Sree Sreenivasan, a parent and co-founder of the Digimentors consulting firm.\n\nBut parents may also try to reach the youngsters under more routine circumstances.\n\n“I ask kids all the time, who do you normally get texts from during school? Their friends, of course,” Highfill says. “But their mothers are texting them, and it’s actually very practical. 'Don’t forget to talk to your math teacher' or 'don’t forget you have this appointment at the end of the day.’ ”\n\nMore:When should a kid get their first smartphone? And other parenting questions of the social media age\n\nMore:These devices help you connect to kids and tweens without giving them a smartphone\n\nMore:Addicted to your smartphone? Here's how to kick the habit\n\nKline adds another dimension to the let-kids-have-phones-in-school argument. In some lower-income areas where there’s concern surrounding the digital divide, the school might offer the kind of speedy internet access that is not available at home. “I think there is some nuance around this,” she says.\n\nAnd then there’s this argument: Restrictions just might not work.\n\n“I really believe that the more rules and restrictions you put on top down, the more kids will just work to try to work around those rules. And they’re good at it, the best hackers,” Highfill says.\n\nWhen her IT department blocked Snapchat access at school, kids built their own server as a workaround. Highfill also knows of students who put their cellphone cases – but not the phones themselves – inside pocket charts to fool teachers.\n\nThe case against phones in class\n\n“When we’re asking these 12 to 13 year olds to carry the phone and not be on them, we 100 percent know that’s not happening,” says Delaney Ruston, a physician and director of the documentary “Screenagers: Growing Up in the Digital Age.” “You can go into any classroom or ask any middle schooler, and they will tell you consistently how they and/or their friends are sneaking being on the phones during class times.\"\n\nThe consequences? According to the “Away For The Day” initiative Ruston developed with the team behind “Screenagers” to try to institute policies requiring phones to be put away, 56 percent of middle schools allow students to carry phones on them all day, yet 82 percent of parents don’t want their kids using phones there.\n\nThe Away For The Day website cites various academic studies that point to potential negative outcomes of classroom phone use. In one such study, 75 percent of teachers reported that the attention spans of students have decreased. In another study, students regularly interrupted by text messages had test scores that were 10.6 percent lower.\n\nRuston believes that putting the phones away can improve a child’s emotional well-being in school and help with their focus in and out of the classroom.\n\nAnd while she recognizes that a teacher might ask a kid to pull out a phone during a given lesson, \"to do X, Y, Z ... the reality is that many of these kids now on their personal device have gotten so many notifications that they’re actually not going to whatever the teacher is saying they should be doing, but instead sending and receiving messages or going onto their video games.\"\n\n\"You're already going to have those struggles with (school supplied) educational devices,\" Ruston adds, \"but it gets exponentially more challenging when it's a personal device.\"\n\nEven if a device on a student's desk is turned off, the worry is that it still becomes a distraction.\n\nRuston also dismisses the safety argument. She pointed to an NPR report in which security experts have said that letting a kid have a phone in the classroom during a lockdown makes them less safe, not more. When students should be quiet, for example, a ringing or vibrating phone might alert an assailant where kids are hiding. Parents trying to reach youngsters in an emergency might jam communications and interfere with first responders. And the kids might miss instructions from the authorities.\n\nBut Ruston concedes that “that’s not to say there’s not an emotional upside for a parent.”\n\nWhere do you come down on the subject?

That can cause excessive pressure and damage the engine, causing vehicles to stall and in some cases catch fire, according to Hyundai documents posted Friday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nIt's a different problem from what has caused the rest of the recalls since 2015 from Hyundai and its affiliated automaker Kia, which have been plagued by engine failures and fires across the U.S.\n\nThe recall, which covers only the 2013 Veloster with 1.6-liter engines, is due to a software problem that has been found only in that model year and not in other Hyundai engines, company spokesman Michael Stewart said. Kia spokesman James Bell said in a statement that the automaker didn't use any engines from the plant that made Veloster engines.\n\nVolkswagen recall:VW recalls cars, SUVs with defect that can lead to losing control\n\nNew car:Lincoln set to debut all-new Corsair at New York International Auto Show in April\n\nJason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group that has petitioned the government seeking more Hyundai and Kia recalls, said the fire and engine problems keep spreading to more vehicles.\n\n\"This recall raises the question of whether we are even beyond the tip of the iceberg with these non-crash fires with both of these manufacturers,\" Levine said. \"How many times are we going to hear from either Hyundai or Kia that these circumstances are unique to a particular model and then have another recall or fire situation announced weeks or months later?\"\n\nHyundai said in documents that it has been analyzing fire claims from owners and reporting the findings to NHTSA, which in December raised questions about the Veloster. The company traced the problem to engine control software in vehicles made at the Ulsan plant in South Korea from April 26, 2012 to Oct. 16, 2013, according to documents.\n\nWhile claims were high for the 2013 model, they decreased starting in 2014, the company wrote. Software was updated on vehicles at the factory in October of 2013, the company said. Hyundai wrote that it's not aware of any crashes or injuries.\n\nDealers will install updated software on the recalled cars. Owners will be notified starting May 13.\n\nIn February, Kia announced that it would recall the Soul small SUV with the same-size engine due to fire and engine failure problems, but Stewart said that was for a problem that was different from the Veloster.\n\nThe Soul recall covered nearly 379,000 vehicles from 2012 through 2016. Documents showed that high exhaust gas temperatures can damage the catalytic converters, which control pollution. That can cause abnormal combustion and damage pistons and connecting rods. A failed connecting rod can pierce the engine block and cause oil leaks that can cause fires.\n\nSo far Hyundai and Kia have recalled about 2.4 million vehicles to fix problems that can cause fires and engine failures since 2015. In addition, the automakers are doing a \"product improvement campaign\" covering another 3.7 million vehicles to install software that will alert drivers of possible engine failures and send the cars into a reduced-speed \"limp\" mode if problems are detected.\n\nBoth automakers are under investigation by NHTSA for potentially being slow to fix faulty vehicles.\n\nThe Center for Auto Safety says it has found more than 300 Hyundai-Kia fire complaints in a government database, which is high compared with similar vehicles. Levine has said fire complaints to NHTSA have come from across the country, including a death in Ohio in April of 2017.\n\nWill future cars be auto-immune?:Jaguar Land Rover hopes its future vehicles can help stop the spread of colds and the flu\n\nAvocado recall:California company recalls avocados as precaution against listeria: Is your fruit safe?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2023/02/01/progressive-state-farm-drop-hyundai-kia-insurance/11153762002/", "title": "State Farm drops coverage for some Hyundai, Kia cars, Progressive ...", "text": "Both Progressive and State Farm have halted new insurance policies for select Hyundai and Kia vehicles.\n\nThe companies said the vehicles are part of an increase in car thefts.\n\nAt least one insurance company, State Farm, said the change is temporary.\n\nProgressive and State Farm will no longer issue insurance policies for select Hyundai and Kia vehicles due to a rise in thefts among the vehicles, the insurers confirmed this week.\n\nBut what about other insurers?

State Farm's halt on Hyundais and Kias is part of its plan to protect both the business and its policyholders, the company said.\n\nHow is Progressive handling Kia and Hyundai vehicles?\n\nProgressive has seen a rise in theft rates for certain Hyundai and Kia vehicles, the company said in an emailed statement. In some areas, the vehicles are almost 20 times more likely to be stolen than other vehicles.\n\nThe company called the theft increases \"explosive\" and said its policies are based on the level of risk they represent, so insuring the vehicles is \"extremely challenging.\"\n\nProgressive will continue to insure existing customers who have these vehicles but has notified them of the \"elevated risk.\" The company has also given policyholders tips to secure their vehicles.\n\n\"We’ll continue to monitor how this issue plays out, and if we see a change in theft rates to more typical levels, we’ll adjust our pricing and acceptance criteria accordingly,\" the statement read.\n\nInsurance: Car prices may fall this year, but auto insurance will cost more.

The thefts are mainly among Kia cars newer than 2011 and Hyundai cars newer than 2015.\n\nThe Highway Loss Data Institute reviewed 2021 insurance claims and found that among 2015-19 vehicles, theft claims were nearly twice as common for Hyundai and Kia vehicles than all other car manufacturers.\n\nThe institute thinks it's because the companies sell vehicles that don't have electronic immobilizers to prevent thieves from taking them. People are able to break in and bypass the ignition, the institute said.\n\nIn the model year 2015, immobilizers were standard on 96% of other manufacturers’ vehicles but were standard on only 26% of Hyundai and Kia vehicle models, the institute said.\n\nA spokesperson for Hyundai said engine immobilizers are now standard on all the company's vehicles produced as of November 2021, and the company plans to offer drivers a free software update beginning in late February.\n\nWhich models, years and cities are affected?\n\nKia said in a statement that impacted vehicles include those built between 2011 and 2021. The impacted vehicles have a steel key to \"insert and turn to start\" the ignition.\n\nA spokesperson for Hyundai didn't specify which years are impacted.\n\nNeither company listed states that will be affected but CNN reported the companies have stopped offering insurance on vehicles in Denver and St. Louis.\n\nAside from State Farm and Progressive, are other insurance companies dropping Hyundais and Kias?\n\nProgressive and State Farm have stopped issuing policies for select Hyundais and Kias but what about other major insurance companies such as Geico, Allstate, USAA, Liberty Mutual, Farmers, Travelers, Nationwide and American Family?\n\nOther companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter.\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

Kia and Hyundai vehicles represent a large share of stolen cars in multiple cities, data from police and state officials suggests.\n\nThe group of 23 attorneys general says that's because Kia and Hyundai chose not to include anti-theft immobilizers as standard equipment in many vehicle models sold in the U.S. even though \"every other car manufacturer\" was doing so.

Japan-based Honda sold 1,309,222.\n\nLooking at just these mainstream brands, Hyundai and Kia outsold Honda by more than 130,000 vehicled, the first time the combined brands have outsold Honda. If their respective luxury brands are included – Hyundai’s Genesis and Honda’s Acura – the margin is much narrower, just 22,000 sales, but the Korean brands still come out slightly ahead. These sales figures were supplied by the automakers.\n\nFor Kia, it was the first time the brand ever sold more than 700,000 vehicles in one year. Hyundai set a record for retail sales – meaning excluding sales to fleet customers – and increased its market share by eight-tenths of a percentage point.\n\nIt might seem odd to compare two automakers with just one, but Hyundai and Kia are closely related. Hyundai Motor Group, Hyundai’s parent company, owns a controlling interest in Kia, and the two companies share a lot of engineering in their various models. In the United States, Kia and Hyundai operate as two distinct companies with different US headquarters and executives, different dealerships and even different factories – Kia builds cars in Georgia while Hyundai has a factory in Alabama. But, taking a global view, they are like two members of the same family.\n\nLarger SUVs, like the Kia Telluride, have helped change perceptions of the Kia and Hyundai brands. Kia\n\nBoth brands have come a long way from their former identities as purveyors of just basic transportation for the budget conscious. It hasn’t been quite a steady climb, though. The two brands’ combined market share came close to Honda’s a decade ago, according to data from the automotive website Edmunds.com, but the gap opened up again before the Korean brands surged over the past few years to finally pass Honda.\n\nHyundai and Kia each saw sales increase roughly 20% in 2021. Honda’s sales were up just 8.2%. In announcing its sales, Honda noted struggles with supply chain issues. Both Hyundai and Kia acknowledged that the industry-wide microchip shortage created challenges for them as well. Neither company said what was done to work around it.\n\n“Remember, with this chip shortage, the brand that has the more ample supply is the brand that’s going to win,” said Vanessa Ton, senior manager of analytics at Cox Automotive, a company that owns various automotive websites and auto dealer services firms.\n\nBesides apparently handling its supply of computer chips better, according to Ton, Hyundai and Kia also benefited from some compelling products, particularly the three-row Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride SUVs which have proven extremely popular. Both models still command high prices from customers, said Ivan Drury, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com, and they bring in new customers to brands previously known for smaller SUVs and cars.\n\n“I think those are the two products that are going to help them maintain that [market growth] because they were kind of chipping away,” he said, “but now, by adding this new mix of consumers, they’re really changing the mindset.”\n\nHyundai and Kia also compete in market segments that many other automakers have quit. Both brands offer sedans like the Kia K5 and the Hyundai Elantra, while some other automakers, such as Ford and GM, have stopped building sedans for the US market. Kia also has a new SUV-like minivan model, the Carnival, which replaced the Sedona minivan in the US. Kia’s minivan sales were up 90% last year.\n\nBeing two separate brands does provide Kia and Hyundai with some innate advantages over any single brand like Honda. Namely, car shoppers get more choices of models and dealerships. Someone shopping for a compact sedan can choose a Honda Civic, Kia Hyundai Elantra or Kia Forte. Same with compact SUVs. With each brand offering a choice in that segment, Hyundai and Kia have a total of two opportunities to win you over – the Hyundai Tucson and Kia Sportage – to Honda’s one, the popular Honda CR-V.\n\nAnother factor that may have helped Hyundai and Kia was the general sense of economic unease in the nation last year due to the coronavirus and related disruptions, said Ton. The Korean brands have tended to do well when people were worried about money, she said, pointing to the brands’ strong performance during the 2008 recession.\n\n“They do really well because of their value proposition,” she said.\n\nBoth brands offer long warranties and, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, their cars tend to have lots of features and options for the money, she said. For buyers watching their pennies, a Hyundai or Kia feels like a frugal purchase. It also helps that the Korean brands hired designers and engineers from German brands like BMW and Audi to help make their models sharp-looking and enjoyable to drive, she said.\n\nA lot of car shoppers still associate Hyundai and Kia with that more negative corollary to “good value.” They’re still seen by some as being “cheap,” said Drury.\n\n“If they don’t know what the brand is putting out today in terms of product, their reaction is almost always negative,” he said. “And that’s perfect. They still have people to convert. They’ve got tons of room to grow.”\n\nRandy Parker, vice president of sales for Hyundai Motor America, also credits the brand’s products for the sales growth, of course. But, besides that, he points to a huge promotional push.\n\n“We never took our foot off the gas from a promotional perspective,” he said. “In fact, we spent more money” in 2021 than in 2020.\n\nBesides straightforward advertising Hyundai also invested in a relationship with Disney and Marvel Studios that saw Hyundai vehicles appearing in ads with likes of Marvel’s Loki and Captain America and Wanda from WandaVision. Hyundai also entered into an arrangement with Amazon that now has all of Hyundai’s dealer inventory listed on Amazon.com.\n\n“I’m not going to make any predictions about the future and what our volume looks like,” Parker said. “All I can tell you is that our mindset is that we’re looking to grow year after year and, and so far, we’ve been able to do that over the past several years.”", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2023/04/27/stellantis-buyouts-layoffs-job-cuts/11750581002/", "title": "Stellantis layoffs: Buyouts offered 'corporate wide' to cut 3,500 jobs", "text": "Stellantis wants to cut 3,500 hourly skilled and production jobs in the United States, and it plans to offer buyout packages \"corporate wide,\" according to a letter from a local UAW official.\n\nThe company said the buyouts would be offered to 33,000 workers in the United States and an undisclosed number in Canada but the company confirmed that the target number of hourly positions being sought is about 3,500. Stellantis did not say how many salaried positions it wants to cut.\n\nStellantis' efforts to cut payroll prompted an angry response from United Auto Workers officials on Wednesday, with UAW President Shawn Fain calling the company's \"push to cut thousands of jobs while raking in billions in profits ... disgusting.\"\n\nThe letter, dated Monday and posted on the Facebook page of UAW Local 1264, said the issue was discussed in a phone call between the local's leadership and UAW Vice President Rich Boyer, who oversees the union's Stellantis department.\n\nWhat does Stellantis do?\n\nStellantis owns the Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat brands; Local 1264 represents workers at Stellantis' Sterling Stamping Plant.\n\nStates want vehicles recalled:Attorneys general ask for recall of Kia, Hyundai vehicles due to lack of anti-theft devices\n\nF-150s catch fire:'We’re not putting this out:' F-150 Lightning fire melts EV trucks\n\nTwo incentive packages would be offered to workers, including one for $50,000 for seniority members hired before 2007.

But on Wednesday, she provided a statement from Stellantis saying the company would offer voluntary separation programs to certain employees, both union-represented and nonunion-represented workers.\n\nIs the Stellantis factory closing?\n\nAs when the company announced its plans in December to idle its Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, Stellantis, in the statement, referenced the transition to vehicle electrification as a reason for its actions. The Belvidere plant produced the Jeep Cherokee SUV.\n\n\"In response to today’s increasingly competitive global market conditions and the necessary shift to electrification, Stellantis is thoroughly reviewing its North American operations to improve efficiency, reduce costs and protect the competitiveness of our products to allow for further strategic investments to support our transformation,\" the statement said.\n\nThe company said its buyout offers for union-represented workers would include some in Canada and said information about the packages would be communicated to eligible employees next week.\n\n\"These voluntary programs are being offered to provide a favorable option to employees looking to pursue new opportunities, while preserving critical roles the Company needs in order to maintain its competitive advantage. Voluntary separation packages are being offered to designated non-represented U.S. employees who have 15 or more years of service and work in certain organizations,\" the statement said.\n\nThe issue comes as the company and union gear up for what are expected to be contentious contract talks later this year. The fate of Belvidere has been a particular sore spot for the UAW, and officials have pointed out that governments have been providing incentives to both prompt consumers to purchase EVs and for companies to build EV and battery production plants.\n\nFain, the UAW president, called the proposed job cuts \"a slap in the face to our members, their families, their communities and the American people who saved this company 15 years ago. Even now, politicians and taxpayers are bankrolling the electric vehicle transition, and this is the thanks the working class gets.” Fain said in a UAW release.\n\nBoyer, the UAW vice president, said in the release that “our union is working around the clock to get justice for the members impacted by these job cuts. We look forward to Stellantis doing the right thing by the workers who make this company run.”\n\nThe union noted that Stellantis made almost $18 billion in net profit and provided CEO Carlos Tavares with almost $25 million in total compensation in 2022.\n\nIn March, Tavares, who has criticized the cost of the electrification push by governments and said it would affect the company's manufacturing footprint, was asked how workers should consider the impact of high executive compensation, returns for shareholders and company profits in thinking about the situation in Belvidere.\n\n\"They should think about it on a pure sustainability standpoint.

Sign up for our newsletter here]\n\n“I don’t think quality has ever been … one of the things people would look at as one of Chrysler’s talking points,” said Bill Visnic, editorial director of the Society of Automotive Engineers. “Chrysler or FCA has always labored with the perception, at least, that it’s got subpar quality.”\n\nEach year, when J.D. Power and Consumer Reports release their annual surveys and rankings, most FCA brands fall at or near the bottom, and this year has been no different.\n\nThe automaker has also been hit by a rash of recalls.\n\nIn just the past year, recalls — not counting those for air bags, an area where scores of automakers continue to deal with fallout from defective Takata products — were announced for more than 8.3 million FCA vehicles in the United States. Those recalls covered everything from steering components to floor mats.\n\nConsumers can choose to view recalls using different lenses. Either a company is proactively working to address its problems or it's an area of concern about what a company is putting out on the road.\n\nHow a carmaker responds to problems can eventually influence how consumers view that company. Hyundai, for instance, ranks highly on third-party measures related to quality, but recently it has been blasted by safety advocates for what has been seen as a slow response to engine fire risks in some Hyundai and Kia vehicles.\n\nMark Champine knows FCA is not where it needs to be in terms of quality, but he says the company is moving in the right direction. As FCA’s head of Quality for North America since October, Champine says he can influence that effort, but he acknowledges the challenge.\n\n“No, we’re not moving fast enough. We need to move faster to get to … our objective, which is to be among the best. That’s our mission,” Champine told the Free Press during a meeting at the company’s U.S. headquarters in Auburn Hills, north of Detroit, earlier this month.\n\nReaching that goal means emphasizing a message that quality is important, and, as an example, Champine presented a small, glossy pamphlet that is now distributed at company events.\n\nOn the cover is the word “Quality,” with the letter Q created by the image of a globe and a check mark, and the phrase, “Do Whatever It Takes.” Inside are images, including a roaring lion and what appears to be a footprint left on the moon, and themes to promote the quality ideal.\n\n“Quality represents the starting point and is woven into the fabric of everything we make and do. … There is no finish line,” according to one passage.\n\nChampine, who grew up in St. Clair Shores, is a 23-year company veteran with an engineering background who previously served as head of Electrified Powertrain Programs in North America.\n\n“I have tremendous respect for the position I have. It is a very difficult seat. It is a seat that can have a big impact on the quality of our vehicles,” said Champine, who oversees quality for one of the automaker’s four regions. He reports to Richard Schwarzwald, who was named to the top global quality post in October and sits on the company’s Group Executive Council, a key decision-making body.\n\nNot a cozy chair\n\nThe impact of a negative Consumer Reports survey spelled the end of one former FCA quality chief’s tenure when Doug Betts left in 2014. Betts has since taken a key role at J.D. Power.\n\n“I wouldn’t necessarily call it a hot seat,” Champine said of his own position. “I also don’t want to call it uncomfortable. But it’s not a cozy, comfortable chair, let’s put it that way.”\n\nIn brand rankings released by Consumer Reports in February, all but one of the FCA brands listed were near the bottom, with Fiat coming up dead last (Cadillac, GMC, Mitsubishi, Land Rover and Jaguar were also in this group). The publication noted that Chrysler, which ranked highest among FCA brands, had actually tied Tesla for the brands that had dropped the most from the previous year. Two FCA models out of six total — the Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger — even lost their recommendations from Consumer Reports this year. The other models no longer being recommended are the Tesla Model 3, Acura RDX, BMW 5 Series and Volkswagen Tiguan.\n\nJ.D. Power’s 2019 U.S. Vehicle Dependability Study, which reviews 3-year-old models, listed no FCA brands above the industry average, although it did note that Chrysler was the most improved brand and two models — the Dodge Challenger and Chrysler Town & Country — led their segments.\n\nFCA’s crosstown Detroit rivals Ford and General Motors are certainly not immune from problems. Ford and Lincoln were both below the industry average in the J.D. Power dependability study.\n\nGM dominated Consumer Reports’ 2019 list of least reliable vehicles with five entries — the Cadillac CTS, CT6 and Escalade and Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD and Buick Enclave, compared with no vehicles for Ford and only one FCA product, the Alfa Romeo Giulia.\n\nJake Fisher, senior director of auto testing for Consumer Reports, said quality has been a long-standing issue for FCA.\n\n“For several years now, we’re seeing the quality of those vehicles … has not been very good. There’s been some bright spots from Ford, bright spots from GM. We haven’t seen that from FCA,” Fisher said.\n\nStyling over reliability?\n\nHe attributed some of the potential differences with other automakers to the company’s focus.\n\n“A company like Chrysler, their focus is about maybe newer technology and exciting styling and vehicles that might excite you,” he said, noting that the company was an early adopter of the 9-speed automatic transmission, technology that was initially problematic, even leading to a lawsuit over rough shifting.\n\nWhile there might be good reason to try new things, Fisher noted that other automakers appear to be more hesitant to \"push the envelope\" for fear of damaging their reputation.\n\nChampine said the introduction of the 9-speed transmission developed from a need to update the transmission portfolio when FCA was formed. The company worked with German supplier ZF following what he described as a successful partnership on the company’s 8-speed transmission.\n\n“That design (in the 9-speed) did not have the … product stability that the 8-speed had, and we had some learning to deal with the innovation that’s in that transmission that took time,” Champine said, noting that those issues have since been stabilized.\n\nChampine did note that FCA's suppliers have suppliers, and the company has found issues at times in some of the components sent to the main suppliers. But those entities, he said, also supply other manufacturers.\n\n\"It would be hard to think that we’re the only ones that are getting those issues,” Champine said.\n\nMore than just quality\n\nVehicle owner satisfaction, of course, goes beyond just reliability. Tesla owners are “very satisfied” even though every model is below average in reliability, Consumer Reports' Fisher said.\n\n“As long as people go in with eyes wide open, they may get a vehicle they’re happy with,” Fisher said, “No Camrys can give you the V8 rumble that a Dodge Charger will.”\n\nAt J.D. Power, Dave Sargent, vice president of global automotive, takes a more optimistic view of FCA’s prospects.\n\n“We have seen some pretty good improvement over the last few years,” Sargent said, describing the trend for FCA as strong. It’s an area that Champine sought to highlight when he met with the Free Press, showing a chart from J.D. Power’s 2018 Initial Quality Study, which measures problems with new vehicles in the first months of ownership.\n\nThat survey showed FCA just behind Toyota in a chart ranking automakers by number of problems per 100 vehicles. While FCA (and, perhaps surprisingly, Toyota) were just below the industry average in this survey, FCA was ahead of companies such as Mazda, Volkswagen, Honda and even Subaru.\n\nOn another chart, Champine pointed to the company’s improvements on the Initial Quality Study since 2015. That survey showed FCA at 132 problems per vehicle compared with the industry average of 112. By 2018, the numbers had gotten much closer, with FCA at 96, the industry average at 93 and the top group at 87.\n\n”When we look at a 3-year-old vehicle,” Champine said, referencing the J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study, “we haven’t been where we need to be, but the rate of improvement we’ve made relative to the rate of improvement in the industry has been consistently better for the past few years. We’re doing everything we can to close this gap and get into that top quartile position.”\n\nMore:As Detroit readies for Fiat Chrysler expansion, fate of Mount Elliott facility unclear\n\nMore:Fiat Chrysler to recall more than 860,000 vehicles in new emissions probe, EPA says\n\nSargent noted that although FCA has performed below average in surveys of quality and dependability, the company’s vehicles do well in other areas, such as appeal and performance and that, for the most part, people really like their products.\n\nHe also echoed comments by Consumer Reports’ Fisher that consumers gravitate toward different vehicles for many reasons, and that reliability is only one measurement of satisfaction.\n\n“The absence of problems is not how most people want to live their lives,” he said.\n\nJulian Gatti, who lives in Detroit’s Midtown area but hails from Clinton Township, has his eye on FCA’s Alfa Romeo Giulia sedan and Stelvio SUV. The 20-year-old would love to see the Giulia in green and he can wax poetic about his preferred interior materials in the Italian sedan.\n\nAlthough Gatti drives a 2014 Chevrolet Malibu, a succession of close relatives has owned FCA products, and he sees some positives there, too, including in a still-running 2004 Chrysler Sebring with almost 200,000 miles.\n\nGatti’s view on quality is expansive.\n\n“I think the Italian mark of quality is found in design and performance, rather than reliability. My Italian heart beats to that pace. So if I bought an Alfa Romeo and wound up in the shop a few more times than expected, it would be an authentic experience,” Gatti said.\n\nVehicles have gotten better\n\nSeveral industry experts noted that the lenses used to measure quality and dependability have changed over the years, and vehicles themselves have gotten better overall.\n\nJohn McElroy, who hosts \"Autoline,\" noted that J.D. Power has put more focus on issues of connectivity and user experience in recent years.\n\n“If you look at the reliability of cars, it’s pretty good today,” McElroy said, noting that Honda and Ford both suffered in the surveys at one point because of infotainment or radio-related issues.\n\nFCA \"would not be having the sales success they have had for years right now if there were genuine problems with their cars,” McElroy said.\n\nMcElroy offered a few suggestions for how a company such as FCA can improve quality-related metrics: providing a more even cadence of product introductions and having the head of quality report to the company’s chairman, rather than just the CEO.\n\n“Unless you put that level of importance on it and you clearly empower that executive, you’re probably not going to get big results,” McElroy said.\n\nVisnic, the editorial director of SAE, noted that “if you’ve acquired a reputation over decades for having subpar quality, then it probably does say something about what your corporate priorities are.”\n\nDon Sherman, a Hagerty magazine contributor and longtime automotive freelance writer, noted that FCA tends to play to its strengths, an attitude reflected in its early decision to focus on SUVs and trucks over cars.\n\n“It costs a lot of effort to score highly on Consumer Reports, particularly against the Japanese or Koreans, and they don’t put the investment in to do that,” Sherman said of FCA. “I think they’re just focusing their resources on what works.”\n\nContact Eric D.

The Tyre Collective has created a wheel-mounted device that collects the tiny particles on electrostatically charged copper plates.\n\n“For years we’ve been so focused on tailpipe emissions, but we’re starting to look at other sources of pollution,” says Siobhan Anderson, chief scientific officer and co-founder of The Tyre Collective. “We all know that tires wear down, but no one ever really thinks about where that material goes – and it’s going into our air and water.”\n\nAnderson hopes The Tyre Collective’s patented device, which won a James Dyson Award in 2020, will tackle this pollution at its source.\n\nWhere the rubber meets the road\n\nThe Tyre Collective began as a student project in 2020, while the four founders were pursuing master’s degrees in Innovation Design Engineering, run jointly by Imperial College London and the Royal College of Art. With a background in biology, Anderson says she has always had an interest in the environment and microplastics, and that’s how she came across the little-known problem of tire dust.\n\nNon-exhaust emissions, which include tire, brake and road surface wear, account for 90% of all particulate emissions from vehicles. The microplastics from tire dust contribute to dangerous PM2.5 pollution – particles that are so small they can be inhaled and cause respiratory health issues.\n\nTo visualize the scale of the problem, the group calculated how much tire dust a single London bus produces each day, and found it was equivalent to the size of a grapefruit.\n\nNext the team had to work out how to stop bits of tire flying onto the road and into the air.\n\n“We were trying out a bunch of different methods to collect it, from vacuuming to using sticky materials,” says Anderson. She says they had a “lightbulb moment” when they realized the particles have an electrostatic charge.\n\nThe team visualized the problem by calculating the amount of tire dust produced by London buses, conventional cars and electric vehicles. The Tyre Collective\n\nIn the same way that rubbing a balloon on a jumper picks up fluff, The Tyre Collective’s device, which is powered by the car’s alternator, uses a copper plate to create an electric field that attracts the tire dust. “Then, we’re able to clean off the plates and put it into a storage canister,” says Anderson.\n\nThe team built a prototype to prove the core technology, which had its first road test last year in collaboration with automotive company Geely Auto Group, enabling the group to adapt and improve it for the real-world environment, says Anderson.\n\nA growing problem\n\nThe push to reduce particulate emissions is even more important as the world transitions to electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nResearch from Emissions Analytics shows that particulate mass emissions from tire wear is thousands of times greater than those from tailpipes, which have been vastly reduced in recent years by high-efficiency exhaust filters.\n\nSo while electric vehicles cut carbon emissions, they are still contributing to the growing problem of non-exhaust emissions, says Lisa Erdle, director of research and innovation for The 5 Gyres Institute, which researches plastic pollution in the seas.\n\nThe Tyre Collective's device had its first road test last year. The Tyre Collective\n\nIn general, electric vehicles are heavier than equivalent conventional cars, so “so this is not a problem that is going to go away,” says Erdle.\n\nA report from the OECD highlights that heavier EVs emit more PM2.5 particles than conventional cars, while lighter EVs emit slightly less – so as more EVs hit the road, non-exhaust emissions are expected to increase 52.4% by 2030.\n\n“If this issue goes unchecked, we’ll see an accumulation of tire dust in the environment,” says Erdle, adding that the toxic chemicals in tires are negatively impacting wildlife, the environment and human health. While there isn’t one “silver bullet,” Erdle says a suite of measures, including toxic chemical bans or material redesigns, could help. Tire companies are aware of this issue and interested in innovating, but need pressure from consumers or legislation to push them into action, she adds.\n\nAnderson says that the rubber captured could be upcycled into new products, including tires. The Tyre Collective\n\nThe automotive industry has been receptive to The Tyre Collective’s device, says Anderson. After last year’s road tests, the company was able to show car and tire manufacturers that the device was “real and working,” she says.\n\n“We’ve received a lot of interest to do the next stage of pilots,” says Anderson.\n\nReinventing the wheel\n\nThe Tyre Collective is currently conducting a three-month trial with Zhero, a London-based company offering low-emission and sustainable logistics services.\n\n“When we realized that there was a device in development that could help reduce and collect those emissions, we knew we wanted to be a part of that process,” says Ollie King, cofounder of Zhero, adding that he hopes it will improve human health nationwide and, eventually, globally.\n\nAnderson says the trial will help the team gather more data about the device’s efficiency. In the lab, it captures around 60% of airborne particles, so the team are currently exploring ways to fine-tune the electrostatics, device placement on the car, and the airflow.\n\nThe canisters will be emptied monthly by technicians at garages. Anderson says the team is also looking into options for upcycling the small rubber particles into new tires, shoe soles, or rubber panels.\n\nThe Tyre Collective are now testing the device in collaboration with Zhero, a London-based logistics company. Leroy Ah-Ben / CNN\n\nThe Tyre Collective hopes to soft-launch its product in 2024, and says it will focus its efforts on retrofitting large fleet vehicles and delivery vans, which have a regular maintenance schedule making it easier to integrate, clean and monitor the tech, says Anderson.\n\nUltimately, Anderson hopes that all cars will be automatically fitted with a device like theirs before they hit the road.\n\n“What we’re talking about here is a global scale problem. And it’s going to require everyone to be aware of that and also contribute to implementing the solution.”", "authors": ["Story Rebecca Cairns", "Video Dan Tham"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/01/08/government-shutdown-2019-effects-nhtsa-car-safety-investigations-hold/2511563002/", "title": "Feds won't investigate most vehicle defects during government ...", "text": "Federal workers must go without pay, national parks are a mess, and now vehicle safety investigations are on hold.\n\nThe agency responsible for investigating defects in the nation's cars, trucks and SUVs does not plan to do so during the government shutdown.

Functions funded by the Highway Trust Fund will continue, while those funded by annual appropriations will be suspended, including safety defect investigations, field crash investigations, review of consumer complaints and notification of new vehicle and equipment recalls,\" according to a statement from the agency.\n\nMore:Ford recalls nearly 1 million vehicles for risk of shrapnel from exploding Takata airbags\n\nMore:Why Audi suddenly has a shortage of luxury cars in the US\n\nMore:Ford's new police SUV hits 137 mph, and it will save taxpayers millions\n\nThe agency said it \"may recall furloughed employees if NHTSA becomes aware of information concerning suspended functions that involve imminent threats to the safety of human life or protection of property.\"\n\nThat assurance is not sitting well with safety advocates.\n\nJoan Claybrook, who ran NHTSA in the Carter administration and later was president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said suspending defect investigations and the review of complaints coming in from manufacturers and consumers means that people are not being alerted about possible dangers being reported at this time.\n\n“That’s one issue, the danger to the public,” she said.\n\nShe also noted that while investigations can take years, that important work isn’t happening and a long suspension can postpone needed action.\n\n“It means that even though these investigations take time, it’s going to be delayed even more,” she said. “If it’s a serious, serious hazard, that repair is going to be made much later.” She added, however, that the auto companies could still take the initiative and “alert the public themselves” of potential defects.\n\nJason Levine, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Auto Safety, questioned the administration's priorities.\n\n“If there’s any question as to whether this unnecessary shutdown has a direct impact on the safety of America’s roads, just look to the Trump Department of Transportation decision that enforcing vehicle safety standards is not necessary for the safety of life and preservation of property,\" Levine said.\n\nHe said the suspension of such investigations is indicative of a wider attitude.\n\n\"With over 37,000 traffic crash deaths and millions of related emergency room visits and vehicle crashes every year, the administration’s cavalier attitude towards safety during the shutdown sadly is in line with the leadership of NHTSA lacking the will to open inspections into cars catching on fire or forcing industry to accelerate the completion of the millions of unrepaired recalled Takata airbags. At least under normal operations, career public servants are allowed to try and do their jobs at a safety agency,” Levine said, referencing fires reported in Hyundai and Kia vehicles.\n\nIn December, NHTSA had 13 active defect investigations, including upper steering column separations in 2008-13 Toyota Highlanders, power steering failures in 2010 Ford Fusions and spontaneous sunroof breakage in 2011-13 Kia Sorentos. Based on the response from NHTSA, it would appear those investigations are suspended.\n\nThe Free Press has requested an update on NHTSA's review of the so-called Jeep \"Death Wobble,\" where drivers report a violent shaking in the steering column after hitting a bump, but that would likely also be on hold.\n\nVehicle defects can describe a wide range of problems, from the mundane to the serious. Issues such as exploding Takata air bags — one of NHTSA's open investigations in December — and the General Motors ignition switch scandal have been blamed for scores of fatalities and injuries around the world.\n\n\"The safety and security of all Americans is a priority for this president which is exactly why he is committed to securing the border and ending this crisis,\" the White House said in a statement. \"The Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have procedures in place to recall furloughed employees if they become aware of information concerning suspended functions that involve imminent threats to the safety of human life or protection of property.\"\n\nContact Eric D.

It's coming alive Sunday with a parade and the annual Corktown Races and will remain in a festive mood through March 17 — which falls on a Friday this year!\n\nCorktown, home to some of Detroit's earliest Irish immigrants, has traditions that date back 150 years. Some of them are revived every year at this time when bars and pubs in the neighborhood showcase bands and singer-songwriters who perform traditional Irish folk music on guitars, harmonicas, banjos and fiddles.\n\nSinger-songwriter John Freeman (guitarist for local Irish-folk rock outfit the Codgers) grew up near Corktown and recalls going to see his uncle perform with Charlie Taylor at Saint Andrew's Hall as a kid. “You didn’t have to travel across the pond to understand those tunes about Belfast and Dublin neighborhoods,” he says.\n\nAs you cruise down Michigan Avenue west of downtown, you’ll find several Irish bars and taverns worth a visit for St. Paddy’s Day, including PJ's Lager House, McShane’s Irish Pub and the Gaelic League of Detroit. Also nearby are Nancy Whiskey Pub, just north of I-75 on Harrison, and Donovan's Pub, just a stone’s throw down Vernor Highway.\n\nFreeman laments the “bad rap” that St. Paddy’s Day gets because of its reputation for “drunken debauchery.” He says that he and his bandmates have discovered that in Detroit, the holiday really is about “reconnecting with good friends.”\n\nHere's a look at where you can take in some culture and listen to an Irish ballad or jig during celebrations Sunday and next Friday, the 17th.\n\nSUNDAY\n\nStone Clover and Bill Grogan’s Goat\n\nYou can start rocking early Sunday with \"paddy slag\" stylists Stone Clover and Celtic rockers Bill Grogan's Goat at PJ's Lager House, which will come alive a few hours before the parade begins. Both of the Detroit bands enliven traditional Irish and Celtic folk songs with a shot of punk rock. Their stage energy alone can keep you fueled for a full day of partying. Stone Clover will kick things off and play until 1:30 p.m.. Bill Grogan’s Goat takes over just after 2 p.m. 10:30 a.m.-5 p.m., PJ’s Lager House, 1254 Michigan Ave. 313-961-4668. pjslagerhouse.com.

None of them is Celtic, but all are proven crowd-pleasers. The Muggs are savvy blues-rock vets, while Nina & the Buffalo Riders are up-and-coming youngsters who specialize in a swirl of '60s psychedelia , '70s folk and contemporary rock. The music starts just after noon. Closing things out, starting at 3:30 p.m., will be the versatile blues-funk-rock-almost-anything outfit known as the Reefermen.

It’s a fuller appreciation of what these artists are about, and what inspired them to get into the studio and create.”\n\n\"SiriusXM Celebrates Black History Month\" will also include dedicated programming across the existing urban channel lineup and on Pandora, the streaming service acquired by SiriusXM in 2019. New wake-up music segments on Pandora’s Black Music Forever station will include guests such as Robert Glasper, Deon Cole and Kirk Franklin.\n\n“In February, the spotlight shines a little brighter on this history,” said Summers. “This is American history, and it extends through multiple genres. We’re a multifaceted culture, and I’m thankful the month of February is time the spotlight shines on us and the significant contribution we’ve had.”\n\nTracey Jordan, SiriusXM’s senior director of talent relations, was well-positioned to spearhead the interviews and other content that will supplement the music on the new channels. In a lengthy music industry career, she worked closely with Franklin and Motown Records while making connections with a host of figures in both circles.\n\nMore:'High School Musical' star Monique Coleman says Taylor wore headbands because crew styled Black hair 'poorly'\n\nLooking for books about racism? Experts suggest these must-read titles for adults and kids\n\nThat included time as publicist for Berry Gordy Jr., and a similar role with Franklin during their years at Arista Records in the 1980s.\n\nJordan recalls her first professional meeting with Franklin, on the set of the “Jumpin’ Jack Flash” video shoot at Detroit’s United Sound studio in 1986 It was an all-star affair that featured Whoopi Goldberg, the Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards and Ron Wood, and the Queen of Soul sporting an eye-catching zebra-striped catsuit.\n\n“You always got that up-and-down look when she first met you: ‘Who are you, what’s your intention, are you on the up-and-up?’” Jordan recounts.\n\nThe young PR representative was quickly dispatched to buy several coats for Franklin’s consideration, she said, and the star wound up selecting a leather motorcycle jacket to wear in the video. The two formed a bond that endured through the decades.\n\nJordan spent long stretches working out of Franklin’s Bloomfield Hills house, overseeing photo shoots, interviews and other duties for a star who was famously homebound by her fear of flying.\n\nIn summer 2018, aware that the ailing Franklin was in the final weeks of her life, Jordan and SiriusXM began quietly gathering material for a Queen of Soul channel that would ultimately run for several weeks after her Aug. 16 death. That effort also segued into the planning for Franklin’s funeral two weeks later, where Jordan helped arrange the guest and performer lineup for the nine-hour, globally broadcast event.\n\nFor the Aretha channel’s latest run, Jordan expects a lineup that includes heavy hitters such as the Rev. Al Sharpton, Clive Davis and Herbie Hancock, along with an array of Franklin family members sharing behind-the-scenes anecdotes.\n\n“I really wanted the stories you wouldn’t normally hear, from the people who knew and loved her best,” Jordan says.\n\nThe Motown Channel will include guest spots from the Temptations’ Otis Williams, the Four Tops’ Duke Fakir, Miracles’ Claudette Robinson, Martha Reeves and Valerie Simpson. Mary Wilson will be part of a virtual town hall celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Supremes, to air the weekend of Feb. 26.\n\n“I’m so blessed to have had the experience working with these iconic legends,” said Jordan. “I’ve been having a blast rounding up stuff people have never heard before.”\n\nMore:Aretha Franklin, Toni Morrison, more to enter Women's Hall of Fame\n\nSiriusXM specialty channels, Black History Month 2021\n\nAll are available on the SiriusXM app Monday through March 2.\n\nThe Motown Channel: Feb. 1-7\n\nThe Aretha Franklin Channel: Feb. 15-21\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience Channel: Feb. 8-14\n\nMiles Davis Radio: Feb. 22-28", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2019/05/02/patti-fred-sonic-smiths-st-clair-shores-house-sale/3640081002/", "title": "Patti Smith, 'Sonic' Smith's former St. Clair Shores house for sale", "text": "It's the home where Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee Patti Smith and her Detroit guitarist husband, Fred \"Sonic\" Smith, wrote the \"Dream of Life\" album.\n\nIt's the Tudor-style house on a canal off of Lake St. Clair where the musicians' two children were raised, and where a secret passage leads to an area that may have been used for alcohol running during Prohibition.\n\nAnd it could be yours.\n\nOpen house\n\nThe Smiths' former St. Clair Shores house hit the market Monday with a selling price of $499,000. An open house is scheduled from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe two-story house is at 22501 Beach St., just north of 10 Mile. The 2,116-square-foot \"Storybook\" home, as described by the Realtor, sits on a canal and is a very short distance from Lake St. Clair.\n\nSeveral stories in Patti Smith's memoir, \"M Train,\" released in 2015, took place at the house.\n\nWho's selling it?\n\nNone other than the Smiths' son, Jackson Smith, who lived in the house until he was \"13 turning 14.\"\n\nJackson Smith said his parents bought the home, which was built in 1918, in 1980.

The 2011 release spent 111 weeks on the Billboard Top 200 album chart and its hit single “Sail” scored nearly 6 million in sales while becoming the second-longest charting song on Billboard’s all-genre Hot 100 singles chart.\n\nBut despite the success, Bruno feared he was being doubted when he went to work on the recently released Awolnation follow-up album, “Run.”\n\n“I’ve always worked best when I’ve had sort of an imaginary or sometimes real enemy, almost,” Bruno said in a recent phone interview. “I kind of knew that there were going to be a lot of people who didn’t think I could possibly repeat the same kind of success. So that was a fun little chip on my shoulder that I got to tap into.\n\n“There are plenty of critics that overlooked the first record,” he added. “They didn’t know that it even happened. Then all of a sudden ‘Sail’ was this massive success, so, of course, they were going to want to hate on me and say, ‘OK, this guy can’t do this again.’ ”\n\nBruno used the negativity as a reason to challenge himself musically. He believed he could avoid a sophomore slump and also push his music well beyond the template created for “Megalithic Symphony,” an alternative rock project that incorporated elements of electro-pop.\n\n“I think the success of the first record gave me a lot of confidence that people could relate to what a lot of people probably thought was insane in the first record,” Bruno said. “So it gave me artistic freedom to push myself even further after seeing what really translated and reacted live and obviously commercially as well. (It) certainly gave me a newfound confidence to make the sophomore freak-out record that I’ve always wanted to make. In fact, I’ve been looking forward to having this opportunity my whole career, but it just never happened. When this opportunity presented itself, I was very ready to do it. It was difficult, but a wonderful challenge that I took head-on, and I’m extremely proud.”\n\nAs Bruno’s last comment suggests, he’s not exactly a newcomer to the music business. In a career that stretches back 15 years, he has been a key member of two major label bands — Home Town Hero and Under the Influence of Giants — that seemed positioned to make a big splash on the music scene.\n\nIt didn’t happen. Home Town Hero, which was signed to the Warner Bros.-affiliated Maverick Records (owned by Madonna), had some modest success with its 2002 self-titled debut, but broke up soon before the release of its second album, 2004’s “Bitch City.”\n\nBruno and Hometown Hero band mate Drew Stewart then formed Under the Influence of Giants and landed a deal with Island Records, but the group’s 2006 self-titled debut album stiffed and the band ended. Bruno began developing the Awolnation sound not long after the demise of Under the Influence of Giants and got signed by Red Bull Records. Soon after that, he went to work in earnest on “Megalithic Symphony,” which was released in March 2011.\n\nThe music Bruno created on “Run” (he writes, plays and produces all the music on the album) retains the keyboard and electronics-based sound of “Megalithic Symphony,” but “Run” is more involved and quirkier musically than the debut, and several of its songs expand the musical range Bruno showed on “Megalithic Symphony.” The new album starts off with a curveball in the title track, a moody, deliberately paced tune that mixes piano and strings with a repeating synthesizer coda before turning heavier and more foreboding. “Drinking Lightening” mixes a dirge-ish sound with Brian Wilson-esque harmonies and moments of pop brightness.\n\nThe taste of punchy rock that first surfaced on the “Megalithic Symphony” song “Kill Your Heroes” gets pushed even further on the songs “Dreamers” and “Hollow Moon” (Bad Wolf).” That latter track, with its big beat and huge synthesizer riff, topped Billboard’s alternative singles chart and reached No. 4 on the rock airplay chart. At the same time, a few songs such as the acoustic-centric “Headrest for My Soul” and “Holy Roller” show more of a gentle, intimate dimension.\n\nBruno said he and his four-piece backing band are giving the music a different feel live as they begin touring behind “Run.”\n\n“It’s much heavier and dirtier. It’s just really good,” Bruno said of the live sound. “I didn’t know how it was going to go. But rather than trying to make it sound like the record onstage, we’re trying to make it sound better and more brutal and dirtier and more interactive — and more human. When you make a record, it’s just a time capsule of where you are at that time. Hopefully, you get better at playing these songs live, all along keeping in mind that I don’t want to alienate our fans and flip out a song so much that it’s not even familiar to them. I tried to keep what are my favorite elements of the song, the most important parts, and then add new as well.”\n\nAwolnation\n\n7 p.m. Thu.\n\nFillmore Detroit\n\n2115 Woodward, Detroit\n\n313-961-5450\n\n$35", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/03/17/detroit-artist-marcus-glenn-drunk-driving/81927536/", "title": "Artist Marcus Glenn faces trial in fatal car crash", "text": "Lori Higgins\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nProminent Detroit artist Marcus Glenn has been ordered to stand trial on a felony drunken driving charge in connection with a February car crash that killed a passenger in his car.\n\nGlenn, 48, is scheduled to be arraigned March 31 in Wayne County Circuit Court on a charge of charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, causing death.

Getting crystal meth into the Smithsonian kind of trumps astronaut ice cream. But he still can’t believe it’s actually happened. “If you had told me there’d be crystal meth in the same museum as the Star-Spangled Banner, Thomas Edison’s light bulb, Abraham Lincoln’s pocket watch and Dorothy’s ruby slippers, I’d have told you you were using too much of Walter White’s product.”\n\nTwo baggies of that product — his signature baby-blue, highly potent (but fake) crystal methamphetamine — are part of the “Breaking Bad” exhibit, scheduled to open in 2018.\n\nSongwriter Toussaint saluted\n\nMick Jagger and Robbie Robertson are paying tribute to the late Allen Toussaint, the New Orleans musician who wrote “Southern Nights,” “Lady Marmalade” and many other hits.\n\n“He was such an influential songwriter and performer,” Jagger tweeted Wednesday.

With guitarist Adam Jones and bassist Justin Chancellor up front, they wove a set of intense prog-metal whose precise interlocking parts often swelled to epic levels.\n\nThe band's new material was well represented, as songs such as “Invincible” and show-opener “Fear Inoculum” unfolded with the power of vintage Tool, edging closer and closer like menacing musical glaciers before breaking the tension with cathartic crescendos. “Chocolate Chip Trip” followed a late intermission to give Carey a dazzling, polyrhythmic showcase that let him show off the chops that have sealed his place on metal’s all-time-best list.\n\n“Anema” was anthemic; “The Pot” channeled a molten groove; “Vicarious” cut with jagged edges; and “Parabol”-“Parabola” showed off the band’s way around intricately structured, multipart works. While Saturday was foremost a listening experience, there was a potent visual element to go with it, including arresting laser arrays on numbers like “Pneuma” and scenes from the band’s dark, trippy classic videos.\n\nThe sound was reliably loud but exquisitely mixed, making it easy to absorb the complex and finely tuned interplay among the four players as the show moved through its two hours and 15 minutes.\n\nThere was little chatter onstage, though Keenan did take a moment early in the night to nod to his roots.\n\n“Hello, Michigan — behind Arizona, the second-best state in the continental United States,” said the 55-year-old singer, a longtime Arizona resident who spent his formative young-adult years in western Michigan.\n\nWhile the enigmatic band has loosened up of late — its catalog finally hit streaming platforms in August — Tool still grasps the enduring power of mystique. The show’s opening stretch was performed behind a gauzy stringed curtain ringing the stage, and Keenan delivered his howling vocals often cloaked in shadows at back.\n\nA strict photo-video policy was also in force. (While media outlets were invited to photograph the opening song, the Free Press declined because of usage and rights restrictions.) As signs and announcements at LCA made clear, fans were barred from using their mobile devices, under threat of ejection.\n\nBut as the concert arrived at its closing number, the 1996 hit “Stinkfist,” Keenan at last offered an olive branch.\n\n“Security, stand down!” the singer announced with dramatic flair. Fans were now allowed to “play with” their cell phones and such, he declared — “even though it’s kind of annoying.”\n\nContact Detroit Free Press music writer Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/10"}]}

But they barely scratch the surface of the rich, silty soil that enabled Memphis to become \"the Hardwood Capital of America,\" to cite just one of the city's nicknames.\n\nIn other words, this is not a definitive Memphis timeline. With a few exceptions, it ignores music and sports (which will be celebrated by this newspaper later in the year with their own bicentennial tributes). You will have complaints about omissions. But we hope you will enjoy or appreciate the inclusions.\n\nSo, here it is — a Memphis 200 for a Bluff City Bicentennial.\n\n1. May 22, 1819: Modern Memphis is founded by planter and judge John Overton, Revolutionary War officer James Winchester and future president Andrew Jackson, a year after the federal government purchased the territory from the Chickasaw Nation in negotiations partly led by Jackson. Planned as a grid of streets along the river, the city is named for a former great river town, the ancient capital of Egypt.\n\n2. Progress was slow. \"From its founding in 1819 until about 1840, Memphis was a primitive and pestilential little mudhole striving to survive as a town.\" — John E. Harkins, \"Metropolis of the American Nile,\" 1982.\n\n3. The city's founding came 270 years after the first Memphis-area encounter between American Indians and Europeans, led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Both France and Spain would build forts on the \"Chickasaw bluffs\" in the 18th century.\n\n4. Memphis' first grand jury indictment arrives in 1820, when Patrick Meagher is charged with two counts of assault and battery after indulging in too much \"fire water\" and brawling with bartenders. His fine: $2.\n\n5. 1826: Encouraged by Memphis Mayor Marcus Winchester, Davy Crockett is elected to the U.S House of Representatives, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District — the seat (with very different boundaries) later held by Harold Ford and Steve Cohen.\n\n6. Memphis' oldest noise ordinance, from 1827, prohibits \"whooping, halloo-ing and swearing loudly,\" punishable by a $5 fine — or $10, if the offense occurs on a Sunday.\n\n7. In Memphis, traffic problems predate automobiles: An 1837 law makes driving a horse-drawn conveyance \"faster than a trot\" punishable by a $10 fine.\n\n8. April 21, 1841: Henry Van Pelt publishes the first issue of The Appeal. The paper later merges or buys out the Monitor, the Western Mercury and the Avalanche; in 1894, it is renamed The Commercial Appeal.\n\n9. 1848: Free public school opens.\n\n10. 1851: Nathan Bedford Forrest moves to Memphis and opens a slave trading company, one of a dozen in the city during the decade.\n\n11. March 15, 1851: Memphians pay an astronomical $20 per ticket to see Jenny Lind, the so-called \"Swedish Nightingale,\" perform at Odd Fellows Hall. Her manager for the tour: P.T. Barnum.\n\n12. 1852: Construction of St. Peter's Catholic Church begins.\n\n13. 1853: The first synagogue in Tennessee, B'nai Israel, is established by Jewish German immigrants. In 1943 it adopts its current name: Temple Israel.\n\n14. July 15, 1853: Elmwood Cemetery opens for business, so to speak, when the late Mrs. R.B. Berry is laid to rest as its first occupant. The 75,000 interred since then have included slaves, suffragists, yellow fever victims and author Shelby Foote.\n\n15. \"May God bless Memphis, the noblest city on the face of the earth.” — Mark Twain, in an 1858 letter to his sister, after visiting the Memphis hospital where his brother Henry was taken after a steamboat explosion that took \"hundreds of lives.\"\n\n16. June 6, 1862: The Mississippi River churns as Union gunboats defeat Confederate naval forces at the first Battle of Memphis.\n\n17. Also June 6, 1862: To avoid \"Yankee\" takeover, the presses and plates of the pro-Confederacy newspaper, The Appeal, are loaded into a boxcar and moved to Grenada, Mississippi, where the newspaper resumes publication. Keeping one step ahead of Union confiscators, The Appeal later journeys to Jackson, Mississippi; Meridian, Mississippi; Atlanta; Montgomery, Alabama; and Columbus, Georgia.\n\n18. Aug. 21, 1864: Nathan Bedford Forrest's troops raid the Union-occupied city but ultimately withdraw; this incursion becomes known as the second Battle of Memphis.\n\n19. Bright kid, promising future: In 1865, 18-year-old Thomas Edison works as a telegraph operator in Memphis.\n\n20. April 27, 1865: The greatest maritime disaster in U.S. history occurs on the Mississippi River at Memphis when the boilers of the overloaded Sultana explode. Close to 1,800 of the 2,400 people aboard the 260-foot wooden steamboat are killed or drowned (about 50 more than will be lost in the sinking of the Titanic). The boat's legal capacity was 376.\n\n21. Forty-six black people and two white people are killed when white civilians and police officers rampage through black neighborhoods for two days of mob violence, May 1-3, 1866. The event becomes known as the \"Memphis Massacre.\"\n\n22. 1869: The foundation stone is laid for Beale Street Baptist Church (also known as First Baptist Church — Beale Street), a congregation organized by freed slaves.\n\n23. The city's oldest degree-granting collegiate institution, Christian Brothers University, is established in 1871 (as Christian Brothers College) by members of a Catholic congregation founded by France's St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, the patron saint for \"teachers of youth.\"\n\n24. 1875: Walter Burke Sr. opens the original Burke's Book Store at 180 N Main. Now located at 936 Cooper, the store has remained independent and Memphis-owned ever since.\n\n25. Jan. 15, 1877, becomes known as \"The Day It Rained Snakes.\" According to newspaper reports that inspired an investigation by Scientific American, a \"torrential downpour\" left behind great numbers of snakes in the area of Vance and Lauderdale. The Monthly Weather Review reported the snakes were dark brown or black and \"very thick in some places, being tangled together like a mass of thread or yarn.\" Whether the reptiles were driven from subterranean hiding places or deposited on the Bluff City via some sort of storm-driven snakenado remains a mystery.\n\n26. Aug. 13, 1878: Restaurant owner Kate Bionda becomes the city's first recorded victim of yellow fever, having contracted the disease from a man who had escaped a quarantined steamboat.

Wells moves to Memphis in 1882 at the age of 20. A few years later, she launches her anti-lynching campaign through her newspaper, the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight.\n\n28. Wells makes an international reputation: \"Miss Ida B. Wells is a negress, a young lady of little more than twenty years of age, a graceful, sweet-faced, intelligent, courageous girl. She hails from Memphis, Tenn. She is not going back there just now, because the white people are anxious to hang her up by the neck in the market place, and burn the soles of her feet, and gouge her beautiful dark eyes out with red-hot irons.'' — The London Sun, 1894.\n\n29. An estimated 50 men, women and children, are killed on March 30, 1882, when a broken lantern causes a fire aboard the steamer Golden City, as the boat is about to dock.

On Oct. 15, 1887, Grover Cleveland becomes the first president to visit Memphis while in office. Thousands lined the streets (and were infiltrated by gangs of pickpockets, according to The Commercial Appeal), but the joy gives way to shock when a prominent local citizen, Judge Henry T. Ellett, grandly introduces the 24th president of the United States and then promptly drops dead on stage. The newspaper calls it “one of the saddest incidents that ever characterized a gala occasion,\" and offers this recounting: \"Judge Ellett was placed upon the platform, his shoes removed, and all that mortal effort and medical science could suggest applied to bring resuscitation. It was useless, his spirit had fled.\"\n\n32. A Memphis community designed expressly for black residents, Orange Mound — named for the area's many Osage orange trees — begins to be developed in 1890, on former plantation property.

In about 1901, Natch the black bear — who over a century later would be weirdly reimagined as NBA mascot Grizz’s chief romantic rival — is put on display in Overton Park, stoking the public interest that results in the April 1906 founding of the Memphis Zoo. Natch, who lived chained to a tree, is poisoned by a bruincidal maniac in 1906; his head is removed, stuffed and put on display at the zoo, but reportedly is petted and hugged so often by the Natch-loving public that it literally falls to pieces.\n\n38. Prohibition advocate Carrie Nation, notorious for attacking bars and taverns with her signature hatchet, makes the rounds of several Memphis saloons on Oct. 23, 1902.

It is 8 mph.\n\n43. Edward Hull Crump is elected mayor of Memphis in 1909.

May 8, 1925: Immortalized as \"a very worthy Negro\" on an obelisk in the park that bears his name, 39-year-old levee worker Tom Lee — who could not swim — makes four trips in his small skiff, the Zev, to rescue 32 of the 72 people in danger of drowning in the swift currents of the Mississippi after the 1925 sinking of the M.E. Norman, a steamboat. Lee's effort remains Memphis' most famous act of heroism.\n\n52. \"The Mississippi Delta begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel,\" journalist David Cohn wrote in 1935.

Binford is appointed head of the Memphis Censor Board; he reigns as America's most inflexible, eccentric and subjective censor until 1955, banning movies with Charlie Chaplin (\"a London guttersnipe\") and Ingrid Bergman (due to her \"notorious adultery\"), and penning the types of condemnations that transformed the targets of his ire into instant must-sees. Banning David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1947, Binford wrote: \"It is sadism at its deepest level. It is the fleshpots of Pharaoh, modernized and filled to overflowing. It is a barbaric symphony of passion and hatred, spilling from a blood-tinted screen. It is mental and physical putrefaction.\"\n\n57. Aviator Charles Lindbergh, 25, visits Memphis in October 1927, some five months after his solo flight across the Atlantic makes him one of the world's most celebrated men.

Hoffman on March 20, 1930, issues a report declaring Memphis the murder capital of America, based on the 1929 homicide rate. Memphians object, pointing out that Chicago, for example, had hosted the \"St. Valentine's Day Massacre\" that same year.\n\n63. 1932: Duck decoys placed in the ornate Italian marble fountain of The Peabody prove so popular that the hotel institutes a tradition of live ducks in the lobby.

A decade after TV came to New York, it arrives in Memphis when WMC — then co-owned by The Commercial Appeal — signs on the air on Dec. 11, 1948. After an hour of test patterns, dedications, political proclamations and backstage tours, the \"entertainment\" programming begins with Santa Claus, live on the air, reading letters from kids.

A mere satellite compared to the nuclear furnace of Sun, Cordell Jackson's Moon Records label in 1956 releases Jackson's double-sided holiday single, \"Rock and Roll Christmas,\" backed by \"Beboppers' Christmas.\" The latter song contains perhaps the most memorable introduction of St. Nick since Clement Moore's: \"He had white fuzz all over his chin/ He came boppin' up and said, 'Give me some skin.'\"\n\n78. Reviewing Elvis' acting debut in \"Love Me Tender\" in 1956, an unimpressed Time magazine critic wrote: \"Is it a sausage? It is certainly smooth and damp-looking, but who ever heard of a 172-pound sausage, 6 feet tall? Is it a Walt Disney goldfish? It has the same sort of big, soft beautiful eyes and curly lashes, but who ever heard of a goldfish with sideburns?\"\n\n79. Known for his black outfits, Bogart sneer and prowess with a bullwhip, movie cowboy Lash LaRue is arrested for buying and concealing stolen property — sewing machines — in connection with car thefts that occur while he is a \"Wild West\" performer at the 1956 Mid-South Fair. Acquitted of the charges, LaRue returns to Memphis frequently in the 1970s and '80s as a guest of the nostalgia-oriented Memphis Film Festival.

A prime example of 1950s Polynesian exotica, the Luau restaurant opens at 3135 Poplar in February 1959.

Its striking modern design by Memphis architect Roy Harrover now partially obscured by an ugly parking garage, the current Memphis International Airport terminal opens on June 7, 1963.\n\n88.

A beloved and seemingly ubiquitous harbinger of summer from the 1960s through the mid-1970s, the Memphis-born circular ice-cream delivery vehicle known as the \"Merrymobile\" roams the streets at a puttering 15 mph, making it easy prey for loose change-wielding, popsicle-craving urchins. During its late-1960s heyday, the Merrymobile company operates dozens of the iconic vehicles, which — with their striped canopy roofs — resemble circus tents or fairground carousels on wheels.\n\n90.

Opening night movies include \"The Glass Bottom Boat,\" with Doris Day, and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini.\"\n\n97. 1967: Inspired by Oakland's Black Panthers, young Memphis militants organize a \"black power\" group called the Invaders.

About a dozen Memphis and Shelby County library titles — including \"Valley of the Dolls,\" \"Myra Breckenridge\" and \"Portnoy's Complaint\" — are placed off limits to readers under 18 in the summer of 1969 after Mayor Henry Loeb attended a library board meeting and \"shooed all women out of the room and read aloud passages he had underlined in red ink\" from \"Portnoy,\" according to The Commercial Appeal.

In what comes to be regarded as a revolutionary moment in the history of photography, an exhibit of color work by William Eggleston goes on display on May 24, 1976, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, establishing the Memphis photographer as arguably the Bluff City's most influential artist outside the realm of music.\n\n125. Nov. 23, 1976: A pistol-toting and inebriated Jerry Lee Lewis is arrested after pulling up to the gates of Graceland in a new Lincoln Continental and demanding to see Elvis.

Hooks of Memphis becomes national executive director of the NAACP.\n\n127. Jan. 15, 1977: Three months after hitting No. 1 with his novelty dance hit \"Disco Duck,\" Memphis deejay Rick Dees — recording as \"Rick Dees and His Cast of Idiots\" — releases a follow-up single, \"Dis-Gorilla.\" Even an appearance on \"The Brady Bunch Hour\" that finds Dees introduced by the kids from \"What's Happening!!\" and performing in front of a pair of swinging King Kong arms couldn't lift the song above No. 56 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\n128. The Memphis in May International Festival is organized in 1977. The first \"honored country\" is Japan.\n\n129. Out of office less than five months, former president Gerald Ford sinks a hole-in-one during the June 1977 pro-am portion of the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic golf tournament at Colonial Country Club.

Hundreds of National Guardsmen are assigned to Memphis in the summer of 1978 after police officers and firefighters go on strike. On July 1, 1,400 firefighters walk off the job; that same day, 45 fires occur in four hours, inspiring a front-page editorial in The Commercial Appeal: \"The rash of vandalism and harassment that accompanied the strike is contrary to the public image of Memphis firemen. It comes as an ugly shock.\" The next month, police also go on strike.\n\n134. 1979: Adrian Rogers, senior pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church, is elected to the first of the three terms he will serve as president of the Southern Baptist Convention. A charismatic and telegenic preacher, Rogers is a leader in the denomination's \"conservative resurgence,\" which emphasizes a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible.\n\n135.

Organized by a coalition of bar owners, restaurateurs and devotees of blarney that calls itself \"Irish Eyes of Memphis,\" the St. Patrick's Day \"pub crawl\" reaches its bacchanalian height (or depth) in 1982, when an estimated 50,000 revelers stagger from Main Street to Overton Square in search of green-dyed beer. Legal fees and other complications eventually reduce the event to its current manageable form, a parade on Beale.\n\n146. 1982: The Mud Island river park opens to the public, complete with concert amphitheater and monorail transportation between the park and the \"mainland.\" Its most impressive aspect may be its \"Riverwalk,\" a scale reproduction of the 954 miles of the lower Mississippi River, with \"every sandbar, oxbow, and topographic contour faithfully reproduced in cement,\" according to Roadside America. Starting at \"Cairo, Illinois,\" the Riverwalk ends at a \"Gulf of Mexico\" that for several embarrassing years was rebranded as a Budweiser-sponsored water park named \"Bud Boogie Beach.\"\n\n147. When the New York Metropolitan Opera brings a touring performance of \"Macbeth\" that features a topless witch to the Auditorium North Hall on May 10, 1983, a group calling itself MASH — Memphians Against Social Harassment — stage a \"strip-in\" to protest the unequal enforcement of the city's anti-nudity ordinance.

The ordinance later is declared unconstitutional.\n\n148. \"Memphis — A Diamond in the Bluff'\" is the winning entry in a 1983 contest to pick a slogan for Memphis, sponsored by The Commercial Appeal and the Rotary Club.

Jan. 7, 1984: Restored to its former glory, The Orpheum — Main Street's historic \"palace\" of a theater — reopens with a public \"Champagne and Gershwin\" party. A harbinger of Downtown's revival, the theater was built in 1928, on the site of the Grand Opera House, which had burned to the ground in 1923.\n\n152. The bizarre and \"epic\" (in the characterization of The Commercial Appeal) Georgian Hills Day Care child sex abuse scandal dominates much of the news from 1984 to 1988 and results in the indictments of four adult workers in connection with the alleged molestations of at least 19 children. Eventually, all charges are dropped and the one conviction overturned, due in part to the implausibility of much of the testimony of the child witnesses (one boy said child victims were \"baptized to the devil\"). The investigation is now regarded as a textbook case of 1980s \"satanic panic.\"\n\n153. Sept. 5, 1986: In a predecessor to the current \"Mighty Lights\" display, the \"M\"-shaped structure of the Hernando de Soto Bridge (still referred to as \"the new bridge,\" if you're old) is illuminated with 200 sodium lights, following a fundraising campaign by fashion designer Pat Kerr Tigrett and developer Henry Turley.\n\n154. \"After we moved to Memphis, I don't recall Mother's ever once saying: 'A gentleman must always' do so and so. Or: 'A lady will never' do so and so ... The old delicate balance between her wild nature and her strict Presbyterian, genteel upbringing was gone in Memphis ... When we were all in the doldrums, she more than once said: 'I sometimes think a shooting in the family would have been better than a move to Memphis.'\" — Peter Taylor, \"A Summons to Memphis,\" which wins the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987.\n\n155. 1988: Michael Hooks becomes the first black candidate elected to countywide office when he wins the race for assessor.\n\n156. 1989: Self-promoting promoter Sidney Shlenker makes a deal to take over Mud Island, announcing plans to convert the river park to a $100 million entertainment complex called \"Rakapolis,\" a name intended to suggest ancient Egypt and modern rock 'n' roll. Rakapolis was to come complete with a huge crystal sphinx, a \"time machine\" ride and a re-created Egyptian village. Shlenker — who already had the contract to manage the then-under-construction Pyramid arena — predicts 3 million visitors a year. For some reason, people believe him. Eventually, local government has to sue to regain control of the attractions.\n\n157. Commodities trader Charles D. McVean invests about $8 million into the development of a new type of \"horse\" racing: indoor Hackney pony races with remote-controlled robots for jockeys, the reins attached to the robots' tiny metal arms. \"You put 10,000 people in here with a six-pack of beer apiece, and then by God you've got something!\" McVean told the Wall Street Journal, during a test run at the Fairgrounds in 1989. The state Racing Commission rejects the idea.\n\n158. Memphians are all shook up when the news media hypes \"self-proclaimed climatologist\" Dr. Iben Browning's prediction that a major earthquake will rock the New Madrid Fault on Dec. 3, 1990. When the much-feared date arrives, Memphis fails to shake, rattle, or even roll, at least tectonically.\n\n159. Writing in his book \"Rythm Oil\" in 1991, Stanley Booth sticks up for the Bluff City when confronted by skeptics: \"I told them that in this century, Memphis, Tennessee, had changed the lives of more people than any other city in the world. I used, I regret to report, the phrase 'cultural influence' ... I never had a chance to tell them that, like it or not, they had shopped at supermarkets, eaten at drive-in restaurants, slept in Holiday Inns, and heard the blues because people in Memphis had found ways to convert these things into groceries.\"\n\n160. July 4, 1991: Constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the National Civil Rights Museum is dedicated.

Herenton is elected mayor, defeating incumbent Dick Hackett by 172 votes out of about 250,000 cast. (Proving joke candidates can make a difference, Robert \"Prince Mongo\" Hodges, who claimed to be a resident of a planet named Zambodia, received 2,921 votes.) The city's first elected black mayor, Herenton will be elected to five terms; he resigns in 2009 to pursue an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\n162. Memphis' distinctive Pyramid arena opens with a concert on Nov. 9, 1991. The headliners? The mother-and-daughter country act, the Judds.\n\n163. On Nov. 16, 1991, patrons burst like scalded cats from the doors of the Madison Avenue punk club, the Antenna, when shock rocker GG Allin lived up to his reputation and began flinging his own feces into the crowd. The cover charge: $5.\n\n164. \"They left Chickasaw Gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown, into the fading sun ... The warm, sticky, humid Memphis summer air settled in with the dark. Softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and lime-green and fluorescent-yellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle. Cars full of teenagers crowded into fast-food joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex.\" — John Grisham, \"The Firm,\" 1991.\n\n165. Lionel Linder, 60, editor of The Commercial Appeal since 1988, is killed in a 1992 New Year's Eve accident on Union Avenue when a drunk driver plows into his car. Linder spearheaded the campaign to bring President George H.W. Bush to Memphis in 1989 for an event on the newspaper's lawn, where Bush designated The CA as the first \"Point of Light\" in a program honoring the nation's volunteers.\n\n166. \"In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists of all time,\" wrote critic Leonard Feather. He was Phineas Newborn Jr., whose classic albums include \"A World of Piano!\" (1961) and \"The Newborn Touch\" (1964). He is found dead of natural causes at his Memphis home on May 26, 1989, at the age of 57.\n\n167. 1992: \"Several visitors to a zoo exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Live!' asked for refunds after discovering that dinosaurs ceased to roam the Earth 65 million years ago,\" the newspaper reports, in a story about zoo patrons who expected to find real live dinosaurs when they attended an exhibit that actually featured motorized mechanical replica dinosaurs. \"People have watched too much Fred Flintstone,\" says zoo vice president Ann Ball.\n\n168. Artist Carroll Cloar, 79, who had been suffering from cancer, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 10, 1993.

Feb. 11, 1994: Memphians wake to the warzone-like cracks of explosive timber after the region is blanketed by a devastating ice storm that snaps trees — at least one person is killed by a falling limb — and cuts power to close to 425,000 MLGW customers, some of whom are without electricity for 17 days.\n\n170. On April 7, 1994, the crew of a Federal Express DC10 flight leaving Memphis overpowers a hammer-wielding company employee and safely lands the plane after a hijacking-suicide attempt by Auburn Calloway, 42, a pilot facing termination for falsifying his job application.

On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University becomes the University of Memphis — the fifth name change since its founding in 1912 as the West Tennessee Normal School.\n\n172. Longtime WHBQ-TV kiddie-show host and toy store impresario Harold \"Happy Hal\" Miller, 74, dies on Nov. 28, 1997. From the 1950s to 1973, Miller was Memphis' answer to \"Captain Kangaroo\"; his hand-puppet sidekick was the blue-hued and taxonomically indeterminate \"Lil' Bow,\" described by Miller in a 1988 interview as a bow-tie-wearing \"cross between a mouse and a chipmunk-type thing.\"\n\n173. In 1998, University of Memphis student Kelly Chandler hangs a sheet on the wall of The Edge coffee shop in Cooper-Young and hosts a group of local filmmakers, who project their work on the sheet.

Downtown's gem of a baseball diamond, AutoZone Park, opens on April 1, 2000, with an exhibition game between the Memphis Redbirds and the St. Louis Cardinals.

During Elvis Week 2002, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, then at the height of his leonine majesty, sits atop the base of a large upwardly tilted silver \"rocket\" ship during the Elvis Beale Street parade. The suggestion that this man is the literal father of rock 'n' roll is hard to miss.\n\n179. Nicknamed \"Hurricane Elvis,\" the most damaging wind storm in Memphis history strikes on July 22, 2003, toppling trees and telephone poles, cutting service to 340,000 homes and businesses, and introducing Memphians to the term \"derecho,\" which refers to a type of devastating straight-line wind.\n\n180. After some five years of planning, the $250 million FedExForum opens to the public with a Sept. 6, 2004, \"open house.\"\n\n181.

A movie about a North Memphis hustler who \"dares to dream the pimpossible dream\" (to quote Time magazine), Craig Brewer's future Oscar-winner \"Hustle & Flow\" has its Memphis premiere at the now vanished Muvico Peabody Place 22 on July 6, 2005. Police report that some 6,000 \"well-behaved\" fans crowd the red carpet to see such celebrities as Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson; producer John Singleton; members of Three 6 Mafia; Brewer (“resplendent” in a Girbaud denim suit, gold Versace sunglasses, straw cowboy hat and a 3-carat diamond ring that had belonged to Sam Phillips); and — incongruously — martial-arts star Steven Seagal.\n\n183. In a spectacular blast that attracts hundreds of spectators, the 50-year-old Baptist Memorial Hospital on Union Avenue — where Elvis was declared dead, among other historic happenstances — is razed at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005, by the controlled detonations of 600 pounds of explosives placed on six of the building's 21 stories.\n\n184. March 5, 2006: Thirty-four years after Stax legend Isaac Hayes earned an Oscar in the same category for \"Theme from Shaft,\" Memphis hip-hop artists Jordan Houston (Juicy J), Paul Beauregard (DJ Paul) and Cedric Coleman (Frayser Boy) win the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp,\" their contribution to writer-director Craig Brewer's made-in-Memphis \"Hustle & Flow.\"\n\n185. Graceland is known for celebrity visitors, but on July 1, 2006, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visits Elvis' home in the company of President George W.

An off-course manatee appears on Oct. 24, 2006, in Wolf River Harbor, some 720 miles north of its usual coastal habitat.

April 9, 2011: Funeral services are held for former University of Memphis basketball player and coach Larry Finch, 60, arguably the most significant sports figure in local history.

May 23, 2015: The Memphis in May Sunset Symphony ends its 39-year annual run at Tom Lee Park. The event was perhaps best known for its 17 years of “Ol' Man River,” the \"Showboat\" tune that was a centerpiece of the symphony until the 1998 retirement of James Hyter, the sonorous-voiced singer who each year led thousands of riverside revelers in multiple singalong encores.\n\n194. In association with nationwide actions organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the police killings of black civilians, almost a thousand protesters shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River for close to four hours on July 10, 2016.\n\n195. Statues of Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederate president Jefferson Davis are removed from city parks on Dec. 20, 2017, following some political sleight of hand in which the city outfoxes statue advocates in the state legislature by selling the two parks to nonprofit Memphis Greenspace for $1,000 each.\n\n196.

They were identified as Glenn Edward Bennett, 84, a customer who was shot in front of the store, and Safeway employee Donald Ray Surrett Jr., 66, who fought the shooter in the produce section, Miller said.\n\n“This is the Safeway employee who engaged with the shooter, which is to say he attempted to disarm the shooter and attacked this person, and we believe he prevented further deaths in addition to the quick police response,” Miller said. “Mr. Surrett acted heroically during this terrible incident.”\n\nGov. Kate Brown released a statement on Facebook Monday honoring Surrett.\n\n“While we are still gathering the facts about last night’s shooting, it’s clear that far more people could have been killed if not for the heroism of Donald Ray Surrett, Jr., who intervened to help stop the shooter, and the officers who entered while shots were still being fired,” Brown’s statement said. “In the face of senseless violence, they acted with selfless bravery. Their courage saved lives.”\n\nThe gunman – identified by police as Ethan Blair Miller, 20 – was found dead at the scene and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the police spokeswoman said.\n\nPolice found an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun close to Miller’s body, according to Bend Police Chief Mike Krantz.\n\nThe shooting unfolded shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday at a shopping center, Krantz said. Police initially received reports there may have been more than one shooter, Sheila Miller said, but there is no evidence of a second shooter. There were reports of at least two other people who had injuries that were not life threatening, as well, she said.\n\nThe motive remains unclear, but police are aware of online posts that might be relevant, Sheila Miller said.\n\n“We are aware that the shooter may have posted information online regarding his plan. We are investigating this. We have no evidence of previous threats or prior knowledge of the shooter. We received information about the shooter’s writings after the incident had taken place and the shooter has no criminal history in the area,” Miller said.\n\nSafeway said in a statement the company was saddened by the “senseless violence.”\n\n“Our thoughts and actions now are directed toward supporting our associates, customers, and the community affected by this tragedy. We thank the officers at the Bend Police Department for their response and will continue to support the department’s investigation over the coming days,” the company’s statement said.\n\nSunday’s shooting follows a spate of other grocery store shootings across the country in the past year and amid an overall surge in “active shooter” incidents, according to an FBI report.\n\nIn May, 10 people were killed in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack in Buffalo, New York. A “hero” security guard and a beloved teacher were among those gunned down.\n\nIn March, another 10 people were gunned down at a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. A veteran police officer with seven children was among those killed.\n\nLast September, a gunman shot 15 people – including one fatally – at a Kroger in Collierville, Tennessee. Some people hid in freezers to survive.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nMiller said police received multiple calls of shots fired around 7 p.m. at the Forum shopping center in northeast Bend.\n\nThe gunman entered from an apartment complex behind the shopping center, Miller said. He moved through the parking lot while firing rounds from an AR-15-style rifle before entering the Safeway.\n\nOnce inside, he shot a customer – Glenn Edward Bennett – who died while being taken to the hospital, Miller said.\n\nEmergency personnel respond to a shooting at the Forum shopping center in east Bend, Oregon, Sunday, August 28, 2022. Ryan Brennecke/The Bulletin/AP\n\nThe gunman continued to make his way through the store before having an altercation with and fatally shooting Donald Ray Surrett Jr., Miller said.\n\n“As our officers responded, they entered Safeway while shots were still being fired. They found the apparent shooter dead inside Safeway,” Miller said.\n\nAn AR-15 and shotgun were found near the gunman’s body, Miller said. Bend police did not fire any shots, she said.\n\nHow the gunman obtained firearms is under investigation. Because of online postings, Bend police also contacted the Oregon State Police Bomb Squad, who cleared the grocery store and the apartment complex, Miller said.\n\nPolice said it’s unclear how many people were in the store at the time of the shooting.\n\nOfficers were on scene within three minutes of the first 911 call, Miller said. It took four minutes from the time officers were dispatched to the time the shooter’s body was found, police said.\n\nPlans appeared to be posted online\n\nA search warrant was served on the gunman’s vehicle and home, Miller said. Investigators found three Molotov cocktails in his car along with a sawed-off shotgun. Police are working with the ATF to learn if the firearms were legal.\n\nIn his apartment, authorities found additional ammunition and digital devices that are currently being reviewed.\n\nCNN has identified several blog entries appearing to belong to Ethan Miller which were published on the blogging site “Wattpad” detailing a plan and reasons for the shooting. The posts were made public on the evening of August 28 by an anonymous account and viewable for 12 hours, according to Wattpad. The posts have since been removed.\n\nThe first blog entry was headlined June 29 and signed with the name Ethan. The writer of the post blamed Covid-19 and quarantine for worsening their mental health.\n\nInitially, this person planned a shooting inside a high school on September 8, according to the posts.\n\nMore than 35 posts were made by this same account on the blogging site. Most of the posts indicated a desire to commit violence.\n\nOne post referenced being “partially inspired” by the Columbine High School shooting.\n\nIn other posts signed with the name Ethan, several reasons were cited for the writer turning into a “ticking time bomb,” which included their family and their love life, which was detailed in a post headlined July 8.\n\nThe writer mentioned buying a shotgun and an AR-15 for the shooting, and said they hoped to kill over 40 people.\n\nThroughout the posts, other mass shootings were also referenced.\n\n“I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’”\n\nCustomers and employees described a chaotic scene at Safeway, saying they scrambled for safety as bullets flew.\n\nJosh Caba told CNN affiliate KTVZ he and his four children were shopping in the store when the shots broke out.\n\n“We started heading to the front. Then we heard I don’t know how many shots out front – six or seven. I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’ People were screaming. … it was a horrifying experience,” Caba told KTVZ.\n\nCaba said he was worried about his wife, who stayed in the car because she wasn’t feeling well. But as he and three of his children fled through exit doors by the produce department, he found that his wife had driven to the back of the store and was “sitting in the car, saying ‘Get in the car! Get in the car!’” KTVZ reported.\n\nThe father was able to rush back into the store and find their fourth child, he told KTVZ.\n\nAn employee who identified himself only as Robert told the Central Oregon Daily News that he and other employees were working a closing shift in the deli when they heard loud gunfire.\n\n“Me and three other employees ran into a walk-in refrigerator and closed the door and stayed there and stayed hidden until authorities arrived,” he said.\n\nA third person was struck and was in good condition at St. Charles Medical Center, spokesperson Lisa Goodman said.\n\nResidents in the central Oregon city were stunned by the shooting.\n\n“I heard anywhere from five to eight shots. I thought it sounded like backfire,” Heather Thompson, who lives across the street, told Central Oregon Daily News.\n\n“Less than a minute later, there were 10 to 20 shots, and then another 10 to 20 shots,” she said. “And by that time, I went inside and told my dad to get away from the window. And people were running out of Safeway.”\n\nClarification: This story has been updated to clarify when the Wattpad posts were made public.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Tina Burnside Caroll Alvarado Hannah Sarisohn", "Amir Vera", "Tina Burnside", "Caroll Alvarado", "Hannah Sarisohn"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-best-reads/2018/12/23/miracle-baby-found-roadside-one-arizonas-great-mysteries-new-clues-solve-hatbox-baby-sharon-elliott/2403545002/", "title": "'Hatbox Baby' found on roadside is one of Arizona's great mysteries", "text": "Dec. 25, 1931:\n\nThe fates collaborated late yesterday afternoon, and as the result a baby girl abandoned on the desert 10 miles west of Superior had been given a temporary home in a Mesa maternity hospital while seven families of that valley city had offered permanent havens.\n\nTire trouble of a homeward-bound Phoenix motorist, the restlessness of the motorists wife and the muffled cries that broke the desert’s usual vast stillness combined to save the tiny tot just as the approaching dusk heralded another anniversary of the Christ Child’s nativity.\n\nWithout a clue as to thebabe’s identity, peace officers throughout central Arizona were wondering last night who her parents might be, where they are now, and why the wee tot was left 150 feet from the highway in the cacti-studded wastes on the uplands beyond Florence Junction…\n\n—The Arizona Republic\n\n◆ A day earlier, Dec. 24, 1931\n\nIt was Christmas Eve and the sun was starting to go down in the desert. Ed and Julia Stewart were making their way home to Mesa on Highway 180, two lanes of oiled gravel that wound through the heart of Central Arizona's copper country.\n\nThe young couple had been on a day-long outing with Julia’s twin teenage cousins. They’d driven up the rugged Apache Trail, spent time in the tiny town of Roosevelt, then driven back through the mining towns of Miami and Globe.\n\nThey had about 40 miles to go when their car broke down seven miles west of Superior.\n\nWhile Ed worked on the car, Julia, all of 18, wandered into the chill of the desert stillness, hoping to keep warm.\n\nThe stars overhead reminded her of a Christmas card, but her attention was drawn to the ground, where she noticed something odd: a black pasteboard hatbox sitting on the rocky ground near a greasewood bush about 150 feet from the road.\n\nShe called her husband over to open it.\n\nInside the hatbox, wrapped in a blue blanket, was a newborn baby girl.\n\nThey heated some water from a thermos and fed it to the red-haired waif with a spoon.\n\nBack home in Mesa, they turned the baby over to the constable. He placed her in the care of a doctor’s wife, who ran a maternity home.\n\nBy the next day, it was all over the newspapers and radio, the find heralded as a Christmas miracle. People brought the baby gifts — a locket, a gold bracelet — and they knelt at her cradle to pray.\n\nThey named her Marian, a variation of Mary, the mother of the Christ child.\n\nIt was the depths of the Great Depression. Maybe she was a sign that better days were ahead.\n\nLawmen from three counties tried to find baby’s mother, but they never did. Two months after her miraculous discovery, Baby Marian was adopted by a Phoenix couple and seemingly never heard from again.\n\nA journey begins\n\n“Hello, city desk?”\n\nIt started with a phone call and a simple question.\n\n“Have you ever heard of the Hatbox Baby?” the woman asked.\n\nI was a cocky assistant city editor at a spunky suburban paper called the Mesa Tribune. I prided myself not only on knowing a good story when I saw one, but how to tell it.\n\nAt 28 years old, I didn’t know how much I didn’t know.\n\nThe call came in a few weeks before Christmas, 1988. Back in those days, all the calls came into a central line on the city desk. It was before the Internet, when people would call newspapers with questions about everything under the sun, whether it was to settle a sports trivia bar bet (the distance between home plate and second base is 127 feet, 4 inches) or to find out the name of Calvin Coolidge’s dog (Rob Roy) for their kid’s research paper that was due the next day.\n\nYes, I had heard of the Hatbox Baby, I told the caller. It was an old Mesa mystery dating from the 1930s. I'd learned about the case from Walter Zipf, the Trib’s elder-statesman columnist, who was still banging out three columns a week at age 85 on an old manual typewriter.\n\n“Why do you ask?” I said.\n\n“I’m her,” the woman replied.\n\n“Excuse me?”\n\n“I’m her. I’m the Hatbox Baby.”\n\nIn years of answering the phone on the city desk I’d had my share of cranks and crackpots. But they usually phoned at night, and most of the time they sounded drunk or crazy or both.\n\nThis was early in the afternoon, and aside from saying she was the solution to the Mesa equivalent of the Lindbergh baby, she sounded perfectly normal, with a lilting, almost sing-song voice.\n\n“What makes you think you’re the Hatbox Baby?” I asked.\n\nAnd that is when Sharon Elliott proceeded to tell me a story that she — and I — would tell over and over again for the next 30 years.\n\n◆ ◆ ◆\n\nIt is a Christmas story, not so much about hope and joy, but more about love, heartbreak and longing.\n\nIt is also a cautionary tale about secrets, and what happens when those secrets are revealed.\n\nMost of all it is a story about family, and what it means to different people.\n\nFor some, family means the clan they were born to, the people whose DNA and physical traits they share.\n\nFor others, family means the people who raised them and instilled the values they hold dear.\n\nFor many of us, those people are one and the same.\n\nFor Sharon Elliott, and virtually everyone who is connected to this story, family is not that simple. In fact, it’s complicated, messy and sometimes cruel.\n\nFor most of her life, Sharon believed she knew what a family was, and more importantly, who her family was.\n\nShe grew up in Southern California with a mother, a stepfather and a stepbrother. She married, had a daughter of her own and divorced.\n\nShe roller-skated as a child, led cheers at Inglewood High as a teen and worked at an aerospace company as an adult.\n\nBut when she was 55, her notion of family was turned upside down.\n\nFaith Morrow, the woman Sharon had always known as her mother, had carried a secret for those 55 years, and as she neared the end of her life she decided to unburden her soul.\n\nShe told Sharon she was adopted. More than that, that she was the center of a mystery that had made headlines across the country in 1931 after a couple from Mesa reported to the authorities that they’d found a newborn baby stuffed into a hatbox near an Arizona highway where their car broke down on Christmas Eve.\n\nThat baby, Faith said, was Sharon.\n\nFaith would die six months later. Her burden was now her daughter's.\n\nFor the next 30 years, Sharon would wonder who her real family was and why they would abandon her in the desert to die when she was just seven days old.\n\nIf that’s really what happened.\n\nSharon would find answers to some of her questions, in unexpected places, at unexpected times. She and one living relative would learn about each other, astonished to find the connection. But there would remain a mystery she would spend her life trying to solve.\n\n◆ How one phone call changed two lives\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. Before a story can end, it first must begin.\n\nAnd this story begins with that day in 1988 when I made an appointment with Sharon to visit her tidy apartment in a sprawling Mesa complex she called home, a home filled with knick-knacks and Christmas decorations and pictures of her grandchildren.\n\nI examined the trove of yellowed newspaper clippings, letters and documents that her dying mother had given her. I interviewed Sharon at length and listened to her story. It was enough to convince me that Sharon Elliott was who she said she was. She was the Hatbox Baby.\n\nThe story I wrote ran on Christmas Day. It was picked up by the wire services and ran in newspapers across the country, just like the original Hatbox Baby story in 1931.\n\nA friend of a private investigator named Alice Syman read a version of it in the Los Angeles Times and sent Syman a copy, suggesting she take on Sharon’s case.\n\nSyman often did work for the Arizona branch of an organization called Orphan Voyage, which was dedicated to helping adoptees find their birth parents.\n\nShe did take on the case, and through her connections, the story of the Hatbox Baby made it to the producers of the television show \"Unsolved Mysteries.\" The show's retelling aired and was one of their most popular episodes ever. It can still be seen on video streaming services today.\n\nAfter the episode, thousands of tips poured in, and Syman tried to run each one of them to ground.\n\nDozens of them involved people whose family lore included siblings who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Others were sure that Sharon was the illicit child of red-headed movie star Ann Sheridan or silent-film cowboy actor Tom Mix, who died in Arizona in 1940. One person even insisted that Sharon was the sister of the Lindbergh baby.\n\nNone of the clues seemed to pan out, but that initial search gave Sharon some perspective — and comfort.\n\nDuring her quest, Sharon would meet one of the men who investigated her case. He was 95 and remembered everything about that Christmas Eve night when Ed and Julia Stewart showed up at the Mesa police station with the baby in the hatbox and an improbable tale about how they found her.\n\nShe would also learn that \"Sharon\" was not the first, or even the second, name she was given.\n\nAnd she would learn that Faith Morrow had secrets of her own long before the Hatbox Baby.\n\n◆ ◆ ◆\n\nAs Sharon gracefully transitioned from middle age to an elderly woman, she kept the strawberry blonde traces in her hair, and she never lost the twinkle in her blue eyes.\n\nShe relished the attention every time a story about her would appear on television or the newspaper, and she would beam when I would tell her nurses that their patient was a celebrity.\n\nAs I accompanied Sharon for much of her 30-year journey, I hoped that someday I would be the one to solve the Hatbox Baby mystery story. But as I got to know Sharon better, I began to get a better sense of the hole her mother's revelation had bored into her life. I no longer wanted to solve the case for me, but for her.\n\nAs time passed and technology advanced, I was able to track down sources, documents and newspaper stories online. I even got Sharon to take a DNA test. We found no close matches.\n\nTime can also be so cruel. Much of Sharon's generation, certainly anyone with first-hand knowledge of her case, is gone, and a year and a half ago Sharon fell and broke her hip.\n\nI began to resign myself to the idea that despite the DNA test, Sharon might never know whether Ed and Julia Stewart’s Christmas Eve tale was fact or fiction.\n\nIn July 2017, I made that confession onstage in front of 300 people who had packed into the Phoenix Little Theater to hear me and five of my colleagues tell stories about our craft as part of an Arizona Storytellers program.\n\nAs the house lights came up and the storytellers mingled with the audience, a woman approached me. She said her name was Bonnie and that she was an amateur DNA genealogist. She offered to look at Sharon’s DNA results to see if there were clues I’d missed.\n\nWith nothing left to lose, I said why not?\n\nUsing the same kits that millions of Americans are giving each other as gifts this holiday season (last year Ancestry.com sold 1.6 million kits on Black Friday weekend alone), Bonnie Belza would painstakingly piece together the puzzle of Sharon’s forebears.\n\nThrough Bonnie’s efforts, Sharon would learn that she had a brother she never knew. And she would be introduced to a great niece named Emily, who, like Sharon, had been adopted as an infant and was searching for answers of her own.\n\nBoth of their journeys would lead to secrets buried beneath secrets. Some of those secrets would eventually lead both women to their respective birth parents. And along the way, they found that elusive sense of family in each other.\n\nA mother unburdens her soul\n\nMy 30-year journey with Sharon Elliott started with a phone call.\n\nSharon Elliot's personal quest for answers to the Hatbox Baby mystery started the same way.\n\nIn the summer of 1986, two and a half years before I first heard her voice, Sharon was working as an administrative assistant for a Southern California aerospace company called Rubbertech, not far from where she grew up, in Inglewood, Calif., in a middle-class home with her mother, stepfather and stepbrother.\n\nWhen her phone rang at work that day, it was her mother, Faith Morrow, calling from Arizona.\n\n“We have to talk,” she told Sharon.\n\nSharon asked what was wrong, but Faith insisted that she didn’t want to talk about it on the phone. She just wanted Sharon to come soon.\n\nSharon and her mother were always close. Faith had been married to Sharon's stepfather for 40 years, but after he died in 1979, Faith moved to Cottonwood, a small town near the Arizona territorial capital of Prescott, where she had lived and worked in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nNot long after she arrived in Cottonwood, Faith was diagnosed with breast cancer. There were complications. The radiation had burned the lining of her heart, and she had fallen and broken a hip.\n\nSharon's daughter and grandchildren had just moved to Mesa, and Sharon was contemplating retiring and moving herself to be near them.\n\nWhen Faith called Sharon and asked her to come see her, Sharon feared the worst, so she flew to Phoenix, rented a car and drove to her mother’s home.\n\nFaith had recently gone to court to obtain long-buried legal records to help her prepare for the news she had to tell her daughter. Many years later, I would petition a judge in Pinal County to unseal those very same records again.\n\nOn that day in 1986, Faith asked Sharon to sit down and handed her a large manila envelope.\n\nShe told Sharon there was something she’d kept hidden from her. Sharon pulled a handful of brittle, yellowed newspaper clippings from the envelope and began to leaf through them.\n\n“Find Abandoned Babe In Hatbox on desert,” one of them said. “Desert Baby Still Enigma” another one said. “Court To Rule in Baby Case,” read a third.\n\nThe headlines told the story of a newborn found alive in a hatbox in the desert on Christmas Eve by a couple whose car broke down in the exact spot in the middle of nowhere where the baby had been abandoned.\n\nBut they didn’t make any sense to Sharon. She looked at the court papers and began to get an uneasy feeling.\n\n“It’s you, Sharon,” her mother finally said. “You’re that baby.”\n\nIt was at that moment that Sharon’s notion of family as she had known it began to unravel. It was at that moment, at age 55, that Sharon learned for the first time that she was adopted.\n\nNot only was she adopted, but she had been abandoned as a newborn, stuffed in a hatbox and found in the desert, a discovery that became a national news story.\n\nSharon struggled to understand as Faith told her how she was listening to the radio on Christmas Day of 1931 and heard the story about the miraculous “Hatbox Baby.”\n\nNews of the baby spread quickly.\n\nThe story was on the front page of The Arizona Republic on Christmas morning, and later that day the Phoenix Gazette bannered it across the top of the page with a lurid, screaming headline.\n\nThe reaction was immediate. It was two years into the Great Depression, and people were desperate to find something good to hold on to. Townsfolk in Mesa brought gifts for the baby to the home of Helen Dana, a nurse and midwife whom the authorities called upon to care for the child.\n\nDana named the baby Marian, a variation of Mary, the mother of the Christ child whose birth was being celebrated that day.\n\nAt the time, Faith was married to a man named Henry Stieg, a young grocery chain executive, and they lived in a home on a citrus lot on East McDowell Road, just past the Phoenix city limits. They were both in their 20s, and it was the second marriage for each of them.\n\nBoth would go on to lead complicated lives without each other, but at this moment they wanted children. Faith had been unable to carry a baby to term, but now the answer to their prayers was right before them on Christmas Day. They left their turkey in the oven and rushed to Mesa to put their names on an already growing list of couples who wanted to adopt the foundling.\n\nBefore the baby could be declared abandoned and given a new home, there would have to be an investigation.\n\nThe young couple who found the baby, Ed and Julia Stewart, said they had made a day trip along the Apache Trail with Julia’s two teenage cousins and their car broke down seven miles west of Superior. That is where they said they found the hatbox.\n\nThey took the child to Joe B. Maier, who had recently been elected Mesa’s constable. Maier, the Kansas-born son of a German immigrant, lived with his wife, two daughters and his mother-in-law, and, according to news reports at the time, was the only one on duty at the police station that Christmas Eve.\n\nToday, Mesa is a city of more than 450,000 people, bigger than Cincinnati, Des Moines and Pittsburgh, and an almost indistinguishable mixture of red-tiled roofs in the sprawling Phoenix metro area.\n\nIn 1931, though, it was a sleepy square-mile Mormon farm town, miles from the nearest community. With a population of just 3,000, it was the kind of place where pretty much everybody knew pretty much everybody else.\n\nMaier’s family had come to Mesa when Arizona was still a territory. He was a part-time boxing promoter and referee, a softball coach, and a career lawman, having served both as a Maricopa County Sheriff’s deputy in addition to his elected position as a constable in Mesa.\n\nBut of all the hats he wore, none was of the 10-gallon variety, which he was depicted wearing in the 1989 \"Unsolved Mysteries\" episode on the Hatbox Baby.\n\nInstead, he preferred a business suit and a fedora, which he felt added more of a professional air to law enforcement.\n\nAnd he’d seen all sides of the law. At age 24, he sat as a juror in a murder trial, and four years before the Hatbox Baby case, he’d been a formal witness to the hanging of his brother-in-law, who was executed for murdering a business partner.\n\nMaier would eventually become Mesa’s police chief, a position he held until 1948, when his career took its darkest turn and he was forced to shoot an armed suspect in front of the man’s wife and daughter. The man died, and Maier, who’d prided himself on being able to talk down the nastiest of criminals, turned in his badge.\n\nBut on Christmas Day of 1931, as the newspaper headlines and radio reports shared the news of the miracle baby, tips were already coming into the station. Maier fielded them all. None panned out.\n\nHe met with reporters about noon and said he intended to lead a search party the next day to scour the desert where the blue-eyed, red-haired child was found, in the hopes of finding a clue about her mother’s identity.\n\n“There is a possibility that homicide might enter into this case,” he told reporters. “The baby’s mother might be dead out there, and we are going to conduct a thorough search.”\n\n“We start the search without a single clue,” Maier said. \"The baby seemed to just drop out of the sky.”\n\nOn the day after Christmas, Maier and deputy Deke LeBaron took Ed Stewart back out to the remote stretch of highway 40 miles away where Stewart and his wife said they found the black pasteboard hatbox with a newborn baby girl inside.\n\nThey were met by Pinal County Sheriff Walter Laveen, Gila County Sheriff Jimmy Byrne and Maricopa County Sheriff J.R. McFadden because they were unsure which county the Hatbox Baby was found in or who should have jurisdiction in the case.\n\nFrom Ed Stewart’s directions, they determined that the baby was found in Pinal County, but the search didn’t turn up a shred of evidence.\n\n“We didn’t find a clue,” Maier told reporters after the search. “There was nothing to indicate a homicide. We found no trace of how the hatbox had been brought there or who might’ve left it.\"\n\nThe investigation would continue. Maier hinted that he expected developments soon, but he did not tip his hand.\n\nThe case was turned over to Laveen, the Pinal County sheriff.\n\nA week later, Laveen's deputies would tell reporters in Florence that they were investigating a teenage mother in the mining town of Miami, about 25 miles from where the baby was found, and they just about had the case wrapped up.\n\nBut they never mentioned the case again in the press, and several weeks later, a formal hearing was held in Pinal County Superior Court, where the Hatbox Baby was officially declared an abandoned child and eligible for adoption.\n\nMore than half a century later, Maier would meet Sharon Elliott. Though he was 95, his mind was sharp. He still remembered the case and told Elliott he thought about her every Christmas Eve.\n\nSharon recounted the story in a first-person magazine story several years later in which she said she told Maier that she was struggling with the fact that “I was just dumped in the desert to die.”\n\nAnd that, Sharon wrote, was when Maier told her the words that comforted her for the next 30 years of her life:\n\n“There’s a lot of questions about where you came from that night, questions that may never be answered. God knows, a lot of folks had theories about what did and didn’t happen.\n\n“Was somebody hiding in the sagebrush and watching to make sure you’d be found? Was that good-hearted couple who brought you in telling us the whole story? Nobody knows for sure, but this much I am certain of. The baby put into my hands that night was clean and well-cared-for. You were meant to be found and given a good home.”\n\nThe couple who found the Hatbox Baby\n\nIn December 1989, NBC aired an episode of \"Unsolved Mysteries\" that recreated the story of the Hatbox Baby. As soon as it ended on the East Coast, Ed and Julia Stewart's phone started to ring with calls from friends, who wanted to express shock.\n\nHad they really found a baby all those years ago? Were they worried the show implied that they knew more than they were telling about the case?\n\nThat Hatbox Baby herself even said she thought the whole thing was a setup.\n\nThe calls left Julia Stewart in tears.\n\nAn hour later, the episode aired in the Central Time Zone, prompting another wave of calls and another wave of tears.\n\nA third wave came when the episode finally aired on the West Coast.\n\nTo their dying days, Ed and Julia Stewart maintained that their car really did break down seven miles west of Superior on Christmas Eve of 1931, and that they really did stumble upon an abandoned baby in a hatbox.\n\nFrom the beginning, they felt the authorities had pointed an accusatory finger at them. Even if the investigators didn't come right out and say it, the implication was there: Surely there was more to their story. Surely they must be covering up for some friend or loved one’s indiscretion.\n\nThe \"Unsolved Mysteries\" episode ran 57 years after their miraculous find, and now the accusatory fingers were pointing all over again.\n\n◆ ◆ ◆\n\nIn 2003, I decided to do an update on the Hatbox Baby case, and I was able to interview the Stewarts' only surviving daughter: Wilma Ervin.\n\nWhen I found Wilma, she was living in the town of Delta, on Colorado's Western Slope, where her parents had moved decades earlier.\n\nShe told me that the Hatbox Baby was something that was never talked about in their household.\n\nI would interview Wilma several more times in the intervening years, and her story never wavered.\n\nWilma had never even heard of the case — or her parents' involvement — until she read about it as a teenager in her grandmother’s journal.\n\nWhen she asked her mother about it, Julia said it brought back the terrible memories, that what should have been a joyous miracle was clouded by the shadows of suspicion.\n\nJulia was 18 when she and her husband showed up at the Mesa Police station that Christmas Eve with the baby and their incredible tale of how they happened upon her.\n\nA month later, they were subpoenaed to appear in Pinal County Superior Court in Florence.\n\nThe authorities had been investigating for a month and still had no clues as to who left a newborn baby in a hatbox beside the road almost exactly where the Stewarts said their car happened to break down on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe subpoena ordered Ed and Julia to testify at a child abandonment hearing for the baby, one that would ultimately allow the child to be adopted. They were asked where they had been that fateful day, and where they were going that night.\n\nThe answers they gave were sometimes vague and contradictory. Julia’s account would change significantly in a newspaper interview a year later. There's no way to tell whether the reporter's take was accurate or whether he took a creative license.\n\nIn either event, no one, it appears, officially challenged their version of the events, at least in court.\n\n◆ Who were Ed and Julia Stewart?\n\nThe young couple were products of tough and tangled upbringings.\n\nEd’s parents were estranged shortly after he was born. His father’s first wife ran off with another man, and his mother, Lelia, died when he was seven. Ed, along with his younger brother and older sister, were taken in by Lelia’s mother, Mary Weller.\n\nWeller had left her abusive first husband, Lelia’s father, who was later shot and killed by her second husband, Elton Weller. He was the brother of the Ed’s father's first wife.\n\nEd, 6 feet and 4 inches, lanky and dark-haired, only finished the eighth grade. He dropped out to work as a mule driver and then went to work for a grocery store. Even though he didn't have a lot of formal education, he was mechanically minded and went on to work as a surveying engineer for several federal land agencies. He was working as a driver for Diamond Ice Co. in Phoenix when the Hatbox Baby was found.\n\nJulia, a tall, dark-haired beauty with a shock of white hair from the time she was 18, also had a tough upbringing.\n\nHer mother had three sons from a previous marriage before she married Julia’s father, Albert Wriedt, in 1912. Wriedt died in 1918, a casualty of the Spanish flu epidemic, leaving Julia fatherless at age 6 and leaving her mother with four young children.\n\nEd and Julia were married on April 1, 1930, and their first child was born a little more than a year later. They lived next door to Julia’s mother in Mesa before moving to a house near Virginia Street just east of Central Avenue in Phoenix, which was closer to Ed’s work.\n\nEd had dropped out of school after eighth grade to try and put food on the table for his family. To make money on the side, he and Julia would take their 1925 Buick, most likely the car they were driving when they found the Hatbox Baby, into the desert and try to rope wild horses, which he would then break and try to sell.\n\n◆ Child abandonment hearing for the Hatbox Baby\n\nOn Tuesday, Jan. 11, 1932, Ed and Julia appeared in Pinal County Superior Court.\n\nJudge E. L. Green presided over the child-abandonment hearing. He gaveled the hearing into session at 11 a.m. The hands on the three-story clock tower of the historic courthouse read 11:44, as they always did. When the courthouse was built in 1891, the county could not afford the clockworks for the ornate tower, so the hands were painted on.\n\nFor Green, the Hatbox Baby would be one of three high-profile cases in two years. In 1930, he presided over the sanity hearing for Eva Dugan, who was sentenced to the gallows for murdering an elderly rancher for whom she’d worked as a housekeeper.\n\nGreen’s ruling allowed the execution to go forward, but with grisly consequences. When the trapdoor sprung, the noose decapitated Dugan, causing her body to collapse in a pool of gore. Outrage over the case caused Arizona to abandon the practice of hanging in favor of the gas chamber. She was the last woman executed in Arizona.\n\nA few months after the Hatbox Baby hearing, Green would preside over a sanity hearing in another sensational case. This time, the defendant was the notorious “Trunk Murderess” Winnie Ruth Judd, who shot and killed two former roommates, hacked up their bodies and shipped them to Los Angeles in steamer trunks. He found that she was not sane, and her life was spared.\n\nThe child-abandonment hearing provided considerably less drama.\n\nJulia was the first to face direct examination from Pinal County Attorney W.C. Truman, according to a court reporter’s transcript of the hearing.\n\n“With reference to this Hat Box Baby, alias Baby Marian, alias Jane Doe, will you tell the circumstances surrounding this child to the best of your knowledge?” Truman asked.\n\n“You mean how I found it?” she replied.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, I just happened to run on to it, and I didn’t want to open the box, so I called my husband, and he opened it and we saw what was in it, that was all. We just ran across it.”\n\nShe went on to testify that she, her husband, and her two teenage twin cousins had left Mesa about 8 a.m. that Christmas Eve and had driven up the Apache Trail to the town of Roosevelt, where she visited a friend, a “Mrs. Houser.”\n\nAfterward, they drove through Miami, then Globe and Superior without stopping until the car’s fuel line broke, around sunset, seven miles west of Superior, she said.\n\n“The place where you stopped due to the breaking of the gas line, could you see the baby from there?”\n\n“No sir, it was surrounded by trees, I mean some bushes around it…I was walking towards it and saw it kind of along the side.”\n\nTruman finished his examination after several more questions, but Green asked Julia to describe the scene in further detail and go over their route again.\n\nShe repeated the fact that they did not stop in Miami, where a week earlier Pinal County Sheriff Walter Laveen's deputies had suggested the abandoned child’s mother lived.\n\n\"Drove straight through,\" she said.\n\nThe questioning continued.\n\n“You didn’t see anybody around there when you found this baby?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Did you examine the ground to see if you could see any tracks?”\n\n“No, we just looked around, we thought there was someone close and we looked, but couldn’t see anyone.”\n\n“Was the top fastened down on the box? Were the clamps fastened?”\n\n“On both sides, but not in front. It didn’t set down right tight.”\n\n“Was there anything in the box in the way of a pillow or anything?”\n\n“No just had its clothes on and a blue blanket around it.”\n\n“Will (the baby fit) in that box without doubling up?”\n\n“It was doubled up quite a bit.”\n\n“How was it lying?”\n\n“On its back with its little knees almost under its chin.”\n\nGreen asked a couple more perfunctory questions about Julia’s cousins, who were in the car, and then turned the questioning back over to Truman.\n\n“What was this baby, boy or girl?” he asked.\n\n“A girl, they say.”\n\n“You don’t know?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Any distinctive coloring about the baby or description?”\n\n“Just red hair, that’s all I noticed.”\n\n◆ Ed Stewart contradicts his wife's testimony\n\nAfter Julia Stewart was dismissed, Ed took the stand. Julia had testified that after their stop in Roosevelt they drove straight through Miami, Globe and Superior without stopping, but Ed testified that they stopped between Miami and Superior for 15 or 20 minutes “to look at the snow.”\n\nHe also said that their reason for visiting Roosevelt was “just looking around,” and that the purpose of the trip was to see snow.\n\nNeither Truman, the prosecutor, nor Green questioned why Ed said they had stopped near Miami to see snow while Julia said they hadn’t.\n\nClimate data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Weather Bureau for December of 1931 shows no precipitation near Miami or Superior in the week leading up to Dec. 24. High temperatures were in the 60s, and the lows had not dipped below freezing for at least a week.\n\nWhile it’s possible Ed was referring to snow on the surrounding mountains, they likely would have had a much better view of the snow on Four Peaks at their earlier stop in Roosevelt.\n\nThere is no record of whether the authorities tried to verify that Julia visited a friend in Roosevelt. Census records, voter registration rolls and city directories show no Mrs. Houser — or any other variation of that spelling — in Roosevelt or the surrounding area.\n\nThe only Houser listed is 30 miles away — in Miami.\n\nThere are other questions about the Stewarts' testimony that apparently went unasked.\n\nBoth Ed and Julia testified that they broke down seven miles west of Superior, a busy mining town that was then significantly larger than Mesa. Neither Green nor Truman asked why they didn’t drive the seven miles back to Superior instead of driving the 40 miles to Mesa.\n\nThe Stewarts testified that they heated water from a Thermos and fed it to the baby in a spoon. But later in her testimony, Julia said she did not stay with her husband at the police station because she had left her own 8-month-old baby with her mother and was uncomfortable because she had not nursed all day.\n\nPerhaps it was the decorum of the time, but neither Green nor Truman asked her why she didn’t nurse the foundling during the 2-hour drive back to Mesa.\n\n◆ Julia Stewart changes her story\n\nA year later, journalist and author Oren Arnold interviewed Julia for an anniversary story about the Hatbox Baby.\n\nBoth Stewarts testified in court that their car broke down with a fuel line problem. In Arnold’s story, however, Julia said they had a flat tire.\n\n“We were put out when that tire went flat,” she told Arnold.\n\n“We had an eight-month-old baby of our own back in Mesa with my mother, and Ed and I were anxious to get back and take of Santa Clause.”\n\nAnd while she had initially testified that they never stopped after Roosevelt, she told Arnold that “Business had called us to Superior that day.”\n\n\"Ed got out to change the tire,\" she said. \"The air was cold and still and to keep from shivering I got out and walked around. The stars were awfully bright on the desert, and I remember that it all looked like pictures you see on Christmas cards…”\n\n“I walked a way on the desert from the highway, while Ed was knocking and banging on the wheel. Suddenly I saw something black on the ground near a greasewood bush. It didn’t frighten me. I just saw it looked odd, so I called Ed.\n\n“He hollered back that he was in a hurry to get home, and was about done with the tire.\n\n“But I made him come anyway. When we went closer, we saw it was a ragged hatbox…It was closed, and a piece of cloth hung out.\n\n“Ed opened it, and something inside moved! Then I did get scared. I clutched at Ed’s shoulder. We heard a little noise.\n\n“We carefully pulled back the cloth, and as Ed struck a match we saw it was a teeny baby! I never felt so queer in all my life.”\n\nIf Arnold, who later wrote that he attended the adoption hearing, caught the discrepancies, it’s not evident from his story.\n\n◆ A letter from the Stewarts\n\nIn the end, Green declared the Hatbox Baby abandoned and eligible for adoption. While an occasional newspaper columnist would write a wistful column wondering whatever became of the baby, it would be 55 years before anyone found out.\n\nThe world would learn that her name was Sharon Elliott, and, after I wrote the first story about her in 1988, a private investigator named Alice Syman helped get her story on \"Unsolved Mysteries.\"\n\nThe Stewarts were never interviewed for the program.\n\nSeveral years after it aired, Syman wrote them, asking for their side of the story.\n\n“I have thought about you so many times, and have wanted to tell you how sorry I am for any discomfort you may have sustained by what was said on the show,” she wrote. “We never meant to hurt anyone.”\n\nThe Stewarts would have none of it.\n\n“You know as much about the Hatbox Baby as we do. We FOUND her, we know NOTHING about her,” Julia wrote. “We question why she would care who her mother is, when she took her to the desert & and left her for the wild animals to eat. As far as we’re concerned, this matter is CLOSED!! Please DO NOT contact us again.”\n\nEd Stewart died in 1992, and Julia died 10 years later.\n\nIt would take nearly 20 years before DNA testing would show no genetic link between the Stewarts and the baby they said they found in a hatbox in the middle of the desert on Christmas Eve of 1931.\n\nBut the questions about whether there was more to their tale than they were telling would remain.\n\nThe people who gave Sharon a home\n\nOn July 18, 1986, Faith Morrow filed a motion in Pinal County Superior Court, asking a judge to unseal the adoption records in the 55-year-old case of the Hatbox Baby.\n\n“I am now 83 and my daughter will be 55 in December,” she wrote in a shaky hand. “I feel I could better tell her she is adopted than to have some other person (well-meaning or otherwise) tell her after I am gone.”\n\nFaith told the judge how two years earlier while undergoing treatment for breast cancer, the radiation burned the lining of her heart, almost killing her. She had also fallen and broken a hip and undergone hip-replacement surgery.\n\nShe felt her own mortality closing in on her, and she wanted to tell her daughter the secret she’d kept from her for more than half a century.\n\nIt was even more urgent because her daughter was thinking of moving to Mesa, and Faith was afraid she might accidentally stumble across the story of her birth there.\n\nIn six months, Faith would be dead.\n\nIn her motion, Faith described how, years earlier, she and her husband, Henry, desperately wanted to have a child but that she had not been able to carry a baby to term.\n\n“Following yet another miscarriage…I was beginning to think I would never have a baby of my own,” she wrote.\n\n“When I heard the news on the radio (Christmas morning) we turned off the oven on the turkey and drove right to Mesa to see the baby. You should have seen her — so perfect and so perfectly adorable.\n\n“We requested the right to adopt her. I was told they had 200 applications.”\n\nI found Faith’s motion in Sharon’s adoption records after I filed my own motion in Pinal County Superior Court in November to have them unsealed. Faith’s motion had been successful, but for some reason, the records had been resealed.\n\nI had some items from the original file, but I wanted to make sure there weren’t other clues that we might not have known were relevant 30 years ago, well before anyone thought of DNA testing for the Hatbox Baby.\n\nI had introduced her in a story as Sharon Elliott, a retired aerospace worker from Southern California who never knew she was adopted, much less the subject of a longstanding Arizona mystery.\n\nIn my court hearing on Dec. 5, Pinal County Superior Court Judge Stephen McCarville told me he’d read the file and didn’t think there was much in there that I didn’t already have. He granted my motion to unseal the file.\n\nThen he wished me luck.\n\n“I hope you find what you’re looking for,” he said.\n\nHe was right. I knew most of what was in the file, but there were a couple of things I didn’t: Faith’s five-page handwritten motion, and a transcript of her testimony in the Feb. 10, 1932 adoption hearing for the Hatbox Baby (who was known at the time as Baby Marian, named for the Virgin Mary because she was found on Christmas Eve).\n\nAfter she was adopted, her new parents changed her name to Mary Elizabeth. Sharon didn’t remember when exactly her name had changed again, but she always thought it had something to do with the Rose of Sharon, a flowering vine that is mentioned in the Bible, and the fact that Faith’s father was a minister.\n\nThe adoption documents helped me flesh out a picture of Faith, a complicated woman who led a complicated life. While she was the only mother Sharon ever knew, Sharon never had much to say about her other than what a normal upbringing she had had and what a good mother Faith was to her and her stepbrother.\n\nBut in digging into Faith’s life, I found things out about her that Sharon never knew, including a marriage and a divorce, and Faith’s apparent use of aliases in at least two sets of public records.\n\n◆ Who was Faith Morrow?\n\nFaith Lillian Amelia Soderstrom was born in Minnesota in 1903, the youngest child of an itinerant Swedish-born preacher. By age 7, her family had moved to Alamogordo, N.M., and by 16 she was living in a Los Angeles boarding house with her mother, who worked as a housekeeper for a woman who had lived in Arizona.\n\nLess than a year later, Faith was living near Prescott, possibly to be with her sister, whose husband, a World War I veteran, was being treated at Fort Whipple. The post had a large Army sanatorium that treated soldiers for tuberculosis or complications from mustard-gas exposure in the trenches.\n\nFort Whipple was founded in 1864 during what were known as the Indian Wars, and actually served as Arizona’s first territorial capital before a more permanent seat of government was established two miles south in Prescott. The fort was active through the Spanish American War, protecting the capital as well as the gold mines that dot the area.\n\nThe fort was decommissioned in the early 1900s, then recommissioned during World War I.\n\nSoon after she arrived in Prescott, Faith went to work as a clerk typist and stenographer for the Veteran’s Bureau at Fort Whipple, and in 1925, at the age of 22, she married a man named Sigmund Ingersoll, who also worked at the fort and was nearly 10 years her senior.\n\nThe marriage didn’t last. Less than three years later, in March 1928, she would divorce him, citing non-support and the fact that he didn’t want children.\n\nSharon Elliott never knew about that divorce until I found a copy in the state archives and asked her about it. The news didn’t seem to faze her. Compared to finding out she was the Hatbox Baby, that surprise was pretty minor, she told me.\n\nIn Faith’s divorce complaint, she alleges that “for more than one year last past (Ingersoll) has neglected and failed to provide…the common necessaries of life, he having the ability to provide the same but has failed by reason of his idleness, profligacy and dissipation,” even though he was a “strong, able-bodied man, able to provide a living for himself and is now earning more than $150 a month.”\n\n“I worked all the time we were married and gave him practically every penny I made,” she said.\n\nIngersoll never bothered to answer the complaint or show up in court. Faith said it was probably because he was afraid he’d be hit with the court costs.\n\nBy the time her divorce was granted in March of 1928, Faith had already moved to Phoenix. The 1928 Phoenix City Directory shows a woman named Ingersoll working as a typist at the Veteran's Bureau, but she is listed as Fanny, not Faith.\n\n◆ Who was Sharon's adoptive father?\n\nOn Oct. 25, 1928, Faith would marry Henry Stieg in Los Angeles. She could not legally marry in Arizona because not enough time had elapsed since her divorce.\n\nStieg was an up-and-coming grocery executive who would go on to become one of the Valley’s movers and shakers. Stieg was one of the founding directors of the A.J. Bayless grocery chain, which was an Arizona mainstay for 60 years until it was absorbed in the grocery consolidations of the 1990s.\n\nStieg's was a rags-to-riches story, the kind that gave Phoenix a reputation as a place where anyone could stake a claim to a fresh start and succeed beyond their wildest imagination. Born in poverty in rural southwestern Ohio, he attended school only through sixth grade.\n\nHis father was a farmer and a “coal burner,” the tough, grimy job of making charcoal, which was commonly used for heat. His mother, who had divorced his father, worked as a housekeeper, and when Henry was old enough to work, she sold him into virtual servitude, an arrangement where she was paid for the work he did for a neighboring farmer.\n\nAs a teenager, he began selling fruits and vegetables in Hamilton, Ohio, near Cincinnati, and parlayed it into a going concern. By his early 20s, he was buying quarter-page advertisements in the Hamilton newspaper on a weekly basis.\n\nLike Faith, Stieg had a failed marriage in his past. He’d married at 19 and had a son. They moved to Arizona sometime between 1925 and 1927, when she moved back to Ohio.\n\nFour years later, Stieg would testify at Sharon’s adoption hearing that he divorced his wife on grounds of desertion, but it’s unclear whether she could have sued him on grounds of infidelity.\n\n“She knew I carried on and she went back to Ohio and I wouldn’t go back. I was in business here…and she wouldn’t stay … because it was too hot in Arizona and I wouldn’t go back to Ohio, so we separated.\"\n\nBoth Henry and Faith told the judge that they were happily married and had never discussed or even contemplated divorce.\n\nThey told Green they lived in a house on two and a half acres on McDowell Road just east of the city limits. They said the house and the property were worth $5,500 and they only owed $1,000 on it. Henry also testified that he had 600 shares of A.J. Bayless stock and made $45 a week plus a bonus.\n\nIt was just two years after the stock market crash of 1929, when unemployment was 17 percent, and Henry Stieg, at the age of 29, was making 25 percent more than the average American.\n\n◆ 'Let it rest a miracle'\n\nWhile news reports at the time said that as many as 200 couples had wanted to adopt the Hatbox Baby, only two showed up. Heavy rains that week had made travel difficult.\n\nThe other couple, a 45-year-old employee of Hayden Flour Mill and his 36-year-old wife, already had a 14-year-old adopted daughter.\n\nCourt transcripts from the Feb. 10, 1932, adoption hearing show a fairly routine procedure, but Faith’s own account years later, along with that of Arizona Republic reporter Oren Arnold, bend toward the dramatic.\n\n“The judge called them first, and the woman didn’t say anything but the man said, 'We have one adopted daughter and I’ll say right here she’s been raised in the fear of the Lord, and I don’t believe in sparing the rod and spoiling the child,\" Faith wrote in her 1986 motion, recounting the testimony of the other couple. “I prayed — Dear God don’t let that man have my baby!”\n\nAt the end of the day, Judge Green allowed the Stiegs to adopt the Hatbox Baby because they did not have a child while the other family did.\n\nThirty years later, Arnold wrote in the Christmas 1952 issue of Desert Magazine that he too was in the courtroom that day and that Faith had begged the judge to “Never tell where Marian is. Let her grow up without publicity, not as a freak found out on the desert. Please never tell.”\n\nArnold closed his piece by saying he had been in contact with Faith and that the Hatbox Baby was well and happy.\n\n“It has all been so wonderful,” Faith told him. “People are so kind. Let it rest as a miracle. Please never tell who she is or where she is.”\n\n◆ ◆ ◆\n\nFaith and Henry finally had the baby they’d always wanted. But their domestic bliss wouldn’t last, and there are indications it was just fiction anyway. Just seven months after they adopted Baby Marian, Henry Stieg filed for divorce. His wife was already living back in Prescott at the time.\n\nIn his petition, Henry accused Faith of “cruel treatment,” saying that for more than a year, “she constantly and without reason found fault with and quarreled with (him), both in private and before his friends and acquaintances.”\n\nShe also mocked his “manner of speech” and “lack of education,” causing him “constant discomfort, annoyance and mental pain and anguish.”\n\nLastly, Henry said that Faith “consistently disturbed (his) peace of mind and the enjoyment of his home, by constantly urging and insisting” that Henry quit his job and move to California, where she preferred to live.\n\nThe divorce was granted. Henry agreed to pay Faith $1,500 in monthly installments of $50 for her share of the house and gave her a 1929 Buick sedan. She also got to keep her Singer sewing machine, the couple’s dishware — and their baby.\n\nTheir settlement called for Faith to have sole custody and control of the baby, now identified as Mary Elizabeth Stieg, and in return she agreed to forgo any alimony or child support.\n\nHenry Stieg went on to become a prominent Phoenix citizen. He ran a number of businesses, including a bar and restaurant and a meat-packing company that was accused by a disgruntled business partner — charges never proven — of selling horsemeat to the Scottsdale schools while his third wife served on the school board.\n\nHis third marriage would come 10 years after his divorce from Faith, and he and his new wife would adopt four children together.\n\nIf Henry Stieg ever saw Sharon after his divorce from Faith, Sharon didn't remember it.\n\n◆ ◆ ◆\n\nAfter her divorce from Henry, Faith returned to the Veteran’s Bureau at Fort Whipple, and less than 20 months later, she married for a third time, this time to a tuberculosis patient named Charles Francis Cook, a second lieutenant from New York who had fought in World War I.\n\nCook was a widower. His wife had died of tuberculosis several years earlier, leaving behind a young son, Jack. Almost a year to the day after he and Faith married, Charles Cook died, leaving Faith with a daughter and a son, and, after a fight, his veteran’s pension.\n\nPrescott city directories from the late 1930s show Faith Cook, and Jack and Sharon, living in a home owned by a music teacher, Vera Morrow, and her brother Arthur, who is listed as a house painter.\n\nArthur, who was four years older than Faith, was tall and thin, with blue eyes and brown hair. On March 7, 1939, a marriage license was issued in his name in Yuma. He married a woman named “Esther Cook,” whose age and birthplace match Faith’s.\n\nA year later, Faith Cook is listed in the 1940 Census as a widow, living in Los Angeles with her children, Jack Cook and Sharon Stieg; along with Vera and Arthur, who was listed as a carpenter.\n\nHis World War II draft registration card lists him as working for Airesearch, an aerospace company in Inglewood, Calif, where he spent the rest of his career, helping raise Sharon and Jack. He would give Sharon away at her wedding.\n\nIn her 1986 court plea to have Sharon's adoption records unsealed, Faith mentions that she was divorced from Henry, but says that she and Arthur were married for 40 years. She doesn't mention the marriage to Charles Cook at all.\n\nArthur Morrow died in 1979, the only father Sharon ever knew.\n\nThe search for Edna Sherman Roe\n\nAs Christmas approached in 2011, I started thinking about Sharon Elliott, who was about to celebrate her 80th birthday and 80 years as the center of one of Arizona's most enduring mysteries.\n\nI called her and told her I'd like to do another story.\n\nIf anyone involved in her case was left, their memories would be fading. I hoped another story might pry another clue loose. She was willing to give it a shot.\n\n“The Hatbox Baby is 80 now,\" I wrote, \"and I’ve come to interview her again.”\n\nAs I had many times before, I sat down with Sharon at her kitchen table and began to sort through the box of clippings and documents that chronicled the extraordinary first few days of her life.\n\nThere were news stories from across the country that recounted how a young couple making their way from Superior to Mesa on Christmas Eve of 1931 pulled over in the middle of the desert with car trouble and found the baby stuffed in a black pasteboard hatbox.\n\nThere were the records of her adoption, two months later, after authorities failed to find any trace of who might have left her in the desert or why.\n\nThere was even the first story I wrote about her in 1988.\n\nAnd then there was an envelope.\n\n◆ A note hidden in plain sight\n\nI was certain I’d never seen it before. It looked unfamiliar to Sharon.\n\nInside was a single page with a series of notations, written with almost no punctuation in a woman’s hand that Sharon identified as her adoptive mother’s.\n\n“Mother Edna Sherman Roe,” it said.\n\n“Born 1914 Died 1949 Plane crash.”\n\nAnd then this: “1935 — your mother saw you she was 21 then.”\n\nI was stunned.\n\nI had first written about Sharon’s case nearly a quarter of a century earlier. Had the solution to the mystery of the Hatbox Baby been beneath our noses all this time?\n\n“That’s my mother’s handwriting,” Sharon said. “How could I have missed it?”\n\nIn 1986, when Sharon was 55, her adoptive mother, Faith Morrow, was dying of cancer. Before she did, she told Sharon the secret she had kept since Sharon was a baby.\n\nNot only was Sharon adopted, but she was the Hatbox Baby.\n\nFaith gave Sharon an envelope of old, yellowed newspaper clippings and other documents that laid out how Sharon was found, declared abandoned and placed up for adoption.\n\nWhen I showed Sharon the envelope, she couldn’t say whether it had been in the stack of newspaper clippings Faith had given her, or whether she found it after Faith had died.\n\nThere was another complication. In an effort to keep Sharon from finding the documents, Faith had given them to friends and relatives for safekeeping. The last friend who had them, Dorothy Wooden, misplaced them for several years. She thought she had accidentally thrown them out, but then found them again.\n\nCould the letter have come from someone other than Faith?\n\nI called Alice Syman, a private investigator who helped land Sharon’s case on the TV show \"Unsolved Mysteries\" who had taken Sharon to Pinal County to view her adoption file after I wrote the first Hatbox Baby story in 1988.\n\nAlice had spent thousands of hours on Sharon’s case and felt she had seen the letter. According to her detailed notes from the case, she had tracked down relatives of Edna Sherman Roe, but none of them knew anything about her having a baby. Her files even contained a picture, but Alice didn't believe there was a family resemblance.\n\nStill, it was worth looking into again, she suggested.\n\n◆ ◆ ◆\n\nThe first thing I did was to Google Edna Sherman Roe. The search turned up a 1953 U.S. Supreme Court Case involving the beneficiaries of her life insurance policy.\n\nShe and her husband, an executive at a tool and dye company in Odessa, Texas, had indeed been killed when the small plane he was flying crashed in the mountains near Ruidoso, New Mexico. But the crash was in 1951, not 1949.\n\nBecause their bodies were not found for more than two weeks, it could not be determined whether Edna or her husband, James, died first. If one died before the other, then the surviving spouse would have inherited all of the couple’s community property, and the benefits would be paid out to that person’s beneficiaries.\n\nI called the Odessa Public Library, and they emailed me stories about the crash, along with a copy of Edna’s obituary, which listed her survivors. Among them was her father, Fred Sherman, of Coalgate, Okla.\n\nWith a little more digging I found that Fred Sherman had been the moonshine-busting sheriff of Coal County. He also served in the Oklahoma Legislature and later worked as a railroad detective.\n\nIt wasn't hard to imagine how a pregnant 15-year-old daughter of a law-and-order sheriff in the heart of the Bible Belt might get shipped off to Arizona.\n\nOther details seemed to help the story fall into place: Sherman had once owned a gold-and-silver plated .44 revolver that cowboy actor and showman Tom Mix greatly admired. Mix had Arizona connections (he died in a single-car crash near Florence in 1940), and several people who had sent tips to Syman after the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" episode aired named him as the father.\n\nBut coincidences are not proof. And the theory raised more questions.\n\nIf Edna Sherman Roe was Sharon’s mother, how did Sharon wind up in a hatbox on a remote roadway in Arizona on Christmas Eve? Was the young couple who claimed to find her after their car broke down at the exact location where someone left Sharon part of a miracle or some elaborate plot?\n\nAnd given all the secrecy surrounding adoptions — it took a court order to unseal Sharon’s case in 1986 — how would Edna have seen Sharon in 1935?\n\n◆ ◆ ◆\n\nAs I continued to trace Fred Sherman’s descendants, I found another tantalizing clue: Dorothy Wooden, the woman who had held on to Sharon’s papers, was a niece of Edna Sherman Roe.\n\nSharon told me she didn’t know how her mother knew Dorothy but had often commented that they looked so much alike that they could be cousins, especially because they both had red hair.\n\nDorothy obviously held a key, but to what?\n\nI began trying to track her down. Her last address was in Southern California near Palm Springs, but she didn’t appear to live there anymore. I tried all the people-finder databases I could find and even enlisted friends of mine who work for newspapers in California.\n\nHer name didn’t register in the Social Security Death Index, so I knew she was likely still alive, but she had apparently gone off the grid.\n\nAfter a little more sleuthing, I tracked down another descendant of Fred Sherman who lived in Tucson. She turned out to be another niece of Edna Sherman Roe.\n\nI called her and told her the Hatbox Baby story and asked if she could help me find Dorothy Wooden.\n\nShe said she hadn’t heard from her in years and had no idea how to reach her.\n\nBefore I hung up, however, I asked her if she might be willing to help solve the mystery.\n\nWould she be willing to take a DNA test?\n\n“I don’t see why not,” she said. “Especially if it would help that lady with some answers.”\n\nI called Sharon with the news, and she was excited. After 80 years, we might finally know who her birth mother was, which might lead us to who left her in the desert and, perhaps most importantly, why.\n\nThis was before the boom in DNA self-testing kits. Conducting a test on the niece would be expensive. I called several companies, and one agreed to do it at cost.\n\nThere was one more complication. The woman in Tucson wanted to do it after the holidays.\n\nBut I was on the hook with my editors for a Christmas story, so in the finest traditions of journalism, I went with what I had and wrote the story with a cliffhanger ending.\n\nIn January, I called the woman to arrange for me to go to Tucson and collect a cheek swab.\n\nShe told me she’d had a change of heart. She didn’t want to be a part of the story, and she wouldn’t be taking any DNA test.\n\nSharon was crushed when I told her the news. There had been times when she said she no longer cared whether she found the answer to who she really was, but this time I had raised her hopes.\n\nI told her I’d keep trying to find Dorothy Wooden.\n\n◆ Chasing ghosts down rabbit holes\n\nIt would take me five years and the help of a private investigator, along with dozens of letters sent to addresses throughout California.\n\nWhen Dorothy Wooden finally called me, we spoke for more than an hour.\n\nShe told me how she’d grown up poor in Oklahoma and as a young girl had spent the summer with Edna in Odessa.\n\nShe described trips to department stores and fabulous dresses and fancy dinners with china, silver and crystal. She said she remembered a young oil tycoon by the name of George H.W. Bush had been a dinner guest with the Roes, which I was unable to verify.\n\nDorothy knew all about the story of the Hatbox Baby, but no, she wasn’t related to Sharon, and Sharon wasn’t related to Edna Sherman Roe.\n\nDorothy and Faith had become friends in the 1970s when Dorothy was working as a real estate agent and had helped Faith with a home sale.\n\nDorothy said Faith must have “borrowed” the Edna Sherman Roe story because she thought it sounded romantic and would make Sharon feel better about being abandoned as a baby.\n\nIt appeared I had spent a lot of time chasing ghosts down rabbit holes.\n\nBut the Edna Sherman Roe episode wasn’t a total waste.\n\nHer niece wasn’t willing to take a DNA test, but Sharon still was. And in just a few years, so would millions of other Americans.\n\nCould one of them solve the mystery of the Hatbox Baby?\n\nWill DNA tests unlock new clues?\n\nOn Oct. 1, 2016, I received an email from a woman in Oregon who had read my 2011 story about the Hatbox Baby.\n\nGlenda Poling and her sisters were looking for a sibling who, according to family lore, had been taken away from their mother in, of all things, a hatbox.\n\nI’d been down this road a number of times before and was skeptical.\n\nThe Hatbox Baby, according to sensational media reports in 1931, had been found on a remote roadside, abandoned inside a hatbox. Decades later, Sharon Elliott contacted me to tell me she had been that baby, which set off a new round of interest — and tips that couldn't be proved.\n\nGlenda and her sisters had contacted Sharon and private investigator Alice Syman years earlier after seeing Sharon’s story on \"Unsolved Mysteries,\" but had never followed through with a DNA test.\n\n“Without getting into a lot of detail at this point,” Glenda wrote, “there was a circumstance in our family where a baby, my parent's firstborn, was placed in a 'pretty' box and promptly removed from the house — this happened in the early 1930's in Silver City NM.”\n\nBABYFULSTONE MYSTERY: Sisters search forlong-lost sibling born in Silver City\n\nSharon had been found on Christmas Eve of 1931, stuffed into a black, pasteboard hatbox and abandoned beside a remote desert highway between Mesa and Superior.\n\nThe timing was about right, but it was the location Glenda mentioned that was intriguing.\n\nSilver City sits in far southwestern New Mexico and would have been a long day’s drive from Mesa in 1931. It was accessible by rail and bus.\n\nI was interested, but still unconvinced.\n\nGlenda offered to send me pictures of her mother. Aside from hair color, she didn’t bear a great resemblance to Sharon. I told Glenda I’d stay in touch.\n\nA month or so later, in November of 2016, another unsolved mystery made headlines in Phoenix. It had nothing to do with Sharon, but it helped propel the search for her mother in a whole new direction.\n\nThe story involved a break in a pair of grisly Phoenix murders from the early 1990s. The twist: The notorious Canal Killer had been caught with DNA evidence.\n\nPolice had used an emerging technique called forensic genealogy to arrest a man in the murders of two young women whose bodies were found in Phoenix canals in 1992 and 1993.\n\nIt was one of the first cases ever solved with the technique. Since then, police have used it increasingly to solve cold cases, such as the notorious Golden Gate killer case in Sacramento, Calif.\n\nFor one of her stories about the Canal Killer arrest, my colleague Megan Cassidy interviewed a DNA expert named Bennett Greenspan, president of a company called Family Tree DNA, one of several new technology companies that specialize in helping individuals trace their ancestry through genetic matches.\n\nAnd the technology was exploding. In 2013, only 330,000 Americans had paid for personal DNA testing. By 2017, the number was nearly 5 million. Today, that number is over 12 million, with the largest segment on Ancestry.com — which has more than 7 million profiles in its database.\n\nI called Greenspan and told him about Sharon’s case. He agreed to help.\n\nBut first, I had to ask Sharon if she was willing to try again, knowing the risk of disappointment.\n\n◆ ◆ ◆\n\nSharon was nearing her 85th birthday, and it had been five years since I’d written about her case. In that story, a few years earlier, I had identified a potential relative who was willing to take a DNA test. The relative backed out after the story was published.\n\nWhen I brought up the idea of giving DNA another shot, she was surprisingly game.\n\nI met her at her tidy apartment in Mesa with photojournalist Michael Chow. Sharon had slowed down since the last time I saw her and was limping from a painfully arthritic foot, but she was her usual bright and cheerful self. She had that same lilting sing-song voice I’d heard nearly three decades earlier when she first called me looking for information about her case.\n\nI told her I was worried about her living on the second floor with her foot in such bad shape, and she assured me she was on the waiting list for a first-floor apartment and expected one to become available soon.\n\nWe sat down at her kitchen table and opened the DNA sample kit from Family Tree. I offered to help her with the cheek swab, but she wouldn’t hear of it and insisted on doing it herself.\n\nI boxed her sample up and mailed it that day.\n\nI emailed Greenspan with the kit number, and though it was right before the holidays —the busiest time of year for DNA testing because so many families give the kits as gifts — he agreed to expedite the analysis.\n\nSharon had been expecting a story for that Christmas, but I decided to hold off and wait for the test to come back.\n\nOn January 11, the results came in. The report identified matches in what it called the 30 to 80 centimorgan range. I had no idea what that meant. I emailed Greenspan for help in interpreting the analysis.\n\nDNA TERMS EXPLAINED: A guide to genealogy vocabulary\n\nIt turned out centimorgans measure genetic linkage. Each of us has 6,800 to 7,000, and we share roughly 3,400 to 3,500 centimorgans with each parent; 2,630 for a sibling and 1,766 for a grandparent.\n\nSharon’s numbers were much lower.\n\n“The results mean that no one in our database is close, genetically, to the Hatbox Baby,” Greenspan replied.\n\nHe held out the possibility that as the number of people using Family Tree grew beyond the 1 million or so users at the time, there was a chance a match could show up in the database.\n\nWhen I broke the news to Sharon, she shrugged it off.\n\n“Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?”\n\n◆ Could Sharon be Baby Fulstone?\n\nSix weeks later, Glenda contacted me again, saying she and her brother and sister had all taken DNA tests. I replied that Sharon had taken one as well, and Glenda asked if I would share the results with her.\n\nThere was a hitch: They had used Ancestry and 23andMe, while I had used Family Tree DNA. Because each service uses a proprietary database, two siblings who use different services would not find connections with each other without specialized knowledge.\n\nLater in the day, Glenda sent me another photo. This one stopped me in my tracks.\n\nIt was a photo of Glenda’s grandmother, the woman who had taken the baby away from Glenda’s mother.\n\nI thought the resemblance with Sharon was stunning.\n\nI’ve never been good at seeing likenesses in peoples’ faces, even in my own family, so I sought confirmation by showing the pictures side-by-side to colleagues in the newsroom.\n\n“Is that the same woman?” they asked.\n\nI showed the pictures to my wife. She agreed. The resemblance was uncanny.\n\nGlenda agreed.\n\n“Oh my goodness John, we are stunned, they look like mother / daughter instead of grandmother / grand-daughter,” she wrote.\n\nI told Glenda I would send her a Family Tree DNA test, and gave her the names of the all of the people involved in the Hatbox Baby story: Ed and Julia Stewart; Julia's cousins John and Betty Mansfield, even Edna Sherman Roe, so they could check them against the DNA results they already had from other services.\n\nAnd though I was excited beyond words at being on the brink of finally solving the mystery of the Hatbox Baby, I avoided telling Sharon.\n\nI’d disappointed her too many times, and even though this looked like a sure thing, I didn’t want to let her down again.\n\nSix weeks later Glenda’s results came in.\n\nNo match.\n\nI was glad I hadn’t told Sharon about Glenda’s case, but I felt a little guilty for letting her down again with the whole DNA experiment.\n\nI was afraid we’d reached another in a long string of dead ends.\n\nBut I didn’t know what I didn’t know.\n\nAnother story yields unexpected help\n\nTime was beginning to run out.\n\nI had spent nearly 30 years off and on trying to solve the mystery of the Hatbox Baby and was not much closer than when I had started.\n\nWho had left an infant in a hatbox beside a remote Arizona road on Christmas Eve of 1931?\n\nI wrote my first story on the case in 1988, after Sharon Elliott had called me at the newspaper I worked for. She told me she had recently learned from her dying mother that she was the infant who was found abandoned in the desert in a hatbox between Mesa and Superior on Christmas Eve of 1931.\n\nShe had never known she was adopted.\n\nA DNA test showed no close relatives. A second test was taken after an Oregon woman searching for a sibling sent me a photo of her grandmother that closely resembled Sharon. This time there was no match at all.\n\nA few months after that second disappointment, I tried calling Sharon to see how she was doing. Her number had been disconnected. I drove to her apartment, and the person who answered the door said she had just moved in and didn’t know where the previous tenant had gone.\n\nWith a growing sense of dread, I knocked on a neighbor’s door and asked about Sharon.\n\nThe neighbor told me Sharon had suffered a bad fall because of her arthritic foot and had moved in with family to recuperate.\n\nI talked to her guardian, the husband of Sharon’s granddaughter. He told me she was living with his family for the time being and would be moving to an acute care home not far from her old apartment.\n\nHe was hopeful rehabilitation treatment would help her back on her feet.\n\nBut reading between the lines, he didn’t seem optimistic.\n\nI began to worry that I wouldn’t be able to help Sharon find the answers she’d been seeking for so many years.\n\nI thought back on the stories I’d written and wish I’d done things differently.\n\nI wish I’d have asked more questions of Joe B. Maier, the constable who led the investigation the night Sharon was found. Had he kept a diary or ever filed police reports in the case? I knew Maier long before I ever heard of the Hatbox Baby. He was my neighbor when I was a cub reporter at the Mesa Tribune and living in downtown Mesa.\n\nI regretted not doing a follow-up story after the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" episode. I regretted not trying harder to track down Ed and Julia Stewart, the couple who found the Hatbox Baby, while they were still alive.\n\nI wish I’d have tried again to reach Betty Mansfield, Julia Stewart’s cousin, after her husband hung up on me.\n\nBut opportunities lost are just that, and with each passing day, the chances of finding someone who had firsthand knowledge of Sharon’s case were dwindling.\n\n◆ John D'Anna appears on stage\n\nIn July 2017, I was asked to appear on stage as part of at The Arizona Republic’s Arizona Storytellers project, which features individuals from the community telling personal stories in front of a live audience.\n\nThe theme for the project's sixth anniversary was “stories about stories,” and I was to appear with five of my colleagues to showcase the craft of journalism by telling a true story about something memorable from our careers.\n\nI had just been involved in a fairly significant press-freedom legal case involving stories I’d written about the murder of a priest and the attempted murder of his associate, and I’m pretty sure that was the story my bosses expected me to tell.\n\nBut as the night of the program approached, I decided I’d tell the story of the Hatbox Baby instead. In 35 years practicing journalism, I’ve written thousands of stories and edited probably 10 times that. I’ve been a member of two teams that were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize in breaking news and played a role in \"The Wall\" project that won the Pulitzer this year.\n\nBut out of all those stories, I can’t think of one that has stuck with me as much as Sharon Elliott’s.\n\nWhen I first wrote about Sharon in 1988, I felt pretty good that I had played a role in solving the mystery of whatever became of the Hatbox Baby.\n\nLongtime Republic columnist Don Dedera actually congratulated me and told me that he’d wanted to be the one to find Sharon ever since he first wrote a story on the 30th anniversary of the case in 1961 — the year after I was born.\n\nAnd it definitely stoked my ego to see a story I had written become an \"Unsolved Mysteries\" episode. (If you happen to catch it on Hulu or the Lifetime Network, they actually pan over the story with my byline on it.)\n\nBut as the years passed, I grew to realize that my story had only solved part of the mystery of the Hatbox Baby.\n\nEven after private investigator Alice Syman got involved, and after thousands of tips poured in to \"Unsolved Mysteries,\" Sharon still didn’t know who had abandoned her in the desert or why.\n\nI began to see Sharon in a different light as well.\n\nShe was still the same person with the sunny disposition and the twinkle in her blue eyes whom I'd met in 1988, but she was also someone with a hole in her life.\n\nShe first learned she was adopted at age 55, shortly before the only woman she knew as mother died. The knowledge, in essence, robbed her of blood relatives she thought she’d had in her life. The family lore of her mother, and her mother’s parents and sister, no longer belonged to her.\n\nThe only blood relatives she had now were her daughter, and her daughter’s children and grandchildren. What lore could she pass on to them?\n\nOver the years, I assigned several reporters to do updates on the Hatbox Baby and I wrote several myself.\n\nSharon wanted answers, but there were times when she worried what those answers might be, something most adoptees understand.\n\nSharon relished the romantic theory that she was perhaps the love child of a movie star’s illicit affair. But what if there was some awful story behind her birth? What if she was the product of a criminal act or some unspeakable shame? Wouldn’t she be better off not knowing?\n\nWhen Sharon was in her 70s, I wrote a story about how she had accepted the fact that she might never know the answer and was comfortable just being a mother and grandmother. But when she was in her 80s, she had decided that she really did want to know the answers, regardless of what they were. So willing in fact, that she gamely agreed to take a DNA test.\n\nEvery story I wrote or assigned carried with it the hope that it would jog a memory or yield a clue that would help solve the rest of the mystery.\n\nAnd so when my turn came to take the stage on that Arizona Storytellers night in July 2017, I began to tell the audience of 300 the story of how Sharon had called me one day out of the blue on the city desk and asked if I could help her find information about the “Hatbox Baby.”\n\nI talked about how she was hailed nationwide as a Christmas miracle when she was found in that hatbox on the road from Superior to Mesa by a couple who just happened to have car trouble on Christmas Eve.\n\nI talked about how that couple, Ed and Julia Stewart, never even told their own children they’d found a baby and how upset they were when \"Unsolved Mysteries\" aired an episode based on my story. They maintained until their dying days that they just found the baby, and they resented any implication that they were part of some kind of ruse to help an unwed mother.\n\nI talked about the woman in Oregon as well as another tantalizing clue, a note written in Sharon’s mother’s hand suggesting that her birth mother was an heiress who later died in a plane crash. Both were false starts. I mentioned how the DNA test yielded no close relatives.\n\nI closed by saying that Sharon was not doing well, that she had fallen and broken a hip. I said that I wanted to solve the mystery for her but was worried that time would run out before I could.\n\nI talked about how she was one of the sweetest people I knew, and I said that while journalists aren’t supposed to become a part of the stories they cover, Sharon’s story had become a part of me.\n\nAt the end of the show, as the storytellers mingled with the audience, a woman approached me. She challenged my assertion that the DNA test had proved fruitless. In fact, she said, DNA always provides clues, but sometimes you just have to know how to interpret them.\n\n“I’m Bonnie,” she said. “I’m an amateur DNA genealogist. Maybe I can help.”\n\nA genealogy detective on the case\n\nWhen Bonnie Belza goes out to dinner with friends and the question comes up, she explains DNA by picking up the salt and pepper shakers. Each one represents a parent.\n\nShe sprinkles some of each into a single pile. That’s you, she'll say, a half-salt and half-pepper mix from each parent.\n\nThen she opens up a sugar packet. That’s your spouse, who will be a half-and-half mix of whatever his or her parents are.\n\nAnd if you have kids, their DNA will be half sugar and half salt and pepper.\n\nIt’s a simple visual to help explain a complicated subject, but it’s a subject Belza is passionate about because it pairs so well with one of her other passions: genealogy. And her two passions helped her make more progress in a year and a half than I'd made in 30 years of trying to solve the mystery of the Hatbox Baby.\n\nBelza was in the audience when I laid out the mystery at an Arizona Storytellers event in July 2017.\n\nI recounted the story of a tiny, red-haired newborn who was found in the desert stuffed into a hatbox on Christmas Eve of 1931. I described my attempts over 30 years to help Sharon Elliott find out who abandoned her and why. In that story, I mentioned that several of our attempts to solve the mystery through DNA testing had failed.\n\nBonnie approached me after the show, introduced herself as an amateur DNA genealogist and offered to help.\n\nWe met for coffee a few days later, and, with Sharon’s permission, I gave Bonnie the passwords to Sharon’s Family Tree DNA account.\n\nAt that point, I began to learn how much I didn’t know.\n\nIn the course of my DNA education, I would interview Richard Hill, a scientist and an adoptee who wrote a gripping memoir about how he became one of the first people to track down his birth parents with DNA.\n\nI would also talk with Paul Fronczak, author of \"The Foundling,\" the true story of a baby who was kidnapped from a Chicago maternity ward in 1964. Two years later, an abandoned baby was found in New Jersey and, after some questionable police work and pressure from the media, the toddler was identified as the kidnapped baby and reunited with the Fronczak family.\n\nAs a boy, Fronczak learned of the kidnapping by accident. He had never felt like he fit in with his family, and he always wondered if he really was the baby who had been kidnapped.\n\nDNA testing proved he wasn’t. That wrought a cascade of anger and grief from his parents and opened two other doors: He learned he had a twin sister who has never been found and may have been murdered. And he renewed the mystery of what became of the real Paul Fronczak, who has never been found.\n\nBoth Hill and Fronczak agreed the Hatbox Baby case deserved to be solved and offered to help in any way they could. But for the moment, Bonnie was my tutor, and she started with the basics in Sharon Elliot’s case.\n\n◆ ◆ ◆\n\nSix months before I told Sharon’s story in front of a live audience, I’d had her take a Family Tree DNA test, which came back with what I believed were disappointing results.\n\nWhen Bonnie first approached me, she told me that DNA never fails to yield clues. You just have to know how to interpret them.\n\nLater, as we embarked together on a year and a half long journey into Sharon’s ancestry, Bonnie pointed out that we had used the service Family Tree.\n\nShe suggested we also have Sharon take tests with Ancestry.com and 23andMe, which would lead to more chances of finding a match.\n\nBelza has been down this road before. She’s been interested in genealogy since the 1980s and used it to solve a family mystery about a relative who had disappeared in the early 1900s. She also wanted to learn as much about her family tree as she could for health reasons: Her father had developed retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic eye disease that eventually caused him to go blind.\n\nBonnie had set out on a different path. She started out as a home economics major at Arizona State University, with the intent of becoming a stewardess, which is what flight attendants were called in those days. But she got engaged, which necessitated a change in career paths because, at the time, the airlines required flight attendants to be single.\n\nSo she switched her major to business, which, with engineering, were the only options for anyone who wanted to study computer science.\n\nIn college, she began working for American Express, handling card services and reservations, which used to be done over the phone. She eventually became a collections agent, which required her to use the technique of skip tracing to track down people with delinquent accounts, measures that appealed to her inner snoop.\n\nShe rose through the ranks at American Express, helping usher the company into the computer age. All the while, she was using her newfound skills to try the nascent versions of genealogy software.\n\nDNA TEST KITS: Five things to know before you take one yourself\n\nWhen she retired in 2015, one of the items on her bucket list was to take a cruise through the Panama Canal. A friend told her about a specialty canal cruise for genealogy enthusiasts that featured three of the biggest names in the field: Blaine Bettinger; CeCe Moore, a consultant for the popular television show Finding Your Roots; and Angie Bush, who has degrees in microbiology and biotechnology and is a professional genetic genealogist. Bonnie signed up immediately.\n\nShe was hooked. She never even put on her bathing suit or got in the pool. Instead, she spent almost all of her time at seminars, drinking in as much as she could.\n\nWhen she got back from the cruise, she wasted no time hitting up every relative over age 75 to take DNA tests. It was important to get them while they were still around.\n\nSince then she's attended as many genealogy and DNA conferences and workshops as she could to further her knowledge.\n\n◆ A 5,000 piece jigsaw puzzle\n\nWhen I met her, she was sharing that knowledge by teaching a continuing education class called DNA Kindergarten, where she walked people through the basics.\n\nShe had also used her skills more than half a dozen times to help friends and acquaintances — and sometimes even strangers — solve family mysteries.\n\nShe likens each challenge to solving a 5,000-piece jigsaw puzzle in which every piece is exactly the same size, shape and color — on both sides.\n\nIt’s a challenge she has loved. The precision and structure of the family tree appeal to the computer programmer side of her, and the methodical detective work required provides the thrill of the hunt. There’s also the satisfaction that comes with solving a mystery, even though there is seldom a neatly tied ending, and more often the solution is news the subject of the mystery doesn’t want to hear.\n\nShe tells everyone up front that DNA detective work may unlock deeply uncomfortable secrets that some would rather stay buried. At best, those secrets can provide a measure of comfort to those who long to find out who they are and where they came from. At worst, those secrets can destroy venerated images of ancestors, rewrite cherished kinship lore and fracture families.\n\nHer research into the Hatbox Baby case would be no different. Secrets would be exposed along with troubling truths about virtually every family involved in the case, from the people who found her to the people whose DNA connects them to Sharon in ways they are not comfortable with.\n\nBonnie’s 5,000-piece jigsaw puzzle would build out to half a dozen interlocking trees and a database with more than 4,500 names connected to Sharon's case. And as with any puzzle, the best way to start building it is around the edges.\n\n◆ Tracing back the family tree\n\nThe first step in solving any genealogical relationship mystery is to find the most recent common ancestors, then follow those branches of the family tree to see if they intersect with other branches.\n\nOne of the ways DNA family linkage is expressed is by “shared centimorgans.” Centimorgans measure genetic linkage. Each of us has 6,800 to 7,000, and we share roughly 3,400 to 3,500 centimorgans with each parent; 2,630 for a sibling and 1,766 for a grandparent.\n\nIn Sharon’s first DNA test, her strongest connections showed 30 to 80 shared centimorgans, indicating third or fourth cousins at best.\n\nThird cousins are the great-grandchildren of a great-great-aunt or great-great uncle. A single set of great-great grandparents links them. Fourth cousins share a set of great-great-great grandparents.\n\nUsing genealogy software, along with thousands of family trees posted publicly on online sites like Ancestry.com, Bonnie painstakingly began to trace the highest centimorgan relatives back, generation by generation, to find their most recent common ancestors.\n\nAfter several months, she felt certain that Sharon’s ancestors had descended from German immigrants who initially settled in eastern Iowa in the 1850s, just a few years after Iowa became a state and was eagerly seeking new residents with promises of rich farm soil and the opportunity to own land.\n\nA handful of family names started to emerge. If she could find where those branches intersected, she would have the trunk of the tree: the Hatbox Baby’s birth parents.\n\nAs Bonnie began to log the potential third and fourth cousins identified in Sharon’s DNA profile, she checked them against family trees that were posted publicly online at sites like Ancestry.com.\n\nEach one would become a branch of Sharon's family tree, and eventually would help identify what genealogists call the MRCA, or most recent common ancestor, which is the key to solving virtually every genealogical mystery.\n\nIn Sharon’s case, many of the distant cousins that showed up in her DNA database all seemed to have roots within a 30-mile radius of Davenport, Iowa, mostly from small farm communities along the Mississippi River with names like Lowden, Wheatland, Buffalo and Blue Grass.\n\nFor Bonnie, that presented both a good and a bad problem. On one hand, relatives concentrated in one place might make it easier to find a most recent common ancestor. On the other, tight-knit clans tend to intermarry, which is known in genealogical terms as endogamy and can result in a family tree whose branches are hopelessly tangled.\n\nIn endogamous communities, it’s not unusual to find two brothers who marry two sisters, which would produce two sets of offspring with very similar DNA.There can be other relationships, such as when a father and son marry two sisters, or when second cousins marry, which is legal in the U.S.\n\nSharon’s family tree was similarly complicated.\n\n◆ Crowdsourced DNA could crack the case\n\nLuckily, genealogy has exploded as a passion among the American public. The number of people who have taken home DNA tests will likely eclipse 15 million by the end of this holiday season.\n\nIn addition, millions of people willingly post their family trees online, submit them to local libraries and circulate them to relatives. Current genealogical computer programs also allow data to be downloaded into Excel files, allowing users to build pivot tables and filter for common threads.\n\nUsing public family trees and the computer skills she honed in her long career at American Express, Bonnie painstakingly traced each potential relative, combing public records for confirmation and searching Newspapers.com to see if any of them ever made headlines.\n\nAfter several months she had built out a family tree so large it could no longer be viewed in its entirety on one computer screen. She went old-school and hung a 12-foot roll of newsprint in the hallway of her Scottsdale home. An index card carried each name, along with dates of birth and death.\n\nSome of the cards contained a single question mark.\n\nFor Bonnie, Sharon’s case had become a passion, but it was also a labor of love. She feels incredible empathy for adoptees who long to know where they came from, and this was particularly so in Sharon’s case.\n\nIt must be so hard, she often said, when the only flesh-and-blood relative you really know is your own child.\n\nBonnie wanted to make sure Sharon understood the research she was doing. She sat with Sharon for several hours one day and explained how DNA works, but instead of using salt, pepper and sugar, she illustrated the concept with the brightly colored beads that she uses in her DNA Kindergarten class.\n\nAnd she kept up with her research. By November 2017, she had a list of surnames that had strong possibilities. First among them: Strackbein. Other strong contenders were Kautz and Roth.\n\nBy early December, Bonnie had found the one place where those names intersected. The trunk of Sharon's family tree.\n\nWas a decades-old mystery about to be solved?\n\nHer mother died when she was three months old, and her father, with six older children, could not care for a seventh. Her uncle, so the family story goes, took the train to a funeral one day and came home with a baby.\n\nBy the time she was 12, she would be orphaned again and left to the care of older cousins who lived in a 19th-century farmhouse 30 miles north of Davenport, Iowa.\n\nA few years later, she would be working as a servant for a well-to-do family who lived in a mansion on a hill overlooking the Mississippi River.\n\nAs one relative put it, she felt her family turned her back on her, so she turned her back on the family.\n\nWe don’t know how she met the man she would marry.\n\nWe do know that she was the mother of Sharon Elliott, the Arizona woman known as the Hatbox Baby, and she was nearly five months pregnant when she married.\n\nThe man she married came from Iowa farm stock as well, growing up near the towns of Buffalo and Blue Grass, about 15 miles west of Davenport.\n\nHis mother, prim and proper, came from a well-to-do family that owned a prosperous lumber business. His father owned a large farm in the rich bottom land along the Mississippi, and together the men in the family ran a threshing business, helping other farm families at harvest time.\n\nAnd we know that he was Sharon's father.\n\n◆ A family history finally revealed\n\nDNA genealogist Bonnie Belza had been closing in on the mystery for weeks.\n\nShe had isolated several distinct family lines in Sharon's DNA. For 30 years, we had searched for this connection in an attempt to solve the mystery of the baby found abandoned in a hatbox in the Arizona desert on Christmas Eve of 1931.\n\nThose family lines, Strackbein, Roth, and Kautz, belonged to German immigrants who had settled near Davenport in the 1850s.\n\nThey came from Wonderthausen, a town in the North Rhine-Westphalia region about 75 miles from Dusseldorf, with a history that dates to the early 1300s.\n\nUnder Prussian rule in the 1800s, the region had transformed from a feudal society in which peasants were not allowed to own land to a more egalitarian system. But inheritance rules favored the oldest children, meaning there was little opportunity for younger siblings to own land. The winters were harsh, taxation was high, and military service was compulsory.\n\nAs transatlantic transportation improved, hundreds took the opportunity to emigrate. Among them were members of the Strackbein family, who settled in and around the town of Wheatland, Iowa, and nearby Lowden.\n\nOn Dec. 19, two days after Sharon's 86th birthday, Bonnie emailed me.\n\n“The couple - that are possibly the parents of Sharon are Freda Strackbein (b 1908 d 1991) and Walter Kautz Roth (b 1909 d 2005),” she said.\n\nFreda Strackbein and Walter Kautz Roth.\n\nFor the first time since I began writing about Sharon Elliott’s quest to find who abandoned her as an infant in the desert, there was a plausible theory, one that was based on science and evidence-based reasoning.\n\nBonnie told me that Walter and Freda had married on Aug. 1, 1931 — four and a half months before Sharon Elliott was born — and that they had another child who was born in 1933.\n\nIf Bonnie was right, that meant Sharon had a brother she never knew.\n\nIt also meant a whole new layer of complexity to the Hatbox Baby mystery: Why would a married couple give up their baby, even if it had been conceived out of wedlock, and how did that baby get from Iowa to the Arizona desert?\n\nBonnie had traced both Walter and Freda’s family trees extensively and was confident she had the right couple. But there still could be other possibilities. What if Walter’s brother had been the father? That would produce roughly the same DNA match.\n\nI was excited by Bonnie’s news, but I had to be cautious about what I shared with Sharon. The first time I’d brought up DNA testing in 2011 turned into a crushing disappointment for her, and I’d seen enough dead ends to know this, as promising as it looked, could be another one.\n\nI decided I would tell her that Bonnie had isolated several family lines and describe the German and eastern Iowa connections without naming Walter and Freda.\n\nI drove out to the sprawling care home in East Mesa where Sharon was trying without much luck to rehab her broken hip. In all the years I knew her, I never heard Sharon utter a cross word, but I know she didn’t think much of the food there. Whenever I visited I always asked if I could bring her anything next time. The answer was usually “snacks.”\n\nChester’s Puffcorn was her favorite, and I brought two bags with me, along with some Hershey’s kisses for her sweet tooth.\n\nBut when I got there, Sharon wasn’t there, and because I wasn’t a direct family member, the staff couldn’t tell me where she’d gone.\n\nI called Sharon’s granddaughter, who told me Sharon had taken a turn for the worse and was in the intensive care unit.\n\nI drove to Banner Baywood and found her room. The nurses said it was OK for her to have a visitor. I found her sitting up picking at her hospital food.\n\nShe said she was on the mend and would be out in a couple of days.\n\nI decided to stick with my plan and describe what Bonnie had found in general terms.\n\n“You’ve been busy,” Sharon said.\n\nBut Bonnie had been busier.\n\nShe’d combed Newspapers.com and not only found Walter and Freda’s obituaries, but also their wedding announcement, which noted that for their honeymoon, the couple planned to take “an extended trip to Sioux City and points west.”\n\nDid points west mean Arizona?\n\nBonnie also found an obituary for their son.\n\nJames Evan Roth, perhaps the brother Sharon never knew, had just died two weeks earlier.\n\n◆ ◆ ◆\n\nI decided to wait until after the holidays to contact his family.\n\nWhen I did, I told the woman on the phone who I was and a little bit about Sharon’s case.\n\nThen I told her it was very likely that James had a sibling he never knew about.\n\nShe told me it was a lot to take in and asked me to write everything down in an email.\n\nI called her a week later. She seemed perplexed about how DNA could identify Walter and Freda as the parents if neither they nor their son had taken a DNA test. I tried to explain, and then told her she could settle the question — and provide the answers Sharon had been seeking for 30 years — if she would take a DNA test. I told her I would pay for it.\n\nShe said it was out of the question.\n\nIt wasn’t the answer I had been expecting.\n\nWhen I asked why, she told me that if her ancestors had gone to their graves with a secret, it wasn’t her place to expose it.\n\nI would drive out to California twice to try to convince her to change her mind, but with no luck.\n\nIf we were to prove Walter and Freda were definitely Sharon Elliott’s birth parents, we would need to do it without their son’s family.\n\nWe would need a lucky break.\n\nIt would come four months later.\n\nDNA tests are not static snapshots in time. When you submit your saliva sample, the results become part of the database of whatever company you’ve chosen to go with. As more people take tests, their results are added to the database.\n\nIn April of 2018, a new match showed up in Sharon’s DNA profile. It was a strong connection, in the first-cousin range.\n\nBonnie reached out. The connection turned out to be a 39-year-old woman who lived near Davenport, Iowa.\n\nHer name was Emily Dodds Farro. She was married, had two children, and owned a small business with her husband, who is a U.S. Army veteran.\n\nAnd she was an adoptee looking for her birth parents.\n\nEmily’s DNA not only tied her directly to Sharon, but also to Walter and Freda Roth. And it connected them all in a way that confirmed that Walter and Freda were Sharon’s birth parents.\n\nEven though Bonnie had isolated Sharon’s most likely birth parents months earlier, I had avoided giving Sharon the details because I wanted to be sure, and though we had the who, we still didn’t have the how or why the Hatbox Baby got from Iowa to the middle of the Arizona desert.\n\nBut after Emily’s DNA profile surfaced, providing concrete proof that Sharon was the daughter of Walter Kautz Roth and Freda Strackbein Roth, I decided to lay it out for Sharon. I told her everything I knew about Walter and Freda and their son James, the brother Sharon never knew she had.\n\nI even showed her pictures.\n\nShe showed no reaction at all.\n\nI asked her about it on my next visit.\n\nShe said she’d given the pictures and the family tree information to her great-grandson, Erik Clark, to take care of.\n\nI asked her if the reason she didn’t feel a connection was because those were the people who didn’t want her.\n\nShe smiled and shrugged and said, “Could be.”\n\nIt was clearly a lot to take in. When I finally told her about Emily, she was thrilled and began referring to Emily as her niece.\n\nEven if that was the only thing that came out of our 30-year search, it would have been enough.\n\n◆ Another adopted child gets answers\n\nWhen you send in your DNA sample, you open yourself up to certain risks, and one of those is learning things you would rather not have known. Sharon willingly took that risk. She knew her birth parents could have been poor or criminals or that she could have been conceived in scandal or shame.\n\nAs a journalist writing about other people’s DNA tests, I began to learn that I would also face similar risks. People who had willingly made their results public in their own quests for answers had put me in the position of having information that others would rather I did not have.\n\nFrom Emily’s DNA profile, Bonnie was able to find Emily's branch in the family tree and identify her birth mother — a relative of James Roth.\n\nI was caught in the middle. If I tried to pursue the relative with this new information, it could jeopardize any chance Emily had of trying to connect with her birth mother. But Emily could also jeopardize any chance I had of getting this person to help me paint the picture of Walter and Freda and find out how and why Sharon wound up in the desert on Christmas Eve of 1931.\n\nI decided to step back and see how things with Emily and her birth mother played out.\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nShe reached out several times by phone and by mail. She sent a letter with pictures of her children and a description of her life in Iowa.\n\nIt was returned. She sent a certified letter. In it, she thanked her birth mother for giving her the gift of life. She told her she had been blessed with a wonderful adoptive family (who supported her in her search), along with a loving husband, two terrific children, and a successful business.\n\nThat too was returned.\n\nWith that, Emily decided she would respect her birth mother’s wishes to be left alone.\n\nWhile her attempts to contact her birth mother were disappointing, Emily was delighted to learn she was related to Sharon and sent her a card with photos of her children.\n\nIn November, I told Sharon I would be going to Iowa at the end of the month to find out more about Walter and Freda. She was more interested in whether I was going to see Emily.\n\nI told her I would.\n\nIn the meantime, I wanted to do as much research as I could in advance so I could make the most of my trip.\n\nThe quest to solve the mystery of the Hatbox Baby is one filled with remarkable coincidences. I just happened to pick up the phone when Sharon called. DNA genealogist Bonnie Belza just happened to be in the audience when I told Sharon’s story. Emily Farro just happened to be looking for her birth mother and provided the link that would prove Sharon’s birth parents.\n\nBut none of those coincidences were as random or bizarre as one that would occur before I left for Iowa.\n\n◆ ◆ ◆\n\nAfter an early morning fitness class, I ran into a fellow class member at the Starbucks across the parking lot. We talked a bit about our jobs, and I mentioned a couple of stories I’d written along with the one I was currently working on — the Hatbox Baby.\n\nAs we pa", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/23"}]}

Naturally, we grow basketball here, right? ;)\n\nNBA rosters are littered with former Hoosier prep stars. But not every can't-miss prospect hit it big. Since 2003, 73 players from Indiana were ranked in Rivals' annual list of Top 150 recruits.\n\nSo how have the state's top-ranked recruits from the past 15 years fared? Glad you asked.\n\n2003\n\nKenny Harris, No. 76, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Griffith/Bishop Noll\n\nCity: Hammond\n\nCollege: Valparaiso\n\nA mammoth Indiana All-Star dubbed \"Baby Shaq,\" he averaged 17.4 points and 10.5 rebounds as a senior after transferring to Griffith. He was IndyStar Mr. Basketball runner-up to Pike's Justin Cage.\n\nBut his basketball career was cut short. Harris collapsed in the Valparaiso weight room April 11, 2005. His heart stopped and required a defibrillator to resuscitate it. He was on a ventilator and in a coma for a month.\n\n\"When he passed out, they hit him with the paddles seven times,\" Harris' father Kenneth Jolly told Northwest Times of Indiana. \"How many people you know survive that?\"\n\nHarris' playing days were over and doctors couldn't explain why he collapsed. He has worked as a bailiff in Crown Point and at a hospital in Hammond.\n\n\"Bitter? Not at all. I'm alive. I'm OK. I've moved on,\" he told NWI. \"I'm a man now.\"\n\nHe played in 50 games for Valpo, starting 11 times as a sophomore. He averaged 6.7 points and 4.1 rebounds for his career.\n\nExperiencing Indiana Basketball: Gregg Doyel finds out what Indiana basketball is all about\n\nA class only taught in Indiana: Sam Alford teaches today's youth about the great history of Indiana high school basketball\n\nJustin Cage, No. 110, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Pike\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Xavier\n\nThe 2003 IndyStar Mr. Basketball led Pike to a 29-0 record and Class 4A state title as a senior.\n\nHe became an instant contributor for the Musketeers, playing in all 36 games as a freshman, including starting the last 18 games of the season on a team that reached the Elite Eight. He started 113 straight games to finish his Xavier career.\n\nA three-time selection to the Atlantic 10 All-Defensive Team, he was far from a one-trick pony, scoring 1,181 points in his career. He averaged 9.0 points and 4.9 rebounds for his career.\n\nHe played on NBA Summer League teams (Chicago, Phoenix) in 2007 and 2008 and for the Colorado 14ers in the G League before heading to Europe. He currently plays for Mons-Hainaut in Belgium, where's been since 2009.\n\n► Rankings missed on: Brandon Crone (Frankfort/Butler).\n\n2004\n\nRobert Vaden, No. 38, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Pike/Cathedral/Bridgton Academy\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Indiana/UAB\n\nAfter transferring from Cathedral to Pike, Vaden went out east to Maine to clean up his academics.\n\n\"It was hard to leave Pike knowing that I had a chance to be Mr. Basketball in Indiana, but if I hadn't gone to Bridgton, I never would have been able to play at IU,'' Vaden told IndyStar in 2004.\n\nVaden, who originally committed to Purdue, started every game he played for the Hoosiers (60 games), averaging 11.9 points, 3.5 rebounds and 2.9 assists. When coach Mike Davis was fired by IU and then hired at UAB, Vaden followed him and became one of the nation's top pure scorers.\n\n\"When coach Davis resigned, I said I was gone, and I don't know if people didn't think I was serious or what, but I was serious,'' Vaden said in 2006. \"I came to IU to play for coach Davis and I want to continue my career where he is coaching.\"\n\nHe was first-team All-Conference USA as a junior, averaging 21.1 points a game and led the Blazers to back-to-back NIT appearances. He's 21st all-time in 3-pointers made in NCAA Division I history. Vaden's 3-pointer with 3.3 seconds left lifted IU past San Diego State in the first round of the 2006 NCAA tournament.\n\nLove Indiana high school basketball? Then you'll love IndyStar's newest book!\n\nVaden was taken 54th in the in the 2009 NBA draft by the Charlotte Bobcats and subsequently traded to Oklahoma City. However, he never played in the NBA. He spent time with OKC's developmental squad (Tulsa 66ers) and played in Italy, Slovakia, Germany and Belgium before returning to the G League in 2014.\n\nA.J. Ratliff, No. 77, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: North Central\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Indiana\n\nWinner of IndyStar Mr. Basketball in one of the closest votes in the award's history, Ratliff received 48 votes, with White River Valley's A.J. Graves getting 46 and Fort Wayne Elmhurst's James Hardy 44.\n\nRatliff's career at IU was defined by inconsistency. He started just 39 of of 93 career games, and after a solid junior season averaging 9.3 points and shooting 40 percent from behind the arc, Ratliff missed the first semester of his senior year because of an academic suspension and then lasted just nine games after that, leaving the team for \"personal issues.\"\n\nHe finished his Hoosiers career averaging 5.8 points and 2.2 rebounds a game.\n\nJames Hardy, No. 80, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Elmhurst\n\nCity: Fort Wayne\n\nCollege: Indiana\n\nFinished third in the voting for Mr. Basketball behind A.J. Ratliff and A.J Graves, Hardy was a two-sport standout in high school and decided to focus solely on football following his freshman season at IU.\n\nHe was a star for IU. He was a special college receiver with size (6-6), great hands and superb body control. His career numbers with the Hoosiers remain staggering. He is the Hoosiers' all-time leader in career receptions (191), career receiving yards (2,740), career receiving touchdowns (36), single-season receptions (79), and single-season touchdown catches (16).\n\nHardy was taken in the second round, No. 41 overall, by Buffalo in the 2008 NFL draft, but his professional career was derailed by injuries. In June, his body was found in the Maumee River, the cause of death ruled suicide. He was 31 years old.\n\n\"We always had a good relationship even when he stopped playing basketball,\" former Hoosiers coach Mike Davis told IndyStar. \"It broke my heart. As a coach, you want your players to outlive you.”\n\nJ.R. Angle, No. 136, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Indian Creek\n\nCity: Trafalgar\n\nCollege: Iowa\n\nAngle graduated as Johnson County's all-time leading scorer (1,689 points) and chose to play for former IU star Steve Alford at Iowa. Alford left for New Mexico and another former Indiana prep standout took over the Hawkeyes: Butler coach Todd Lickliter.\n\nAngle never really found his footing in Iowa City. He started just four of 62 career games, averaging just 7.4 minutes a game for his career. He averaged 1.9 points and 1.1 rebounds as a Hawkeye and played just five games as a senior.\n\nReturned to Indiana and was an assistant coach for Greenfield-Central boys program in 2016.\n\n► Rankings missed on: Courtney Lee (Pike/Western Kentucky), George Hill (Broad Ripple/IUPUI), A.J. Graves (White River Valley/Butler).\n\n2005\n\nJosh McRoberts, No. 2, 5 stars\n\nHigh School: Carmel\n\nCity: Carmel\n\nCollege: Duke\n\nMcRoberts led the Greyhounds to a 21-4 record (their most wins since the 1993 semistate team) and a berth in the sectional title game as a senior. He averaged 17.9 points, 11.4 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 2.9 blocks per game that year. He could have gone pro straight out of high school, but instead chose to play for Coach K. He was the only one of the nation's top-six prospects to go to college. Gerald Green (No. 1), Monta Ellis (No. 3), Andray Blatche (No. 4), Martell Webster (No. 5) and Andrew Bynum (No. 6) all went straight to the NBA (McRoberts, Green, Ellis and Bynum would alleventually play for the Pacers during their pro careers).\n\nAs a freshman at Duke, he averaged 8.7 points and 5.3 rebounds, starting 31 of 36 games for the nation's No. 1 team. He returned for his sophomore season and posted 13.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 2.5 blocks a game.\n\nHe declared for the 2007 NBA draft and was a second round pick by Portland (No. 37 overall). McRoberts played in just eight games for the Trail Blazers and was traded to his hometown Pacers on draft night in 2008 with Jarrett Jack and Brandon Rush for Jerryd Bayless and Ike Diogu. He played three seasons in Indiana, averaging 5.4 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.1 assists a game in 147 games. He spent seven more seasons in the NBA (Lakers, Magic, Bobcats, Heat and Mavericks), with his best statistical season coming in 2013-14 with Charlotte where he started 78 times and averaged 8.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.3 assists a game.\n\nDominic James, No. 61, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Richmond\n\nCity: Richmond\n\nCollege: Marquette\n\nJames averaged a state-best 31.1 points per game as a senior and added 7.1 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 3.9 steals a game finishing as IndyStar Mr. Basketball runner-up. He scored 49 points in a game, breaking Richmond's 97-year old single-game scoring record.\n\nHe made an immediate impact at Marquette winning Big East Rookie of the Year and was first-team All-Big East as a sophomore. He finished his Golden Eagles career second all-time in games played (129) and assists (632), third in points (1,749) and fourth in steals (238).\n\nHe went undrafted in 2009 and spent most of his pro career overseas, giving his passport a workout with stops in Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Italy, France and Qatar. He spent last year with the Greensboro Swarm of the NBA G League.\n\nHe now goes by Dominic Wright, taking the last name of his once-estranged father, Greg.\n\nLuke Zeller, No. 79, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Washington\n\nCity: Washington\n\nCollege: Notre Dame\n\nZeller's midcourt heave at the buzzer of the 2005 Class 3A state title game may go down as the best game-winner in state finals history since Bobby Plump. He averaged 19.6 points, 8.9 rebounds and 4.0 assists per game as a senior for the 27-2 Hatchets. He won IndyStar Mr. Basketball and was a McDonald's All American. He graduated as Washington's all-time leading scorer (1,727 career points).\n\nZeller started just 32 of 128 games for the Fighting Irish (and just seven his final two seasons). He never averaged more than 5.0 points a game, though he did serve as a team captain his senior year.\n\nHe played professionally in Japan and Lithuania before returning stateside to the G League. Zeller would eventually reach the NBA, playing 16 NBA games, all with Phoenix in 2012-13. He finished with career averages of 1.2 points and 0.6 rebounds a game.\n\n► Rankings missed on: Deonta Vaughn (Arlington/Cincinnati).\n\n2006\n\nGreg Oden, No. 1, 5 stars\n\nHigh School: Lawrence North\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Ohio State\n\nOden led Lawrence North to three straight Class 4A state championships, was named National Player of the Year — twice, and obviously won IndyStar Mr. Basketball honors.\n\nOn the day he and Lawrence North teammate Mike Conley committed to the Buckeyes, IndyStar's sports editor sent an intern to Ohio State for campus reaction. Oden was the nation's top recruit and Conley was a top-20 prospect himself. Granted it was the summer time, but no one on the Buckeyes' campus had heard of the LN duo. Well, it didn't take long for people in Columbus to catch on.\n\nAs freshmen, Oden and Conley led the Buckeyes to the national championship game, eventually losing to Florida. The seven-footer averaged 15.7 points, 9.6 rebounds and 3.3 blocks a game as a Buckeye. He declared for the NBA draft, and was selected No. 1 overall by Portland — ahead of Kevin Durant.\n\nKnee injuries derailed Oden's career. He played 82 games combined in his first two seasons, averaging 9.4 points and 7.3 rebounds a game for the Trail Blazers, but missed all of the 2011, 2012 and 2013 seasons. He returned to action for the 2013-14 season with Miami, playing 23 games (including six starts), but was a shell of his old self.\n\nHe attempted NBA comebacks, but never made the league again. His final playing days were spent in China, where he had a 25-game stint in 2015-16.\n\nHe returned to Ohio State to finish his sports industry degree and is a student manager for the Buckeyes basketball team.\n\n\"It's important for me to come back to get my education, because I promised my mom that I was going to do it,\" Oden told Fox Sports' Rob Stone. \"I'm older. I'm not taking advantage of campus as much as I did when I was 18 years old. Coming back to school at this age, I want to learn this stuff. I want to get as much knowledge about this industry that I can. I want to soak it all up, so that when that time does come for me to get that job, I can be well prepared.\"\n\nMike Conley, No. 18, 5 stars\n\nHigh School: Lawrence North\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Ohio State\n\nA key part of Lawrence North's three-straight Class 4A state titles, Conley finished runner-up to teammate Greg Oden in the Mr. Basketball voting.\n\nLike Oden, Conley left Columbus after one season. Oden went No. 1 in the 2007 NBA draft, and Conley wasn't far behind at No. 4. He's spent his entire NBA career with the Memphis Grizzlies. He hasn't made an All-Star team but he's been among the steadiest point guards in the league the past decade, though injuries have taken a toll. He's missed parts of seven seasons with various ailments. This year, he played 12 games before suffering a season-ending Achilles injury. It's no coincidence the Grizzlies are brutally bad this season without him (last place in the Western Conference).\n\nHis best season came in 2016-17 when he averaged 20.5 points and 6.3 assists a game. A decent return after signing a five-year, $153 million contract that offseason, which was the richest deal by total value in league history at the time.\n\nJamil Tucker, No. 60, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Gary West Side\n\nCity: Gary\n\nCollege: Virginia\n\nTucker averaged 18.5 points, 11.0 rebounds and 4.2 assists a game as a senior at Gary West Side. At Virginia, he played in 88 games, starting seven, and averaged 5.3 points and 3.1 rebounds a game before being dismissed from the team for academics his senior season.\n\nLuke Harangody, No. 104, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Andrean\n\nCity: Schererville\n\nCollege: Notre Dame\n\nHarangody led Andrean to three sectional titles, finishing his prep career with 1,527 points (18.8 per game) and 850 rebounds (10.5 per game). He stayed in northern Indiana for college and put together one of the most-storied careers in Notre Dame history.\n\nHe was second-team All-American three times, a first-team All-Big East selection three times and the Big East Player of the Year in 2008. He graduated as the first player in Irish history with 2,000 career points and 1,000 career rebounds. He led the Big East in scoring and rebounding in consecutive seasons (2008, 2008), becoming the first to achieve the feat. And he was the first Big East player to average 20.0 points and 10.0 rebounds in league play for his career.\n\nHe's second on Notre Dame's all-time scoring list with 2,476 points. Only Austin Carr has scored more. And he's second on the school's all-time rebounding list (1,222). Only Tom Hawkins had more. His 64 career doubles are 10 more than second place LaPhonso Ellis.\n\nHe was a second round pick in the 2010 NBA draft by Boston. He played 28 games for the Celtics and then 21 games for Cleveland his rookie season, averaging 3.9 points and 2.9 rebounds between them. He yo-yoed between Cleveland and its G League affiliate in Canton and played 21 games for the Cavaliers in 2012, starting one game before being waived.\n\nHe played for the Fort Wayne Mad Ants (2012-13) before heading overseas with stints in Russia, Spain, Turkey and Germany, where he currently plays.\n\nArmon Bassett, No. 122, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Terre Haute South/Hargrave Military Academy\n\nCity: Terre Haute\n\nCollege: Indiana/Ohio\n\nA starter at IU during his two seasons in Bloomington, Bassett averaged 10.4 points and 3.3 assists in 61 games for the Hoosiers. He transferred to Ohio after his sophomore season and his MVP performance in the MAC tournament lifted the Bobcats to the 2010 NCAA tournament. In his one season at Ohio, he averaged 17.1 points and 3.5 assists a game. He scored 32 points in Ohio's first-round upset win over Georgetown in the NCAA tournament, but not long after the Bobcats' March run, Bassett was arrested for assaulting a doorman at an Athens, Ohio bar. It wouldn't be the last time he ran afoul of the law.\n\nIn January 2016, he was arrested on domestic violence charges, which were eventually dismissed. A month later, he was convicted of possession of a firearm and possession of a controlled substance. He also plead to a case of driving while a habitual traffic offender and was arrested again in November of 2016 on drug charges.\n\nMarques Johnson, No. 130, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Fort Wayne Snider\n\nCity: Fort Wayne\n\nCollege: Tennessee/North Carolina State/Georgia State\n\nJohnson averaged 15.1 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.3 assists as a senior at Snider and started his college career at Tennessee, only playing in four games before transferring to N.C. State after one semester his freshman year.\n\nHe played 21 times for the Wolfpack in 2007-08, including six starts, averaging 2.0 points and 1.6 rebounds. He then transferred again, this time to Georgia State. After sitting out a year, he took over the Panthers' starting point guard duties, making 46 starts from 2009-11. As a senior, he averaged 5.2 points, 2.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists a game.\n\n► Rankings missed on: Chris Kramer (Huntington North/Purdue), Vaughn Duggins (Pendleton Heights/Wright State)\n\n2007\n\nEric Gordon, No. 2, 5 stars\n\nHigh School: North Central\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Indiana\n\nGordon averaged 29 points, 6.2 rebounds and 3.3 assists as a senior and led North Central to the Class 4A state title game, losing to E'Twaun Moore's East Chicago Central squad. He won IndyStar Mr. Basketball, was a McDonald's All American and a first-team Parade All-American.\n\nOriginally committed to Illinois, Gordon gave IU a long look once Kelvin Sampson took over for Mike Davis.\n\n\"If this was Mike Davis, it would be cut-and-dried,\" Eric Gordon Sr. told IndyStar in 2006. \"Eric said he didn't want to go to IU and that was it. But when (Eric) made the commitment (to Illinois), this coaching staff wasn't in place. And I'm sure (the Sampson staff) feel they owe it to Indiana basketball to at least take a run at the best player in the state, if not the country. I wonder what they'd think of Sampson if he didn't go after Eric? They'd run him out of town.''\n\nSampson was eventually run out of town, but for different reasons. Gordon became his first big recruiting win for the Hoosiers. His freshman year was one of the best individual seasons the program has seen in the last two decades. In 2007-08, Gordon led the Big Ten in scoring, set a conference record for points by a freshman and was named an All-American.\n\nCurrently in his 10th NBA season (second with Houston), Gordon has always been able to score, but often dogged by injuries. When healthy, he's one of the league's top shooters (won 2017 3-Point Contest) and certainly isn't shy about launching. He's averaging nine 3-point attempts a game this season. He finished fourth in 3-pointers made last season and won the 2016-17 Sixth Man of the Year. For his career, he's averaged 16.8 points, 3.1 assists and 2.5 rebounds a game.\n\nE'Twaun Moore, No. 35, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: East Chicago Central\n\nCity: East Chicago\n\nCollege: Purdue\n\nMoore averaged 21.2 points, 5.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game during his senior year, leading East Chicago Central to the Class 4A state title.\n\nA celebrated member of the \"Baby Boilers,\" he was a two-time first-team All-Big Ten performer and became just the third player in Big Ten history to post 2,000 points (2,136), 500 rebounds (611), and 400 assists (400) in a career. No one has played more games, minutes, had more starts and won more games for Purdue than Moore.\n\nIn his seventh NBA season and his fourth team, Moore is having his best year this season. He's started 60 of 62 games for the Pelicans, averaging a career-high 12.3 points in a career-high 31.8 minutes a game.\n\nJaJuan Johnson, No. 42, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Franklin Central\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Purdue\n\nAnother of the \"Baby Boilers\" group, Johnson was the man in the middle erasing shots, hitting soft jumpers and rattling the rim with crowd-pleasing dunks.\n\nJohnson averaged 20.6 points and 9.1 rebounds as a senior for Franklin Central, leading the Flashes to a sectional title and a memorable Hinkle Fieldhouse regional final against North Central (Eric Gordon's Panthers won 49-44).\n\nJohnson improved his scoring and rebounding in each of his four seasons at Purdue. In scoring, from 5.4 to 13.4 to 15.5 to 20.5 as a senior. In rebounding, 3.1 to 5.6 to 7.1 to 8.6 as a senior. Those senior-year numbers earned him 2011 Big Ten Player of the Year and first-team All-American honors. For good measure, he added conference Defensive Player of the Year, finishing his career second on the Purdue's all-time blocks list (behind only Joe Barry Carroll).\n\nHe was a first-round pick by Boston (No. 27) and played 36 games as a rookie, averaging 3.2 points and 1.6 rebounds in limited action. He spent two seasons in the G League before heading overseas to play in Italy, China, Turkey and Russia. He currently plays for Darüşşafaka S.K. in Turkey, which is coached by former Cleveland Cavaliers coach David Blatt.\n\nJeff Teague, No. 57, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Pike\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Wake Forest\n\nSon of former Indiana All-Star Shawn Teague, Jeff averaged 21.5 points, 4.0 assists and 2.0 steals per game as a senior, becoming an All-Star himself. He led Pike to a 20-5 record, but the Red Devils lost to North Central in the loaded Hinkle Regional.\n\nHe played two seasons at Wake Forest, averaging 18.8 points and 3.5 assists his sophomore season, earning second-team All-ACC honors. He declared for the draft and was taken 19th overall by Atlanta.\n\nIt took Teague two seasons to learn his way, averaging just 4.2 points per game his first two years. But he moved into a starter's role in Year 3, and hasn't looked back. He played his first seven seasons for Atlanta (12.1 ppg, 5.2 apg) and was an All-Star in 2015. He was traded to his hometown Pacers for the 2016-17 season and started all 82 games in Indiana, averaging 15.3 points and a career-best 7.8 assists a game. This offseason, he signed a free agent deal with Minnesota and is having another solid year (13.7 ppg, 6.9 apg) in 55 starts.\n\nRobbie Hummel, No. 75, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Valparaiso\n\nCity: Valparaiso\n\nCollege: Purdue\n\nWith fellow Boiler recruit Scott Martin as his running mate, Hummel averaged 15.7 points, 7.1 rebounds and 4.1 assists for Valparaiso as a senior and led the Vikings to a sectional title. They lost to eventual Class 4A champ East Chicago Central in the regional final.\n\nNo Purdue fan will look at Minnesota's Williams Arena without a shudder and feeling of what could have been. If Hummel doesn't slip and tear his knee up against the Gophers in 2010, maybe the Boilers finish the season in the Final Four. Things were certainly trending that way. Purdue was 24-3 and had just won its 10th straight Big Ten game and ranked No. 3 in the country. The Boilers lost their very next game, and lost in the Sweet 16 to Duke.\n\nAfter sitting out a year because of the injury, he didn't get to finish his career with classmates JaJuan Johnson and E'Twaun Moore. But as a senior in 2011-12, he averaged career-bests in points (16.4) and rebounds (7.2).\n\nA second-round pick by the Timberwolves (No. 58), he played in Spain before returning to the States and appearing in 98 games for Minnesota, including nine starts. He averaged 3.9 points and 2.7 rebounds over two seasons with the T-Wolves (2013-15). He went back to Europe, playing in Italy and Russia before coming home.\n\nHe's currently an analyst for the Big Ten Network and doing a fantastic job, if you don't mind us saying.\n\nScott Martin, No. 76, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Valparaiso\n\nCity: Valparaiso\n\nCollege: Purdue/Notre Dame\n\nMartin averaged 22.2 points, 9.1 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game as a senior at Valparaiso. He joined teammate Robbie Hummel in Purdue's loaded class, but lasted just one season in West Lafayette. He played in all but two of the Boilers' games as a freshman (8.5 ppg, 3.8 rpg and 1.4 apg), but decided to transfer to Notre Dame. He sat out the next two years, first because of transfer rules and then because of a torn ACL.\n\nHe returned to the court in 2010-11, and started 33 games for the Fighting Irish and averaged 9.7 points and 4.8 rebounds per game. He started all 33 games a year later and was granted a rare sixth-year of eligibility. Knee issues cut short his senior season with 17 games left.\n\nDespite the a rash of injuries, Martin was convinced by Notre Dame coach Mike Brey to pursue a proffesional playing career.\n\n“Coach Brey and I talked almost right after (the surgery) happened, and I wasn’t sure I was going to play,” Martin told the Newcastle Observer in 2014. “Coach said, ‘You know, you really can’t end like this.’ He was right, and I felt the same way, so I worked hard rehabbing to get myself back in shape, and I got this opportunity.”\n\nThat opportunity was in England with the Newcastle Eagles, where he played before signing with BK JIP Pardubice of the Czech Republic this summer.\n\nMatt Howard, No. 91, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Connersville\n\nCity: Connersville\n\nCollege: Butler\n\nConnersville went 37-7 in Howard's final two seasons, but lost to Batesville in the sectional both years. He averaged 23.1 points and 14.4 rebounds a game as a senior and was the first top-100 nationally ranked prospect to pick Butler since such rankings became so common.\n\nHe didn't disappoint. He graduated in 2011 as the winningest player in program history and its third-leading scorer (1,939) and rebounder (884). Along with the likes of Gordon Hayward and Shelvin Mack, he was among the pillars that pulled the Bulldogs to unforeseen heights: a pair of national championship game appearances.\n\nHoward was the 2009 Horizon League Player of the Year and the conference's tournament player of the year in 2011. He went overseas and has played in Greece, Germany, France and is currently playing for Hapoel Tel Aviv in Israel.\n\nGary McGhee, No. 150, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Anderson Highland\n\nCity: Anderson\n\nCollege: Pittsburgh\n\nA 6-11 center, McGhee averaged averaged 20.6 points, 11.6 rebounds and 4.2 blocks as a senior for Anderson Highland.\n\nAt Pitt, he played sparingly his freshman and sophomore seasons, but became an entrenched starter as a junior and started 68 consecutive games.\n\nKnown for his ability to protect the rim, McGhee finished his Panthers career sixth in program history with 114 blocked shots. He averaged 6.9 points in both his junior and season season, adding 6.8 rebounds as a junior and 7.7 as a senior, finishing third in the Big East in total rebounds that year.\n\nHe's spent his pro career overseas with stops in Turkey, Germany, France, Romania, Kosovo, Spain and Greece, where he currently plays for Kymis B.C.\n\n► Rankings missed on: Jake Kelly (Carmel/Iowa, Indiana State), Zach Hahn (New Castle/Butler), Brandon Wood (Kokomo/Valparaiso, Michigan State), Ben Botts (Muncie Central/Fort Wayne).\n\n2008\n\nTyler Zeller, No. 33, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Washington\n\nCity: Washington\n\nCollege: North Carolina\n\nThe second of the three Zeller brothers to win IndyStar Mr. Basketball, Tyler averaged 33.1 points and 11.0 rebounds a game his senior season and led the Hatchets to the 2005 and 2008 Class 3A state titles. He set a record with 43 points in the 2008 state finals win over Fort Wayne Harding.\n\nThe Tar Heels won the national championship in Zeller's freshman season, though he played sparingly (just 15 games). He averaged 9.3 points and 4.6 rebounds off the bench as a sophomore before moving into the starting lineup his final two seasons in Chapel Hill. He averaged 15.8 points and 7.2 rebounds as a junior and won ACC Player of the Year and was second-team All-American as a senior with 16.3 points and 9.6 rebounds a game.\n\nHe was selected in the first round (No. 17) by Dallas and traded to Cleveland on draft night. He was second team NBA All-Rookie after averaging 7.9 points and 5.7 rebounds in 55 starts for the Cavs. He played one more season in Cleveland before being traded to Boston in the summer of 2014. He started 67 times over the course of three seasons for the Celtics, with a career-best 10.2 points a game in 2014-15.\n\nHe signed with Brooklyn this offseason and started 33 of 42 games for the Nets before being traded to Milwaukee on Feb. 5.\n\nWalter Offutt, No. 99, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Warren Central\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Ohio State/Ohio\n\nA three-time Marion County and all-conference selection, Offutt missed his senior year because of injury. He played 23 games over two seasons at Ohio State before transferring to Ohio.\n\nOffutt started 70 of 71 games during two seasons with the Bobcats. He averaged 12.4 points and 3.5 rebounds as a junior in 2012, helping lead Ohio to a Sweet 16 appearance. He averaged 10.6 points, 4.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists as a senior, earning third-team All-MAC honors.\n\nIn 2014, he was a varsity assistant coach at Cathedral, then joined his former Ohio coach Jon Groce on the Illinois staff as a graduate manager for two years. He served as Ball State's director of basketball operations for one season before joining Chattanooga as an assistant coach this year.\n\nJulius Mays, No. 148, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Marion\n\nCity: Marion\n\nCollege: N.C. State/Wright State/Kentucky\n\nMays averaged 18.6 points per game and was first-team All-State his senior year, leading Marion to the Class 4A state title game against Brownsburg.\n\nHe spent the first two seasons of his college career at North Carolina State, starting six of 58 games, while averaging 4.7 points and 1.7 assists a game for the Wolfpack. He transferred to Wright State, and after sitting out the 2010-11 season, he led the Raiders in scoring (14.1 ppg) and was named the Horizon League's Newcomer of the Year.\n\nHe chose to transfer again and landed surprisingly at Kentucky as John Calipari needed to rebuild a roster that lost Anthony Davis, Marquis Teague, Doron Lamb, Terrence Jones and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist early to the NBA.\n\nMays started 28 games for the Wildcats, averaging 9.3 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game for a Kentucky team that lost to Robert Morris in the opening round of the NIT — the only season in Calipari's Lexington tenure not to reach the NCAA tournament.\n\n► Rankings missed on: Gordon Hayward (Brownsburg/Butler), Alex Young (Northwest/IUPUI), Zack Novak (Chesterton/Michigan), Kyle Kuric (Evansville Memorial/Louisville), Julian Mavunga (Brownsburg/Miami of Ohio).\n\n2009\n\nD.J. Byrd, No. 102, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: North Montgomery\n\nCity: Crawfordsville\n\nCollege: Purdue\n\nNorth Montgomery's all-time leading scorer, Byrd averaged better than 25 points, nine rebounds and three assists per game as a senior. He led the Chargers to the regional final, losing to Greensburg.\n\nHe started 22 games a sophomore, averaging 5.2 points and 3.0 rebounds a game on a Boilers team that finished the year 26-8. He came off the bench a year later, and became a much more reliable 3-point shooter, improving his accuracy from 34 percent to 43 percent. He upped his scoring to 8.9 points and was named Big Ten's sixth man of the year.\n\nAs a senior he started 33 of 34 games, posted career highs (10.1 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 2.7 apg) and earned honorable mention all-Big Ten for the second straight year.\n\nHe played overseas briefly in Germany before returning home. He was an assistant at his alma mater North Montgomery for a year before coaching Franklin's JV team for two seasons. This summer he returned to Purdue as a graduate student manager on Matt Painter's staff.\n\nDerek Elston, No. 103, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Tipton\n\nCity: Tipton\n\nCollege: Indiana\n\nElston was a first-team all-state performer and averaged 19.7 points, 10.8 rebounds and 2.8 assists as a senior, leading Tipton to a 23-3 record. The Blue Devils lost to Deshaun Thomas-led Bishop Luers in Class 2A regional semifinal.\n\nOriginally committed to Kelvin Sampson, Elston stayed with the Hoosiers after the switch to Tom Crean. Despite suffering a knee injury that required surgery prior to his freshman season, Elston still played 31 times for the rebuilding Hoosiers. His 5.8 points and 4.1 rebounds per game as a freshman was actually his best output in his four seasons in Bloomington. Elston was a senior on the 2012-13 team that became the first in 20 years to win an outright Big Ten title.\n\nHe started only 21 of his 115 games for IU and had his senior season cut short because of another knee injury. He finished his career with modest production (4.3 ppg, 2.9 rpg).\n\nHe played professionally overseas in Malta and Portugal before joining Tom Crean's staff as director of player development. He was retained by Archie Miller and remains on the Hoosiers bench.\n\nJordan Hulls, No. 107, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Bloomington South\n\nCity: Bloomington\n\nCollege: Indiana\n\nThe heart and soul of Tom Crean's first full recruiting class, Hulls was a late riser on the recruiting circuit. Thought to be too small, too slow and a defensive liability, Hulls let his production do the talking. He led Bloomington South to a 45-2 record in his final two seasons, including a 26-0 senior year, culminating with a Class 4A state title and Mr. Basketball honors.\n\nHulls led the Panthers in scoring (15.8), assists (5.2) and steals (2.6) as a senior and had five times as many Mr. Basketball votes as runner-up Bruce Grimm Jr. of Rochester.\n\n“Jordan is truly everything Mr. Basketball should be. A lot of people will say all they care about is winning, not the personal achievement, but Jordan honestly believes it,” said then-Bloomington South assistant Criss Beyers (now coach of No. 1 Warren Central).\n\nHe started 113 straight games for IU and was a guiding force in the Hoosiers turnaround, going from 10-21 his freshman season to 29-7 and ranked No. 1 most of the year as a senior. Hulls averaged 9.8 points, 2.6 assists and 2.3 rebounds for his career and his 3,898 career Big Ten minutes played are 17th-most ever.\n\nHe plays professionally in Germany after stops in the Czech Republic, Kosovo and Belgium\n\nScott Wood, No. 133, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Marion\n\nCity: Marion\n\nCollege: North Carolina State\n\nA first team all-state pick, Wood averaged 24.8 points a game as a senior for Marion. He started a freshman-record 36 games for N.C. State and started 136 of the 138 games he played for the Wolfpack. He proved deadly from behind the arc, hitting 42 percent from behind the arc after his freshman season. He led the ACC in 3-pointers made as a junior and senior and his 334 career 3-pointers in are 5th-most in ACC history — behind only J.J. Redick (Duke), Curtis Staples (Virginia), Dennis Scott (Georgia Tech) and Trajan Langdon (Duke).\n\nHis junior year, he broke Redick’s ACC record for consecutive free throws made, hitting 66 in a row (Redick’s mark was 54). That same season, Wood hit four 3-pointers against Georgetown to lift the Wolfpack to the 2012 Sweet 16. Wood finished his N.C. State career averaging 10.6 points and 2.7 rebounds a game.\n\nHe has played in Spain and Turkey overseas and was the 2017 G League 3-point contest champion, representing the Santa Cruz Warriors.\n\n► Rankings missed on: Andrew Smith (Covenant Christian/Butler), Colt Ryan (Batesville/Evansville), Jake Odum (Terre Haute South/Indiana State), Reggie Hearn (Fort Wayne Snider/Northwestern).\n\n2010\n\nDeshaun Thomas, No. 22, 5 stars\n\nHigh School: For Wayne Bishop Luers\n\nCity: Fort Wayne\n\nCollege: Ohio State\n\nThomas finished his high school career third on the state’s all-time scoring list (3,018 points) and led Bishop Luers to back-to-back state titles in 2008 and 2009. A 70-68 regional semifinal loss to Southwood his senior year cost Thomas potentially three more games to chase Damon Bailey’s scoring record (3,134). He averaged 30.3 points as a junior and 32.5 points as a senior, winning Mr. Basketball and McDonald’s All American honors.\n\nHe played three seasons for Ohio State, improving his scoring from 7.5 points as a freshman to 15.9 as a sophomore and 19.8 his junior year – tops in the Big Ten. He finished his career ninth on the school’s all-time scoring list and declared a year early for the 2013 NBA draft.\n\nSan Antonio selected Thomas in the second round (No. 58), though only played for the Spurs Summer League and G League squads. He played overseas in France, Spain, Turkey and Israel, where he currently plays for Maccabi Tel-Aviv.\n\nTerone Johnson, No. 51, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: North Central\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Purdue\n\nThe 2010 Marion County Player of the Year, Johnson averaged 21.3 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 2.8 assists as a senior for the 25-3 Panthers. He scored 26 points in the Class 4A state title win over Warsaw.\n\n“Terone is one of the most complete basketball players I’ve ever been around,” North Central coach Doug Mitchell said. “He is constantly putting pressure on you offensively, and defensively he’s much better than he’s given credit for. He’s a great leader, both vocally and by example. He’s just an outstanding human being.”\n\nHe came off the bench primarily his first two seasons in West Lafayette, but saw plenty of action averaging 19.3 minutes and 23.7 minutes a game as a freshman and sophomore, respectively. He became a full-time starter as a junior and put together his best statistical season that year, averaging 13.5 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists a game. He was named third-team All-Big Ten by the coaches, though the Boilers struggled to a 16-18 season.\n\nHe played overseas in Greece after graduating with 1,318 points — ranking 25th in Purdue history — as well as ranking fourth in games played (134), 19th in assists (299) and 15th in 3-pointers made (120).\n\nRussell Byrd, No. 115, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Fort Wayne Blackhawk Christian\n\nCity: Fort Wayne\n\nCollege: Michigan State/The Master's College\n\nFort Wayne Blackhawk Christian’s first-ever Indiana All-Star, Byrd averaged 23.2 points and 10.1 rebounds his senior year.\n\nHe redshirted his first year in East Lansing with a foot injury. He played 78 games for the Spartans over three season, all from the bench. Billed as a top shooter out of high school, Byrd shot just 23 percent from behind the arc for Michigan State and averaged 1.4 points a game.\n\nByrd transferred from Michigan State following his junior year, finishing at The Master’s College in Santa Clarita, Calif. He was drafted by the G League’s Sioux Falls franchise, but was waived and eventually played in Israel and Spain. He returned to North America and played with fellow former Spartans Korie Lucious and Brandan Kearney on the Moncton Miracles in Canada.\n\nChrishawn Hopkins, No. 124, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Manual\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Butler/Wright State\n\nA high-flying dunking sensation, Hopkins won 2010 City Player of the Year honors averaging 25.8 points, 7.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 3.0 blocks and 2.2 steals a game as a senior.\n\n“He’s a freak of nature. I’ll bet you don’t see another guy like that around here for 20 years,” Pike’s Khristian Smith said of Hopkins.\n\nHopkins played sparingly as a freshman, but started 24 times as a sophomore, averaging 9.1 points and 2.4 rebounds a game for the Bulldogs. He was to be one of four starters to return for the 2012-13 season, but Hopkins was dismissed from the Butler program “due to a repeat violation of team rules and standards. Although the mistakes he’s made were enough to constitute his dismissal from the program,” Vince Stenett, Hopkins legal guardian told IndyStar via email.\n\nAfter sitting out a year as a transfer, he put in a solid if not spectacular two seasons at Wright State (5.3 ppg as a junior and 8.5 ppg as a senior in 2014-15).\n\nIn July 2016, Hopkins told IndyStar’s Kyle Neddenriep he’s playing five or six days a week in various leagues and planned tryouts with G League teams. He’s spent time as an AT&T sales rep.\n\n“If I had to do over again, I probably wouldn’t have passed as much,” Hopkins said. “That’s what (coaches) have been telling me for five, six years. I would have played harder. Sometimes I didn’t feel like playing. It wasn’t that I didn’t love the game or anything like that, I just didn’t feel it. I wasn’t pumped up to play. Now I feel like I have something to prove.”\n\n2011\n\nMarquis Teague, No. 5, 5 stars\n\nHigh School: Pike\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Kentucky\n\nRanked the nation’s top point guard, Teague was first-team All-State and a McDonald’s All American after averaging 22.1 points, 4.2 rebounds and 6.0 assists a game as a senior. He led the Red Devils to sectional titles as a sophomore and senior.\n\nTeague stepped in right away at point guard as a freshman for John Calipari. He started all 40 games he played at Kentucky, helping the Wildcats to their eighth national title. He was fifth on the team in scoring (10.0) behind future NBA players Anthony Davis, Doron Lamb, Terrence Jones and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. Teague’s 4.8 assists were a team-best.\n\nHe declared for the NBA draft and was selected 29th overall by the Chicago Bulls. He played 67 games with the Bulls, while also playing for the team’s G League affiliate in Iowa. In Jan. 2014, he was traded to Brooklyn, playing just 21 games for the Nets. Brooklyn traded him to Philadelphia in October 2014 and waived him three days later. He averaged 2.3 points and 1.4 assists in the NBA and last played in the league April 16, 2014, seeing 41 minutes of action in the regular season finale.\n\nHe’s played in the G League since, with stops in Israel and Russia mixed in. This year he made headlines when he was wrongly accused of stealing airline blankets during a G League road trip with the Memphis Hustle and escorted from the plane. American Airlines apologized directly to the players, per an airline spokesman.\n\nCody Zeller, No. 15, 5 stars\n\nHigh School: Washington\n\nCity: Washington\n\nCollege: Indiana\n\nOlder brothers Luke and Tyler had both been named Mr. Basketball in their senior years, and Cody would, too, after leading Washington to a state title in his final high school season. He averaged 24.6 points per game, 13.1 rebounds per game and 3.3 assists per game and was a McDonald's All American.\n\nHe was a priority target for then-IU coach Tom Crean, who would eventually make Zeller a centerpiece of his rebuilding job in Bloomington. Zeller spent two seasons at Indiana, winning a Big Ten title in 2013 before heading to the NBA. Had he stayed in college for four years, he was on pace for a 2,000-point/1,000-rebound career.\n\nHe was drafted fourth overall — two spots below teammate Victor Oladipo – by Charlotte. Zeller has spent all five years of his career in Charlotte, averaging 7.9 points and 5.6 rebounds a game for his career. He primarily started for the Hornets the past three seasons, but was relegated to a bench role this year and limited to 31 games because of a knee injury.\n\nBranden Dawson, No. 20, 5 stars\n\nHigh School: Gary Lew Wallace\n\nCity: Gary\n\nCollege: Michigan State\n\nDawson averaged 28.7 points, 18.6 rebounds and 5.6 assists as a senior for Lew Wallace, which closed in 2014. He was first-team All-State and a McDonald’s All American.\n\nHe started 122 of 130 games during his four seasons in East Lansing and is just one of three players in Spartans history with 1,000 career points and 100 career blocks (Draymond Green and Adreian Payne). He never turned into the star some thought he would be. Perhaps the severe knee injury at the end of his freshman season sapped some of his supreme athleticism, but he still finished his career tops on school’s career blocks list, sixth in steals (163) and seventh in rebounds (902).\n\nHe earned second team All-Big Ten honors as a senior (11.9 ppg, 9.1 rpg, 1.7 bpg) and helped lead the Spartans to the Final Four. He’s 14th all-time in the Big Ten in rebounding.\n\nNew Orleans drafted him with the 56th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft and traded him to the Clippers for cash. He played six games for the Clippers in 2015-16, but has spent most of his career in the G League. He’s also had stops in Israel and Japan.\n\nMichael Chandler, No. 55, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Lawrence North\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Northwest Florida State/Oregon\n\nChandler averaged 19 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks a game as a senior, earning third-team All-State honors. He looked like the next in line of the LN big man assembly line, but withdrew from school early and never made it to UCF, where he committed to play after originally choosing Louisville. He ended up at Northwest Florida State, which went 30-4 and reached the junior college national title game in 2012-13.\n\nHe transferred to Oregon, playing 19 times as a junior with averages of 2.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in just 5.3 minutes per game. He was granted his release from his scholarship after the season.\n\nDee Davis, No. 123, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Bloomington South\n\nCity: Bloomington\n\nCollege: Xavier\n\nAs a sophomore, Davis shared a backcourt with Jordan Hulls when Bloomington South went undefeated and won the Class 4A state title. He returned with Erik Fromm to win Class 4A again as a senior, averaging 21.6 points, 5.7 assists and 2.4 steals a game.\n\nDavis became Xavier’s starting point guard his sophomore season. He averaged career highs in points (9.0) and assists (6.0) his senior year. His 221 assists that season was second-most in a single season in school history and ninth in the nation.\n\nHe's played for the Canton Charge in the G League and in Slovenia and currently suits up in Germany for the Gießen 46ers.\n\n► Rankings missed on: Nic Moore (Warsaw/SMU), Max Landis (Perry Meridian/Gardner-Webb, Fort Wayne).\n\n2012\n\nGlenn Robinson III, No. 11, 5 stars\n\nHigh School: Lake Central\n\nCity: St. John\n\nCollege: Michigan\n\nLake Central’s all-time leading scorer (1,318), Robinson averaged 21.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 2.1 steals per game as a senior leading Lake Central to a 21-3 record.\n\nHe started all 39 games his freshman season (11.0 ppg, 5.4 rpg) and helped lead the Wolverines to their first Final Four appearance in 20 years. He earned All-Big Ten honorable mention for the second year in a row as a sophomore and was just the fourth Michigan sophomore to be named a captain.\n\nHe entered the NBA draft two years early and was taken in the second round (No. 40) by Minnesota. In the 2014-15 season, he played 25 games for the Timberwolves before being waived. Philadelphia picked him up and he played 10 games for 76ers.\n\nLarry Bird said he was trying to acquire Robinson for a year before finally signing the athletic swingman. “He sees something he likes in me, and it makes you feel good,” Robinson said. “I mean, he’s Larry Bird.”\n\nHe played 45 times for the Pacers in 2015-16 and then 69 games, including 27 starts in 2016-17, averaging 6.1 points and 3.6 rebounds a game. He was in line for more playing time this season, but an ankle injury has kept him sidelined for most of the season, having only recently returned.\n\nYogi Ferrell, No. 19, 5 stars\n\nHigh School: Park Tudor\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Indiana\n\nFerrell guided Park Tudor to three straight trips to the Class 2A state finals, winning the championship his junior and senior season. He averaged 18.5 points, 3.1 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game as a senior, was runner-up for Mr. Basketball and named a McDonald’s All American. A former AAU teammate of Cody Zeller’s, the Washington big man’s commitment a year prior to IU, made Ferrell’s decision easier to stay home.\n\n“He and Cody are such good friends. I’m so happy for them both,” said then-Park Tudor coach Ed Schilling, now an assistant for Archie Miller at IU. “They’re both cut from the same cloth spiritually. They are quality kids who are serious academically. To find two like-minded kids who happened to be two of the top players in the nation, that’s special.”\n\nFerrell didn’t disappoint. He started all 137 games he played at IU, including 36 as a freshman on the nation’s No. 1-ranked team.\n\nFerrell finished his career as the school’s all-time leader in assists (633) and sixth on the school’s all-time scoring list (ahead of the likes of Damon Bailey, Kent Benson and Alan Henderson).\n\nHe went undrafted, worked his way up through the G League and became an overnight NBA sensation for the Mavericks after signing a 10-day contract and going right into the starting lineup. He averaged 11.3 points and 4.3 assists for Dallas and was named second-team NBA All-Rookie. He was rewarded with a multi-year deal and is averaging 10.0 points and 2.2 assists and 3.3 rebounds a game this year.\n\nHe's the only member of IU's so-called #TheMovement to play all four years in Bloomington.\n\nGary Harris, No. 25, 5 stars\n\nHigh School: Hamilton Southeastern\n\nCity: Fishers\n\nCollege: Michigan State\n\nA two-sport standout (Harris was an excellent receiver for the Royals), he averaged 25.4 points, 7.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 4.0 steals as a senior and set a school single-season record with 610 points. He won IndyStar Mr. Basketball honors and was a McDonald’s All American.\n\nHe started 33 of 34 games as a freshman, averaging 12.9 points and 2.5 rebounds on his way to winning Big Ten Freshman of the Year in 2012-13. A year later, he led the Spartans in scoring (16.7), and added 4.0 rebounds and 2.7 assists a game. He was a first-team All-Big Ten selection, honorable mention All-American and Big Ten All-Defensive team pick.\n\nHe declared for the 2014 NBA draft and was taken in the first round (No. 19 overall) by Chicago and traded to Denver on draft night.\n\nAfter a rookie year spent mostly on the bench, Harris has started all but one game he’s played in the past three seasons. He signed a four-year, $84 million contract extension this offseason and has responded with his best year to date. He’s averaging a career-best 17.9 points and 3.0 assists a game this season and averaging 2.4 made 3s a game. He’s also fifth in the league in steals.\n\nMitch McGary, No. 30, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Chesterton/Brewster Academy\n\nCity: Chesterton\n\nCollege: Michigan\n\nA versatile and highly-sought after forward McGary left Chesterton for Brewster Academy in New Hampshire to get his academics in order. He picked Michigan over Florida and Duke\n\nMcGary played 39 times his freshman season for Michigan and stepped up his play in the Wolverines’ run to the 2013 Final Four. In the second round against VCU, McGary went for 21 points and 14 rebounds. In the Sweet 16 against Kansas, he posted 25 points and 14 rebounds. He was named to the all-tournament team.\n\nA preseason All-Big Ten pick, McGary played just eight times his sophomore season due to a back injury.\n\nDespite missing most of the season, he declared for the NBA draft and the gamble paid off as Oklahoma City picked him 21st overall. He played 52 games over two seasons for the Thunder, averaging 15.2 minutes as a rookie in 2014-15, but then just 3.6 minutes a year later. He spent most of his time with Oklahoma City’s G League affiliate. The Thunder waived him after he was hit with a second suspension for violating the league’s drug policy.\n\nMcGary has since been spending his time bowling while waiting for his next NBA chance.\n\n\"The NBA is complicated, the NBA is a business,\" he told the Gary Post Tribune in 2017. \"I'm getting back in shape. I'll be back, whether it be the NBA or overseas.\"\n\nD'Vauntes Smith-Rivera, No. 32, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: North Central/Oak Hill\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Georgetown\n\nSmith-Rivera was on North Central's state title team as a sophomore and followed that up with an- All-State junior season before transferring to Oak Hill Academy in Virginia.\n\nHe helped Oak Hill to a 44-0 record and national title as a senior.\n\nAt Georgetown, Smith-Rivera finished in the top 10 in Big East scoring and steals in each of his final three seasons, and in the top 10 in assists his junior and senior seasons. Since 2009, only five Big East players have played more minutes.\n\nHe led the Hoyas in scoring in each of his last three seasons and finished his career fifth all-time on the school's scoring list. He was first-team All-Big East as a junior, and second team all-conference his sophomore and senior years.\n\nHe went undrafted and joined the Bull's G League affiliate before being traded to Fort Wayne Mad Ants. He played one game for Fort Wayne before heading overseas to Greece. In a May social media post, he announced an end to his playing career.\n\nJeremy Hollowell, No. 41, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Lawrence Central\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Indiana/Georgia State\n\nA first-team All-Marion County selection as a junior and senior, Hollowell averaged 23.9 points 9.0 rebounds per game his senior year and led Lawrence Central to its first sectional title since 1998.\n\nHe played 33 games for IU as a freshman, averaging 9.7 minutes a game, and doubled that as a sophomore, starting 15 of 29 games played. He averaged 5.7 points and 3.5 rebounds in his second season, but shot just 35 percent from the field. He transferred to Georgia State, where he played for former IUPUI coach Ron Hunter.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I think he had to figure out who he was a priority for,\" said Hollowell’s former AAU coach Chris Hawkins.\n\nAfter sitting out the 2014-15 season due to NCAA transfer rules, Hollowell made an instant impact in Atlanta. He led the Panthers in scoring in each of his two seasons, finishing 10th in the Sun Belt in scoring as a junior (14.8) and a senior (15.2).\n\nHe went undrafted and has been playing for the Erie BayHawks of the G League and is averaging 8.6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.2 assists on 45.4 percent shooting.\n\nHanner Perea, No. 43, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: La Lumiere\n\nCity: LaPorte/Colombia\n\nCollege: Indiana/East Tennessee State\n\nPerea was always rated based on his freakish athletic gifts and potential and never really his production. Originally from Colombia, he made it to the Midwest playing for Indiana Elite in AAU. He joined La Lumiere for two seasons, averaging 14.2 points and 10.3 rebounds per game as a senior.\n\nHe never found his footing in Bloomington. And was suspended the first nine games of his career for receiving improper benefits. He played sparingly his first two seasons (averaging 5.8 and 7.7 minutes a game as a freshman and sophomore, respectively). Perea started 22 games as a junior on a Hoosiers team desperate for frontcourt help. He averaged 6.5 points and 4.3 rebounds a game but was often dogged by foul trouble and niggling injuries. He was arrested for OWI in February of 2014 and dismissed from the IU program a year later for repeated violations of team rules.\n\nHe transferred to East Tennessee State and started all 35 games for ETSU in 2016-17 after sitting out the prior year because of NCAA transfer rules. He averaged 8.3 points, 4.7 rebounds and 1.2 blocks for the Buccaneers, who won the Southern Conference and reached the NCAA tournament.\n\nA second-round pick in the G League draft by the Westchester Knicks, Perea was activated Nov. 13 and waived Nov. 20.\n\nA.J. Hammons, No. 77, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Carmel/Oak Hill\n\nCity: Carmel, Gary\n\nCollege: Purdue\n\nHammons averaged 8.3 points, 7.8 rebounds and 4.8 blocks a game as a sophomore for Carmel but left prior to his junior season for famed prep school Oak Hill in Virginia.\n\n“He needs to focus on schoolwork, and it will be a better situation for him there,” said Hammons’ former AAU coach Jared Quarles.\n\nNew Carmel coach Scott Heady was obviously disappointed by Hammons’ decision.\n\n“His AAU coaches left (it) like this would be the best for him partly because of academics. I disagree with that. We have a great public school here that could have provided him with all the resources he needed,” Heady told IndyStar in 2010. “And from a basketball standpoint, we play one of the toughest schedules in the state. I feel really good about what we offer here.”\n\nHe posted modest averages at Oak Hill surrounded by other Division I talent, but still headed to Purdue as a top 100 recruit.\n\nA sometimes-mercurial talent, Hammons established himself as a defensive force in the Big Ten. He was a three-time conference all-defensive team selection and won Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year as senior. He finished his career as just the second player in Big Ten history with 1,500 career points, 900 career rebounds and 340 career blocked shots (fellow Boilermaker Joe Barry Carroll is the other).\n\nHe earned second-team all-conference honors as a junior and first-team honors his senior season. He finished his career third on Purdue’s all-time rebounding list and second in blocked shots. His 1,593 career points were 17th-best in school history.\n\nHe was selected 46th overall in the 2016 NBA draft by Dallas and played 22 games for the Mavericks as a rookie (averaging 2.2 points and 1.6 rebounds in 7.4 minutes a game). He split time with the G League’s Texas Legends and was traded to the Miami Heat in July for Josh McRoberts, a future second round pick and cash considerations. He spent this season with the Sioux Falls G League squad, but was waived by the Heat on Feb. 8. Hammons was averaging 8.6 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.96 blocks for Sioux Falls.\n\nKellen Dunham, No. 93, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Pendleton Heights\n\nCity: Pendleton\n\nCollege: Butler\n\nA two-time All-State pick at Pendleton Heights, he led the state in scoring as a senior with 29.5 points a game. He set school single-game and career scoring marks and was a member of the loaded 2012 Indiana All-Star crop.\n\nDunham was one of the nation’s top 3-point marksmen during his Butler tenue and was consistently reliable. He averaged 16.4 points a game as a sophomore, 16.5 as a junior and 16.2 as a senior, becoming the first Butler player since 1998 to lead the Bulldogs in scoring three straight years (Jon Neuhouser 1996-98). Dunham hit 43 percent of his 3-pointers his senior season and his 299 career made 3s are third-most in school history. He also ranks fourth in total points — his 1,946 trail only Chad Tucker, Darrin Fitzgerald and now Kelan Martin.\n\nHe signed a contract with the Memphis Grizzlies on Oct. 20, 2016 and was waived a day later. He has played in the G League and in Belgium.\n\nRonnie Johnson, No. 94, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: North Central\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Purdue/Houston/Auburn\n\nTerone Johnson’s younger brother, Ronnie averaged 20.1 points per game as a senior for North Central and was the Marion County Player of the Year.\n\nHe started 28 of 34 games for Purdue as a freshman, averaging 10.3 points and 4.1 assists (third-best in the Big Ten). He started 31 games as a sophomore, averaging 10.8 points and 3.7 assists a game. He decided to transfer, infamously claiming he had “too much sauce” for a Matt Painter point guard.\n\n\"The system that they played didn't fit me very well,\" Johnson told IndyStar. \"There was a lot of subbing and it was hard to get into the flow of the game. I felt like I needed to play through my mistakes like every other guard in the Big Ten was.\"\n\nJohnson picked Houston and former IU coach Kelvin Sampson. After sitting out the 2014-15 season, the 6-foot point guard started 13 games and averaged 9.4 points and 2.9 assists as a junior for the Cougars. But again, he decided to transfer. He joined Bruce Pearl’s Auburn team for the 2016-17 season and played 32 times, starting twice. He averaged 7.8 points and 2.3 assists for the Tigers last season.\n\nRapheal Davis, No. 96, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: La Lumiere/Fort Wayne South Side\n\nCity: Fort Wayne\n\nCollege: Purdue\n\nDavis averaged 21.5 points and 4.3 rebounds for nationally-ranked La Lumiere as a senior. Before transferring to the LaPorte prep school, he was a three-time first-team all-conference pick while at Fort Wayne South Side.\n\nHe started roughly half of Purdue’s games his first two seasons in West Lafayette and developed into a key leader and one of the conference’s premier defensive stoppers his junior and senior years. He was a two-time All-Defensive Big Ten selection and the conference’s Defensive Player of the Year in 2015 as a senior.\n\nHe started the final 71 games of his Boilermakers career and averaged 7.7 points and 4.0 rebounds. A year after graduating, Purdue won the Big Ten title and Davis received a championship ring from Matt Painter, who credited Davis’ leadership for helping Purdue reach the conference’s peak.\n\nDavis attended a pre-draft pro day in Miami and traveled to China to audition for pro teams.\n\n\"I'm putting my name out there, and I'll hopefully have a good season overseas and then make it back,\" Davis told Journal & Courier’s Nathan Baird in July 2016.\n\nDavis is a pharmaceutical sales representative for Eli Lilly in Atlanta.\n\nRon Patterson, No. 131, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Broad Ripple\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Syracuse/IUPUI\n\nPatterson graduated as Broad Ripple’s all-time leading scorer — a record that won’t be broken. He was the ringleader of #TheMovement, IU basketball’s much-ballyhooed recruiting class. but never played for the Hoosiers. He attended summer courses on a probationary basis in Bloomington but was denied admittance.\n\n\"That didn't make sense to me,\" Patterson told IndyStar in February.. \"I don't know how. I got into every school in the country. I could have gone to Xavier or some other school the next day, probably, if I wanted to.\"\n\nHe went to Brewster Academy, a prep school in New Hampshire, before joining Syracuse, where he spent two seasons. He came off the bench in all 39 games he played for the Orange, averaging 11.7 minutes a game. Unhappy with his role, Patterson transferred back home to Indy, joining up with Jason Gardner's IUPUI program.\n\nHe averaged 9.8 points a game with the Jaguars and started 27 of 30 games this season.\n\n► Rankings missed on: D.J.

His junior season, he led Marian to its first sectional title since 1969 and first regional title ever. He graduated as St. Joseph County's all-time leading scorer (1,934).\n\nAt Notre Dame, he started half the season as a freshman (6.0 ppg, 1.8 apg). With Eric Atkins and Jerian Grant graduated, Jackson took over the point as a sophomore. He averaged 12.4 points, 3.6 rebounds and 3.1 assists his sophomore season, which ended in the Elite Eight. A year later, he averaged 15.8 points, 4.7 assists and 3.5 rebounds and led the Irish back to the Elite Eight. His 164 assists were second-most in the ACC and he earned second-team all-conference honors.\n\nHe left South Bend a year early for the NBA draft and was selected No. 45 overall by the Celtics.

But Lyles re-opened his recruitment before his junior year and eventually settled on Kentucky.\n\nWhile he might have wavered on his college choice, he never strayed from Tech. Despite overtures from prep schools, Lyles stayed at Tech and won the school's first-ever state title en route to winning IndyStar Mr. Basketball. Led by Lyles, the Titans became the first Indianapolis Public Schools program since Broad Ripple in 1980 to win a state title.

He averaged 21.3 points in the Musketeers four tournament games, including 29 (21 in second half) vs. Florida State.\n\nHe's a unanimous first-team All-Big East selection this season — his third time on the first team — and became just the fifth Xavier player to eclipse 2,000 career points.\n\nSam Logwood, No. 150, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: La Lumiere/Lawrence North\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: New Mexico\n\nLogwood transferred to La Lumiere from Lawrence North after his sophomore year.

As a senior, Swanigan averaged 22.6 points and 13.7 rebounds. \"Biggie\" came up big in some of Homestead's biggest games, including a 40-point, 19-rebound effort in a semistate win over South Bend Riley. Swanigan set school records for scoring in a career (1,649 points) and season (704) and rebounds in a career (1,048) and season (424). He also made 364 free throws and 625 field goals to set school records and ranks second in blocked shots (106) and fourth in assists (204).\n\nHe chose Purdue after originally committing to Michigan State, a massive coup for Matt Painter's rebuilding Boilers. He started all 69 games he played for the Boilers and after averaging 10.2 points and 8.3 rebounds as a freshman, he put up monster numbers as a sophomore (18.5 points and 12.5 rebounds). The Big Ten Player of the Year, he led the nation in rebounds (436) and Big Ten in scoring (646) and helped Purdue win the Big Ten regular season title.\n\nHe declared for the draft, forgoing his final two years of eligibility and was a first-round pick by Portland (26th).

Walton, No. 103, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Brownsburg\n\nCity: Brownsburg\n\nCollege: Missouri/Ball State\n\nWalton, a 6-3 shooting guard, averaged 19.7 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.9 steals as a senior at Brownsburg. He helped the program to back-to-back sectional titles (a 42-10 record the past two seasons) and was named to the IndyStar Indiana All-Star team.\n\nHe chose Missouri and averaged 5.3 points as a freshman while playing in all 31 games. He averaged 6.7 points this past season as a sophomore, making 17 starts while playing in all 32 contests. The Tigers fired their coach, so Walton decided to transfer. He set his sights closer to home with Ball State — and a team loaded with in-state talent.\n\n“Indiana guys, they’re very competitive and have a lot of pride in their state,” Walton told The Star Press. “To come back and play with some really good guys and guys that I know want to win for this state, it’s really important. I’m glad to be a part of something like this.”\n\nWalton is sitting out this season per NCAA transfer rules.\n\nRyan Cline, No. 141, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Carmel\n\nCity: Carmel\n\nCollege: Purdue\n\nCline led Carmel to back-to-back sectional titles and averaging nearly 17 points a game for the Greyhounds Class 4A state title team his junior year.

He's averaging 4.0 and 1.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists a game this season.\n\n► Rankings missed on: Jaelan Sanford (Evansville Reitz/Toledo), Ryan Welage (Greensburg/San Jose State), Devin Cannady (Mishawaka Marian/Princeton).\n\n2016\n\nKyle Guy, No. 43, 4 stars\n\nHigh School: Lawrence Central\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Virginia\n\nA McDonald's All American and Mr. Basketball winner, Guy finished his career with 1,614 points, the school’s most since Lawrence North was added as a second high school in Lawrence Township in 1976. He averaged 23.5 points, 5.6 rebounds and 3.7 assists and shot 43 percent from the 3-point line (63-for-146). Lawrence Central finished 19-7 to post its highest win total since 1996.\n\nGuy averaged 18.6 minutes a game his freshman season at Virginia (7.5 points per game), primarily as a reserve.

He spent the rest of the winter tending to his ailing father, Joe Brunk, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor.\n\nBecause of the family circumstance, the decision was made for Joey to sit out the rest of the season and apply to be a redshirt freshman. Joe Brunk died April 15 at age 56.\n\n“That’s something I’ll never regret or ever look back on,\" Brunk told IndyStar in December.\n\nThe NCAA granted him an additional year of eligibility, so this season is still technically his freshman year. He's played 19 games this season, all off the bench, averaging 1.3 points and 1.8 rebounds a contest.\n\nC.J. Walker, No. 124, 3 stars\n\nHigh School: Tech\n\nCity: Indianapolis\n\nCollege: Florida State\n\nWalker ran point on Tech's 2014 state championship team.

He averaged 22.1 points and 7.0 rebounds as a senior for a team that spent much of the season ranked No. 1 after starting 13-0. The Panthers stumbled a bit in the second half, then recovered to win a sectional regarded as the toughest Class 4A field in the state.\n\n“I had three goals coming into high school,” Wilkes said. “I missed one of them, which was to win state. But I also wanted to be a McDonald’s All American and be named Mr. Basketball. Two out of three wouldn’t be bad.”\n\nHe won Mr. Basketball, becoming the fourth from North Central to win, following Jason Gardner (1999), A.J. Ratliff (2004) and Eric Gordon (2007), tying Anderson, Marion and Washington for the most.\n\nHe chose to play for Steve Alford at UCLA and has had a strong freshman season. He's second on the Bruins in scoring and made the Pac-12 All-Freshman team, averaging 14 points and five rebounds a game.

Power ranks the best US airports. Is yours on the list?", "text": "Here’s a stat you probably weren’t expecting: J.D. Power found airline passengers are actually more satisfied with their overall airport experience this year than they were last year.\n\nThe firm’s 2023 North American Airport Satisfaction Study was released Wednesday and it found flyer morale is improving on the ground, despite reliability issues that have been plaguing flights recently.\n\n“It has not been an easy year for North American airports, but major capital improvements they’ve made over the last several years and new investments in getting food, beverage and retail operations back up and running at full capacity have helped them manage the crush of passengers,” Michael Taylor, managing director of travel, hospitality and retail at J.D. Power said in a statement. “Happy passengers spend a lot more money at the airport, so ongoing efforts to spread passenger volumes throughout the day and deliver superior service at all customer touchpoints will be critical.”\n\nAirport satisfaction key takeaways\n\nOverall J.D. Power’s survey found that travelers were marginally happier with their airport experience this year, but that crowding remains a major issue. Airport satisfaction peaked in 2020 when far fewer people were flying.\n\nRecent renovation projects can give the airport experience a huge boost, the study found. New York’s LaGuardia airport came in dead last for traveler satisfaction among large airports in 2019, but a major renovation in the intervening years has brought it up to the middle of the pack.\n\nJ.D. Power predicts crowding will remain an issue at many airports for the foreseeable future as travel demand remains high.\n\nLearn more about the airport satisfaction study by clicking here.\n\nBest mega airports\n\n1.

Some of the airlines mentioned included Delta Air Lines, Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines.\n\n“Lack of communication and poor customer service are two major reasons why people will not fly an airline again,” The Vacationer’s Eric Jones said.\n\nRemember Southwest’s meltdown that left thousands of people stranded in airports last December? The event didn’t deter the airline from being awarded J.D.

The emphasis on airport amenities, for example, increased, with the idea that it's one of the areas that airports \"have the most control over.\"\n\n\"We painstakingly pored over a wider range of elements that help make a site more sustainable or that show that an airport tries to maintain a deep connection to the community it serves,\" writers for The Points Guy said in a post about this year's results.\n\nIn partnership with other companies, The Points Guy's reviewers looked at such factors as how long it takes to get to an airport and how likely flights are to take off on time — or at all.\n\nWhile most flyers don't have the luxury of switching to a different airport, The Points Guy's writers said it's the prerogative of flyers and the \"duty of journalists\" to \"celebrate the airports that go above and beyond and hold accountable those that don't make the grade.\"\n\nThe company has published travel advice since the website debuted in June 2010. According to its website, \"What started out as a points-and-miles blog by founder and CEO Brian Kelly has evolved into a lifestyle media brand with 7 million unique visitors a month and a social media audience of 3 million.\"\n\nWith about 40 employees, the company boasts of having an expert team of editors and reporters, as well as a large pool of regular contributors \"equally adept at parsing, analyzing and reporting on the world of points and miles.\"\n\nQuestions about rankings\n\nCommissioner Pendergrass said he's not sure why Southwest Florida International landed near the bottom of the list in the ranking of the Top 50 Airports — making it one of the worst at No. 46.\n\n\"Other than a lounge, which is coming with the new enhancements, I mean there's nothing wrong with the airport,\" he said.\n\nCarol Obermeier, Lee County Port Authority's director of air service development, also reacted to the rankings at the Tourist Development Council meeting, saying she didn't see it coming.\n\n\"We do so much there,\" she said.\n\nThe Points Guy dinged the airport, Obermeier said, for not having a business lounge and for its lack of travel amenities. She pointed out there are plans to fix both of those situations. A terminal expansion will include a business lounge and updates are slated for all of the airport's concessions.\n\nThe port authority, she said, isn't giving too much credit to the rankings.\n\nGood news\n\nIn other rankings, RSW has performed well. For example, RSW ranked third in the nation among medium-sized airports in the J.D. Power 2018 North American Airport Satisfaction Study.\n\n\"We know and everybody here knows how wonderful the airport is,\" Obermeier told council members.\n\nIn an email, Victoria Moreland, director of communications and marketing for the Lee County Port Authority, which operates the county's airports, said the \"worst ranking\" came as a disappointment, but seemed to be largely due to the lack of a business lounge or business travel amenities, and also longer commute time.\n\n\"Although RSW has ease of access from I-75 and other roadways, our large catchment area would make 'commuting' lower,\" she said.\n\nAlso, when it comes to timeliness the airport ranked 21st, Moreland said.\n\n\"Of course, on-time operations is not something an airport can control,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to consistently ranking high in the J.D. Power North American Airport Satisfaction Survey, RSW has been recognized as a \"very clean and convenient airport with ample parking and ease of use\" in quarterly customer surveys.\n\nIn 2016, TripAdvisor, the world's largest travel platform, named Southwest Florida International one of the Traveler’s Choice Favorites for U.S. Airports.\n\n\"If you look at the comments on social media you will see that many people believe that RSW is a great hometown international airport for Southwest Florida,\" Moreland said.\n\nMany residents and visitors in Collier County use Southwest Florida International to reach their travel destinations. Jack Wert, the county's tourism director, said he hears mostly positives about RSW from visitors.\n\nThe turnaround time in customs, he said, is one of the fastest around, and it's easy to get in and out of the airport.\n\n\"We don't hear negatives, not for that airport. That's for sure,\" Wert said.\n\nHe doesn't expect any fallout from the 'worst airport' ranking.\n\n\"I just look at it as one study,\" Wert said. \"I don't worry about one poll over another.\"\n\nMore:Southwest Florida sees increase in illegal saw palmetto berry harvest arrests\n\nMore:Regal Unlimited plans to give access to theaters in Naples, Fort Myers, Estero\n\n.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2018/12/13/fort-myers-airport-upgrades-amenities-before-winter-travel-season/2213257002/", "title": "Fort Myers airport upgrades amenities before winter travel season", "text": "More mobile device plug-ins and a lactation room for nursing mothers and babies.\n\nThese are some of the upgrades Southwest Florida International Airport will have ready at its passenger terminal in time for the busy winter travel season.\n\nInspiration for these improvements came from consumer feedback and recommendations from the staff of the Lee County Port Authority.\n\nThe changes aren’t as extensive as what will occur in the passenger terminal expansion and security checkpoint reconfiguration that should begin in about a year. But the authority thinks they’ll make travel more pleasant meantime.\n\n“We’re trying to keep up. … We thought these were things we could do to make sure our customers continue to give us good grades,” said Jeff Mulder, port authority executive director.\n\nIt matters that an airport terminal makes a good impression on visitors because often it’s the first thing people see when they arrive and the last thing they see when they leave.\n\nKeeping visitors happy is crucial to Southwest Florida’s economy. Tourism and hospitality support an estimated 1 in 5 jobs in Lee and Collier counties alone.\n\nPlus, some of those visitors decide to move here permanently and relocate businesses here.\n\nYou might notice some of these features the next time you use RSW:\n\nCharge-up\n\nAfter leaving security checkpoints for the air gates, look for stanchions topped with the airport logo and holding outlets for recharging mobile devices.\n\nThey’re a little more visible than the banks of outlets and USB ports that hang just below seats where you wait for a boarding call. Those also have increased in number.\n\n“We’ve doubled the number of plug-ins in the terminal and gate areas,” Mulder said.\n\nFill up\n\nWho hasn’t had to pitch a bottle of water or soda before entering a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint?\n\nWe know staying hydrated is important when traveling; however, sometimes we don’t want to buy replacement beverages after clearing security.\n\nAnd refilling bottles at drinking fountains can be messy.\n\nNow all three airport checkpoints sport wall-mounted hydration stations.\n\nPlace your water bottle on a flat platform under the spout. An automatic sensor stops the flow of water when the bottle’s full.\n\nMore RSW news:RSW adds cash-to-card machines as airlines say no to paper money\n\nAnd:Getting and keeping intrastate flights isn't easy for Southwest Florida International Airport\n\nCare for the baby\n\nChanging tables have been added to the terminal’s gender-neutral “companion care” restrooms.\n\nA lactation room — where a mother can nurse her baby or pump breast milk in a private, tranquil atmosphere — will open late January in the airport’s pre-security public area near the Concourse D entrance.\n\nA concept drawing the airport provided shows an upholstered rocking chair with arms and a separate footrest among the room’s furnishings.\n\nA ”Friendly Airports for Mothers Act” was included in the five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration that President Trump signed Oct. 5.\n\nAlthough many airports already have them, these rooms become a requirement for medium- and large-hub airports as of Sept. 30, 2022.\n\nThe law says a lactation room must be in the area past security checkpoints, which means RSW will have at least one such room post-security after its terminal expansion.\n\nMore:Southwest Florida International Airport sweetens incentives to get West Coast routes\n\nMore:Bye bye birdies: 6 great restaurants near RSW airport Fort Myers — JLB Picks\n\nCoffee up\n\nWith the addition of a permanent Starbucks coffee stand on Concourse D this year, all three RSW concourses and the pre-security area of the terminal have a full complement of food and beverages from the popular retailer.\n\nBut until the terminal expansion, “we’re still lacking enough restaurants and gift shops past security,” Mulder said.\n\nAs a temporary measure, the port authority has worked with existing concessionaires to add grab-and-go kiosks, particularly those serving up bottled beverages and snacks.\n\nTo be sure, flyers don’t choose an airport for these little comforts and conveniences.\n\nBut there’s a “high correlation between satisfaction and the amount people spend at an airport,” said Michael Taylor, travel practice lead at J.D. Power. He provides business improvement recommendations to the company’s clients in the airline, airport and car rental industries.\n\nPeople who rate an airport 10 out of a possible 10 in J.D. Power surveys “spend twice as much as people who rate it a six or a seven,” Taylor said, adding, “That’s across all airports we measure.”\n\nIn its most recent North America Airport Satisfaction Study, J.D. Power ranked Southwest Florida International third — behind Buffalo Niagara International and Indianapolis International — for medium-sized U.S. airports.\n\nLee's port authority encourages travelers to arrive two hours ahead of their scheduled departures from RSW — three hours if traveling internationally.\n\nThe local airport has a good reputation for on-time travel, even during the busiest of times.\n\nPersonal finance site Magnify Money recently looked at the 10-year average percentage of flights departing airports that arrived at their destination on time, and the 10-year average percentage of flights that were canceled.\n\nIt placed RSW third on its \"best 10 airports for holiday travel\" list, with an average of 77.2 percent of flights arriving on time to their destinations and just 1.7 percent canceled.\n\nOnly Hawaiian airports Daniel K.

In-seat USB chargers\n\nSouthwest will begin adding USB-A and USB-C power ports to every seatback, starting with 737 MAX aircraft early next year.\n\n\"The ability to keep your devices charged while you are connected inflight is a request that we've heard consistently in ongoing conversations with our Customers,\" Southwest's Vice President of Customer Experience and Customer Relations Tony Roach, said in a statement.\n\nThe airline says the power systems are designed to avoid compromising legroom.\n\n2. Expanded in-flight entertainment\n\nSouthwest is doubling the number of movies available in its free in-flight entertainment portal this year.\n\nMovies, live and on-demand TV, music and texting via iMessage and WhatsApp are all free on Southwest flights.\n\nLater this month, the airline will also introduce an improved flight tracker with \"3D and cockpit views.\"\n\nI DO:Their Vegas wedding wasn't going to happen. So this couple got married on a Southwest flight.\n\n3. Stronger Wi-Fi\n\nHardware upgrades are expected to \"immediately double our current bandwidth\" on some aircraft and \"provide the capability of up to 10X our current bandwidth\" on 350 planes by the end of October.\n\nExisting aircraft will continue to be served by Anuvu, but Viasat will provide internet and live TV service to new aircraft starting this fall.\n\nWi-Fi service costs $8 per day per device on Southwest.\n\nWI-FI IN THE SKY:Here's how in-flight connectivity changing (and what it's costing)\n\n4. More overhead bin space\n\nBeginning early next year, new aircraft will feature larger overhead storage bins for carry-on luggage.\n\nSouthwest will continue to allow passengers to check-in up to two bags for free.\n\n5. New alcohol options\n\nRosé, hard seltzer and more alcoholic options will join Southwest's in-flight beverage selection starting in September.\n\nThat's just in time for passengers who may have hung onto free drink coupons that expired earlier in the pandemic, when alcohol was not being served. Those vouchers are being honored through the end of this year.\n\nOther changes pre-flight\n\nSouthwest also announced a major change for parents and caretakers of young children. Currently, lap children can't be designated until customers check into their flights at self-service kiosks or full-service desks at the airport. Starting later this year, customers will be able to do that when booking their reservations.\n\nAlso later this year, customers will be able to purchase upgraded A1 to A15 boarding priority for themselves and others in their party through Southwest's mobile app up to 24 hours before departure, when available. Southwest does not assign seats, so the sooner passengers board, the wider their seating options.\n\nCANCEL A FLIGHT AND WISH YOU COULD TRANSFER THE CREDIT?:Southwest will soon let you – for a price", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/10/goat-house-crasher-hurricane-setbacks-artist-haven-news-around-states/40292455/", "title": "Goat house-crasher, hurricane setbacks: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Thirteen nights of fun, fright and good times are ahead at ZooBoo, which begins Friday. The Halloween-themed evening event at the Montgomery Zoo has provided generations of River Region citizens tons of seasonal fun. Activities include haunted hay rides – as well as a traditional, non-scary version – plus games, bouncy castles, rides, seasonal concessions and much more. Gates open nightly at 6 p.m, with the festivities running Fridays through Sundays until the end of the month. Admission is $17 for ages 3 and older. For zoo members, the price is $8.50. Coupons for $1 off are available online. The Montgomery Zoo says it still needs more than 1,500 volunteers to make ZooBoo 2019 a success.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: New technology is expected to help detect and study conditions that lead to landslides, a researcher says. The landslide detection system in Sitka will monitor soil moisture levels and help residents and scientists understand landslide patterns, the Sitka Sentinel reports. University of Oregon postdoctoral researcher Annette Patton helped install the system funded through a $2.1 million grant from the National Science Foundation. The project was initiated after heavy rainfall in 2015 triggered a landslide that struck a Sitka subdivision and killed three men, she says. The monitoring stations at three locations in Sitka will transmit data every five minutes and produce a body of information over time. A goal is to study the relation of landslides to different types of storms, Patton says.\n\nArizona\n\nGrand Canyon National Park: A project to conserve murals inside a historic watchtower near the Grand Canyon’s east entrance is complete. The 1930s murals in the Desert View Watchtower have been worn down by weather and visitors over decades. Crews have been working over the past four years to conserve them. Workers filled deep gouges in window sills and staircases where visitors had carved names. They removed writing left in marker, nail polish or pen. They also removed salt deposits and tried to preserve what was left of the pigment in the murals. Grant funding covered much of the project. Famed architect Mary Colter designed the watchtower, and Fred Kabotie and Fred Geary painted the murals. The 70-foot watchtower gives visitors expansive views of the painted desert and the Little Colorado River gorge.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state will review a proposal to remove waste from the country’s first “national” river watershed after a large hog farm accepted a buyout from the state to close its site following years of environmentalist complaints. The Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment hired Harbor Environmental to draft the closure plan for C&H Hog Farms, which was completed late September. It includes permanently banning medium and large hog farms from the Buffalo National River watershed. C&H took a $6.2 million buyout from the state this summer to shutter the farm. Critics have expressed concern over pollution, but the research has not explicitly found that C&H caused the algae in the river. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports people can submit comments on the plan until Oct. 15.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state will limit rent increases for some people over the next decade after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law Tuesday aimed at combating a housing crisis in the nation’s most populous state. Newsom signed the bill at an event in Oakland, where a recent report documented a 43% increase in homelessness over two years. Sudden rent increases are a contributing cause of the state’s homeless problem, which has drawn the ire of Republican President Donald Trump. “He wasn’t wrong to highlight a vulnerability,” Newsom said of Trump’s criticisms to an audience of housing advocates. “He’s exploiting it. You’re trying to solve it. That’s the difference between you and the president of the United States.” The law limits rent increases to 5% each year plus inflation until Jan. 1, 2030. It also bans landlords from evicting people for no reason.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A doctor fired after trying to help a terminally ill man obtain drugs to end his life has filed an updated lawsuit that challenges her firing by a Christian hospital company. In the case against Centura Health filed Monday, Dr. Barbara Morris alleges it retaliated against her in violation of the state’s assisted suicide law and unlawfully inserted itself the doctor-patient relationship. Colorado law prohibits corporations from interfering with a physician’s professional judgment. Morris was fired in August after she and patient Neil Mahoney asked a judge to say whether Centura could stop her from helping him. He has sought help elsewhere and isn’t part of lawsuit anymore. Centura says it’s now only a case about whether an employer can fire a worker who violates its policies. But Morris’ attorney, Jason Spitalnick, says it’s about whether Centura’s polices can violate Colorado law.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: The University of Connecticut plans to offer free tuition to in-state students from families with an annual household income of $50,000 or less. UConn President Thomas C. Katsouleas announced the initiative Friday during his inauguration. Undergraduate students will be eligible for the program beginning next fall. UConn says it will be supported by a fundraising campaign and other school resources. Yale University announced this week that parents earning less than $75,000 won’t have to contribute to their child’s education beginning next year. The previous threshold was $65,000. Katsouleas on Friday also called for doubling research at UConn over the next seven to 10 years.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A statewide autism respite program will be reinstated with the help of additional state funds, after the at-home care service for students with autism was suspended with little notice at the beginning of the month. The newly allocated state funds will keep the program running through the end of the fiscal year in June. Christina School District, which oversees the Delaware Autism Program, requested $750,000 from the state, said Robert Scoglietti, spokesman with the state Office of Management and Budget. The actual amount the state provides will depend on use of the program through the year, he said. Christina originally decided to suspend respite services because of skyrocketing costs. Over the past year, demand for respite services have risen 350%, said Alva Mobley, spokeswoman for Christina. Costs have increased 400%.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Local lawmakers have voted to bar district agencies from cooperating with federal immigration agencies unless provided a judicial warrant or order. WTOP-FM reports the emergency legislation unanimously passed Tuesday aims to ensure the district doesn’t detain people solely for violating immigration law. The measure prohibits the district from inquiring about the immigration status of a person in custody. It also limits district agency compliance with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement unless provided judicial input or criminal warrants. Limitations include not sharing a person’s release date or providing space or equipment to the agency so it can search a person in district custody.\n\nFlorida\n\nPanama City: A year after Hurricane Michael, the county hardest hit by the Category 5 storm is still in crisis. Thousands in Bay County are homeless, medical care and housing are at a premium, and officials say domestic violence has been an issue. Michael was among the strongest hurricanes ever to make landfall in the United States. It barreled onto the Florida Panhandle on Oct. 10, 2018, with 160 mph winds, ripping homes from their foundations and devastating Tyndall Air Force Base. It left 22,000 of Bay County’s then-180,000 residents homeless and resulted in total insured losses of almost $7 billion. This summer, county officials unveiled a nearly 300-page blueprint to rebuild. Among their ideas: Use shipping containers and 3D technology to build new houses, and offer signing bonuses to lure new doctors.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAmericus: Some residents are opposing a $500 million solar farm in southwest Georgia that would be one of the nation’s largest. WALB-TV reports Sumter County commissioners held a hearing Tuesday on whether to grant zoning approvals for Americus Solar LLC, a subsidiary of Chicago-based Invinergy. Some opponents say the solar farm will hurt property values, harm wildlife and take too much land away from farming uses. The company would cover much of 9,700 acres in solar panels, although it says it’s still evaluating how big a solar farm to build. The company says it will pay $35 million in yearly property taxes and employ 500 people during construction. It also says the project will help rebuild worn-out farmland. The installation would generate 1,115 megawatts of electricity.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A customer satisfaction survey of air passengers has ranked the city’s airport the third worst in North America. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports Daniel K. Inouye International Airport has received the ranking in the J.D. Power 2019 North America Airport Satisfaction Study. Inouye airport ranks behind New York’s LaGuardia and New Jersey’s Newark Liberty as the worst among 62 airports. Honolulu ranks second-worst in the large-airport category, where it was fourth-worst the previous year. The annual study is based on responses from 32,276 U.S. or Canadian residents who passed through at least one North American airport. The survey scores airports on terminal facilities, airport accessibility, baggage claim, security check, check-in and baggage check, food, beverage, and retail.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The forest in and around one of the nation’s top ski destinations is in trouble from an ongoing combination of unusually warm temperatures, drought, wildfires, insect invaders and pathogens. So the U.S. Forest Service is starting an environmental analysis to find ways to improve the forest’s health at Sun Valley Resort’s Bald Mountain ski area, a huge economic driver for the region heavily dependent on tourism. The potential Bald Mountain Stewardship Project includes the entire 3,000-acre ski area. Officials say wildfires in 2007 and 2013 surrounded 9,150-foot Bald Mountain with burned forest, increasing bark beetle attacks. Pine beetles, dwarf mistletoe and white pine blister rust are also killing trees on the ski-run-carved mountain that forms a scenic backdrop for the resort towns of Ketchum and Sun Valley.\n\nIllinois\n\nLynwood: The owner of a suburban Chicago flight school is taking responsibility for a wheel found lodged in the ceiling of a house over the weekend. Amy Summers of SummerSkyz Inc. of Lansing says the wheel that homeowner Linda Taylor-Whitt found hanging from the ceiling of a bathroom late Saturday is a helicopter ground-handling wheel. Taylor-Whitt says she and her family discovered the wheel and the damage it caused when they returned from dinner. She says Summers has been in touch with her and explained what happened. Summers says the wheel is used to move a helicopter from one hangar to another. It was still attached to the helicopter when a flight instructor flew it out of Lansing Municipal Airport. Summers says she has reached out to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: After making a name in the city’s music community, rapper Sirius Blvck wants to use his reputation to help other artists. Known for solo recordings as well as work with the disbanded Ghost Gun Summer collective, Blvck founded the New Hands Music Festival that debuts this weekend at all-ages venue Healer. “I’ve always wanted to use the social capital that I’ve built to then build a platform,” he says. “And utilize that platform how I see fit, which is to make sure we provide space for marginalized voices and people who get pushed out of the community.” New Hands also includes a focus on philanthropy. The Oct. 11-12 event will raise money for nonprofit organizations such as Ascent 121, an agency that provides long-term trauma care services to teen survivors of sex trafficking.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: A man who spent more than 25 years in prison for a murder he didn’t commit is urging college students to help inmates who may be innocent. Terry Harrington spoke to Coe College students Tuesday, recounting how he was wrongly convicted in the 1977 shooting death of a security guard when he was a teenager. Harrington had exhausted his appeals and was serving a life sentence at the Iowa State Penitentiary when he met a prison barber who believed in his innocence. “One lady made a difference in my life,” said Harrington, now 60. The barber obtained Council Bluffs police records that revealed authorities had withheld evidence showing another man had been a strong suspect but was ignored. Witnesses who had implicated Harrington recanted, saying they’d been coerced. The Iowa Supreme Court overturned Harrington’s conviction in 2003.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state has seen a big jump in syphilis cases over the past five years and a spike in the number of infants born with the sexually transmitted disease. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says Kansas reported 152 cases of primary and secondary stage syphilis in 2018, compared with 60 in 2013. The increase was 153%. The rate of cases per 100,000 residents grew to 5.2 in 2018 from 2.1 in 2013. Kansas had eight cases of newborns being born with syphilis in 2018. The state had only a single reported case from 2013 through 2017. Kansas Health and Environment Secretary Lee Norman said babies born with syphilis may be developmentally delayed, have seizures or die if the infection is not treated during a pregnancy.\n\nKentucky\n\nWhitesburg: A group made up of black lung disease sufferers and supporters is dedicating a memorial to miners who have died of the disease. The Black Lung Association of South Eastern Kentucky is hosting the event in Whitesburg on Sunday. They will dedicate a headstone memorial for miners who have died of the disease in Letcher and surrounding counties. The disease is caused by breathing coal dust, and rates of the disease have risen in recent years. The dedication event will be at 2 p.m. at Riverside Park. The association has been calling attention to a government trust fund that provides about 19,000 sickened miners or their surviving dependents with living and medical benefits. A tax that supplies the fund was cut in half at the beginning of the year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nWinnfield: Federal authorities have dramatically expanded detention of immigrants in the state. Since last year, eight local jails have started holding asylum-seekers and other migrants, making Louisiana an unlikely epicenter for immigrant detention under President Donald Trump. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says it’s now detaining about 8,000 migrants in Louisiana out of 51,000 nationally. These new facilities are a mix of old state prisons and local jails and are several hours away from bigger cities. They are far from where most immigrants’ rights groups and lawyers are based. Migrants complain of mistreatment and prolonged detention. ICE refused several requests to comment on why it focused on Louisiana.\n\nMaine\n\nPresque Isle: A crop specialist with the University of Maine Cooperative Extension has told the state’s potato farmers they might need to reduce use of a widely used pesticide that controls blight. Steven Johnson said national and international changes in the regulation of a fungicide called chlorothalonil could prompt the changes, and growers might consider moving to newer kinds of chemicals. The Bangor Daily News reports chlorothalonil has been used extensively in the farming of potatoes and other crops since the 1970s. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers it a “likely human carcinogen” and has attempted to reduce its use. The European Union banned the pesticide in March, and Canada has reduced the amount that can be used during the growing season.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A state panel has voted to remove a logo that includes a Confederate flag from a plaque in Maryland’s Capitol that honors the Civil War’s Union and Confederate soldiers, but the state is keeping the plaque. The State House Trust voted 3-1 by email to spend more than $2,400 to remove the logo, which includes a Confederate flag and a U.S. flag, and overlay it with a cast image of the Maryland state flag. Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller and Laura Mears of the Maryland Historical Trust voted for the change and to keep the plaque. Maryland House Speaker Adrienne Jones, the state’s first black speaker, supported removing the entire plaque and voted against the plan.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway has cut ties with the nonprofit that had tended to the park for the past 10 years. WORK Inc., the region’s largest employer of people with disabilities, has groomed the park for 10 years. The Boston Globe reports the conservancy that manages the 1.5-mile-long park has chosen to move forward with Block by Block, a for-profit firm from Kentucky. WORK Inc. President James Cassetta called the decision an “absolute shock” and a slap in the face to the disabled. Jesse Brackenbury, executive director of the Greenway Conservancy, denied the move discriminates against those with disabilities. He said the Kentucky firm offered a more competitive price. The new contract took effect last week.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Counselors in the state are cheering after the initial passage of legislation aimed at safeguarding their ability to practice psychotherapy. The state House voted unanimously this week to advance the bill to the Senate. It would clarify the scope of practice for Michigan’s 10,000 licensed professional counselors. The measure is a response to a state department’s proposed revision of counseling rules. A state spokesman says existing law does not give counselors the authority to diagnose and use psychotherapy technique. Counselors say they’ve been doing so for years, however, and the rule changes would have significant consequences for them and the 150,000 people they serve.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBrainerd: Wildlife officials in central Minnesota are discovering it’s not easy to get rid of deer carcasses infected with chronic wasting disease. The disease was discovered in a wild deer in Crow Wing County earlier this year, the first confirmed case in the state outside southeastern Minnesota. Legislators have set aside $50,000 to set up dumpsters in disease areas. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is supposed to empty the dumpsters and take the carcasses to landfills. But Minnesota Public Radio reports that Marv Stroschein, the Crow Wing County landfill manager, refused to accept any infected deer. He says he’s worried the disease could infect the surrounding environment. The Minnesota DNR earlier this year finally gave the landfill a 15-year-old incinerator.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge will hear arguments in a lawsuit that challenges the state’s unique, multistep process of electing the governor and other statewide officials. Friday’s hearing comes less than a month before the gubernatorial election between Republican Tate Reeves and Democrat Jim Hood. Mississippi’s 1890 constitution requires a statewide candidate to win a majority of the popular vote and a majority of the 122 state House districts. If nobody wins both, the election is decided by the House, now controlled by Republicans. Attorneys for black plaintiffs say because of the way state House districts are drawn, the electoral system dilutes African American votes. State attorneys say the system is not discriminatory.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A newspaper’s review of state records shows taxpayers have spent $366,000 on private attorneys to defend former Gov. Eric Greitens’ use of a self-deleting text message app. The Kansas City Star reports the bulk of the spending was by the governor’s office. About $161,000 of it came after fellow Republican Mike Parson became governor following Greitens’ resignation in June 2018. A state audit in September showed that taxpayers had spent more than $200,000 before Greitens resigned to defend him in a 2017 lawsuit. It alleged Greitens’ office used the app Confide to avoid being subjected to Missouri’s open records laws. A judge dismissed most of the case in July, but the litigation is ongoing. Greitens resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct and campaign violations.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two tribal leaders have resigned from a task force in protest of the state attorney general’s support of a proposed oil pipeline from Canada. Montana Department of Justice spokesman John Barnes confirms Jestin Dupree of Fort Peck and Brandi King of Fort Belknap stepped down from the Missing Indigenous Persons Task Force. State lawmakers authorized Attorney General Tim Fox to create the 11-member panel to better report and find missing Native Americans. On Monday, Fox intervened in a lawsuit in support of constructing the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta’s tar sands. Dupree wrote in a Facebook post that his tribe opposes the pipeline and that Fox’s intervention is a “slap in the face.” Barnes says the resignations are disappointing, and officials will ask the tribal governments to recommend replacements.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State officials have received $6.5 million in federal grants to help prevent and treat opioid abuse. The funding boost announced Tuesday will support the state’s efforts to reduce the number of opioid deaths. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services says 183 people died in the state from a drug-involved overdose in 2017. Officials say the national opioid epidemic isn’t as severe in Nebraska as it is in other states, but it’s still a concern. Officials will use the money for a variety of services, including an addiction medicine fellowship, expanded access to medication-assisted treatment, better tracking of public health data and improvements to Nebraska’s prescription drug monitoring program. It also will help train medical providers and spread public awareness.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Officials say the historic Nevada State Prison needs another $50,000 worth of work before it can open as a museum. Glen Whorton, Nevada State Prison Preservation Society president and former state prisons chief, says about $30,000 has been spent for improvements, including making one bathroom handicap-accessible. Whorton told people touring the facility Tuesday that $50,000 would pay for an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant ramp, asbestos removal, lighting, and electricity hook-ups. The prison predates Nevada statehood and was used for 150 years, from 1862 to 2012. Former Republican Assemblyman Pete Livermore of Carson City led a push in 2013 to make it a museum. Carson City Chamber of Commerce executive Ronni Hannaman calls the facility part of a unique history that could bring visitors to town.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: There may be some bad blood between a former financial adviser and clients he’s accused of defrauding via a fake charity he claimed involved singer Taylor Swift. The state Bureau Of Securities Regulation recently obtained a court order to freeze the assets of Dain Stokes and prevent him from contacting former clients. Authorities say two of those clients invested more than half a million dollars in what Stokes claimed was a charity project in Africa involving Swift, Bill Gates and other celebrities. In court documents, officials also say Stokes told clients he was engaged to Swift and promised them a 20% return. Stokes, of Fremont, has been fired by LPL Financial in Bedford.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state has greenlighted roughly $13 million in film tax credits for “WrestleMania” and David Simon’s production of the Philip Roth novel “The Plot Against America.” The Economic Development Authority authorized the tax credits at its board meeting Tuesday. It’s the third round of film tax credits under a 2018 law that established awards. About $9 million was awarded in August for two projects, including “Joker,” and $6.2 million was awarded in June for four projects. Former Gov. Chris Christie let a former film tax incentive program expire in 2015. “WrestleMania XXXV” got a $2.9 million award and was shot in April at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford. “The Plot Against America,” starring Winona Ryder and John Turturro, got a $10.2 million award and was shot in Jersey City.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state has discontinued financial bonuses for top-rated teachers as it delivers the results of job-performance evaluations for the school year that ended in June. Public Education Department spokesman Connor Boyle confirmed this week that no money was allocated by the state for Excellence in Teaching Awards. The performance bonuses of up to $10,000 were devised by former Republican Gov. Susana Martinez. The administration of Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is creating a new teacher evaluation system for the 2020-2021 school year with help from a 46-member task force and suggestions from community meetings. Student test scores no longer figure directly in evaluations. Lawmakers increased teacher salaries by 6% or more this year with additional pay under extended school-year calendars.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city has announced a settlement that prevents floating digital billboards in its waters. Under the terms of the agreement announced Tuesday, Ballyhoo Media must pay a $100,000 fine if its Times Square-style LED billboards are seen on any East River or Hudson River barges. The city sued Ballyhoo Media in March, claiming the floating billboards created a “public nuisance” and broke zoning laws. The agreement comes after the state enacted a law in August that banned floating digital billboards in its navigable waters. Ballyhoo released a statement saying it had complied with all local, state and federal laws and has a legal right to safely operate in New York waters but decided to stop fighting the city and state and focus on pursuing opportunities elsewhere.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The federal government has denied individual assistance for residents in four counties hit hard by Hurricane Dorian just days after approving other funds to help local governments repair infrastructure, the governor said Wednesday. Gov. Roy Cooper had sent a letter to the White House seeking federal aid for households in Carteret, Dare, Hyde and New Hanover counties. The assistance, which would have included funds for uninsured expenses including temporary housing, lodging reimbursement and repairs, was denied in a letter from FEMA, signed by Associate Administrator Jeff Byard, saying that “it has been determined that the impact to the individuals and households from this event is not of such severity and magnitude to warrant the designation of Individual Assistance.” It says the denial can be appealed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A man whose life sentence was overturned in the death of a woman whose baby was cut from her womb was resentenced Monday to 20 years in prison after he apologized and pleaded for leniency in front of a nearly empty courtroom. There were no apologies from East Central District Judge Tom Olson for the life sentence he gave to William Hoehn last year for his role in the 2017 killing of Savanna Greywind, only for the state Supreme Court to overturn it on appeal. “I want to sentence you to as long as I can by law,” Olson told Hoehn. The judge somberly noted that Greywind’s child, who survived the attack, will still be in high school when Hoehn is eligible for parole, although his exact release date will likely be decided by the state Department of Corrections.\n\nOhio\n\nAshland: A homeowner has been busy cleaning up after a large goat broke into her home by ramming through a sliding glass door and then settling down for a nap in a bathroom. The Ashland Times-Gazette reports Logan Keathley returned to his family’s Sullivan Township home Friday to find their German Shepherd agitated and the house reeking. That’s when he discovered “Big Boy,” a goat who had escaped from a farm several miles away, napping in a bathroom. Logan’s mother, Jennifer, began calling friends for advice. Ashland County sheriff’s deputies arrived, put a rope around Big Boy’s neck and tried to entice him outside with food. They finally grabbed the billy goat by the horns and led him outside. Jennifer Keathley says her home “definitely smells like a goat farm.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A Democratic lawmaker from the city and other advocates for more restrictive gun laws filed a lawsuit Monday challenging a new state law that will allow people to carry firearms without a background check or training. State Rep. Jason Lowe’s suit argues that the law violates a state constitutional requirement that bills deal with only one subject matter. “This fight is far from over,” Lowe said at a news conference. “We believe this law is dangerous.” Dubbed “constitutional carry” by its supporters, the bill signed by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt would allow most adults to carry firearms, concealed or openly, without the currently required background check or training. Exceptions would include anyone in the country illegally or those convicted of certain crimes. The bill is scheduled to take effect Nov. 1.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s public records advocate says fees charged by the state and local governments for public records requests are high and wildly uneven, creating a barrier for journalists and citizens seeking documents. Ginger McCall, who leaves her job Friday, said in a final report Wednesday that fees, sometimes reaching $180 per hour, are onerous compared to what the federal government and other states charge. She recommended a less discretionary fee structure and low rates and called for the Legislature and others to commit more resources to public records processing. McCall announced her resignation in September, saying Gov. Kate Brown’s office wanted her to secretly work for the governor while giving the impression she was working in the public interest. Brown said she regrets the controversy and is committed to improving transparency.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A man who has maintained his innocence in a murder case for nearly three decades has been ordered free from prison after a judge overturned his conviction. Willie Veasy’s long-running appeal came to an end Wednesday morning, when a judge tossed out the murder conviction. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports the judge told the 54-year-old Veasy that “you’re a free man,” as a crowd in the courtroom erupted in applause. He’d spent 27 years in prison. Veasy’s case is one of two the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office was reviewing due to ties to two former detectives accused of using threats, false promises or abuse to coerce suspects into confessing to murders they didn’t commit. Veasy insisted for decades that he didn’t kill John Lewis on a Philadelphia street corner in 1992.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Supporters of a free tuition program at the Community College of Rhode Island say graduation rates have improved, but there is room to do better. The two-year graduation rate at the college hit 19% this year, more than tripling its historical average of 6% and putting it above the national average. Enrollment has surged, especially for minority students. But CCRI President Meghan Hughes tells The Boston Globe the college has more work to do when it comes to raising graduation rates for the low-income students the Rhode Island Promise Scholarship free tuition program was designed to help. Hughes said the college is raising private money to better support low-income students. The college expects to spend about $7 million this year on the program.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFripp Island: A family visiting the Palmetto State fished a big package from the ocean, took it to their rental home and opened it up, finding about 44 pounds of cocaine. Beaufort County Sheriff’s Maj. Bob Bromage told news outlets Monday that the family was walking along Fripp Island when they spotted the trash bag-wrapped package floating in the water. They dragged it onto the beach and lugged it to their rental in a golf cart, later slicing it open to discover bricks of white powder. At that point, they figured they’d better call police. Authorities assessed the cocaine’s value at more than $600,000. Officials are working to determine its origin. Bromage said narcotics don’t frequently wash up in the county. He thinks Hurricane Dorian may have pushed it ashore.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBadlands National Park: Bison are about to have more room to roam. People are invited to celebrate expansion of the park’s bison range during a public ceremony Friday. The Return of the Bison Celebration begins at 11 a.m. at Pinnacles Overlook and will feature a ceremonial fence cutting, a bison release and a grass dance performed by students from American Horse Middle School. The park will open more than 22,000 acres to bison. Thanks to $743,000 in contributions, the park installed 43 miles of new fence along with new cattle guards to expand the bison grazing area to 80,193 acres. Park officials say the expanded grazing area will contribute to the health and genetic integrity of a herd estimated at 1,200 bison and to continued health of the prairie.\n\nTennessee\n\nMaryville: A forestry professor says the fall leaf colors in the Smoky Mountains will be more subdued this year. Wayne Clatterbuck tells The Daily Times that color changes probably won’t happen until November. And when they come, they will likely be of short duration. The University of Tennessee professor says the problem is the recent heat and lack of rain. Clatterbuck says some species of trees that require more moisture already will have lost their leaves by the time the leaves start to change. He says species like oaks will retain their leaves and “sort of turn burnt red.” But tulip poplars and cherry trees are expected to just drop their leaves without any color change except to brown.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A federal court of appeals is hearing arguments in a lawsuit accusing the University of Texas of violating free speech rights by removing Confederate statues. The Texas chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans sued after the university put three statues of leading Confederate figures in storage. The move followed 2017 white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which three people died. The lawsuit argues that the university breached its agreement with Maj. George Washington Littlefield, who donated the statues in 1921. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments Tuesday. The Austin American-Statesman reports Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton says the court should dismiss the case. He says the group doesn’t have standing to challenge the university.\n\nUtah\n\nCisco: An artist is trying to revitalize an abandoned railroad town by refurbishing buildings and converting them into residences for artists. KUTV reports that artist Eileen Muza is the sole resident of Cisco, a scattering of old buildings in the high desert 30 miles west of the Colorado line. It was created in the 1880s as a fill-station for a railroad that connected Utah to Colorado. The town was abandoned when Interstate 70 was built a few miles north. Muza first became fascinated by the town when she visited it while on vacation. She purchased it in 2015 and left Chicago. She is fixing up the buildings so other artists can work from them in a residency project she calls “Home of the Brave.”\n\nVermont\n\nEast Richford: A bridge connecting the Green Mountain State and Quebec since 1918 has been restored. The East Richford Sutton International Bridge over the Missisquoi River reopened Monday. Marie-Claude Francoeur, a Quebec delegate, says residents on both sides of the bridge are “not only friends, we are family.” State officials say about 10 to 15 people use the bridge daily, but that number fluctuates with the seasons. Vermont and the Province of Quebec own and maintain the bridge, splitting it about 80% and 20% respectively. Gov. Phil Scott says the newly renovated border crossing will strengthen trade between Vermont and Quebec, which trade more than $2.2 billion worth of goods every year.\n\nVirginia\n\nBlacksburg: A review into a panel’s safety recommendations after the Virginia Tech mass shooting shows the state has implemented a majority of the proposals. The Roanoke Times reports Gov. Ralph Northam launched a review into the proposal adoptions after a special legislative session on gun violence was shut down by Republicans. The review found 74 of the proposals have been fully or partially implemented. The review says three recommendations weren’t implemented, including universal background checks, which Northam intended to push during the special session in light of the Virginia Beach shooting that left 12 people and the shooter dead. The Virginia Tech Panel was set up by then-Gov. Tim Kaine three days after a shooter killed 32 students and himself. The panel mostly focused on mental health, not gun control.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An environmental group says state and federal officials are moving too slowly to implement cleanup plans for the state’s waters. The Seattle Times reports a 1998 agreement between Northwest Environmental Advocates and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency called for the state Department of Ecology to develop plans for almost 1,600 bodies of water. The group says in a court filing that plans for more than 540 water bodies that were supposed to be done in 2013 are incomplete. The group is suing to force EPA to set a timetable for completing plans for other waters identified as polluted. An EPA spokesman declined comment on the filings. State officials say such plans may not always be the best way, noting lawsuits can delay implementation, and in recent years have tried other approaches.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMadison: This drug-ravaged state has opened its first family treatment court aimed at protecting abused and neglected children while helping parents facing potential loss of custody to overcome substance use disorders. The court’s debut at the Boone County Courthouse in Madison was celebrated Monday. Family treatment courts also will open in Ohio and Randolph counties. Boone County Circuit Judge William Thompson is heavily involved in helping people addicted to drugs turn their lives around and envisioned the idea of a family treatment court a decade ago. He said the new court’s goal is keeping families together. Drug cases have overwhelmed the state’s court system. In a state of 1.8 million residents, more than 30,000 people are in drug treatment. West Virginia has by far the nation’s highest drug overdose death rate.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers has declared the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day, following similar moves in other states away from recognizing it as Columbus Day. WLUK-TV reports Evers signed an executive order making the designation Tuesday at Indian Community School in Franklin. Evers says with the executive order, the state is recognizing and appreciating tribal nations and indigenous people and the contributions they’ve made to Wisconsin, which is home to 11 recognized American Indian tribes. Oneida Nation Chairman Tehassi Hill says the change has been a long time coming and can serve as an educational tool about tribal culture and history. Columbus Day remains a federal holiday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A new court filing has revealed the federal government began a fraud investigation into coal company Blackjewel LLC prior to the company’s sale last week of two Wyoming coal mines. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the document filed Saturday indicates the investigation also preceded Blackjewel’s July bankruptcy filing. Court documents say Blackjewel owes the federal government about $50 million. The court filing says the government has been investigating Blackjewel’s potential violations of the False Claims Act, which holds corporations liable for defrauding the government. The government has asked a West Virginia federal bankruptcy court to delay discharging Blackjewel of its debts, which would allow the investigation to continue.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/10"}]}

He did not provide an update on the condition of the other two people hospitalized after the incident.\n\nA university spokesman later said the two students injured are an 18-year-old woman who is a freshman and a 22-year-old man who is a sophomore. No information was provided about the two people who DSU said are not students.\n\nThe details are the latest in a shifting narrative from DSU, which first sent out an alert about the shooting three days ago.

He also would not respond to whether shots were fired into a crowd of students — a fact which DSU Police Department Chief Bobby Cummings confirmed during the forum Tuesday.\n\n\"It is important to us that when incidents happen on campus that we deliver communication (and) candid responses within a timely fashion,\" Allen said at the same forum.\n\nCummings said on Tuesday that the shooting is still under investigation, and no suspect has been identified.

In 2007, the university made national headlines when two freshmen were shot, one fatally. More recently, in 2015, three people were struck by gunfire at an annual student cookout.\n\nThe university president said the school will continue to increase security, especially around the basketball courts where there currently isn't a \"welcome center\" vetting visitors at the nearby gate. The idea to add these security checkpoints to gates other than the main one was \"a good suggestion,\" Cummings said.\n\nWhile the gates do close at night, Allen said that \"the reality is that (DSU is) an open campus and there are multiple ways to get on the campus, not unlike any other university in the country.\"\n\nHe pointed out some of the existing security in place besides the gate, including 30 campus police officers, a \"robust camera system\" and ID checks.\n\nMORE:How a Delaware employee's 'assault on women's healthcare' altered this OB-GYN practice\n\nStill, Student Government Association President David Hawkins said at Tuesday's forum that it has been \"a very dark period for the university.\" He said he's noticed lower student engagement since the shooting.\n\n\"A lot of students weren't really expecting to come on to campus and for anything like this to ever happen,\" Hawkins said.\n\nStudents affected by the shooting have had access to counselors on campus since Sunday morning, Allen said.\n\nThe DSU Police Department did not respond to multiple requests for comment since Saturday's shooting.\n\nSend story tips or ideas to Hannah Edelman at hedelman@delawareonline.com.

But HBCUs like Delaware State are riding a wave of their own\n\nWhy were Delaware State students protesting?\n\nCalls without answers, long times spent waiting for response, avoiding stairwells, fear of walking alone at night — students had a lot to say about campus safety. And they found a megaphone to do it.\n\nHundreds of students protested in Dover on Wednesday afternoon, Jan. 18, calling for change within the Delaware State University Police Department. The protest pushed into the late afternoon.\n\nStudents called for better response times, better training and more transparent handling of sexual assault cases by the Delaware State University Police Department. Several said they do not feel safe on campus. Others fear more sexual assaults are going unreported because they say they are not taken seriously.\n\nBackground:Delaware State students protest for more action, better response from university police\n\nThe university responded with a town hall meeting, set for 6 p.m. the next evening in the Education and Humanities Theatre. Media was barred from attending. Parents also told Delaware Online they were unable to attend.\n\nThe meeting would end up stretching nearly nine hours in the night, several students said Friday.

Comparing notes, swapping stories, drafting demands in hushed tones, their words steeped in an already restless campus atmosphere.\n\nThey had heard of a coalition forming to address concerns of safety and the handling of sexual assault cases. They heard students might get to lead it. Quickly, they agreed on their worst fear.\n\n“I don't want it to fizzle out,” Jayda Tate said to the group, heads nodding around her. “We don't have the luxury of time at Delaware State.”\n\nHundreds already filed out of class, finding megaphones to speak out about feeling unsafe or not taken seriously when reporting assaults. Protesters made noise in Dover that would lead to community meetings, news coverage and discussion during a state budget hearing for the public, land-grant university.\n\nNow, students feel that very catalyst has been muzzled.\n\nDelaware State University made any student who wished to join the Safe Space Coalition, through the core membership or nine steering committees, sign a confidentiality agreement. It would strip over 100 members serving across these committees of free speech on these issues, if they hoped to serve on the new workgroup formed to assess campus safety and existing protocol.\n\nBroad strokes in the agreement bar its signer from sharing “any and all information related to my participation as a committee member,” according to a copy obtained by Delaware Online/The News Journal, for fear that “such willful and unauthorized disclosure violates university policy (and) will be grounds for adverse action.”\n\nStudents stopped answering text messages. Some told this reporter they fear their school could sue them. Others fear pulled scholarships. Most didn’t have time to question the validity in their alarm.\n\nWhat's the 'Safe Space Project?'What a $300K grant for Delaware State University aims to address after student protests\n\nBackground from Dover:Delaware State students are fighting for campus safety. So what's next?\n\nA university spokesperson confirmed these agreements were sent across all members of the new coalition. The chief reason given was the possible handling of sensitive information.\n\n\"We need everybody to be on the same page and respect the privacy and confidentiality of what we're doing,\" said Carlos Holmes, director of news services. \"Once the committees come to decisions with respect to actions that will be taken, or measures that will be implemented, then that will be shared with the campus community.\"\n\nAttorney Alex Morey said she’s never heard anything quite like it.\n\n“It's another level of troubling that they would have students purport to sign away their rights — their expressive rights under the First Amendment — to talk about these issues that are going on, that are clearly of major public concern,” said the director of Campus Rights Advocacy for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE.\n\nStudents have strong rights to speech at public universities, Morey explained, particularly on issues of political and public concern.\n\n“What Delaware State is doing here is really putting these students in an incredibly difficult position,” she said. “Because they're saying we'll let you help us work to use government resources to fix this incredibly important problem — but you can't talk about it.”\n\nThe lid has been on tight in Dover. Delaware State escorted media out of the large town-hall meeting following Jan. 18 protest, while follow-up meetings were also made closed to the public. This marked the second time reporters have been removed from campus recently while trying to cover issues at the institution, including a shooting in September 2022. Several students also said these confidentiality agreements are common for student leaders, such as heads of Student Government Association, but Holmes did not offer confirmation.\n\nClosed to public:Delaware State responds to protest cries with closed-door town hall meeting\n\nMorey cautioned that a “well-meaning” administrator may have tied this privacy notion to discussion of sexual assault, but the public institution “is an arm of the state, using government resources\" and the best practice is transparency.\n\nConfidentiality or anonymity could have been specifically attributed perhaps to any sensitive student information, she said, if any student committee was going to be granted such access.\n\nAnyone participating had to sign. More than 100 students, parents, community members and employees form this coalition, according to a university announcement. The “core” of appointed leaders marries nine separate steering committees that students were free to join:\n\nCampus Health\n\nCounseling and Prevention\n\nCommunications and Customer Service\n\nEmployee Awareness and Safety, Facility and Management\n\nJudicial Affairs and Title IX\n\nProject Resources and Funding\n\nPublic Safety and Student Awareness\n\nEngagement, and Safety\n\nOne student said she wasn't surprised.\n\n“If we can’t be open and honest about what we’re doing, what’s the point?” posed Dynah Mosley, a junior who didn’t join any committees, having expected a document like this one. She stood for hours in protest. She spoke in multiple town halls. She shared her own story as a survivor.\n\nBut the junior said she’s tired of a culture that keeps quiet.\n\n“One of the big topics that I really tried to push for during the town hall was being open and honest,” she said. “If you want this to be a ‘family,’ then you have to be honest with your family. If you want us to trust, you have to build that trust with your family.”\n\nIt’s been nearly two months since the protest.\n\nQuiet, 'early days’ in Delaware State response\n\nAnother student asked to remain anonymous.\n\nConnecting on the phone over spring break, the Dover scholar’s caution remained that simply sharing whether they joined certain committees breaches the signed agreement. Even while personally more comfortable behind the scenes, they can sense its impact.\n\n“It dilutes the very catalysts of creating that change,” the member said of student NDAs. “So it’s interesting.”\n\nTheir committees have had just one introductory meeting so far, this student said, though they hope it’s \"still early days.” It is frustrating, however, having fellow Delaware State classmates unable to see much from the outside, save noticing electricians working on blue-light systems.\n\nIt’s almost dulling the pain, they said.\n\n“It kind of dulls the very reason people became angry — about administration, faculty not handling these cases in the timely order they should be handled,” the student said of sexual assaults. “If you’re asking what the school culture or environment is right now amongst peers. ... It’s kind of been complacent.”\n\nBut this student wants to see more. And ACLU-DE would agree.\n\n'Something's happening to my child':One survivor's family says it knows public safety culture at Delaware State, firsthand\n\nExecutive Director Mike Brickner said the organization has been trying to keep a pulse on campus unrest since the start of the year. He found news of the NDAs striking.\n\n\"Not every single student at Delaware State University is going to be able to participate. Not every single person who lives in the area of DSU is going to be able to participate. Not all of the parents or family members of people who go to DSU are going to be able to participate,\" Brickner said. \"So this is a vent that has essentially cut off that pipeline of public information.\"\n\nThe director since 2020 said if this measure were intended to protect the possible disclosure of sensitive information, it's \"using a sledgehammer to swat a fly.\"\n\nAs his organization continues to watch the university's response, he added, \"It absolutely concerns us.\"\n\nHolding hope for a Safe Space\n\nPresident Tony Allen began pitching the scaffolding of his university response by Jan. 20. Even in what the top administrator called \"initial steps,\" it became clear the coalition would mark central supports. The new workgroup began to form before month’s end, under a prescribed mission to assess protocol and make recommendations to his office.\n\nAllen said the coalition is now tasked with “regular reporting” to the broader university community at least monthly.\n\nOne of the largest announcements yet came last week, to the tune of $300,000.\n\nThe historically Black university’s coalition was awarded a two-year grant to assist in developing its sexual assault response and prevention program. The \"Safe Space Project” will be housed on DSU Downtown, Delaware State announced March 6. The university also committed to continuing its funding after these two years.\n\nLike several measures Allen announced, it joins promises to upgrade campus lighting and cameras, update the blue lights system, garner body cameras for university police and assess existing escort services and counseling hours.

These schools are nearly four times and six times larger than Delaware State in total student population, respectively.\n\nStudent organizers have repeatedly called on their school to “fortify the integrity” of its Title IX process — increasing trust and transparency, while treating cases as time-sensitive — as well as boost security, escort service, counselors for students and facility improvements to building security and water.\n\nThe Dover institution insists it's on a road to change, while experts question certain methods to get there.\n\nFor students, it’s just hard to ignore the clock.\n\n“Delaware State University stalls these types of issues, suffocates them like a flame almost,” said the anonymous student, noting many seniors form the core coalition. “And once you graduate, that’s basically your exit ticket from the university’s issues.”\n\nKelly Powers covers race, culture and equity for the USA TODAY Network's Northeast Region and Delaware Online, with a focus on education.

The Safe Space Coalition is led by Dr. Gwen Scott-Jones, Dean of the Wesley College of Health and Behavioral Sciences, and senior social work major and Student Government Association Treasurer Rita Williams. Core team members are listed here.\n\nAdditionally, nine new committees will tackle specific elements of concern, working in conjunction with the Coalition.

Equally important will be regular reporting to the broad University community, which will happen monthly for the foreseeable future. I also want to be clear on one final point.

It is part of an effort to reduce crime in an area that has historically seen the highest numbers.\n\nUnder the program, residents on 14 streets – including New, Queen, Kirkwood, Bradford and Governors streets – can get the free lights if they pledge to turn them on every night.\n\n\"The goal is to increase security and empower residents to increase public awareness of criminal activity in these high-risk areas,\" said Chanda Jackson, community engagement specialist for Restoring Central Dover. \"Neighbors working together and talking to each other creates a sense of community. We hope it will demonstrate a unified community approach to public safety.\"\n\nVolunteers from the HELP Initiative Inc. and the Restoring Central Dover, along with interns from Delaware State University, have been out all week installing the lightbulbs and motion floodlights on houses whose owners signed a pledge to reduce crime during a kickoff block party at the end of June.\n\nSTORY: Three state hospital workers charged after patient dies\n\nSTORY: Smyrna hires firm to investigate police chief\n\nThe boots-on-the-ground effort also approaches owners in houses that are not already signed up to try to get full neighborhood participation. McCallister fell into that category.\n\n\"This is amazing,\" said McCallister, who lives on South Queen Street. \"I didn't know this was happening, but I think it might help deter people from going in backyards. I think this will help decrease crime in the area.\"\n\nThat's the hope of the Dover Police Department, a community partner in the campaign. Dover Police Chief Marvin Mailey Jr. believes the effort is a great prevention tool in some of the city's high-risk neighborhoods.\n\nThe area around South New Street, South Governors Avenue, South Bradford Street and South Kirkwood Street has seen more than its share of crime and is considered one of the worst areas in the city, he said.\n\nMailey said people there want to have a better quality of life.\n\n\"Typically, this is our high-crime area, and we are trying to change the landscape of the city,\" Mailey said. \"This program will definitely make Dover safer. Our bad guys don't like to stand under lights when they commit crimes.\"\n\nAccording to Dover police data, burglaries and robberies rose by double-digit percentages in 2016, as were violent crimes, including murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. A large number of those crimes are occurring in the campaign's target area, Mailey said.\n\nWhen the campaign was first discussed publicly in April, the goal was to reach 200 homes in a 75-block area. That number is now 500 homes, according to Jackson. She estimates the cost for materials is $9,000, with the labor being donated by volunteers.\n\nJackson said a number of partners have pledged money and labor, including the HELP Initiative Inc., Delaware State University, NCALL Research Inc., Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County, Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility, the Home Depot and Dover police.\n\n\"This is a community effort and the residents seem pretty receptive. So far, we've had positive reaction to the campaign,\" she said. \"We're getting calls from residents asking when they can get their bulbs. It's a matter of breaking the ice and building relationships.\"\n\nCharlie Kistler and Harold Stafford have been providing the installation labor this past week and will continue their efforts until all the houses in the target area have bulbs and motion sensors. Along the way, the founders of the HELP Initiative Inc. have been educating homeowners about the campaign and also about energy efficiency in general.\n\n\"The residents commit to leaving the lights on and also to keeping their neighbors aware that it is important to keep their lights on, too,\" Kistler said. \"When we go from house to block to neighborhood and then the city, we want to light it up to the point where we can reduce crime.\"\n\nBut the effort is about more than crime, Jackson said.\n\nRestoring Central Dover was adopted in 2014 as a comprehensive neighborhood revitalization plan. Jackson said the plan represents the community’s vision for restoring the vitality of Central Dover and lists recommendations for implementation over the next 10 years.\n\nResident input and priorities have been derived from a community survey, meetings, events, activities and community outreach, she said.\n\n\"Lights-On Dover Strong is just a piece of the puzzle,\" she said. \"Relationships are important in this campaign and all of our efforts.

Stephen J. Ballard may not have always worn his Delaware State Police uniform, but he was always on duty, his wife Louise said.\n\n\"He gave, literally, his life to this job,\" she said in an interview with The News Journal. \"But when he was living, he gave his life each day to Delaware and the community he served.\"\n\nBallard was gunned down Wednesday in a Bear-area Wawa parking lot when he approached a suspicious vehicle and the passenger jumped out and began firing at him. Ballard fell after being hit, and the shooter continued to fire rounds into the trooper before fleeing to his family's Middletown-area home.\n\nThe shooter was identified as 26-year-old Burgon Sealy Jr., who was shot dead by police 21 hours after emerging from the barricaded home that was largely destroyed by explosive charges used to break down windows and doors. Sealy appeared armed with a weapon after an armored vehicle ripped siding off the structure.\n\nA Celebration of Life service is slated for 11 a.m. Friday at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. Those wishing to pay respects to his family are invited to do so from 8:30 a.m. until 10 a.m. Immediately following, uniformed emergency services personnel will be invited to pay their respects.\n\nFriends, colleagues and family members described the 32-year-old Ballard as having a big smile and a positive nature. His wife said his willingness to help people is what attracted her to him in the first place.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED: Standoff ends in Middletown; suspect in Delaware trooper death killed\n\nWHO HE WAS: Trooper's friends say Delaware lost a bright light\n\nThe two met through mutual friends at the Delaware State Police, where Ballard began working 8½ years ago after graduating from Delaware State University. He was recruited by troopers to join the force right out of college, Louise Ballard said, and he graduated the academy in April 2009.\n\nThe two were married on Nov. 15, 2015, at the DuPont Country Club near Wilmington. The family had recently moved to Hockessin, and Ballard was working as a patrolman based out of Troop 2 in Glasgow.\n\nHe didn't always intend to be a state trooper, Louise said. Ballard originally started DSU in the school's aviation program with dreams of being a pilot, after serving as a Civil Air Patrol cadet in the wing’s Andrews Composite Squadron from 1998-2006.\n\nLt. Col. James Brogan, now chief of staff for the Nebraska Wing, previously served in the same squadron with Ballard and remembered him as a man with quiet demeanor, steadfast determination and unquestionable integrity.\n\n“A man whose actions were consistent with his word, Stephen set an example to all around him and inspires us to be and do more in our communities,\" Brogan said in a release from the Civil Air Patrol National Capital Wing. \"His legacy can be seen in the love shared across this nation and among those of us who had the privilege to know him. It's more than accurate to say that I learned more from Stephen than I could have ever imparted to him.”\n\nBallard changed his major to criminal justice after realizing he wanted to engage more with the community as a police officer rather than a pilot, his wife said. He continued to work with the university through the only collegiate chapter of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, or NOBLE, where he mentored about eight students.\n\nHe was also highly involved in NOBLE career fairs, fundraising events and recruiting, said Delaware Chapter President Director Joseph Bryant Jr., adding that Ballard touched many lives within the organization.\n\n\"He had an infectious smile and caring spirit with a kind and giving heart,\" Bryant said in a statement. \"While we know we have lost a member of the law enforcement community, we have truly lost a member of our family.\"\n\nIn lieu of flowers at the funeral, Ballard's family has requested donations be made in his memory to NOBLE.\n\nThe outpouring of love and support for the Delaware State Police and Ballard's family in the days after his death would have made him even prouder to be a trooper, Louise Ballard said. This camaraderie and willingness to serve and support each other was the reason he wore the uniform, she said.\n\n\"He wanted to help people in the best way,\" Louise Ballard said. \"Out of the kindness of his heart, if he wanted to help someone, he would do that. Personally, that was his nature; it's who he was.\"\n\nBallard's love for people spilled over into his personal life, where he helped his wife raise their 5-year-old daughter, Abigail. Many who knew him immediately described him as a family man who put his wife and daughter first.\n\nRELATED: A harrowing night in Middletown-area neighborhood\n\nRELATED: Wilmington 5K run honors fallen police officers\n\nState police created a memorial fund to help his family at the Delaware State Police Federal Credit Union. Checks can be made out to the DSTA-Stephen Ballard Memorial Fund, P.O. Box 168, Cheswold, DE 19936.\n\nAll Wawa locations in Delaware will also be collecting donations for Ballard's memorial fund, and the company pledged to match the first $50,000 in customer donations. A small memorial service will be held at 10 a.m. Monday at the Pulaski Highway location, which has been closed since Ballard was killed there.\n\nBut underneath the badge and uniform, Ballard was human, too, Louise said.\n\nHe loved to travel, even if it was only up to Philadelphia to catch dinner and a show. Every year, she said, they tried to take a new trip together and see another part of the world.\n\nHe was also a fan of gardening, she admitted with a laugh.\n\n\"He actually really enjoyed cutting the grass,\" Louise Ballard said. \"He was very proud of his lawn.\"\n\nAnd he never passed up the opportunity to make better the world he lived in, she said. He would often cover costs of dry cleaning or car repairs for friends who needed help.\n\nOnce he stopped to counsel a young woman driving erratically when he was off duty in his trooper SUV, Louise recalled. He was on his way to the gym when he pulled her over, she said, but he wanted her to be safer and make others on the road safer, too.\n\n\"He cared about Delaware,\" she said. \"This is the only job he's had and he's known, and he really took it seriously. He respected the job. ... He had a lot of good friends on the force. And I know he's going to be terribly missed.\"\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

When a health care breach occurs, it doesn't mean that a patient's identity is necessarily stolen, only that the information is left unsecured for a period of time.\n\nThe Wilmington mom, like others, knew it wasn't good news, but she also didn't fully understand the repercussions.\n\n\"I guess I should know but I don't, \" acknowledged Kirton, who works as a professional organizer. \"I'm just kind of surviving each day with my kids.\"\n\nA growing crime, medical record-pilfering represents the next frontier of identity theft. As the modern medical workforce increasingly shares information electronically, hackers can use ransomware to hijack hospital records by encrypting patient data, and then demand payment to have it returned. Employee negligence, insecure mobile devices and use of public cloud services all threaten the security of highly sensitive information.\n\nIn 2015 alone, more than 100 million health care records were compromised nationwide –– more than one-third of all computer security breaches that year. Virtually all the exposed health information stemmed from three attacks on insurance providers: Anthem Inc., Premera Blue Cross and Excellus Health Plan Inc.\n\n\"If you have somebody's electronic record, you own that person,\" said Robert Lord, co-founder and CEO of Protenus, a Baltimore-based patient privacy monitoring platform. \"There is a huge incentive to get this data.\"\n\nHealth care systems, which rely on updated medical information in life-or-death decision-making, lack the money and resources to manage breaches estimated to cost the industry $6.2 billion a year, according to security experts. A Protenus study found that the number of data breaches nearly doubled from 2015 to 2016, averaging more than one data breach per day.\n\nCompounding the problem, government monitoring efforts vary considerably by state, and thieves can use medical information for a longer period of time and for a broader range of nefarious purposes than credit card information. Among the possibilities: Racking up expenses for medical services and devices, insurance reimbursements and prescription drugs under someone else's name; filing false tax returns; opening up credit cards; and setting up phony medical clinics.\n\nPatients, particularly children, aren't always alerted to a problem until months or years down the road when they go to apply for a first credit card or car loan, according to Lord. By that point, their health records could be riddled with inaccurate information.\n\nStory: TransPerfect workers victimized in data breach\n\nThe situation is especially troubling in Delaware, one of a minority of states nationwide where healthcare organizations aren't required to notify state government agencies, including the attorney general, about medical security breaches. The First State's security breach law hasn't been updated in more than a decade; during that time, the AG's Consumer Protection Unit, which is empowered to enforce data breach notification standards, hasn't filed a single enforcement action, according to office spokesman Carl Kanefsky.\n\n\"Although [the Department of Justice's] legal authority over data breaches is limited, DOJ believes that data breaches should be taken very seriously by companies or organizations whose data is compromised,\" he said.\n\nMaryland's AG, by contrast, has required two health care providers to pay penalties totaling $120,000, improve security practices and pay for patients' identity theft monitoring services under settlements for medical records data breaches dating to 2013, according to office spokeswoman Christine Tobar.\n\nUnlike more than a dozen other states, Delaware's law primarily focuses on financial identity theft; it doesn't include medical records or insurance information under the definition of protected personal information, which triggers public notification requirements in the event of a breach. Instead, the state defers to federal law, which mandates that health care providers notify affected individuals of a data breach within 60 days.\n\nYet a 2015 survey of medical identity theft victims by the Ponemon Institute found that only about a quarter of people are directly notified after a breach.\n\nOnce alerted, medical identity theft victims spend an average of $13,500 and 200 hours to rectify the situation, the privacy think tank found.\n\nIn the past two years, Delaware has made strides in protecting the privacy of website and mobile app users, children, students and crime victims. But medical records privacy has taken a back seat, according to Wilmington attorney Carl \"Chuck\" N. Kunz III.\n\nKunz, who specializes in data privacy issues, identified several \"shortcomings\" in Delaware's current law, including the AG's narrow enforcement authority and the absence of a specific timeline for notifying affected patients.\n\n\"Speaking as a consumer, I'd like to be notified as soon as I reasonably could,\" Kunz said. \"Nothing's changed (in Delaware law) for the last 10 years and there's been a lot of activity.\"\n\nBack in 2013, in response to rapidly changing technology, several members of the General Assembly attempted to strengthen Delaware's digital data breach law by expanding the definition of personal information, broadening the AG's authority to help affected individuals recoup money, and requiring companies to pay $1,000 per breach per person, even if no actual damages could be proven. The bill died in committee and has yet to be reintroduced.\n\nRep. Paul Baumbach, a Newark Democrat and bill co-sponsor, said the legislation didn't move forward because it was introduced late in the session.\n\n\"It probably is overdue looking at that,\" he said, explaining that former Rep. Darryl Scott, a Dover Democrat, was the General Assembly's technology expert.\n\n\"Without that champion there, we are less proactive and more reactive,\" added Baumbach, who holds bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science.\n\nThe bill's primary sponsor, Sen. Dave Sokola, another Newark Democrat, declined a request for a phone interview on the topic. In an email to The News Jounral, Sokola said cybersecurity issues are top-of-mind and \"I'm open to suggestions on how to strengthen Delaware's laws to protect our citizens against data breaches going forward.\"\n\nRecently, one state agency entered the fray. Responding to about 10 customer complaints, Delaware's new Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro launched an investigation this month into a security breach involving Summit Reinsurance Services and BCS Financial Corporation. Summit and BCS are both subcontractors of Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware.\n\nSummit voluntarily reported the breach to Attorney General Matt Denn's office this month. The Indiana-based company disclosed that ransomware had infected a server containing personal information, such as names, Social Security numbers, health insurance information and medical records of roughly 19,000 Delaware consumers. The unauthorized access occurred back in March and wasn't discovered until August, according to a recent letter that Summit sent to affected patients.\n\nStory: 19,000 Delaware Blue Cross Blue Shield members' data breached\n\nUnder the Delaware Insurance Code, the insurance commissioner has the authority, with reasonable cause, to investigate the conduct of insurance companies and levy sanctions or fines against those violating the law.\n\n\"The commissioner runs a very consumer-centric office,\" office spokesman Vince Ryan explained. \"He feels that any instance that could put someone or someone's personal information at risk is significant and noteworthy of this office's attention.\"\n\nYet Navarro's office isn't empowered to investigate data breaches involving health care providers, such as Brandywine Pediatrics' breach last year.\n\nAccording to a Dec. 23 letter sent to nearly 27,000 current and former patients, the Brandywine breach occurred on Oct. 25 when a file server was attacked and encrypted by a \"computer virus.\" That led an \"unauthorized person\" to possibly access children's names, addresses and medical records, but not Social Security numbers of payment information, the letter said.\n\n\"The is no evidence that any information was taken,\" according to the letter, which was faxed to The News Journal at 4:33 p.m. the Friday before Christmas — just in time to meet the federal notification deadline. The Silverside Road practice also posted a notice on its website and set up a toll-free number to field patient concerns.\n\nPractice staff declined The News Journal's request for a phone interview. In a recent email, Jerald Eng, one of Brandywine's eight doctors, wrote that he had heard no complaints from patients regarding stolen data and \"a culprit has not been identified.\" The practice, which had never before experienced a data breach in its 25-year history, has since hired a new IT firm to bolster its firewalls and virus protection, Eng said.\n\nIn a separate email to The News Journal, practice manager Fran Davenport wrote that the office took two months to notify patients due to a lengthy investigation by a computer forensics expert. While Brandywine Pediatrics notified other state attorneys general who had residents affected by the breach, Delaware has no such requirement, she said.\n\nEven though her four children's medical information may be floating around somewhere, Lisa Creegan says she will remain a client of the practice. Creegan, a teacher, says she loves the doctors and wasn't alarmed that her kids' medical information might have been exposed.\n\n\"This happens to my credit card or debit card all the time,\" she said.\n\nScope of problem unknown\n\nCreegan's reaction is considered typical; consumers have become accustomed to data breaches at retailers, hotels and restaurants over the last two years, but they often don't realize that medical records are considerably more valuable on the black market than credit card numbers, according to security experts.\n\n\"The tools and the hackers are getting more sophisticated,\" said Michael Vatis, a New York attorney who has specialized in data breaches for more than two decades. It's rare for a government agency to charge financial penalties for health care data breaches, according to Vatis. More often, a provider or insurer is asked to invest in better technology to avoid future problems.\n\nStory: In secret deal, city employee gets payout\n\nSecurity experts recommend educating employees on how to respond to data breaches, using automated technology to track user and system activity in real-time, encrypting data and maintaining up-to-date software.\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to fine a company from $100 to $50,000 for each failure to uphold privacy standards. An individual who intentionally violates federal law and attempts to profit from medical information can face more substantial fines and jail time.\n\nWhile HHS has been criticized for lax enforcement, last year was a notable exception. The department entered into a $5.55 million settlement agreement with Illinois-based Advocate Health Care Network — the largest to date against a single entity — for multiple data breaches involving more than four million individual records.\n\nThe Office for Civil Rights also maintains a \"wall of shame\" portal, tracking more than 1,800 health care data breaches involving at least 500 individuals since 2009.\n\nListed among the top 10 (by number of people affected) is Jacksonville, Florida-based Nemours Children's Health System. In 2011, Nemours reported a data breach affecting 1.6 million patients, vendors and employees at Nemours facilities in four states, including Delaware. A locked cabinet containing unencrypted computer backup tapes with billing and payroll data was reported missing from a Wilmington facility after a remodeling project. At the time, Nemours representatives said there was no evidence the tapes were stolen or the information was misused.\n\nFollowing the incident, the health system invested in staff training and upgraded encryption services. Nemours Chief Information Security Officer David Jollow would not disclose the total amount spent on improvements.\n\n\"If it's encrypted, that's a great protection to keep it safe,\" he said. \"It practically eliminates the risk from hackers.\"\n\nTo date, Nemours, which operates Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, hasn't suffered another data breach, Jollow said. He added that he has heard no complaints from patients about their information being misused.\n\nThe Nemours breach occurred in Delaware and it was massive, yet it wasn't voluntarily reported to the Delaware AG and isn't listed among Delaware breaches in the federal portal.\n\nIn Delaware, unlike in California and other states, there's no one-stop shop to review all the medical data breaches affecting residents.\n\nPulling together information from state and federal governments and from newspaper archives, The News Journal found more than a half-dozen medical data breaches involving Delaware companies and residents over the last five years.\n\nPrior to the Summit breach, three others were voluntarily reported to the Delaware AG over the past five years, affecting a total of 258 residents.\n\nThree additional breaches appeared in the HHS portal, including the Brandywine Pediatrics breach and a 2014 breach involving Lewes-based Beebe Physicians Network. In the Beebe breach, a temporary contractor who had previously been arrested for identity theft, had handled protected health information of more than 1,800 individuals, according to the federal directory.\n\nIn response to a News Journal request, spokespeople for Christiana Care Health System and Bayhealth Medical Center said their systems had not suffered data breaches in the last five years.\n\nInternal employees, not outside hackers, are responsible for about 40 percent of all health record breaches, according to Lord. Last year, a former employee of Wilmington-based Ambucor Health Solutions downloaded health information affecting more than 1,600 people before leaving the company, according to the federal portal.\n\nIn August, nearly 150,000 Delaware Medicaid clients enrolled in Highmark Health Options were notified of a May cyber attack that potentially compromised their health plan information, including member ID and Medicaid numbers.\n\nRichard Grzybowski of Elsmere was among the notified patients. Now, the 58-year-old regularly checks his medical payment history for discrepancies. So far, he has found none.\n\nThe same day The News Journal published its story on the Highmark breach, the 58-year-old said his insurance company called him to verify his medical history.\n\nGrzybowski refused. The way the system currently functions, patients must keep sensitive information close to the vest, he said.\n\n\"Who is responsible?\" he wondered aloud. \"I feel like somebody should fix this.\"\n\nContact Margie Fishman at 302-324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.\n\nRecent medical data breaches affecting Delaware patients\n\n2017: Delaware Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro launches an investigation into a security breach involving Summit Reinsurance Services and BCS Financial Corporation, after ransomware infected a server containing personal information, such as names, Social Security numbers, health insurance information and medical records of roughly 19,000 Delaware consumers.\n\n2016: In late December, Brandywine Pediatrics notifies nearly 27,000 patients, parents and guardians about an October data breach that occurred after a file server was attacked and encrypted by a \"computer virus.\" That led an \"unauthorized person\" to possibly access children's names, addresses and medical records, but not Social Security numbers of payment information.\n\n2016: In August, nearly 150,000 Delaware Medicaid clients enrolled in Highmark Health Option are alerted to a May cyber attack that potentially compromised their health plan information, including member ID and Medicaid numbers.\n\n2014: A temporary Beebe Physicians Network contractor, who had previously been arrested for identity theft, is found to have handled protected health information of more than 1,800 individuals.\n\n2014: Visionworks, an eye care service provider, reports two medical data breaches affecting a total of 257 Delaware residents\n\n2011: Nearly 500 maternity patients at Saint Francis Hospital in Wilmington have their personal health care information potentially compromised when a doctor loses a thumb drive for as long as two weeks.\n\n2011: The names and Social Security numbers of 113 patients are stolen from a Beebe Medical Center employee, after the employee brought a cost report on vacation to Florida.\n\n2011: Florida-based Nemours Children's Health System reports a data breach affecting 1.6 million patients, vendors and employees at Nemours facilities in four states, including Delaware.

Christopher Leach, 41, a 14-year veteran, and Senior Firefighter Jerry Fickes, 51, a 13-year veteran, died in the fire. Both men had children and families, Goode said at a press conference Saturday.\n\nFirefighters Ardythe Hope and Brad Speakman were transported to Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland, Pennsylvania, and were in critical but stable condition Saturday evening.\n\nTwo other injured firefighters, Terrance Tate and John Cawthray, were treated at Christiana Hospital and discharged Saturday afternoon.\n\nCawthray thanked well-wishers on Facebook, and noted Leach and Fickes \"paid the ultimate sacrifice.\"\n\n\"I was lucky, I came away with only 2nd degree burns on my wrist and hand,\" he said. \"I truly loved both of them and they will be missed. Keep their families in mind.\"\n\nThe fire was reported 2:54 a.m. at 1927 Lakeview Road, in a neighborhood of brick rowhouses about a block south of South Union Street. Firefighters arrived to find flames shooting out of windows and doorways.\n\nRemembrances for Wilmington firefighters killed\n\nInformation sought: Wilmington line of duty deaths\n\n\"It was a huge pile of fire coming out of the front door,\" said a neighbor who goes by Ed and declined to provide his last name. \"I said to myself, 'How the hell are (firefighters) going to get in there.'\"\n\nAccording to the Fire Department, one or more firefighters became trapped at 3:14 a.m. and radioed for help. Dozens of firefighters responded and searched, officials said. They also used ladders to access the upper story of the rowhouse, where the fire shot through the roof and sent flames and thick smoke into the night sky.\n\nFire Department Battalion Chief James Jobes said firefighters were working on the first floor when it collapsed, trapping them in the basement. Their bodies were removed and taken to the state medical examiner's office in downtown Wilmington by a motorcade that was saluted by emergency personnel lining the streets.\n\n\"This is a tragic situation,\" said Wilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams. \"My heart is heavy. So much pain right now.\"\n\nThe residents of the home were able to escape.\n\nMissy Napier lived in the home with her five children, all between 10 and 17 years old. Another child, a family friend, was staying with the family. When she first noticed smoke, she scrambled to get all of the kids out of the home, she said.\n\n\"We started hollering, 'Get out of the house get out of the house,'\" she said between tears Saturday morning. \"We ran out back but the smoke was so hot. Not the fire, but the smoke was burning your face.\"\n\nNapier's mother, Debbie Napier, suspects firefighters thought someone was trapped, \"but everybody got out.\"\n\n\"It's breaking her heart that they passed away in her house,\" she said.\n\nDebbie Napier called her son, Tom Roth, as the fire raged. He arrived outside of his sister's house to find tall flames. By the afternoon, Roth, still stunned, sat in a folding chair a block away from the home alongside an ambulance.\n\nHe said the family had been celebrating the beginning of the weekend when the fire started. At first, they didn’t realize its magnitude, he said.\n\n“The adults were doing what adults do on a Friday night, listening to music having a couple of beers. Some of the kids were out riding their bikes right here,” Roth said. “The smoke hit them just dead in the face.”\n\nNeighbors on Saturday comforted one another on the narrow one-way street, developed as part of the Canby Park Estates subdivision 70 years ago. The side-by-side homes take up the entire block from Rodman Road to South Union Street, with an alley behind it.\n\nNew Castle County property records show 1927 Lakeview Road was built in 1944. The 1,075-square-foot property had three bedrooms.\n\nShane Henry, who lives with his fiancé in the basement of a row house next to the Napier home, said smoke enveloped the surrounding houses.\n\n“Out of nowhere, we saw a black cloud of smoke pour down into our room,” Henry said. “We thought it was maybe our roommates, maybe they left a cigarette still lit. But it was pouring too much, we knew something was wrong.\"\n\nHenry and his fiancé , unable to go home because of fire damage, now have nowhere to sleep, he said.\n\nAt about the same time that Henry noticed the fire, another neighbor, Johnny Alvarado, saw Napier’s children running down Lakeview Road away from the burning home.\n\n“First, you see the black smoke going up, then flames,” he said. “Smoke flooded the streets.”\n\nAlvarado began knocking on neighbors' doors telling them to get away in case the blaze were to spread. He wasn’t the only neighbor to jump into action.\n\nClaudia Leon lives across the street from the Napier home and awoke to a woman banging on her front door in the early hours of the morning.\n\n“She came to the door yelling, ‘Everybody get out — a fire broke out,” Leon said.\n\nMore than 12 hours after Leon had been warned of the blaze, the smell of smoke remained in the air along the block and a puddle of standing water that had flowed off of Napier's property rested at the intersection of Lakeview and Rodman Roads.\n\nMultiple neighbors chatted in front of homes as they peered toward the exterior of the charred, brick rowhouse and its yard, enclosed by a chain link fence. An extension ladder still rested against the front of the home, reaching just below the top floor window.\n\nThe Office of the State Fire Marshal and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are investigating the cause. The federal agency is participating because Wilmington fire officials decided to exclude themselves from the investigation, Jobes said. He said they are exploring all possibilities and foul play has not been ruled out, but he could not discuss specifics.\n\nLeach was assigned to Ladder Co. 2. Fickes was at Squad 4 and was a member and past assistant chief at Aetna Hose, Hook & Ladder Co. in Newark.\n\nVice President Joe Biden visited the scene of the fire and flags were also flown at half-staff at Wilmington fire stations, which were adorned with black bunting. At Fire Station No. 6 on North Union Street near the fire, a neighbor around 1 p.m. dropped off two pizzas to show her support for the department.\n\n\"It's tragic,\" said the woman, who declined to give her name. \"They're part of our neighborhood.\"\n\nIn Hockessin, the Old Lancaster Pike fire station sign read, “Prayers to our Brothers & Sisters of the Wilmington FD.”\n\nThe deaths mark the second incident that has seen a Delaware firefighter killed on the job this year.\n\nOn July 11, Tim McClanahan, a volunteer firefighter from Lewes, died after falling from a helicopter while training with the Delaware Air Rescue Team. Clanahan, 46, was a veteran emergency responder. He previously worked work for Priority 1 Rescue in Texas, which provides emergency service via helicopters to oil rigs and industry service ships in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBefore Saturday, the most recent Wilmington firefighter death was Prince Albert “Ali\" Mousley Jr., who was 58 when he was among the first to arrive at a house fire on the 2800 block of North Tatnall Street in Jan. 6, 1998. At the scene, Mousley collapsed with a heart attack and died. He was a 27-year veteran of the force.\n\nGoode, the Wilmington fire chief, knows well the dangers of the job. His father, Lt. James Goode Jr., died of a heart attack at a city fire station after he aided a rescue mission on the Delaware River on June 18, 1990. He was an 18-year veteran of the force.\n\nAt least 13 firefighters have died in the line of duty since the department’s first paid platoon of 50 firefighters started service in 1921.\n\nFuneral arrangements have not been announced for Leach and Fickes.\n\nGoode on Saturday called both men heroes.\n\n\"Please keep those children and those families and all the members of the Wilmington Fire department in your prayers,\" he said.\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

Minner dies in crash\n\nSTORY: Chromium-6 in Delaware tap water", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/05/15/newcastlesoapopera/27374999/", "title": "Attacks become norm in New Castle County government", "text": "Xerxes Wilson\n\nThe News Journal\n\nNew Castle County government now is a soap opera plot full of twists and turns, whisper campaigns, allegations of dirty tricks and email snooping.\n\nConsider the last council meeting of April: The 13 members approved a proclamation, made a committee appointment and authorized accepting grants. But the hearing focused on the minutiae of legislation Councilman George Smiley introduced to increase pay for certain County Council support staff.\n\nThe council passed the plan, but Executive Tom Gordon rejected it, saying that giving 10 employees a raise would lead to the other 2,000 county workers wanting the same. That sparked a larger debate about whether Gordon could tell the council what to do – and whether the council could override his veto.\n\n\"Now we are told by the administration that they will make decisions on council staff,\" said Smiley, a retired Teamsters official and co-chairman of the county Finance Committee who lives near New Castle. \"When do each of us come together as a council and as a legislative body to send a message that we will not be bought, we will not be intimidated and we will operate independently?\"\n\nNorth Wilmington resident Dennis Bilinski attended the meeting and was surprised by the tone of officials.\n\n\"I think it is outrageous because everybody is just cutting each others' throats out there,\" he said. \"I expect more professionalism. ... There are real problems they should be talking about.\"\n\nThe squabble highlights a growing acrimony among power brokers in county government, where four or five officials have spent months bickering over reoccurring issues of transparency and trust. The climate has spawned a tit-for-tat attitude among the key players, producing lengthy heated exchanges at public meetings, mocking emails and, in one case, a press release alleging improper conduct.\n\nTogether, the feuds have presented serious distractions for officials charged with governing some 550,000 residents.\n\nAlthough Gordon's opponents acknowledge that the day-to-day business of government is operating fairly smoothly, since December virtually no substantial legislative initiatives have been passed.\n\nThis dysfunctional drama has a colorful cast.\n\nOn one side is Gordon, a former county police chief and possible gubernatorial candidate who says he's being targeted by a few council members who don't like him personally. He says there is lingering resentment over his 2012 victory over then-County Executive Paul Clark.\n\n\"They have nothing to do but attack. I have tried for 2½ years to be their friend. I'm not doing it anymore,\" he said.\n\nIn supporting roles are Gordon's second-in-command, David Grimaldi, a former Wall Street financial adviser who sought to discredit an audit of county investments, and his deputy, Samuel Guy, a lawyer and former Wilmington City Council member.\n\nOn the other side is county Auditor Robert Wasserbach, who authored an audit of a controversial county investment and whose emails with his friend, a Dover lobbyist, prompted some on the council to call for an outside investigation.\n\nWasserbach is joined by Gordon foes Smiley and Councilwoman Janet Kilpatrick, who say the county executive office wants to stamp out efforts to make government more transparent and is overstepping bounds to influence council decisions and take away its power.\n\nIn the wings are the 11 other council members, who are being forced to pick sides in this escalating political battle.\n\n\"From a perspective of civility, the relationship is at one of its low ebbs,\" said Councilman Bob Weiner, a two-decade council veteran who fashions himself as an ally of both factions.\n\nAn attorney, Weiner regularly takes an informal lunch with council members before each Tuesday council meeting. He also is a longtime friend of Gordon, dating to their days on the Council of Civic Organizations of Brandywine Hundred.\n\nWeiner said sometimes tension is a good thing between various factions of government, but he said the current climate and frequent infighting isn't productive.\n\n\"The executive and legislative branches of government would be better served by focusing on good government policy and avoiding the personal attacks, although vigilance on the part of both branches of government is necessary for the effective operation of government,\" he said.\n\nGuy said it's just a matter of Gordon being pushed into a corner.\n\n\"You are starting to see what happens,\" he said, \"when someone gets tired of being bullied.\"\n\nAudit sparked mud-slinging, whisper campaign\n\nThe clash over pay increases is hardly Gordon's first. He waged numerous political battles during his first term as county executive, from 1997 to 2004, after working for more than two decades in the New Castle County Police Department.\n\nHis first executive stint also was marred by criminal allegations. Prosecutors filed racketeering, mail fraud and wire fraud charges against Gordon and then-Chief Administrative Officer Sherry Freebery, alleging the two convinced county employees to take part in campaign activities.\n\nBoth took plea deals. Felony charges against Gordon were dropped, and he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of failing to keep accurate payroll records for two county employees. He received probation and a $300 fine.\n\nGordon, of Hockessin, bounced back to win the 2012 election after a bruising campaign that involved charges that Clark's wife, a land-use attorney, benefited from her husband's role. The events have made him especially sensitive to insinuations of improper behavior.\n\nIn his third term – a first in New Castle County history – Gordon has been praised for avoiding tax increases and for helping lead an anti-heroin public service campaign. He also has guided efforts to create a new port facility near New Castle and pushed for eliminating management positions and cutting the number of departments in half to save money.\n\nAsked about his persona, Gordon said he's being unfairly portrayed.\n\n\"They will tell you I am the devil,\" Gordon said. \"That is not the case.\"\n\nCritics counter that Gordon – who still wears a gun in an ankle holster – is behaving as a police chief, making sure the council falls in line. Kilpatrick, a second-term council member from Hockessin, said Gordon doesn't respect how separate branches of government are meant to work.\n\n\"First of all, he is not our boss to begin with. It is not his responsibility to police us,\" she said. \"Whether people want to believe it and act on it, we have separate branches of government.\"\n\n'We are at war'\n\nPersonal attacks also are at the heart of the biggest drama to unfold in county government in recent months: the audit of county investments.\n\nCounty Council, which oversees the auditor, assigned Wasserbach, of New Castle, to investigate how $92 million in tax reserves was transferred to a different investment manager, UBS, after Gordon took office in 2012.\n\nThe controversial change was made on the suggestion of Grimaldi, but the transfer didn't go out to bid. Grimaldi said the move took the money out of unsafe junk bonds, saved taxpayer money and didn't require council approval.\n\nExecutive office officials said the audit was spurred by Gordon's foes to insinuate his administration was up to no good.\n\n\"The auditor was hired to [mess] with Tom Gordon,\" said Guy, the deputy chief administrative officer. \"They brought him in and said, 'Start to find stuff to take Gordon out.' \"\n\nGrimaldi said a similar transfer by Clark was done without going to bid, but didn't trigger an audit.\n\nBut what really made the audit unethical, Grimaldi said, were Wasserbach's political motivations. Grimaldi said Wasserbach timed when he made public comments updating the audit process to coincide with the primary of Kilpatrick, then campaigning on an anti-Gordon platform.\n\nGrimaldi also pointed to Wasserbach's business relationship with lobbyist Rhett Ruggerio, of the Dover firm Ruggerio Willson & Associates. Wasserbach and Ruggerio co-own four Delaware rental properties. Grimaldi said the relationship is unethical because Ruggerio lobbied County Council on land-use issues.\n\nThe county solicitor last month moved to have all of Wasserbach's emails to Ruggerio made public, prompting the county Executive Committee to ask the state Attorney General's Office to investigate whether the auditor broke any rules.\n\nGrimaldi also cited Wasserbach's 2012 audit of the Kent County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which Grimaldi said was self-serving. Wasserbach was a board member of the Faithful Friends Animal Society, a no-kill shelter. The KCSPCA did not have a no-kill policy.\n\nIn a March interview regarding the whisper campaign against Wasserbach, Grimaldi said the auditor can't be objective, given all his political ties.\n\n\"He is not allowed per state code to be political,\" he said.\n\nThe issue peaked on April 22, when county Director of Communications Antonio Prado issued a blistering press release the day before the audit was set to be made public. The three-page statement questioned Wasserbach's professionalism and knowledge of finance, calling the audit \"a year-long misinformation campaign.\"\n\nThe release focuses on Wasserbach, Smiley and Kilpatrick, saying they have attacked the administration because of \"their loss of unwarranted favoritism that they demand from the Executive Office of New Castle County.\" It also quotes Gordon as saying, \"I've never seen an internal auditor make public comments about an audit he hadn't even begun, much less complete.\"\n\nThe press release also contained a copy of the audit, with comments from the executive office inserted, a day before it was scheduled to be officially released by Wasserbach.\n\nIn response, Smiley said Gordon was \"off his friggin' rocker\" for sending out the release.\n\nIn the end, the official audit was mostly tame, calling for the council to have a bigger role in overseeing investments and for the creation of an advisory board. The council will have to approve any changes. Guy said the audit is an attempt to \"handcuff\" Gordon's ability to carry out executive functions.\n\nWasserbach, who previously was Wilmington's auditor, denies any of his suggestions were politically motivated or that he collaborated with council members.\n\n\"It is kind of like an elementary school fight,\" Wasserbach said. \"The audit is just recommendations. When management disagrees, it is usually done in a civilized fashion.\"\n\nThe day after the audit was released, Smiley sent a one-sentence email to Gordon referring to the end of his current term.\n\n\"Enjoy the next year and a half,\" Smiley said.\n\nGordon told The News Journal at the time, \"We are at war.\"\n\nEmail searches under scrutiny\n\nIn his case, Wasserbach said officials in the executive office took advantage of the county email structure. The system is set up in such a way as to allow executive staff to view all correspondence on the county government server.\n\n\"I have no doubt that Mr. Grimaldi has looked at every single one of my emails,\" Wasserbach said. \"He is on a search and destroy mission against me.\"\n\nThe email snooping allegation dates back years. Previous executives have signed pledges to not look at council emails; Gordon's administration has not agreed to the conditions.\n\nKilpatrick, who alleges Gordon inspected her email during her re-election campaign last year, has proposed legislation to purchase a new email system that prevents the practice. Preliminary estimates show a new system could cost about $60,000 annually.\n\nA separate piece of legislation Kilpatrick introduced recently would fire executive staff found to be examining council correspondence and ban them from seeking public office for five years. Kilpatrick used Wasserbach as an example of how Gordon's authority goes too far.\n\n\"If you are being audited and you can go into [the auditor's] email and get the information he is gathering, that is a problem,\" Kilpatrick said. \"How is the auditor supposed to do his job if he believes someone is looking at his emails?\"\n\nGordon doesn't deny that he and executive staff inspect county staff emails, but he said the practice is limited only to searching for specific topics, not through individual mailboxes. He said having access to previous emails gives him a better knowledge of what was happening before he took office.\n\n\"I never go onto the computer and type in 'Janet' and look at her stuff,\" Gordon said. \"I don't have time to sit here and say, 'Let me read their email.' \"\n\nHe said the practice exists because Clark didn't keep proper records – and some records were destroyed.\n\nKilpatrick said the searches are another example of Gordon undermining separation of powers. She pointed to situations where the council and executive branch are in direct conflict, like when Gordon switched support of the executive's office to be against the rezoning for Barley Mill Plaza when he took office. Clark previously supported the plan, which called for a controversial commercial and office project at Del. 141 and Del. 48.\n\nGordon's change put him at odds with the council's support of the plan. A judge ultimately invalidated the rezoning.\n\nKilpatrick said constituents have expressed concern about who is reading emails they send to council members.\n\n\"People are afraid to report things like problems with their neighbors,\" she said. \"They are afraid that if people other than the council member has read the information, then who knows where it can go.\"\n\nGordon said state code allows his staff to access the correspondence and county workers see a disclaimer every time they log onto their computer that the information isn't private.\n\n\"I'm not going to waive my right under the code,\" Gordon said. \"As soon as they can [get their own system], God bless them.\"\n\nGordon said his searches have revealed council members negotiating government action with department heads behind his back, purposefully keeping him in the dark. He also found dishonest dealings between council members, land developers and land use attorneys, Gordon said.\n\nHe offered examples of alleged wrongdoing by Smiley and Kilpatrick. Gordon's office denied a request by The News Journal to inspect records showing what information was searched and when, saying no such search history exists.\n\nAfter being approached by The News Journal to comment about Gordon's allegations, Smiley and Kilpatrick last week filed a FOIA request seeking the correspondence.\n\nSmiley said the technique shows how Gordon operates.\n\n\"You want to run a smear campaign on me, I am going to call him to produce the evidence,\" he said. \"He may use some of that stuff to get people to vote how he wants, but he don't have it on freaking me and that is his problem.\"\n\nA stalemate on spending\n\nJohn Flaherty, president of the Delaware Coalition for Open Government, said New Castle County officials are doing citizens a disservice by waging attacks. He said they should direct complaints to the county Ethics Commission instead of taking issues personally or conducting \"email wars.\"\n\n\"They are showing an immaturity and lack of respect for the public by having all this bickering and fighting,\" Flaherty said. \"They need to conduct themselves with civility in accordance with open government laws.\"\n\nCouncil President Chris Bullock acknowledged there are divisions in county government, but he said, \"The incivility is not the entire council.\"\n\nBullock said that while he would like personalities to stay out of politics, there are a few on the council who speak their mind and were voted in for that purpose. He said there is a history of \"conflict and confrontation\" between the executive office and the council.\n\n\"Fortunately or unfortunately,\" he said, \"it is part of government.\"\n\nGordon said the ongoing discord has distracted him and the council from tackling serious issues, like job creation. He also wants to prioritize making sure the county is safe against terrorism attacks.\n\nAngst from Smiley, Kilpatrick and Wasserbach is rooted in their allegiance to Clark, Gordon said. Smiley also is looking for revenge because of how the current administration handled Barley Mill, he said.\n\nSmiley disagrees, saying the battle dates to when he served as chair of the 16th Representative District Democratic Committee in 2004 and refused to follow Gordon's request to kill the committee's candidate-nomination process.\n\n\"If I didn't do it, he said he would guarantee me opposition\" during the next campaign for council, Smiley said. \"Intimidation doesn't work now, and it didn't work then.\"\n\nKilpatrick denied any favoritism to Clark, but said Clark's administration was more open to council questions.\n\n\"We knew every time they sold a dog license,\" Kilpatrick said. \"Did we argue with them and vote things down once in a while? Yes. But when you didn't feel like something is being hidden from you, it made all the difference in the world.\"\n\nGordon acknowledges he has asked executive staff, including Grimaldi, to lobby council members on his behalf. Guy also has used the public comment portion of council meetings to confront council members about insinuations of wrongdoing.\n\n\"If I am doing too good, they say I am running for governor,\" Gordon said, arguing some on council are persistent naysayers. \"But, I won't let them call me a criminal.\"\n\nThe feud presents itself in both petty and serious ways. For example, Smiley has been openly critical of spending for Sleep Under the Stars, a free festival Gordon started during his first term but was discontinued years later. Gordon launched it again when he returned to office. The program is held twice a year at two locations – Rockwood Park and the Carousel Park & Equestrian Center in Pike Creek.\n\nSmiley called it one of the \"feel-good programs\" in Gordon's administration, adding that county officials weren't transparent about the costs.\n\nBudget hearings in recent months have been a regular opportunity for Smiley to remind everyone about his pending information requests. At one point he threatened to stall the entire $250 million county budget process until he got answers from Gordon staffers on a laundry list of government expenses.\n\n\"I'm tired, at every level of government, of people when it benefits them, bloviating on transparency and open government, but when you ask them for information, they don't give them to you,\" Smiley said.\n\nThe fighting also continues over Smiley's proposal to re-assess the values of each property in the county. This would cost an estimated $15 million to implement. Smiley has suggested they could tap into the reserve fund, which has about $100 million.\n\nGordon is adamant about preserving the fund, which he considers one of his key accomplishments. When he took office in 1997, New Castle County had a $100 million projected shortfall, which was reduced through savings and budget cuts. Taxes have not been raised under his watch.\n\nThe reassessment plan is an effort to \"hang a tax increase\" around his neck, Gordon said, which he won't do.\n\nGordon said that's also why he has rejected a plan by Smiley to increase council staff salaries.\n\n\"You don't care about assessment or salaries,\" Gordon said. \"You are just trying to get me to do a tax increase.\"\n\nThe tit-for-tat could result in a stalemate on budget issues. Smiley, as co-chairman of the Finance Committee, said the administration is ducking his questions on spending. In response, he's threatened to indefinitely table measures, effectively railroading the process to approve the operating budget.\n\nSmiley said Gordon's techniques, especially using Grimaldi to exert pressure on elected officials, is inappropriate.\n\n\"[There are] two ways this can end: One of us leaves office, or his chief administrative officer is gone,\" Smiley said. \"I personally believe his CAO is a virus infecting this county.\"\n\nKilpatrick said relations could improve with more openness and trust.\n\n\"It started because there is no communication. Our distrust goes up, and we start questioning them. The more we question them, the more defensive they get. And when they are defensive with us, we are defensive with them,\" Kilpatrick said. \"We all, in the end, lose.\"\n\nGordon also said he's ready to make progress on a new community center on Del. 9 and start more job-creation programs.\n\n\"I really think we could get more done if we worked together,\" he said.\n\nGordon also admits recent rhetoric toward council members could have been toned down, and said the audit press release could have been handled better.\n\nSmiley recently got his answers about how much Sleep Under the Stars cost. At a budget hearing, Community Services General Manager Sophia Hanson provided a breakdown of costs. It showed $60,000 being spent for the Rockwood Park event.\n\nSmiley thanked her.\n\n\"For the first time in my short tenure on council, somebody went above and beyond what I asked for,\" he said. \"I just wanted the information.\"\n\nBullock said he's also working on consensus-building. Behind the scenes he hopes \"to cool down the personal flames to not derail government.\"\n\n\"As long as we stay out of gridlock procedurally and legislatively, we will be fine,\" Bullock said. \"We are not a do-nothing council. We are council of 13 personalities, and sometimes it is cool. Sometimes it is combustible.\"\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787, on Twitter @Ber_Xerxes or at xwilson@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/06/15/things-montana/71267898/", "title": "101 things to do in Montana", "text": "Tribune Staff\n\nWhether you live in Montana and are looking for a road trip, or visiting the state from afar, we have 101 outings for you to put on your bucket list.\n\nIN AND AROUND GREAT FALLS\n\n1 River's Edge Trail\n\nAs the Missouri River \"meanders through Great Falls, sheltering waterfowl and encouraging other wildlife — and human recreation — along its banks,\" so does this nearly 60 miles of paved and graveled pathways for walking, running, skating and bicycling. A result of a cooperative partnership by the city of Great Falls, Cascade County, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Department of Transportation, PPL Montana and the volunteer trail advocacy group, Recreational Trails Inc., it is one of the urban delights of Great Falls that blends the city with its rural surroundings. Some of its \"splashy features include Black Eagle Falls, Rainbow Falls, Crooked Falls, Ryan Falls (the \"great falls of the Missouri\") and Morony Falls, outdoor art and memorial benches and tables and picnic shelters.\n\nIn 1990, Recreational Trails Inc. formed to help forge the riverside route, which grows each year with new places and trails to explore. The paved, wheelchair-accessible trail runs along the south shore of the river, from Oddfellows Park, which is near the Warden Bridge on 10th Avenue South, past Broadwater Bay, Mitchell Pool, Gibson and Elks Riverside Parks, Black Eagle Falls, the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, Giant Springs Heritage State Park and Rainbow Falls to the Crooked Falls Overlook. The asphalt ends there, but the trail doesn't. A dirt trail stretches along the cliffs another three miles to Cochrane Dam.\n\nEast of Great Falls, the North Shore Trail follows along Cochrane, Ryan and Morony reservoirs. The trail begins at the end of Rainbow Dam Road and includes gravel and single track segments totaling more than 13 miles. A single-track trail now runs between Rainbow and Morony dams, and a trailhead has been established at Rainbow Dam. An expert single-track trail between Ryan and Cochrane dams provides an exceptional way to explore the river canyon east of town. Interpretive signs describing the ecology of the area have been provided by the Cascade Conservation District and the Missouri River Council, and QR Code signs along the trail make information about the trail and dams available to smartphone users.\n\nThe Montana Department of Transportation has completed the design of the Sun River Connector Trail to extend a separated bike and pedestrian connection along Country Club Blvd., between the west approach of the Warden Bridge and 6th Street Southwest, and construction will begin in 2016. This summer's improvements will include a paved loop from Heritage Park down to Giant Springs, a new trail between the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center and Giant Springs and the opening of a 2.1-mile loop linking the Heritage Center, Giant Springs and Heritage Park. Paving will be done to the parking area at Bay Drive, and United Materials will be redoing the shoulders along the trail from 15th Street to Giant Springs.\n\nSummer 2015 activities include Audubon West Wednesday Walks for bird watching along the river and on Sacajawea Island, Cochrane Dam crossings on July 11 and Aug. 22 and a number of \"fun runs\" and mountain bike activities. For details call 788-3313 or read more about the trails at www.thetrail.org.\n\n2 The C.M. Russell Museum\n\nVisitors from all over the world enjoy the Great Falls museum named after the famous cowboy artist who adopted Great Falls as his home more than a century ago. They also can enjoy the Russell Rider Sculpture Garden, a place \"families can come, free of charge, all four seasons\" to picnic, roam the garden and appreciate wonderful art including five major bronze pieces. Five galleries have been installed to showcase the \"astonishing depth and range\" of Russell's art, which ranged from paintings and sculpture to illustrated letters and pen-and-ink drawings during his lifetime (1864-1926). The museum has some 2,000 Russell artworks, personal objects and a \"permanent collection of more than 12,000 objects\" including works of such well-known artists as O.C. Seltzer, Winold Reiss, J.H. Sharp and Frank Tenney Johnson.\n\nDon't miss \"The Bison: American Icon, Heart of the Plains Indian Culture,\" the most ambitious permanent exhibition ever displayed at the C.M. Russell Museum. With about 500 artifacts and a thundering buffalo diorama that shakes as you walk over it, the $1.5 million exhibition is a fitting subject because three-quarters of the Russell Museum's entire collection of paintings and sculpture involve Indians and bison. The \"Browning Firearms Collection\" of rifles, shotguns and handguns surveys the significant developments made by the Browning, Winchester and Colt companies. New this season is \"Harmless Hunter: The Wildlife Work of Charles M. Russell,\" runs through Sept. 13, and \"focuses for the first time on Russell's painting of wildlife.\"\n\nRight beside the museum is Russell's Log Studio, built in 1903. The artifacts in it belonged to Russell and were used for reference in his artwork. The Russell home next door was built in 1900 under the supervision of his wife, Nancy. During the summer, the museum, located at 400 13th St. N., is open Tuesday to Sunday. Museum hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the cabin studio is open 10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., and the home is open 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Admission is $9 for adults, $7 for seniors, retired military and schedule tour groups, $4 for students and is free for active military and kids under age 5. Call 727-8787, or visit www.cmrussell.org.\n\n3 Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center\n\nThe Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center is nestled into the bluffs of the Missouri River overlooking a section of river where the famed explorers portaged two centuries ago to avoid the nearby waterfalls. Black Eagle Falls, the uppermost of the five falls, is visible from the big windows of the interpretive center. Outside, four pedestrian trails connect the interpretive center with Giant Springs Heritage State Park, and a bicycle-pedestrian trail connects the interpretive center with the River's Edge Trail via a tunnel beneath Giant Springs Road.\n\nInside the center, the exhibits are educational and interactive. The ground floor includes the ornate Compass Rose, with a list of private contributors who helped finance the original construction. Only half of the construction cost was funded with federal money. Pictographs tell the explorers' story in Indian drawings. Grabbing the most attention as visitors enter the center is a striking life-size diorama of buckskin-clad explorers hefting a 30-foot canoe up a ravine in their portage around the falls. The exhibit stretches two stories and is framed by vast windows overlooking the Missouri.\n\nThe center \"imparts to the public a personal sense of President Thomas Jefferson's vision of expanding America to the west; it inspires awe and awakens curiosity toward the challenges faced by the expedition as they portaged the great falls of the Missouri river and explored the 'unknown'; brings to life the daily experiences of the expedition and the environment and native peoples of the 'uncharted West'; and celebrated the indomitable spirit of human discovery we all share,\" according to the center's mission statement.\n\nThe 26th Annual Lewis and Clark Festival is taking place June 19-21 and promises to deliver participants \"back to ways of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and life out on the open frontier of the West.\" This special event includes historical programs, children's activities, Native American cultural programs, artisans and local craftspeople and a variety of local food vendors.\n\nOn Fridays beginning June 26, \"Riverside Voices,\" staff of the center and guest presenters, offer evening programs in the amphitheater on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River or in the indoor theater. Topics include medicine on the expedition, the boats used in the journey, changes in the river since the exploration and more Lewis and Clark history and related subjects. A \"Star Party Extravaganza\" for learning about our night sky with the Central Montana Astronomy Society, is Sept. 25 in the center's parking lot.\n\nSummer hours are 9 a.m.-6 p.m. daily. Costs are $8 for adults and free for those 15 and younger. Federal Interagency Annual, Senior, Military and Access Passes are honored for free entry.\n\nContact Information: 4201 Giant Springs Road, Great Falls, MT 59405.

This is also the site of the Roe River, once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's shortest river. Giant Springs flows at a measured 7.9 million gallons per hour or 156 million gallons of water per day. The water stays at a temperature of 54 degrees and has been carbon dated to be about 3,000 years old. More than a quarter of a million lovers of nature visit Giant Springs Heritage Park each year. Many come to marvel at this remarkable feature, or to view the 80-plus species of birds, mammals and reptiles. On any day you may find bicyclists, fishing enthusiasts, photographers and many others; some come to visit the nearby Rainbow Falls Overlook, the visitor center and the fish hatchery.\n\nThe fish hatchery program raises from 700,000 to 800,000 fish annually. They are then distributed to areas in central Montana from the Canadian border to the Wyoming border. A group picnic site is also available. The Fish, Wildlife and Parks visitor center (right across from the roadway from the springs) features taxidermy mounts of grizzly and black bears, educational features on fish and bird recognition, wildlife photographs, and a mini-theater that shows wildlife videos. Pets on leash are welcome.\n\nEvents at the park include ranger talks dealing with the wildlife of the area, bird strolls and kids activities. Check the website at stateparks.mt.gov for specific dates. Concerts will be held in the park on July 12 and Aug.9, and visitors may want to plan to attend Movie Night in the Park on Aug. 21 or the Fall Family Fest on Oct. 17.\n\nLocated off U.S. Highway 87 in Great Falls, then a mile east on River Drive to Giant Springs Road.

Built of native gray sandstone, the structure was completed in 1896 and served for 34 years as a high school and for 45 years as a junior high. \"Art is for everyone\" is the premise of the Square; since 1977, it has provided a \"dynamic program of exhibitions, classes, lectures, tours and performances designed to nurture the region's creative spirit.\"\n\nThe \"Val Knight Retrospective,\" a new permanent exhibition has been added to the Square and includes 25 remarkable works done from the 1960s to the 1990s by the late Great Falls artist in a variety of media that includes encaustic paintings, ceramic figurines and graphic drawings.

He demanded parks, and that's what we got. His namesake is the centerpiece of the park system. Located at Park Drive and 1st Avenue North, Gibson Park features a duck pond, flower gardens, a walking path, basketball courts, restrooms and a playground. Summertime concerts take place at an outdoor band shell. A pedestrian underpass from Gibson Park takes you to Elks Riverside Park, a lesser-known but huge park along the river that features tennis courts, horseshoe pits, a skate park, playground equipment and large expanses of grass where you can fly a kite, play catch or simply relax.\n\nAny sunny day, you'll also find people picnicking, playing games or simply lounging in the rest of the city's 400 acres developed into 57 parks. Two dozen usable public tennis courts also are scattered around the city. A complex of eight courts is available for public use at C.M. Russell High School. In addition, there are three on River Drive North near the 6th Street underpass; four at Montana Park; two each at Lions, West Kiwanis and Jaycee parks; and one each at Sunrise, Charles Russell and North Kiwanis parks. Call Parks and Recreation Administration at 771-1265 for more information.\n\n14 Pacific Steel and Recycling Trailside Dog Park\n\nAn attractively fenced and landscaped area where dogs can \"run free and play 'off leash' with their canine and human friends,\" the dog park, located at 800 River Drive North alongside River's Edge Trail, was opened July 15, 2009. The park was built for less than $100,000 and was financed by gifts to the Animal Foundation of Great Falls, which donated the park to the city of Great Falls. The park features a small pavilion in the middle and separate fenced and landscaped areas equipped for small and large dogs. The dividing line for dog size is 25 pounds. A paved path in the large-dog park was recently installed to protect the turf, and agility equipment on both sides of the park allows for better exercise.\n\nDog owners will find there is no charge to use the park, but they are still responsible for proper pet etiquette and obeying the rules of the Dog Park. Disposal bags and garbage cans are readily available, but drinking fountains for both humans and dogs are rather temperamental, so it's wise to bring your own water. The park is open from dawn to dusk, but it may be closed on occasion for maintenance or improvements. Watch the Tribune for announcements or call the Park and Recreation office at 771-1265. For more information, visit the foundation's website at www.theanimalfoundation.com.\n\n15 First Peoples Buffalo Jump State Park\n\nFormerly called \"Ulm Pishkun,\" it is believed to be the largest prehistoric bison kill site in North America and has now been nominated to be designated a National Historic Landmark. The site, at 342 Ulm-Vaughn Road, consists of a mile-long sandstone cliff, remnants of drive lines and up to 18 feet of compacted buffalo remains as well as \"expansive panoramic views\" of the Rocky Mountain Front, the Missouri River valley and characteristic buttes and grasslands of the High Plains. Plan at least two hours at this day-use-only park for enjoying the interpretive trail, picnic tables and a protected black-tailed prairie dog town.\n\nThe site is open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. until October. Admission is free for state residents or $6 per vehicle for out-of-state visitors. Call 866-2217 for more information.\n\n16 Farmers Market\n\nNo longer just about the abundance of vegetables sold here, the Great Falls Farmers Market is held on Saturdays beginning June 6 through Sept. 26, from 7:45 a.m. to noon, in the Civic Center's Whittier Park. As the popularity of the market has grown, so has the number of vendors, so much that the market has expanded from Civic Center Park onto Park Drive and into the parking lot across the street, and a Wednesday market has been added to the schedule from July 18 to Sept. 23, 4:30-6:30 p.m. More than 100 vendors are expected to bring unique hand-crafted items of all kinds, baked goods, jams, jellies, syrups and all kinds of ready-to-eat foods.

Visit montanastatefair.com for more information; for tickets visit goexpopark.com.\n\n18 Great Falls Golf Courses\n\nGreat Falls has two municipal golf courses where the motto is \"We'll work for you, so you can come out and play. Eagle Falls, adjacent to Legion Park at 25th Street and River Drive North, and Anaconda Hills, a short, hilly course in Black Eagle on the north side of the Missouri River, 2400 Smelter Ave. Both courses offer driving ranges as well as full pro shops and concessions. Other courses include Hickory Swing, a public course at 1100 American Ave., and Meadow Lark Country Club at the confluence of the Sun and Missouri rivers at 300 Country Club Blvd.\n\nEagle Falls Golf Club is an 18-hole course open to the public. Opened in 1953, it underwent a major re-design in 1999 and now plays from 5,234 to 6,571 yards as a par 71. Four sets of tees make it inviting for the casual player and extremely challenging for the avid golfer. There is also a newly designed chipping green, a putting green, practice bunker and a limited driving range. Reserve tee times two days in advance by calling 761-1078.\n\nAnaconda Hills Golf Course is also a city-run course opened originally in the 1920s as a nine-hole course for the employees of the Anaconda Copper Co. The city acquired the course in the 1970s, and nine new holes and grass greens were added in 1992. Hilly and tree-lined with natural rough and water, the par 69 course is slightly less than 5,700 yards. Call 761-8459.\n\nFounded in 1919, the private Meadow Lark Country Club is recognized as having one of the great classic designs with a reputation for sleek, undulating greens. The 18-hole championship course is considered one of the top 10 places to play in Montana. The club also includes a clubhouse, \"award-winning pro shop, formal dining room and more casual grill room, three indoor and four outdoor tennis courts and a swimming pool open Memorial Day to Labor Day. Call 453-6531.\n\nHickory Swing is an 18-hole par 60 executive golf course in west Great Falls. It plays 3,731 yards over 86 acres. It was built in 1992 as a course for all skill levels. A back nine was opened in 1999, and the course has 12 par-3s and six par-4s. Hickory Swing also offers a clubhouse with pro shop and snack bar and a driving range. Open from February (weather permitting) through October, the course now opens at 6 a.m. for early-bird golfers. $20 for 18 holes, $12 for nine; call 452-9400 for available tee times.\n\n19 The Great Falls Dams\n\nThe beautiful waterfalls east of Great Falls now are mostly covered by a series of hydroelectric dams. But glimpses of the falls so famously journaled by Lewis and Clark remain, especially when water is running high on the Missouri. Visitors have several opportunities to view these dams. Perhaps the easiest is Black Eagle Dam, which can be seen close up on the River's Edge Trail or from an overlook on River Road. Just downstream, Rainbow Dam has also been offering beautiful views since 1910 and has undergone a construction project increasing its generating capacity by 70 percent. Between these two is Cochrane Dam, part of the Great Falls Portage National Landmark, which produces 64 megawatts of electricity. Ryan Dam, the original \"great falls of the Missouri,\" is an especially fun destination. A suspension foot bridge leads to an island from which visitors can climb to an observation point and get a full-on view of the dam. The island has a picnic and cooking area very popular with families. Morony Dam is 15 miles northeast of Great Falls. It's classified as a \"run-of-river\" project because it can generate electricity using the water that flows down the river without need to store additional supplies. Boaters, hikers and fishermen should call 454-5840 for current trailhead, boat launch and parking closures.\n\n20 Black Eagle Memorial Island\n\nBlack Eagle Memorial Island opened to the public for the first time in 2005. Located just below Black Eagle Falls, the man-made island was created from material dredged out of the tailrace below the Black Eagle Dam's generation station. In the past, it was used as a parking lot for smelter workers at the former Anaconda Mining Co. complex. Today the area features a restored truss bridge, exceptional stone walls, a launch for non-motorized boats and an interpretive viewing plaza below the falls. The area is open for hiking, biking, kayaking, canoeing and fishing and is part of the new River's Edge Trail section that links West Bank Park to the island.\n\n21 Missouri River Breaks National Monument\n\nOn a topographical map of Montana, the Missouri River Breaks look like a crumpled brown grocery bag extending west to east along the Missouri River from Fort Benton to Fort Peck. The Arrow Creek Breaks and the Musselshell Breaks contribute to the larger geographic area from the south. The Breaks, located in northcentral Montana, offer some of the finest recreational opportunities in the entire state, from river floating to hiking to hunting to horseback riding.\n\nOn the ground, the Breaks consist of rough ridges separated by steep — sometimes almost vertical — coulees. The vegetation consists of scattered Ponderosa pine, juniper, Douglas fir and mixed grasses growing in a shale/gumbo soil type. While not the most hospitable region for humans, the Breaks provide suitable habitat for an impressive list of wildlife species.\n\nThe Breaks mean different things to different people. It is defined, in part, by the history of Lewis and Clark, as a sanctuary for desperados staying a step ahead of the law and as a source of hope and inspiration for several generations of homesteaders. Some enjoy the remote area mostly for the solitude and recreational opportunities provided by the Upper Missouri River, Fort Peck Reservoir and a mixture of public and private lands. Others see the Breaks as a source of grass for livestock, natural gas, timber products and other vital pieces of our economic puzzle.\n\nIn 2001, a portion of the public land in the Breaks managed by the Bureau of Land Management, roughly 375,000 acres, was designated as the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument.\n\nU.S. Highway 87 accesses the western portion of the monument at Fort Benton. On the eastern edge, U.S. Highway 101 crosses the monument and the Missouri at the James Kipp Recreation Area, and Montana Highway 236 also provides access through Lewistown, Winifred and Big Sandy.\n\nThere are no motels, service stations or restaurants in the interior of the Monument. The Missouri Breaks Interpretive Center in Fort Benton is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday Call 622-4000.\n\n22 Monarch and Neihart\n\nAn hour's drive from Great Falls, these neighboring mountain towns are located in a historic mining district. The mines are closed, but the surrounding mountains are open to fun. Local creeks offer excellent fishing. There are scores of trails and backcountry roads to explore on foot, mountain bike or all-terrain vehicle. Check at trailheads for info on motorized access. Check out the easy, half-mile hike to popular Memorial Falls. Camping is available in some areas. The wildlife viewing is terrific. And winter offers a wide range of activities, including snowmobiling, downhill skiing, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.\n\n23 Sluice Boxes State Park\n\nJust south of Belt, where Belt Creek slices out of the Little Belt Mountains is an area of soaring limestone cliffs and precipitous ledges, the Belt Creek Canyon and Sluice Boxes State Park. Rich in history and geologic features, the park provides excellent hiking and viewing of abundant wildlife in a wide range of habitats from shaded rock walls and miniature waterfalls to open, sun-baked slopes covered in prairie grasses. Enjoying the park, however, is not for the faint of heart. Because the train bridges were removed, hikers must ford the creek. That's nearly impossible during high water, so hiking in the Sluice Boxes is limited to the low-water season — usually mid-July through September. The creek is spring-fed and cold. Backcountry camping is allowed with permit year-round. The only facilities are the parking lot, vault toilet and the trail which follows an abandoned rail grade. Call 454-5840 or visit stateparksmt.gov/sluice-boxes.\n\n24 Fort Benton's Riverfront\n\nThe historic community of Fort Benton, 42 miles north of Great Falls, boasts a stunning setting on the banks of the Missouri River. The site of a pre-Civil War trading post and key economic point during the \"steamboat era,\" the town is the water gateway to the Missouri Breaks National Monument and a popular launch site for rafts and canoes. Reconstruction of three buildings of the fort is taking place; the Northeast Bastion and Blockhouse are now historically accurate. A heroic-sized statue of explorers Lewis and Clark overlooks the river along a scenic walking path. Another statue immortalizes Shep, a legendarily faithful dog. A walking bridge spans the river and offers benches for rest and reflection. There's lots to do elsewhere in town, which has two museums and a historic restored hotel, the Grand Union, which boasts a fine restaurant. From June 26 to 28, visitors may experience Montana's premier small town festival. In celebration of Chouteau County's 150th birth, the theme this year is \"Footsteps Through Time.\" Call 750-2918.\n\n25 Havre Beneath the Streets\n\nThe Historical Underground Tour is a recreation of Havre's history. When fire destroyed most of Havre, business owners moved underground to carry on their business until the town could be rebuilt. Step back in time as much as 100 years, into the Sporting Eagle Saloon, a turn-of-the-century honky-tonk where cowboys gambled, kicked up their heels and drank good old-fashioned frontier rot-gut. Saunter along the streets beneath Havre and see an opium den (one of three known to have existed in the early days), a Chinese laundry, an ethnic restaurant, and, of course, a bordello.\n\nTours are available during summer months Monday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with the last tour beginning at 3:30 p.m. Reservations are recommended; the ticket office is at 120 3rd Ave., south of Norman's Ranch Wear.

Take a one-hour walking tour for a close-up look at the best-preserved bison kill and campsite in this area of the plains. The Brick Mural is now complete in the shadow of the Bear Paw Mountains. The site is non-sterile, so visitors may handle certain artifacts. Open June 1 to Labor Day from 9 a.m. to 4.p.m. Tours are usually available \"on demand.\" Call 265-6417 or visit www.buffalojump.org for more information.\n\n27 Fort Assiniboine Historic Site\n\nFort Assiniboine Historic Site, located 6 miles southwest of Havre on Highway 87, was constructed in 1879, and became the largest military fort west of the Mississippi River. The post had 104 buildings and was contained within a 40-mile-long by 15-mile-wide military reservation. Several of the original buildings still stand. It became a state agricultural experiment station in 1911 and is now the home of Montana State University's Northern Agricultural Research Center. The primary mission of the fort's garrison was to prevent attacks from the some 5,000 Lakota Sioux Indians led by Sitting Bull, and other chiefs who had fled to the safety of Canada after the Battle of the Little Big Horn.\n\nThe fort served as a base for patrols along the Canadian border and the Milk River Valley. Fort Assiniboine became the state's military headquarters, with the responsibility of maintaining control over the Blackfoot Confederacy and other northern Montana Indian reservations. The most famous soldier to serve at the fort was John J. Pershing, who was assigned to the post in 1896. He commanded H Troop, the black \"Buffalo Soldiers\" of the 10th Cavalry. The Fort Assiniboine Preservation Society offers summer tours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Mon.-Fri., and by appointment for the weekends. For additional information, call 262-7656.\n\nThe Northern Agricultural Research Center will celebrate its 100th anniversary with several events including the annual field day and tours July 1 with the first tour beginning at 1 p.m. The new office building will be dedicated, and agri-business awards presented. Call 265-6115.\n\n28 Charlie Russell Chew Choo\n\nExperience the beauty of rolling hills, vast ranch lands and breathtaking sunsets from the comfort of a vintage train; possibly masked bandits may even stage a hold-up when least expected. Now beginning at Kingston Junction, near Lewistown, and crossing three trestle bridges on its route to Denton and back, the 3.5 hour trip offers includes a full course prime rib dinner, dessert, no-host cash bar and musical entertainment. Built on the spur track connecting Lewistown and Great Falls 100 years ago, the five 1950-vintage stainless steel cars make 12 trips between May 10 and Oct. 3. Reservations are encouraged and can be made at montana-dinertrain.com or by calling 535-5436.\n\n29 Freezout Lake\n\nFreezout Lake and its surrounding 11,466 acres, is a prime hot spot for bird lovers in Montana. In spring, hundreds of thousands of migrating snow geese stop at Freezout for a rest before flying north to Canada's Alberta and Saskatchewan, and then to nesting grounds at the Arctic coast. Park officials recommend viewing from sunrise to 10 a.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to dusk in early March, but wildlife viewing is available year round. For a more enjoyable experience, stay for a maximum of 14 days. Bring binoculars or telescope, a light lunch and warm clothing.

The flight of the Nez Perce, led by Chief Joseph from Army soldiers, took them from Oregon, through Idaho, into Montana and almost to the Canadian border before they were defeated. Here the tribe split up, with some heading to Canada and others to Nebraska. The Nez Perce ceased fighting at Bear Paw on Oct. 5, 1877, and Chief Joseph gave his immortal speech, \"From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.\" The battlefield is open daily year-round during daylight hours but closed for lunch from noon to 1 p.m. Visitors may walk a self-guided 1.25-mile interpretive trail of moderate difficulty and are encouraged to visit the Blaine County Museum at 501 Indiana St. in Chinook and see the audio/visual presentation \"40 Miles to Freedom\" before touring the battlefield. There are no fees. Call 406-357-2590.\n\n34 Benton Lake National Wildlife Refuge\n\nLocated at 922 Bootlegger Trail and administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Benton Lake National Wildlife Refuge is a 13-square-mile oasis of grasslands and wetlands lying within a sea of agriculture. Mountain ranges surround three sides, forming a backdrop to a scene that reminds visitors of the days when the entire prairie-wetland ecosystem was alive with thousands of different birds. Benton Lake was created thousands of years ago by the continental glacier, and the area was excluded from homesteading in 1885 in order to provide an irrigation district. Animals abound in the refuge and include water birds such as ducks, Canada geese, snow geese and tundra swans. Also common are sightings of dozens of species of mammals, including mountain cottontail, American badger, striped skunk and long-tailed weasel. Ten numbered signs along the Wildlife Auto Tour correspond to a map provided at the information kiosk at the beginning of the drive, helping visitors reflect on species, habitat, history and management of Benton Lake NWR. Follow Highway 87 north out of Great Falls about 1 mile and turn left onto Bootlegger Trail. Then go about 9 miles to the refuge entrance.

Participants are required to walk the trail, so bring hiking boots or comfortable shoes. Hunts are set for Sept. 5-6. Call 866-2217 for further information.\n\nMISSOURI COUNTRY\n\n36 Fort Peck Lake Reservoir and Recreation Area\n\nBehind the 3.8 mile long Fort Peck Dam — the world's largest hydroelectric earthen dam — is the state's largest body of water, Fort Peck Lake Reservoir. It is surrounded by 1,520 miles of shoreline — that's more than California has with the Pacific Ocean. The fishing is great with more than 50 kinds of fish, including walleye, bass, ling and salmon, northern pike, perch and sauger. Open Memorial Day to Labor Day, the shore also offers camping, boating and swimming.

Visitors interested in their turn-of-the-century exploits can still check out several sites along the so-called Outlaw Trail. Start in Scobey, near the beginning of the trail, where Dutch Henry and his gang frequently hung out at the Dug Out Saloon. Much of the history is captured at the Daniels County Museum and Pioneer Town, where 35 historic buildings were restored to depict a town in the early part of the century. If you're in Scobey the last weekend in June, stop by for Pioneer Days, featuring the (family-friendly) Dirty Shame Show. Call 406-487-5965 to confirm dates.

Russell Wildlife Refuge\n\nCovering more than a million acres in northeast Montana and extending 125 airline miles up the Missouri River from Fort Peck Dam, the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge includes a vast range of wildlife and topography. Native prairie, forested coulees, river bottoms, badlands often portrayed in the paintings by Charlie Russell, and the huge Fort Peck Reservoir all are encompassed in the refuge.

Call Complex headquarters at 538-7521.\n\nGLACIER COUNTRY\n\n42 Blackfeet Indian Reservation\n\nWhile most of the members of Montana's largest Indian tribe, the Blackfeet, live much like mainstream Western society, they also have maintained traditions such as the use of painted tepees, colorful headdresses and deerskin costumes on special occasions. The Museum of the Plains Indian, near the intersection of U.S. Highways 2 and 89 in Browning, has a comprehensive collection of cultural artifacts and exhibits as well as a gift shop featuring a wide variety of Native American art and jewelry. Interpreter-guided tours, offering a deeper look at the history of the Blackfeet people, begin at the Museum of the Plains Indian and cover sites such as Sun Dance, Buffalo Jumps, Tepee Rings, Holy Family Mission and Fort McLeod Road. The museum is open Tuesday-Saturday, 9 a.m.-4:45 p.m., through Labor Day. Call 338-2230. Although Browning is its center, resort towns St. Mary and East Glacier are located on the eastern edge of Glacier National Park within the boundaries of the reservation.\n\nDuring the 64th annual North American Indian Days, July 9-12, tepees will be pitched on the powwow ground for \"four days of contest dancing, games, sports, events and socializing.\" Call 338-7406 for more information. The Heart Butte Society Celebration will be held Aug. 6-9 at Heart Butte, a town 26 miles south of Browning.\n\n43 Glacier National Park\n\nThe breathtaking vistas of Glacier National Park draw visitors from all over the world. This 1-million-acre national park preserves some of America's most gorgeous country — including 106 miles of the Continental Divide — and the abundant wildlife that inhabits its wilderness.\n\nGlacier National Park has been revered by the Plains Indians for many generations. Archeologists have found evidence of human activity in the Glacier Park area that dates back 10,000 years. These early people may have been the ancestors of the Blackfeet, Salish and Kootenai Indians. Meriwether Lewis came close to the southern tip of Glacier in 1806, checking how far north the Missouri River watershed extended. White explorers kept searching for the perfect mountain pass through which to run a railroad line over the Rockies. Although many of the region's Native Americans knew the location of Marias Pass, the Blackfeet guarded it closely. In 1889, an explorer for the Great Northern Railway, John F. Stevens, finally figured out where Marias Pass lay. Marias was the lowest mountain pass between Canada and Mexico. Its low altitude and easy grade made it perfect for trains to cross the Continental Divide. The mountains east of the Continental Divide were acquired from the Blackfeet in 1895 and designated a national wilderness forest preserve in 1900, opening it to mining. President William Howard Taft signed the bill to establish Glacier as a national park in 1910.\n\nPortions of the Going-to-the-Sun Road remain open all year, but unpredictable spring snow storms can slow plowing progress. For current road status, visit home.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/hours.htm. Other roads open in May, weather permitting. The summer rate for a 7-day vehicle (non-commercial car, truck or van) permit is $25 with the 7-day single-entry price for visitors traveling by foot, bicycle, motorcycle or in a non-commercial organized group is set at $12. There is no entrance fee on Aug. 25 and Sept. 26.\n\nThere are 700 miles of hiking trails, and many visitors wouldn't miss a chance to hike along the Garden Wall. Campers have a choice of about 1,200 first-come, first-serve campsites accessible by vehicle, and permits are available for 13 country front campgrounds. The historic Many Glacier Hotel has recently undergone a $10 million renovation, but historic hotels book up fast; call Glacier Park Inc. at 892-2525 or Apgar Village Lodge at 888-5484.Tour buses and boats are available seasonally, and guided hiking trips and American Indian interpretive tours are also available. Many visitors also make arrangements to cross the border into Waterton Lakes National Park on the Canadian side of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.\n\n44 Izaak Walton Inn\n\nLocated just off Highway 2 at Essex, on the southern tip of Glacier National Park, is the picturesque Izaak Walton Inn. It was built in 1939 for train crews on the Great Northern Railway. Today it's a popular inn, restaurant and mini railroad museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The dining room walls are covered with old photographs and prints of trains. \"Relaxation is key,\" and \"room telephones are absent\" in the inn. For a different experience, rent one of the four old cabooses that have been converted into overnight lodging or stay in one of six new family cabins. Additional lodging is now available in the GN 441 Luxury Locomotive which features 44-year-old reclaimed oak floors and a full kitchen, and the JJ Caboose, named for James Jerome Hill, the Empire Builder of the Great Northern Railway, for an unsurpassed cozy western retreat. The trains still run past the inn, with passenger service available. And Essex is a great place from which to find a trailhead into the surrounding mountains. You may also book Glacier interpretive Red Bus tours or whitewater raft trips from the inn. For information or reservations, call 406-888-5700 or visit www.izaakwaltoninn.com.\n\n45 Flathead Valley\n\nIn the northwest corner of Montana lies the picturesque Flathead Valley. A hub for tourism, the valley sits next to Glacier National Park and is overflowing with activity. From hiking, fishing, boating and golfing in the summer to cross-country or downhill skiing in the winter, the only thing visitors will wish for more of is time. Flathead Lake is the largest natural freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River, and the resort town, Bigfork, situated at its north shore, is a picturesque town with a 27-hole golf course, Eagle Bend Golf Club (837-7310). Family fun abounds in the area, with the Big Sky Water Park in Columbia Falls (892-5025) and numerous fresh huckleberry and Flathead cherry stands scattered throughout the valley. Hungry Horse Dam is the 11th largest concrete dam in the United States, and its spillway is the highest morning-glory structure in the world. During the summer, the visitor center is open from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Call 387-5241. Boating, fishing, hiking and camping are available at the reservoir. Kalispell, the largest city in the valley, is home of the Conrad Mansion, built in 1895 by the city's founder, as well as a picturesque downtown shopping area with tons of local flavor. Call the Flathead Convention and Visitors Bureau at 800-543-3105.\n\n46 Saint Ignatius Mission\n\nBuilt in 1854 by Native Americans under the supervision of Catholic missionaries who came to convert the locals, the Mission's setting is beautiful, with the Mission Mountains in the background. The striking building features 61 original murals along its walls and on its ceiling. These are by Joseph Carignano, a Jesuit priest who served at the mission. The mission is open for private worship 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the summer with Sunday Mass at 9:15 a.m. Reservations are not accepted, but walk-ins are welcome. Gift shop on site.

Self-guided, drive-through tours are available to observe the more than 400 bison, deer, elk, antelope and birds that make their home on the preserve. Red Sleep Mountain Drive is open during the summer while the winter drive is no longer open to two-way traffic. No motorcycles or bicycles are allowed for the safety of the animals and visitors. Visit the range in spring for the abundant wild flowers and in October to watch the annual bison round up, a hugely popular event. New restrictions exclude longer vehicles as well as any trailer or towed vehicle. Visitors' Center is open daily 10 a.m.-2 p.m., but the front gate is open 6:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.\n\n48 Whitefish Mountain Resort\n\nOpening day is June 20! Located on the edge of Whitefish and just west of Glacier Park, Whitefish Mountain Resort is a world-class downhill ski destination. It offers lodging, restaurants, lots of activities and some of the best views in the area. That goes for summer, too. Take the 15-minute gondola ride to the top of the mountain and witness stunning vistas of Glacier Park and the surrounding area. Have lunch, and then hop the gondola for the trip down. Better yet, take the scenic walking trail. The Zipline Tour is for adventurous visitors who will strap on a paragliding-style harness and click onto a custom built cable trolley to fly 300 feet off the ground at speeds up to 50 mph! People of all ability levels may enjoy the Aerial Adventure Park where they can learn to navigate treetop courses. In July and August wildflower walks are offered. Other guided tours are also available. Visit skiwhitefish.com.\n\n49 Flathead Lake\n\nFlathead Lake is the most popular — and most used — water playground in the state. It's the largest natural freshwater lake in the Western states. The lake is 28 miles long and, at its widest, 15 miles across. Maximum depth is 386 feet. Anglers delight in the fishing. The lake is known for its lake trout, cutthroat trout, perch, bass and whitefish. State parks along the lake offer great access for boating, swimming and camping. The lake is popular for speed boating, sailing, jet skiing, canoeing, kayaking and parasailing. Small islands offer great opportunities to observe birds and wildlife. There's lots of lodging and restaurants available along different stretches of the shore.\n\n50 Yaak Falls\n\nThis waterfall is the highlight for many visitors as they tour through the Yaak area in extreme northwest Montana. During spring and early summer tremendous viewing opportunities abound in the Yaak River area as snowmelt follows its way down and over the falls. For any photographer, this is one sight that shouldn't be missed. This site can be found on a Kootenai National Forest Visitors Map at Township 33N, Range 33W, Section 9. The Yaak Falls, named after the Yaak Indians who once populated this remote area of Montana, has always been a favorite stop on the scenic tour of northwest Montana. This beautifully cascading waterfall was created by the eastward shift of the Pacific plate. As a result of this shifting, some of the oldest rock in the world is exposed. The rock is dated between 800 million and 11/2 billion years old. This area is rich in local history, dating back to the 1880s. Part of an old bridge can be seen just below the falls. This bridge was the first structure to span the Yaak River. This allowed unrestricted passage from Troy to another important mining town called Sylvanite. Many placer mining camps, including one called \"Snipe Town,\" operated near the falls in the 1890s. In 1910, a devastating fire destroyed mining operations around the falls area. The Yaak Falls Campground is a little pack-in, pack-out campground with a maximum stay of 14 days and no fees. No toilets or drinking water are available. Call 295-4693.\n\n51 Hot Springs\n\nHot Springs, founded in 1910, is named for the local hot mineral springs that still bubble today. Thousands of people seeking rest and relief from pressure travel to the town of Hot Springs to bathe in the fine mineral water and mud baths. Many revisit on a regular basis, enjoying the benefits and relief that the natural hot mineral waters bring in the treatment of arthritis, skin diseases, rheumatism, stomach ulcers, high blood pressure and many other ailments. Opportunities for privacy, quietness, and relaxation abound in this area. Many lakes, streams and rivers provide excellent fishing for the avid fisherman. Nearby sight-seeing attractions include a tour of the National Bison Range at Moiese, a visit to the historical St. Ignatius Mission Church and Flathead Lake with its many opportunities for boating, jet skiing, water skiing and fishing.\n\n52 Seeley Lake\n\nNamed for the lake it abuts, Seeley Lake is a small town quickly growing in popularity with tourists. In winter, it's known for great snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, dog sledding and ice fishing. Summer recreation is even more plentiful. The lake itself offers camping, boating, swimming and fishing. Nearby trails head off into both the Bob Marshall and Mission Mountain wilderness areas. Folks on mountain bikes and all-terrain vehicles love all the old logging roads. The Clearwater River, which runs south through the valley, and the Swan River which flows north, offer fishing and canoeing. Golfers enjoy the nine-hole mountain course and more at Double Arrow Resort on the south edge of town. Call the Seeley Lake Area Chamber of Commerce at 677-2880.\n\nSeveral guest ranches offer horseback riding. There's camping and boating also available at nearby Swan Lake and Placid Lake. Just a short drive from Seeley Lake is the trailhead to Morrell Falls. A fairly flat, 2.5-mile hike leads to a stunning drop of falls — and a great place for a picnic. The hike is popular with families because children often enjoy splashing in Morrell Creek below the falls. Bring drinking water.\n\n53 The Sweet Palace\n\nIndulge your sweet tooth at the Sweet Palace at 109 E. Broadway in Philipsburg, and view what nostalgic, sumptuous sweets are cooking. Choose from 50 kinds of fudge, more than 72 flavors of saltwater taffy, 20 varieties of caramels or luxurious hand-dipped chocolates.

During the summer, they're open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. but are closed on Saturdays.\n\n54 A Carousel for Missoula\n\nLocated in Missoula's Caras Park, the colorful carousel is a gift to the city from one man's dream — and the volunteer work of many others. In 1991, cabinet builder Chuck Kaparich told city residents that if they'd provide a home for it, he'd build the carousel. When it opened four years later, more than 100,000 volunteer hours were logged on the project. Locals volunteered time and materials. The result: 38 hand-carved ponies, two chariots, 14 gargoyles and the largest band organ in continuous use in the country. A carving organization in Calgary, Alberta, even carved a friendship horse for the project. It's all contained within a building that looks like a jewel box. Dragons Hollow, the play area for children was added next to the carousel in 1995. Hours are 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. June-August. Call 549-8382.\n\n55 Historical Museum at Fort Missoula\n\nCommunity members joined together in 1974 to save what was left of the historic 1877 Fort Missoula which had housed the black 25th Infantry in 1888 and served as a military training center during World War I, regional headquarters of the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 and as an alien detention center in 1941. The post was decommissioned in 1947. Today the museum is the collection point for history and memorabilia of the Missoula area. Located on 32 acres, it houses 13 structures and more than 25,000 artifacts. Current exhibits include \"Growing the Garden City: Missoula's First 50 Years\" and \"The Road to Today: 250 Years of Missoula's History.\" Open 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday to Saturday and Noon -5 p.m. on Sunday. Call 728-3476 or visit www.fortmissoulamuseum.org.\n\n56 Hike-the-M in Missoula\n\nVisitors to Missoula can gain a dizzying view of the campus of University of Montana with a short but steep hike to Mount Sentinel's M in Missoula. The M-hike is an ideal family activity, but the more ambitious hiker may consider tackling Sentinel itself. Reaching the summit is a bit more strenuous than the M, with an elevation gain of almost 2,000 feet in about one mile. From the summit, hikers have several options to extend their hike or descend the same way they came up. Mt. Jumbo, Mt. Sentinel's sister peak, branded with an L for Loyola High School, offers a climb of barely a mile, but there are fewer switchbacks to help with the climb.\n\n57 Alberton Gorge\n\nSome 30 miles west of Missoula on the Clark Fork River is the Alberton Gorge, the area's premier whitewater run for rafting and kayaking. It features Class III water, as well as quiet pools for swimming and fishing. Floaters are treated to many varieties of birds and wildlife, dramatic cliffs and roller-coaster rapids. Local companies offer full-day and half-day float trips. Only experienced floaters should hit the rapids without a guide. Call 722-7238 for more information.\n\n58 Travelers' Rest State Park\n\nLocated south of Lolo in the Bitterroot Valley, Travelers' Rest marks the old Indian campsite used by Lewis and Clark in both 1805 and 1806 as they made their way through the area. In recent years archaeologists found evidence of the expedition's main cook fire and latrine, which confirmed the explorers had been there. Activities for visitors include bird watching, children's activities, educational programs and fly fishing. Open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. throughout the summer, the visitors' center opens at 9 a.m. The entrance is located ½ mile west of Lolo. Call 273-4253 or visit www.travelersrest.org.\n\n59 Garnet Ghost Town\n\n\"To walk the streets of this ghost town is to step back in time, free from intrusion of modern society!\"A former gold-mining camp east of Missoula, Garnet once boasted some 1,000 residents, a school, many businesses and 13 bars. But by 1912 the gold had played out and a raging fire sent most of the remaining residents packing. Today, Garnet is now considered the state's best-preserved ghost town. Garnet is open to tourists. Open year-round, but access is limited to snowmobile or cross-country skis in winter. For access instructions and restrictions, visit garnetghosttown.net or call 329-3914.\n\nGOLD WEST COUNTRY\n\n60 Virginia City\n\nVirginia City — and the nearby Nevada City — had their glory days during the 1860s gold rush. Seemingly frozen in time, much of their splendor is well preserved, and Virginia City now is a hot destination for history buffs and others seeking a window on the state's past. Virginia City is a National Historic Landmark, a very much alive ghost town that boasts a tremendous collection of old-west memorabilia. Many of the buildings are restored and now give visitors a real-life feel of the past. The Nevada City Living History Museum is open every summer. The summer of 2014 will be filled with fun events celebrating the sesquicentennial of finding gold in Alder Gulch and the cultural heritage of Virginia City. Events are planned every weekend through Labor Day, and there are opportunities for fun and learning throughout the season.

It showcases the development of the cattle industry over the last 150 years with 80 historical structures including a ranch house, bunkhouse and outbuildings which operate much today as they did in the late 1800s and commemorate the role of cattlemen in American history. Visitors may reflect on Montana's early ranch days by beginning guided tours at the main ranch house. The visitors' center is open daily from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and until 5:30 from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Call 846-2070.\n\n62 Bannack State Park\n\nThe first major gold strike in Montana was in Bannack. The mining camp quickly swelled to a bustling town of 3,000. It was the first territorial capital of Montana and became home to the infamous Sheriff Henry Plummer and the Vigilantes. Located about 25 miles south of Dillon on Grasshopper Creek, Bannack became a state park in 1954. Visitors can walk the boardwalk and enjoy the many buildings that have been preserved as part of this National Historic Landmark. History comes alive the third weekend of July each year during Bannack Days. Get in on the first annual Living History Days in September where re-enactors will depict the first 20 years of Bannack history. There are self-guided tours year round and guided tours by special request. Visitors may have fun panning for gold on their own and will enjoy \"Saturdays in the Park\" with a special project presented each Saturday in the summer.

Call 834-3413.\n\n63 Lewis and Clark Caverns State Park\n\nLocated on Montana Highway 2, 19 miles west of Three Forks or 17 miles east of Whitehall, the Lewis and Clark Caverns became Montana's first state park in 1937. Located on 3,000 acres along the Jefferson River, the caverns are filled with geological wonders — stalactites, stalagmites and stunning columns. Visitors can take a two-hour, two-mile guided tour through the large caverns and narrow passages. The limestone caverns remain a cool 50 degrees during even the hottest of days. The park also includes a 40-space campground, amphitheater, visitor center, 3 rental cabins, picnic area, hiking trails, RV hookups, showers, firewood, and toilets. Bring good hiking shoes and bottled water. The trek to the entrance can be tough on little ones, and strollers or backpacks are not allowed on the tour. Summer cave tours run from May 1 to Sept. 30, but campgrounds and cabins are open all year. Tours are scheduled from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and are open until 7 p.m. midsummer. Call 406-287-3541.\n\n64 Old Montana Prison\n\nBuilt by convict labor in the late 1800s, this old-style prison was in use until 1979 and was home to at least one member of the \"Wild Bunch.\" It is now on the National Register of Historic Places. Guided and self-guided tours take visitors through the massive cell block that once housed the state's worst prisoners. Sandstone walls are 24 feet high and buried 4 feet deep to prevent escape by tunneling. A museum now adjoins the prison. It is open year round seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., with last admission time at 5:10 p.m. Call 406-846-3111.\n\nThe old prison also houses an auto museum with more than 150 cars, from classic Chevys to a 1903 Ford, on display. It was recently listed as one of the top 10 car museums in the country by USA Today.\n\n65 Old Works Golf Course\n\nAnaconda's history is built on copper smelting, but that history left a dirty legacy — a Superfund clean-up site. In the 1980s, the idea arose to transform the Old Works smelting site into something more useful. Today, the Old Works Golf Course is the state's only Jack Nicklaus signature golf course, and is quickly building a reputation as one of the premier daily-fee golf experiences in the Northwest region. It features multiple tees, allowing players of all levels to enjoy the challenging 18 holes. The course design includes some of the byproducts of the mining days. Huge piles of black slag are incorporated into the design. It's also used in the bunkers. Measuring up to 7,700 yards, the course runs along Warm Springs Creek. Fairways are bordered by native grasses planted as part of the restoration process. Nicklaus also designed the practice facility — putting area, chipping/bunker area, two bent-grass practice tees and three practice holes. Also available are a clubhouse, dining room and bar and pro shop. Call 563-5989 for prices and tee times.\n\n66 Big Hole National Battlefield\n\nThe site of a battle between the Nez Perce Indians and the 7th U.S. Infantry forces and civilian volunteers in 1877 as five bands of Nez Perce were fleeing the government's attempt to confine them on a small reservation in Idaho. The battlefield offers three separate trails allowing visitors access to the actual locations where the events took place. Trail guides are available at the trailheads, and a Summer Speaker Series begins on June 29 and continues every weekend through Aug. 18. The main visitor center is open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily.

Call 689-3155.\n\n67 Berkeley Pit\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Butte claimed fame as the Richest Hill on Earth. In 1955, copper mining in the area greatly expanded with the opening of the Berkeley Pit. By 1980, with more than 1.5 billion tons of material removed from the town's main mine, all that was left was the pit. The large, truck-operated, open-pit copper mine was world famous while in operation. Two small communities and much of Butte's former east side were swallowed up by the mine following land purchases for expansion. Now a superfund site, the pit is 7,000 feet long, 5,600 feet wide and 1,600 feet deep. It is slowly filling with water. Visitors can look at the colors of the pit from the viewing stand. Call 497-6250.\n\n68 Our Lady of the Rockies\n\nTowering 90 feet tall on the mountains overlooking Butte is Our Lady of the Rockies, a statue dedicated to all women, regardless of religion. Built entirely by volunteers, the statue was begun in 1979 and completed in 1985. That year, in a breath-taking operation, an Air National Guard team raised the 51-ton statue by Sky Crane helicopter onto its mountainside base. Today visitors can go inside the towering metal structure. During summer and early fall, tour buses take visitors to the site. A 2½ hours. Open June through October, Mon. - Sat.

The lake features four public boat ramps. Camping is available, as are lodging, restaurants, casinos and a marina.\n\n71 Boulder Hot Springs\n\nFounded a century ago, Boulder Hot Springs is a historic hotel situated on the grounds of natural geothermal water.

The hotel was recently restored and includes a bed and breakfast. It's the perfect place for a conference or retreat. Famous for its buffets, spa services are also enjoyed by many visitors. The resort is backed by the Deerlodge National Forest — home to bears, moose, elk, deer, fox, antelope and coyotes. Open 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. April 1-October 31 and noon to 8 p.m. November 1-March 31. Call 406-225-4339.\n\n72 Gates of the Mountains\n\nThe Gates of the Mountains Recreation Area at upper Holter Lake is located about 20 miles north of Helena and is a famous part of the route of the Lewis and Clark expedition. A guided boat tour from the marina provides visitors with an in-depth look at the area's geography, wildlife and history. The canyon is home to scores of creatures, including mountain sheep, deer, otters, turkey vultures and even the occasional black bear. Although the 2007 Meriwether fire scorched a large part of the area, vegetation is abundant. The canyon like waterway is actually home to some plants that can't be found anywhere else. Tour guides aboard the boats say the area is a \"geologist's playground.\" Passengers have the option to stop off at the Meriwether Picnic Area, stay awhile and catch a later boat back. There are restroom facilities, a large, covered picnic structure for group gatherings and smaller individual sites with grills and tables. Hikers can tackle the jaunt to the Mann Gulch, where a forest fire killed 13 smokejumpers in 1949, or the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness. The Gates was also a significant site for Native American culture. Tour guides said the area had a deep spiritual implication which still can be seen in the pictographs painted onto the cliffs' nooks and crannies.

The main area of the Capitol was built in 1902; two wings were added a decade later. The building is built of sandstone and granite. Atop its copper dome is a statue depicting liberty. A gift shop and museum are located just down the street in the Montana Historical Society, which offers 1-hour guided tours of the Capitol for student and tourist groups. With two weeks' notice, the Legislative Branch offers an age-appropriate 30-60 minutes presentation on the legislative process, and the Secretary of State's office can present a short program on voting and elections. Self-guided tours are available, as are group tours by reservation.

Call 406-444-4789.\n\n74 Archie Bray Foundation\n\nSixty years ago, on the grounds of his Western Clay Manufacturing Co. brickyard, Archie Bray founded a pottery workshop to encourage the work and creativity of potters. That simple act became a tremendous resource to ceramic artists, who now flock to the center from around the world. A prominent patron of the arts, Bray died in 1953, only two years after establishing the nonprofit Archie Bray Foundation. Since then, more than 400 artists have come to work and hone their talents at the Bray. It also sells pottery and sculpture. Tours are available. Call 406-443-3502 or visit archiebray.org for event schedules.\n\n75 Myrna Loy Center\n\nIn 1976, the Helena Film Society organized to provide alternative films and cinema to residents of the state capital. Based on the second floor of an office building, it became Second Story Cinema and enjoyed a reputation for bringing in independent films. In 1985, with the help of a National Endowment for the Arts grant, the effort expanded with the renovation of the historic Lewis and Clark County Jail into an arts center. The Myrna Loy Center officially opened six years later. Its mission is to present challenging and enriching arts programs to the community. It has sponsored hundreds of live performances, including theater, dance, jazz, folk and performance art. And, yes, it still presents alternative films. For ticket information call 406-443-0287.\n\n76 Marysville\n\nOnce a vibrant gold camp with a population of more than 4,000, the town of Marysville northwest of Helena now is nearly a ghost town. Nearly, but not quite. Some people still live here, and a little mining still goes on. Visitors may take a walking tour of the Drumlummon Hill which includes 14 sites, several of which are listed on the National Historic Register. The Catholic church and general store still serve the community and its visitors. The town now is a popular destination for sightseers and those just wanting a pleasant place for a picnic or a quiet day away from the bustle of town.\n\n77 Sun River Canyon\n\nFlowing from Gibson Reservoir, adjacent to the Bob Marshall Wilderness, is the Sun River. The canyon in this area is a spectacular setting for outdoor recreation. The reservoir is popular for boating and fishing. Hunters flock to the area in fall and winter. Boating and scenic tours are available. Situated nearby is the Sun Canyon Lodge, which offers rustic and modern cabins, a restaurant, camping, horseback and wagon rides and boating. This is a great launch site to the Bob Marshall Wilderness and the Rocky Mountain Front.\n\n78 Lincoln\n\nJust a few miles from the Continental Divide, Lincoln is a mountain town that knows how to have fun in any weather. During winter, the area bustles with hunters, snowmobilers, cross-country skiers and dogsledders. Summer brings hikers, backpackers, anglers, photographers, bird watchers, campers, ATVers and others to enjoy the nearby trails, lakes, creeks and Blackfoot River. Take a night drive over nearby Roger's Pass to watch the stars far from city lights. The annual July 4 weekend rodeo draws contestants and fans from around the state.

Call the Chamber of Commerce at 362-4949 or visit www.lincolnmontana.com.\n\n79 Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex\n\nEncompassing more than 1.5 million acres, the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex now includes the Bob Marshall, Scapegoat and Great Bear Wilderness areas. The vision for protecting this great swath of mountain country came from Bob Marshall, an early day forester and co-founder of the Wilderness Society. The complex, designated as wilderness in 1964, is now considered one of the most completely preserved mountain ecosystems in the world. It includes rugged mountains ranges, alpine peaks, grassy meadows, fish-heavy streams, large valleys and huge forests. Because of its wilderness designation, the area is not open to motorized traffic. But hikers, backpackers and horse riders all enjoy their trips to the interior. The complex is home to grizzly bears, gray wolves, elk, deer, Canada lynx, bobcats, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, black bears, wolverines and other animals. Access from communities in Gold West Country includes roads near Lincoln, Choteau and Augusta. Plan your visit by visiting www.wilderness.net.\n\nYELLOWSTONE COUNTRY\n\n80 Yellowstone National Park\n\nYes, the majority of Yellowstone National Park actually is in Wyoming, but three of the park's five entry gates are in Montana's Yellowstone Country: Cooke City, Gardiner and West Yellowstone. The country's first national park was established in 1872. Its 2.2 million acres cover a spectacular array of mountains, lakes, rivers and, of course, geysers, mud caldrons and bubbling hot pots. The natural wonders — from wildlife to geography — are as beautiful in winter as in summer. Especially in the Lamar Valley in the northeast corner, visitors are treated to a wide variety of wildlife, including grizzly bears, wolves, bison, elk and deer. Eagles, falcons and trumpeter swans are among the 303 bird species that make their home in the park.\n\nThe Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is a popular hot spot for tourists and the site of one of the most picturesque glacial and volcanic aftermaths in the world. Visitors will see house-sized boulders and a more-than-300-foot waterfall from which they can view from an overlook directly above.\n\nEntrance fees are $30 for private vehicle, $25 for motorcycle and $15 for visitors on foot or bicycle. It's open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The park and gateway communities offer lots of accommodations for visitors, but reservations are recommended in the busy tourist seasons. Call 307-344-7381 or visit www.yellowstonenationalparklodges.com.\n\n81 West Yellowstone\n\nThe small community of West Yellowstone is a big destination in itself. In the winter, it's known as the Snowmobile Capital of the World — even the local police ride them around town. In summer, it's a busy, busy entranceway to Yellowstone. The town boasts the state's first six-story IMAX theater, with films interpreting the history, wildlife and geothermal activity of Yellowstone Park. Open 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. every day, the Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center features live grizzlies and wolves and natural presentations. Beginning in June, there are daily ranger talks, free Smoke Jumper programs for kids, weekend rodeos, a mountain bike biathlon and free fly-fishing clinics.

The largest T-rex skull, the largest dinosaur skull ever found and some of the world's rarest dinosaurs are on display in the complex which was designed by world-famous paleontologist Jack Horner. As well as the Siebel Dinosaur Complex, the museum houses the Martin Children's Discovery Center, the Taylor Planetarium, Space: A Journey to our Future, Paugh Regional History Hall and the Living History Farm. Three separate halls are dedicated to traveling exhibits. Call 994-2251.\n\n83 Gallatin Gateway\n\nThis community just west of Bozeman was named for being a main gateway to Yellowstone National Park. Even in the 1800s, the area was known for its many dude ranches and tourist opportunities. Many out-of-state visitors boarded at the beautiful Gallatin Gateway Inn in the early part of the century. It was restored to its original splendor in recent years and has regained its fame as one of the finest historic Inns in the region. The palatial structure features arched windows and carved beams. The original railroad clock still keeps accurate time for visitors. The Inn now is home to a fine restaurant that draws customers from around the state. Fly fishing is available in the Madison, Gallatin, and Yellowstone rivers and raft trips are available from several guides in the area.\n\n84 Chico Hot Springs\n\nJust 30 miles north of Yellowstone National Park in the foothills of the Absaroka-Beartooth Mountain range is Chico Hot Springs. The resort boasts two hot mineral pools that are enjoyed year round. The turn-of-the-century main lodge has 44 quaint rooms, and individual cabins, chalets and cottages are also available. For diners and dippers, this resort has become known for its fine dining and wide array of day spa services. Call 333-4933.\n\n85 Beartooth Scenic Drive\n\nCharles Kuralt called the Red Lodge to Cooke City Beartooth Scenic Highway the \"most scenic drive in America.\" Normally, only mountain climbers get to see the sights on the drive that, since 1936, has taken visitors over the 11,000-foot Beartooth Pass and past hundreds of tiny ponds, as well as lakes situated in glacial depressions. The Beartooth area is one of the highest and most rugged areas in the lower 48 states, with 20 peaks reaching more than 12,000 feet in elevation. Cross-country skiing may be done during June and July.\n\n86 Beartooth Mountains\n\nTalk about big mountains, the Beartooths offer some of the highest elevations in the lower 48 states. Twenty of its peaks are more than 12,000 feet high. The mountain range offers views of glaciers, lakes, forests and abundant wildlife. Much of the range falls within the 900,000-acre Absaroka-Beartooth wilderness. The wilderness area includes hundreds of miles of trails for plenty of hiking, backpacking and cross-country skiing.\n\n87 Yellowstone Wildlife Sanctuary\n\nTake the north entrance to picturesque Red Lodge to find the sanctuary. Formerly called Beartooth Nature Center, it's the only public facility in the state to house native animals that cannot be returned to the wild because of injury or habituation to humans. More than 70 species reside here, many placed by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks. They include wolves, mountain lions, bears, moose, elk, antelope, bobcats, eagles, hawks and others. The center is open to the public from noon to 4 p.m. Tuesdays-Fridays and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends, weather permitting, so that visitors can learn about the animals and observe them at close range and through interpretive displays. Call 446-1133.\n\nCUSTER COUNTRY\n\n88 Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument\n\nIn 1876, the U.S. government launched a campaign against Sioux and Cheyenne Indians who refused to be confined within a reservation. Under the spiritual leadership of Sitting Bull, the Indians prepared for battle against the much stronger army. During the preparations, he was said to have conducted a Sun Dance and had a vision of a great victory of the white soldiers. The defeat of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and his 647 soldiers in the 7th Cavalry is now well known. Custer and his men attacked an Indian village in the valley of the Little Bighorn River. When the bloodshed ended, 263 cavalrymen — including Custer — lay dead. Today, the monument lies within the boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation and commemorates the battle and the warriors on both sides who fought for their respective nations. Summer park hours are 8 a.m.-8 p.m.; the Visitors Center closes at 7:30 p.m. The 4.5-mile driving tour road and Deep Ravine walking trail close at 8 p.m. Call park headquarters at 638-2621 or visitor information at 638-3214.\n\n89 Pompeys Pillar National Monument\n\nOn his return trip through southern Montana, explorer Capt. William Clark carved his signature into a 120-foot-high sandstone formation along the Yellowstone River. That signature is preserved for the viewing of guests through the national monument designation. Clark named the pillar after Jean Baptiste \"Pomp\" Charbonneau, son of Sacagawea, and her guide husband, Toussaint Charbonneau. The child spent the first year and half of his life on the historic journey. Drive in 9 a.m.-6 p.m. until Labor Day; walk in 365 days a year from dawn to dusk.

To the Sioux Indians, the name meant \"bad earth\" or \"bad land.\" Indeed, much of the pine and juniper-studded park is filled with badland formations. The park also is rich in dinosaur remains, including Tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops. A visitor center explains the park's fossils and geologic history. Roads and hiking trails offer visitors a number of routes through which to explore the capstone formations. Visitors also enjoy photography, archery and Frisbee golf. A campground is available, but water is only available May through September. Open daily 10 a.m.-5 p.m. until Labor Day. Call 377-6256.\n\n91 Paddlefishing the Yellowstone\n\nFor a unique experience, try your hand catching paddlefish at Yellowstone Intake Diversion Dam just north of Glendive. From mid-May through June, paddlefish run the waters, testing anglers outfitted with heavy-duty tackle and paddlefish licenses.

It houses a coal tunnel and memorabilia from early mining days, local Indian artifacts, fossils, restored cowboy and pioneer exhibits, a blacksmith shop and an old ranch home built in the 1880s. New this year is \"Clovis to Coal,\" a display constructed in the rock Room depicting an in-depth history of the geologic Musselshell Valley.

Walters, who has been with the state police agency for almost seven years. He remains suspended without pay or benefits, though has not been terminated.\n\nOfficials said Walters was on duty when the incident occurred. He turned off his body camera during the assault, officials said, but a program in the device meant it was still capturing video. There was no audio.\n\nOfficials released Walters' body-cam video, showing him walking up to the back of a Delaware State Police SUV that was holding the handcuffed boy. Another trooper backs out of the way as Walters strikes the boy in the face.\n\nWalters then walks around the SUV until he again comes to where the boy is being held and flashes a light at the teen, who turns his body to face the inside the the vehicle. Walters hits the button to turn his body camera on, activating its audio.\n\n\"You sure about that?\" Walters is heard saying.\n\n\"Please tell me what I did? Please tell me what I did?\" the boy asks.\n\nWalters was charged with second-degree assault, a felony; deprivation of civil rights, a felony; two counts of third-degree assault, misdemeanors; and two counts of official misconduct, also misdemeanors.\n\nAttorney General Kathy Jennings said Tuesday that the man \"chose to extract his own form of personal justice\" by \"embarking on a violent rampage.\"\n\n“As a mother and grandmother, the footage in this case is hard to watch,\" Jennings said Tuesday. \"As a prosecutor, the constitutional violations are stunning.\"\n\nState Police Col.

Believing the boy was up to wrongdoing, Walters confronted him causing a verbal altercation, court documents say.\n\nWalters called Elsmere police, who picked up the teen and took him to his home in the nearby development of Lancaster Village.\n\nThe teen was not charged, but the indictment says the following day Walters looked up the teen on the state’s law enforcement information database that contains addresses, pedigree and background information.\n\nA few days later, on August 21, a 15-year-old boy and his friends were pranking homes in Elsmere by knocking on doors, then running away also known as “ding-dong ditch.” About 8:30 p.m. that day, the 15-year-old kicked Walters’ door, startling the trooper’s girlfriend. She called Walters, who was on duty.\n\nWalters drove toward his home, calling Delaware State Police troopers and other police agencies for assistance, the indictment said. Police said it was reported as an attempted home invasion, prompting the deployment of the state police helicopter and various K-9 units.\n\nWhile at his house, the indictment said, Walters spoke to a witness who told him several juveniles had run past him and toward the street where the 17-year-old boy from the earlier incident lived.\n\nWalters and an officer from nearby Newport went to the home of the 17-year-old boy and, at gunpoint, removed them from the house, according to the indictment. The 17-year-old and his friend had not been involved in the ding-dong ditch prank.\n\nThe teens were forced to the ground, where one can be heard on body camera video saying \"please help me\" and calling for his mom.\n\nThe teen's family said they were held in hot police cars for hours before they were released. The mother of the 17-year-old boy was told it was all a \"misunderstanding,\" The Delaware News Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, has previously reported.\n\n\"Some kids were over in the other neighborhood playing [ding-dong ditch] and they hit a door that belonged to a state trooper police officer,\" the mother said an officer told her. \"Your son is not on the video. He has nothing to do with it.\"\n\nHer son was released after being detained for about four hours with police not providing an incident report. She said Walters had been knocking on doors in the neighborhood and told one of the neighbors that someone had tried to break into his home.\n\nThe indictment claims Walters left the scene after handcuffing the 17-year-old and went to where another trooper had detained the 15-year-old boy and his friends. The 15-year-old was face-down on the ground being handcuffed when Walters arrived.\n\nWalters then struck the 15-year-old in the back of the neck and head with his knee, according to the indictment.\n\nWith the 15-year-old’s hands cuffed behind him, another trooper took the boy to a state police SUV and was placing him in the rear passenger seat. That’s when the indictment said Walters turned off his body-cam, walked to the police vehicle and struck the boy’s face twice causing an orbital fracture.\n\nAnother black eye for the badge\n\nWalters' indictment adds to the growing list of Delaware law officers who have been recently charged with or convicted of crimes.\n\nDelaware State Police trooper James D.

MacColl was sentenced to a year of probation and 150 hours of community service for the felony lie and a misdemeanor official misconduct guilty verdict.\n\nBrandon Cooper, a former Wilmington police officer, was charged with sending nude photos to a teenage girl he met while on duty in 2021.

The teen and his friends were pranking Elsmere-area residents with “ding-dong ditch,” when they unknowingly targeted a home owned by a state trooper. The trooper and other officers, including K-9 units and the state police helicopter, went searching for the boys.

This was confirmed by Sturgis, who said the agency is in the process of implementing body-worn cameras department-wide.\n\n\"Some units, such as the Special Operations Response Team (SORT), have not used body-worn cameras to date as we are working through the challenges of securing the cameras to their specialized uniforms,\" Sturgis said. \"As such, we do not have body-worn camera video of the use of force, but there is body-worn camera video from uniformed troopers who responded after the shooting.\"\n\nInvestigators are still working to determine if there may be other sources of video, she added.\n\nIn 2021, Delaware Gov.

Edwin Ramirez, who was stationed at Troop 9, was charged with misdemeanor and felony tampering with public records; issuing a false certificate, a felony; and official misconduct, a misdemeanor. If convicted, he faces up to nine years in prison.\n\nDelaware State Police contacted prosecutors in May, according to the Justice Department, after an internal review found \"a serious pattern of fraudulent E-Warnings\" by Ramirez.\n\nThe review began on April 30 after one of his supervisors found discrepancies in an accident report, prosecutors said. Ramirez, who has been with the police agency for six years, was immediately suspended with pay.\n\nRELATED:This law shields police in Delaware from public scrutiny. But it didn't start out that way\n\nAccording to the indictment, after finding the discrepancy, the supervisor began looking at Ramirez's activity dating back to April 1. The supervisor compared instances where E-Warnings and E-Tickets were issued to dashcam footage to determine whether the stop had occurred and if so, what Ramirez had issued.\n\nAs state police continued to investigate, they found that in April alone, Ramirez issued more than 30 fraudulent warnings, according to the Justice Department. In some cases, motorists were not informed of the warnings.\n\nIn other instances, prosecutors said, the traffic stop never happened.\n\nSome of the most egregious instances of fraud, the Justice Department said, include:\n\nOne victim, who works for Delaware State Police's communications division, was issued an E-Warning for speeding when they were not driving. Ramirez was driving 16 miles per hour at the time he issued the warning.\n\nA Sussex County police officer was issued an E-Warning for driving off the road. The officer was never stopped, and Ramirez was driving 58 mph at the time he issued the warning.\n\nA Department of Correction employee was given an E-Warning for using a cellphone while driving, but they were never stopped. Ramirez was driving 49 mph at the time he issued the warning.\n\nAnother victim was given two E-Warnings, but there is no video recording of a traffic stop. The victim was in Virginia when Ramirez said he stopped them, though their car was at home in southern New Castle County.\n\nA victim was issued an E-Warning for a window tint violation while they were home and on the computer for a parent-teacher conference. Ramirez was driving 24 mph at the time he issued the warning.\n\nA U.S. Postal Service employee who was at work and not driving was given an E-Warning for not wearing a seat belt. Ramirez was driving 38 mph, then stopped for 15 seconds \"a short time later.\"\n\nOne woman was issued an E-Warning for speeding, but when investigators reviewed dashcam footage, they found Ramirez had stopped a man.\n\nSeveral victims who were stopped were either not told they were being given a ticket/warning or were told about one but not the other. Several others were issued citations without any discussion about it.\n\nFollowing the internal investigation, a state police investigator obtained a search warrant for Ramirez’s patrol vehicle and found a sheet of paper in the center console that listed Troop 9 troopers and their productivity statistics.\n\nThat document included his 2019 and 2020 yearly evaluations, which prosecutors said included commendations for traffic productivity.\n\nIn one commendation, Ramirez's captain said the corporal issued 458 traffic citations and 640 traffic E-Warnings in 2020. As a result, he received the “2020 Troop 9 Traffic Ace” award.\n\nThough E-Warnings don't have financial penalties attached to them, they harm drivers, the Justice Department said.

Callery was suspended on Tuesday pending the completion of an internal human resources investigation, she said.\n\nProblems first surfaced at the Medical Examiner's Controlled Substances Laboratory on Jan. 14, when a Delaware State Police trooper – during a drug trial in Kent County Superior Court – opened up a sealed evidence envelope in front of a jury. Instead of finding the 64 blue Oxycontin pills that had been sent to the lab for testing, the officer found 13 pink blood pressure pills.\n\nAn investigation soon followed and the Controlled Substances Lab was shut down and the Medical Examiner's Office evidence locker was secured by the Delaware State Police on Feb. 20.\n\nSince that time, investigators have been conducting an inventory of all drug evidence at the lab and all police agencies in the state have been asked to double check their records on what drugs had been sent to the lab for processing.\n\nSo far, the audit has found at least 21 cases where drug evidence disappeared or was tampered with from arrests between 2010 and 2013. The state has also had to delay at least two drug trials, dismiss drug charges in one case and cut favorable plea deals with defendants in three other cases, including that Kent County case from Jan. 14.\n\nOn Thursday Superior Court President Judge James T. Vaughn Jr. issued an administrative directive that judges would grant delays in all drug cases set for trial in March – which could involve as many as 150 defendants – if prosecutors asked for a delay and indicated on the record that drugs in the case were processed by the state's drug lab.\n\nThe audit of the drug lab is continuing and the number of cases involving missing or compromised evidence is expected to rise.

Richard Bratz. \"While any fleeing felon has no right to a leisurely escape, his or her apprehension has to be constantly weighed against the likelihood of serious injury or death to the trooper or anyone else.\"\n\nAlpert said DSP's policy doesn't explicitly limit a trooper's freedom to start a chase unless the need to capture a fleeing suspect immediately could cause people further harm, such as in the case of an escaping murder suspect.\n\nInstead, he said, the written DSP policy offers vague latitude to start a chase with non-violent suspects, bucking an increasingly restrictive national trend in law enforcement practice.\n\nIn recent years, police departments across the country have revised their pursuit policies after some high-speed chases ended in tragedy. Those changes most often leaned toward eliminating chases in all but the most dangerous cases.\n\n\"Many of them are restricted to violent crimes only,\" said Alpert, who's served as a member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police Research Advisory Council.\n\nExperts say the officers and departments must weigh the benefits and risks of letting a suspect get away and the potential harm of a chase.\n\nIn most cases, experts argue, it is safer to let a suspect escape. Yet, police have complained that these overly strict policies make enforcing the law harder.\n\nThe written DSP policy gives troopers latitude to initiate a chase for misdemeanors and non-violent offenses, according to a review of the policy obtained by The News Journal.\n\nIn Delaware, troopers decide to initiate pursuits, but then must check in with a supervisor who determines whether to continue pursuing or break off.\n\nThe model policy from the International Association of Chiefs of Police, used as a standard for many agencies across the country, does not allow that latitude.\n\nThe DSP policy warns of the dangers of pursuits, but DSP reports have cited minor offenses such as broken headlights and non-violent causes such as stolen vehicles as the impetus for pursuits. What is not in all of those reports, though, are details about the pursuit, such as the length of the chase, what supervisors said to do and the speed involved.\n\nIt is those details, kept out of public view until presented in a courtroom, that define any chase's merits, a DSP spokesman said.\n\n\"Delaware State Police is confident in our pursuit policy and the authority vested in our supervisors,\" Bratz said. \"Delaware State Police continually strive to enhance the quality of life through best practices and continuous training to protect life and property.\"\n\nConcern about the DSP procedures was raised after the June 23 death of a burglary suspect on a bicycle who collided with a trooper pursuing him in a marked vehicle. State police have released few details about how the crash happened.\n\n\"The whole momentum right across North America is to make pursuits more restrictive because they're inherently dangerous,\" said Gareth Jones, once a sergeant in London and now an expert witness on police pursuits in North America. \"There's more of a realization that it is just not worth it except in the most egregious of circumstances.\"\n\nAt least 11,500 people were killed in police car chases from 1979 through 2013, according to a 2015 USA Today analysis. That includes more than 5,000 bystanders and passengers and about 6,300 fleeing suspects.\n\nSettlement reached over 2013 fatal motorcycle police chase\n\nThe civil case of a bystander killed in a 2014 crash involving a pursuing DSP trooper ended in February when a jury sided with the defendants in the case, awarding no damages to Smith's family. The fatal June 23 chase that resulted in the death of Richard Talbot is under investigation, state police said.\n\nTalbot was a 32-year-old father and tattoo artist with a history of burglary pleas and, according to a letter from his family, drug abuse. In that letter, his family described his life as a troubled one bespeckled with personal joys, which kept him afloat.\n\n\"He battled his addiction right along with his demons, trying hard to escape them all,\" the emailed letter read. \"He loved fishing, it was his other passion besides his child and his art. It was on the water he felt calm and peaceful. Please understand, we do not want Richie Talbot to be remembered as a suspect fleeing police, he was so much more.\"\n\nFamily: Man fatally hit by trooper was father, tattoo artist\n\nHe was on a bicycle around 12:30 p.m. on Fisher Road south of Milton when a Troop 7 officer noticed Talbot matched the description of a burglary suspect. The trooper turned on his lights and initiated a pursuit, police said.\n\nThe details of the chase have not been made public as DSP investigates, but there was a fatal collision between the trooper's Chevy Tahoe and Talbot's bicycle.\n\n\"The suspect ignored numerous verbal commands and continued to flee,\" read a DSP news release. \"As the pursuit of the suspect continued, the two vehicles were involved in a collision.\"\n\nPolice said stolen electronics were recovered from Talbot after the crash. The trooper involved in that crash has been placed on leave, a standard procedure.\n\n\"In past cases, and even in this case, it's unfortunate for everyone involved,\" Bratz said. \"For a trooper engaged in or about to become engaged in a pursuit, a decision must be made to continue or discontinue the pursuit. The Delaware State Police vehicle pursuit policy is designed to assist the individual trooper in determining when it is reasonable to undertake those substantial risks and, for safety purposes, when it is best to continue.\"\n\nExperts interviewed for this story agreed that chasing a suspect on a bicycle is a unique case.\n\nA more typical high-speed chase took place on Interstate 95 just days before.\n\nA Delaware River and Bay Authority police officer, on June 20 around 10 a.m., attempted to stop a driver on I-295 for aggressive driving and other moving violations, according to a police spokesman. A chase, which soon involved a DSP trooper, began on I-95 and reached speeds of 100-120 mph, according to police reports.\n\nThe fleeing motorist left the interstate onto Del. 896 headed toward Maryland, and pursuing DRBA police and the DSP trooper broke off the chase. A DRBA spokesman said the pursuit was too dangerous to continue once it reached a residential zone.\n\nNo one was hurt and the driver got away.\n\nA stricter policy in that case might have kept DRBA and DSP from giving pursuit at all.\n\nPolicies should guide officers\n\nJust letting bad guys go may be anathema to officers, but that is why policy must provide firm guidelines, according to Louis Dekmar, IACP president and chief of police of the LaGrange, Georgia, Police Department.\n\n\"The natural inclination of a police officer is to catch someone who has violated the law. But we know through studies, policy and analysis of pursuits that most folks that run from the police are not involved in dangerous felonies, and that anywhere between 10-25 percent result in an accident,\" Dekmar said.\n\nDekmar said the majority of police pursuits last less than one minute and continue for less than one mile, a circumstance which often precludes supervisors from weighing in.\n\nHe said officers are better equipped when their checklist for pursuits is short and firm.\n\n\"Policy is ultimately going to guide the response of the officer,\" Dekmar said. \"Pursuits begin and end very quickly, and so do the consequences of pursuits.\"\n\nBratz said the policy which guides Delaware state troopers is backed up by one guiding supervisors. Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security provided The News Journal with the troopers' policy but not the supervisors' policy because, Bratz said, operational security measures could be harmed through its publication.\n\nHe said the troopers' policy, reviewed every year and reinforced throughout troopers' training and career, advises them to take into account factors such as road conditions, time of day, surrounding traffic and public safety.\n\nUnder DSP policy, Bratz said, troopers make the first choice in whether to pursue, but he emphasized those mitigating factors also give them the choice to end it.\n\nAlpert said all those factors are exactly why progressive departments take the choice away from officers and put it on the command staff and supervisors.\n\n\"It forces the officer to make a series of decisions in the heat of a chase,\" Alpert said of policies like the one DSP troopers follow. \"While the officer is trying to drive well and keep an eye on the suspect, his or her mind has to go through this variety of factors to make the decision. It is complicated.\"\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma, Police Department Maj. Travis Yates is a trainer with SAFETAC, which aims to reduce line-of-duty deaths and injuries among first responders. He is adamant about strict police pursuit policies, though he didn't always see it that way.\n\n\"If you had talked to me 20 years ago, I would have said we have to chase everybody. But that has certainly changed, and I think that has come from, unfortunately, tragedies, and, unfortunately, from lessons learned,\" Yates said.\n\nNot every police administrator agrees overly strict pursuit policies are best.\n\nMilwaukee officials: Police will chase suspects\n\nMilwaukee Police Department Officer Charles Irvine Jr. died June 7 after his squad car crashed during the pursuit of a reckless driver. His partner and the squad car's driver, Officer Matthew Schulze, was injured in the rollover crash.\n\nIn the mind of Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales, the person who fled, not the policy, is the problem.\n\n\"We’re going to chase you,\" Morales said at a June 25 press conference.\n\nThat department's policy underwent a major overhaul after police pursuits there killed four bystanders in a three-month span in 2010. Some of those strict limitations have since been rolled back after suspects began to take advantage of it.\n\n“I thought you guys couldn’t pursue vehicles unless it was a felony,” the suspect in the fatal police chase told detectives after his arrest, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nA commission with oversight over the Milwaukee Police Department stands by the importance of officers having the freedom to think and act on their own.\n\n\"I'm sorry that it ended tragically but that is what the job is, and we give officers the ability to use their judgment,\" Fire and Police Commission Chairman Steven DeVougas said after the fatal police pursuit. \"Sometimes people get hurt and sometimes the bad guy doesn't get caught. We have to let the officers make those calls.\"\n\nInformation about Milwaukee police was written by Ashley Luthern of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 319-1855 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com\n\nRecent Delaware State Police pursuits\n\nOn May 4, a trooper spotted a stolen Cadillac near Seaford, activated emergency sirens and, when the driver didn't stop, engaged in a vehicle pursuit. The Cadillac collided into a stop sign, ending the chase. The driver, 21-year-old Mikeyah Brewer, was charged for drug paraphernalia found in the car after the chase, driving with a suspended license, reckless driving and multiple traffic offenses.\n\nOn March 24, a trooper in Bridgeville tried to pull over 40-year-old Christopher Albury for a busted headlight, but Albury accelerated and a pursuit began. It didn't end until police deployed tire deflation devices, though Albury then fled on foot. Police said further investigation determined Albury was drunk. He was charged with DUI, failing to stop on command, resisting arrest and traffic offenses.\n\nOn Nov. 4, state police troopers tried to stop 32-year-old Seaford resident Donshell Weston in Bridgeville. No reason was given for the attempted stop in the DSP news release. Weston fled, leading troopers on a vehicle pursuit that ended when Weston crashed into a utility pole at Fisherman’s Bridge. Weston escaped on foot. Weston was wanted after the pursuit for drug possession, disregarding a police officer's signal and traffic charges. He's since been arrested.\n\nPursuit policies\n\nLouis Dekmar, president of the International Association of Police Chiefs and chief of police LaGrange, Georgia, said the IACP model should be used as a baseline.\n\n\"It's a decent policy, but it's by far not the best policy,\" said Tulsa, Oklahoma, Police Maj. Travis Yates, who is also a police trainer. \"If you're not at least meeting that guideline, you're probably behind.\"\n\nBratz said revisions to DSP's policy include guidance from groups like IACP plus any court decisions and state law changes.\n\n\"We feel, as an agency, the Delaware State Police pursuit policy is consistent with the IACP model policy guidelines,\" Bratz said.\n\nThe DSP policy offers troopers greater freedom in making the decision to chase and it first tells troopers to consider the seriousness of the offense.\n\nDSP policy states pursuits for traffic violations are unnecessary. Troopers need only position themselves to get a vehicle description and its plate numbers, the policy states.\n\nThe DSP policy puts pursuits starting with suspicions of DUI, misdemeanors and non-violent felonies at the discretion first of the trooper then the on-duty supervisor, who after being informed a pursuit has begun decides if it will be continued or abandoned.\n\nThe DSP policy give more latitude for chases with felonies involving serious injury or death. This section of the policy offers a variety of limiting factors troopers are advised to consider, though, including risk of a pursuit and seriousness of the crime.\n\nThe final portion of the DSP policy presented to The News Journal was redacted.\n\n\"Historically, most high-speed pursuits are the result of minor traffic violations,\" the DSP policy reads. \"The injuries and property damage that often occurs is frequently disproportionate to the state interest sought to be protected.\"\n\nBratz said pursuits for simple traffic violations do not meet policy by themselves, but weighing additional safety factors and supervisor oversight might change the decision.\n\nThe answer for giving chase, he said, is more complex than yes or no.\n\nThe guts of the DSP policy, according to Alpert's review, are based in the balance equation of possible harm versus potential good any police chase should calculate.\n\n\"It does have language in there that chases are dangerous and that you have to be careful, but the training they get and the accountability they're held to will determine whether they err on the side of caution or chase until the wheels fall off,\" Alpert said.\n\nAdam Duvernay\n\nPOLICE AND THE ROAD\n\nDirt bike street riding: An escape for inner-city dwellers or nuisance for everyone else?\n\nMore than 470 bags of heroin seized in Milford\n\nWilmington man in stolen car leads Pa. police on 20-mile chase, rams cop car\n\nVehicle pursuit leads to lockdown at Del Tech's Georgetown campus", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/29"}]}

It will take over space used by a former Save A Lot and a Sherwin-Williams and is expected to open by the end of the year. Sherwin-Williams agreed to move to another spot in the shopping center to make room for Aldi.\n\nAt a Milford City Council meeting last year, a representative from Milford Plaza owner Tsionas Management said Marshalls shared interest in filling the shopping center's former Peebles store if Aldi also came. But a Marshalls has not been officially announced.\n\nRedner's Fresh Market\n\nLocation: Fernmoor’s Vineyards Community, near the Five Points intersection in Lewes\n\nThe long-awaited Redner's Fresh Market is preparing for a fall opening after several pandemic-related delays, the Cape Gazette reported.\n\nThe store will be Redner's Fresh Market brand, a smaller-format grocery store featuring locally grown products.\n\nParivaar Supermarket\n\nLocation: Route 40 near New Castle\n\nThe Indian grocery store at Route 273 and Churchmans Road is preparing to open a second location. It will be in part of the former Pathmark in the shopping center opposite the New Castle Airport.

Du Pont Highway, will open Feb. 5 at 8 a.m after a ribbon-cutting event. Lidl will be offering special deals and giveaways to customers throughout the weekend.\n\nThe brand's top competitor, Aldi, opened a store in June less than a mile away from the Dover Lidl site. Both chains bill themselves as low-cost alternatives to traditional grocery stores, almost exclusively offering products from their own private-label brands.\n\nAldi arrived in Delaware before Lidl and has five locations throughout the state. The chain is expected to expand from roughly 1,900 to 2,500 U.S. locations by 2022, which would make it America's third-largest supermarket chain behind Walmart and Kroger.\n\nPLASTIC BAGS: Delaware's plastic bag ban is almost official.

It will take the place of the Countryside Nursery and Garden Center, which closed in July. Lidl has not announced a timetable for its construction.\n\nAround 90% of Lidl's products are produced by their own private-label brands.

They also happen to be Rivera's lifelong \"spiritual\" parents, although Gandia publicly shies away from discussing their personal connection.\n\nShe works from a tiny, one-room Stanton office, which Rivera pays for out of his own pocket \"so 100 percent of the donations go to the foundation.\"\n\nWhen Rivera decided to retire in 2013, the Yankees and teams across the league wanted to donate during his retirement tour, so he created a public version of his foundation for underprivileged children.\n\nThat's when his mostly private work began to become more public, leading to the realization that his foundation needed a headquarters, now in a co-working office park near Christiana Mall.\n\nNext month, the foundation will host its biggest Delaware event yet when Rivera himself returns to host the Mariano Rivera Foundation 5K & Kids Run on May 19 in Wilmington's Canby Park to help raise funds for next year's backpack giveaway and other programs.\n\nThe first race, which was held last year in Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania, raised $42,000 for the man who wore No. 42 on his back.\n\nThe funds helped pay for giving away backpacks in Rodney Square last summer, said Richards, Layton & Finger attorney Russell Silberglied, who works closely with Gandia as both legal counsel and a member of the board of directors for the foundation.\n\nA man of God raised by a Christian evangelical family, the self-educated Rivera quietly gave 10 percent of his Yankees contracts back to his private foundation, Gandia said, along with every penny from his endorsement deals.\n\nWhen Rivera was in Rodney Square last summer, he explained where his drive to help comes from and why he does much of it in Delaware, pointing to the Gandias.\n\n\"The Lord has blessed me with a lot and to remember where I came from, I just have to give back,\" he said to a group of local reporters. \"Delaware is a special place for me. ... My spiritual parents live here — the people who have loved me, taken care of me and have been there for me. We're always looking for stuff to do here for the kids.\"\n\nThis new public push makes both Rivera and Gandia uncomfortable, even though it will likely mean more donations.\n\n\"What we do is really to thank God for what he's done for this family and what he's done for Mariano,\" said Gandia, offering a peek into the selflessness and grace that became keystones to Rivera's baseball legend.\n\nEven so, Gandia points not to herself or her husband for Rivera's giving. She said it was the late Yankees owner George Steinbrenner who helped instill Rivera's altruism.\n\nSteinbrenner — the man known as the Boss in New York media for his brash style — also had a softer, charitable side that went mostly unreported because he stipulated that his donations be private.\n\nHe also founded the Silver Shield Foundation in 1982, a nonprofit that pays for the education of children of New York firefighters and police officers killed in the line of duty.\n\nSteinbrenner had been quoted often as saying, \"If you do something good for someone, and more than two people know about it, you didn't do it for the right reason.\"\n\n\"Mariano took that very seriously and, of course, we've always been giving, so it felt right with us,\" she said. \"That's how we became the Mariano Rivera Foundation and gave and gave and gave. And we're still giving.\n\n\"What we do is what we have to do. We teach children to love and to care for your family and your neighbor. That's a biblical principle. And when you learn that and it's in your blood, it doesn't take motivation to do it because it's there.\"\n\nSilberglied has seen Gandia and Rivera, 48, torn between keeping their charity secret and making it known. As he puts it, \"It's an interesting conundrum. Giving on a personal basis and not saying too much is very meaningful, but you also get to give more if you publicize it.\"\n\nAdds Gandia, \"We are not here to make a name for ourselves or lift up Mariano Rivera. We're here to lift up the people. And we realize you have to let the people in need know that you're here.\"\n\nThe foundation focuses on education for underprivileged children through scholarships, back-to-school backpack events, holiday food drives and monetary contributions. Foundation events have been held everywhere from New Jersey and Florida to Panama and Puerto Rico.\n\nSilberglied said the foundation is as hands-on as it gets. Rivera, Rivera's wife Clara and their children, along with Gandia, Silberglied and others, all volunteer their time. As a small, nimble charity, they follow their heart in deciding who to help.\n\nFor the past several years, the Riveras have all have been in Delaware for their annual turkey giveaway – a meal that comes with all the trimmings. They did one event on the Riverfront, and last year's giveaway was held at the William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center in West Center City.\n\n\"It was a very festive atmosphere with a lot of pictures being taken, a lot of hugs and a lot of gratitude,\" said U'Gundi Jacobs, director of the center. \"And going into the winter, it helps families who struggle — maybe even letting them save some of those canned goods for a time after they're done with that big, fresh turkey.\"\n\nSince one church didn't give away its vouchers in 2016, the whole gang went door to door offering the dinners to random families, even stopping cars and making the offer.\n\nGandia remembers one woman in her late 20s with four children who opened her door and was utterly shocked by the generosity, as well as the timing for her family.\n\nShe kept saying, \"Oh my God, oh my God,\" before asking for a hug while sobbing.\n\n\"She told me, 'You don't understand. We don't have any food in this house. What you are giving me is for the rest of the week,'\" Gandia remembered.\n\nThe woman then asked if there was any other food left over. She knew a friend around the block in need. Soon, they were all marching up the block and delivering another dinner.\n\n\"And that woman literally jumped and yelled, 'I have food! I have food!' And that's need right here in Wilmington,\" Gandia said.\n\nGandia, whose missionary work with her husband brought her everywhere from California and Vermont to Peru and South America, moved to Delaware in the mid- to late 1980s. They began working with small groups and were drawn to the people at Georgetown's Iglesia de Dios de la Profecia (Church of God of Prophecy).\n\n\"They were so needy at the time,\" she said of the church, which had only a handful of people when they first met and is now building a multimillion-dollar facility with help from the foundation. \"When we go there, it's like homecoming. They call me Grandma and call my husband Grandpa.\"\n\nDuring their 2009 church visit with Rivera — a visit that turned out to be a lot more public than other visits — the giving didn't stop with the foundation's $50,000 donation.\n\nGandia told Rivera they should start an offering because there were so many people in attendance. She said she then challenged him to see who could raise more, ending up with about $75,000 — a number than included a personal contribution from Rivera.\n\nWhen Gandia and her husband retired as missionaries, they decided to stay in Delaware. They liked that it was small and close to New York, Philadelphia and Washington.\n\n\"I really love the people. We could have left, but we decided let's just retire here,\" said Gandia, who is also a fan of the Chick-fil-A not far from her home, as is Rivera.\n\nShe still remembers the first time she brought Rivera to Christiana Mall while he was still with the Yankees. A young boy noticed him and followed them for a while before asking Gandia if he would take a photo.\n\nShe told him to wait in a corner and brought Rivera over. The kid became so excited that he shouted, drawing attention and plenty of onlookers.\n\n\"We literally had to run out of the mall,\" she laughed at the memory.\n\nThese days, Gandia is building a team around her at the foundation as she slowly steps away from running it. After that, she plans to live happily in Delaware, but Rivera, who lives in New York, has other ideas.\n\n\"He has these big plans that when we really, really retire, that we're going to live with them,\" she said. \"The only way I would move out of here is if I get Alzheimer's, don't know what's happening and they take me. I just love this place.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

It will occupy the entire block between Main Street and East Delaware Avenue at Main and Haines streets.\n\nThe building will include 80 two-bedroom apartments and a 221-space parking garage and will incorporate parts of the existing Duck Donuts and Starbucks buildings to serve as retail space on the ground floor.\n\nWHAT'S GOING THERE: Panera Bread opens Middletown location with drive-thru lane\n\nThe parking garage will be located toward the rear of the building and will be split between four levels. Of the 221 spaces, 120 will be offered to tenants and 101 will be dedicated to public parking managed by the city.\n\nThe project is being developed by Todd Bariglio and Michael Scali, who together years ago built a similar complex on South Main Street called Rittenhouse Station.\n\nIn May, Councilwoman Dwendolyn Creecy appeared to support the project but voted against it. Once the proposal failed, she motioned to reconsider. Then, she again voted against the proposal, and it again failed by a 4-3 vote.\n\nCreecy shared concern over the cost to rent the apartments, which is not among the criteria the City Council is supposed to use to judge development proposals according to city code.\n\n\"There was really some confusion among council members about the criteria to be considered when voting for site plan review,\" Mayor Jerry Clifton said Monday night. \"I think we do owe it to the citizens of Newark and to the applicant to ensure the proper criteria is considered on this vote.\"\n\n\"Due to the circumstances of the last vote, there was a little bit of confusion logistically; however, I do stand on the fact that I would like things to be comfortable for lower-incoming students,\" Creecy said.\n\nThe council on Monday approved the project by a 5-1 vote, with Creecy and Councilwoman Sharon Hughes changing their votes from a month ago. There is a vacant spot on council after James Horning resigned last month.\n\nHughes voted for the project reluctantly, saying she wants the developers to know there are too many apartments downtown and future projects need to be scaled down.\n\n\"They took away our houses and took away our Main Street,\" Hughes said.\n\nHughes' criticisms echoed that of several community members who have argued against the project since its inception last year, saying it's \"out-of-scale\" and against the character of the college town.\n\nThose in favor, including several Main Street business owners, say it will help alleviate parking issues downtown and work to prevent students from renting in residential neighborhoods.\n\nAfter years of development on the periphery of Newark's Main Street, there are several projects now in development or under construction that will bring scores of apartments and fresh retail spaces to the street directly downtown.\n\nA three-story building with retail space and 30 apartments is being built by Lang Development at 281 E. Main St. in place of Fulton Bank. A proposal to build a five-story structure with a restaurant and 56 apartments across the street from the Fulton Bank site is in the approval process.\n\nLang is building a seven-story hotel and a student apartment building at the site of the historic Green Mansion at 94 E. Main St.\n\nThe developer also has plans to build a new structure in place of the building known as Center Square at Center and Main streets with retail space and 58 residential units. Center Square is currently home to Walgreens and the restaurant Homegrown.\n\nAfter approving the project Monday, Clifton said he will ask the council to consider placing a moratorium on development projects downtown so the city can evaluate its code and zoning rules.\n\nIn many recent cases, council members have criticized projects they later approved because the project met code requirements.\n\nThe council will discuss the moratorium idea on June 28.\n\nContact Brandon Holveck at bholveck@delawareonline.com.

The case – in which the trial jury’s 11-1 vote for a life sentence was overruled by a judge-imposed punishment of death – also comes as jury recommendations are in the national spotlight after a Florida jury failed to unanimously recommend the Parkland school shooter be put to death, resulting in his life sentence.\n\nSmith’s execution was called off at about 11:20 p.m. “due to the time constraints resulting from the lateness of the court’s proceedings,” the corrections department said in a statement, adding the protocols required to carry out the execution “could not be performed before the expiration of the death warrant.”\n\nSmith had been scheduled to be executed at 6 p.m. for his role in the 1988 killing of Elizabeth Sennett. But the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals granted him a stay of execution just hours before his death warrant was set to expire at midnight. The state then filed an emergency appeal with the US Supreme Court, which less than two hours before the death warrant was set to expire returned its decision vacating the lower court’s decision and granting the state the ability to move forward with the execution.\n\nThough the high court’s order did not provide a comment on the emergency appeal, it noted liberal Justices Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson would have kept the stay in place.\n\nThe failure to carry out Smith’s execution Thursday closely mirrored the state’s failed attempt in September to put to death Alan Eugene Miller.\n\nThen, too, Hamm blamed the flurry of court proceedings at the eleventh hour, saying the “condemned’s veins could not be accessed in accordance with our protocol before the expiration of the death warrant.”\n\nBoth failed execution attempts come on the heels of the death of Joe Nathan James, whom the state put to death in July in an execution that has since become heavily scrutinized, after a report in The Atlantic said a private autopsy showed James’ “suffered a long death.”\n\nCorrections officials had cut into James’ skin to find a vein to set an IV line – which is not part of Alabama’s lethal injection protocol, Dr. Joel Zivot, an anesthesiologist and professor at Emory University who witnessed the autopsy, has told CNN.\n\n“The attempted execution of Kenneth Smith last night is the last in a series of executions and attempted executions that demonstrate failures in Alabama’s ability to implement the death penalty consistent with its protocols and constitutional values,” Ngozi Ndulue, the deputy director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said in a Friday statement to CNN.\n\nNdulue took particular issue with the “secrecy with which Alabama conducts executions,” saying it “allows this pattern to continue with the only public scrutiny coming from litigation and post-execution autopsies.”\n\n“When other states have faced sustained problems with executions, they have paused executions and investigated the source of the issue,” Ndulue said.\n\nSmith’s jury voted 11-1 for life\n\nWhen Smith was sentenced, a jury voted 11-1 for a life sentence that was overridden by the trial judge who opted instead for the death penalty, a practice the state has since repealed.\n\nSmith’s attorneys argued in an earlier filing before the Supreme Court that he shouldn’t be executed. If he was tried today and his jury came to the same conclusion, his attorneys said, Smith would not be qualified for execution – not in Alabama or anywhere else, because no jurisdiction today allows the practice of judicial override.\n\nPutting Smith to death despite the jury’s verdict, they say, would constitute cruel and unusual punishment, violating his constitutional protection under the Eighth Amendment.\n\nAlabama became the last US state in 2017 to repeal judicial override, which allowed judges to disregard a jury’s decision for either life or death in capital cases and impose the alternative sentence. The new law, however, was not retroactive, and inmates like Smith, whose juries rendered what was then an “advisory” verdict for life, remain on death row.\n\nWhile the practice was previously allowed in three other states – Indiana, Florida and Delaware – Alabama judges routinely overrode juries’ votes for life, per a 2011 report by the Equal Justice Initiative. At the time, judicial override accounted for about 20% of the death sentences among the state’s death row inmates, the report said.\n\nThe Supreme Court has visited the issue of judicial override in Alabama since it was repealed. In 2020, the court denied the petition of another inmate, Calvin McMillan, who argued for his death sentence to be vacated, saying it was unconstitutional since his jury had voted for life.\n\nSmith had been one of four death row inmates set to be executed this week after the Supreme Court on Wednesday denied his request for a stay of execution. Stephen Barbee in Texas and Murray Hooper in Arizona were both executed Wednesday, and Richard Fairchild in Oklahoma was executed Thursday.\n\nThe murder of Elizabeth Sennett\n\nSmith was convicted of capital murder in 1996, court documents show, for his role in a murder-for-hire plot targeting Sennett, the wife of a local minister who was having an affair and had taken an insurance policy out on his wife so he could pay off his debts.\n\nSennett’s husband, Charles Sennett, recruited someone to kill his wife, court records state. That man then recruited two others, one of whom was Smith, and Sennett agreed to pay each $1,000 to kill his wife and make it look like she was killed in a burglary.\n\nIn March 1988, the men carried out the killing as planned, and Smith took from the Sennett home a video cassette recorder, which he stored in his own residence.\n\nCharles Sennett killed himself a week after his wife’s murder, the records state, as the investigation began to focus on him. But Smith was arrested after authorities, having received an anonymous tip, executed a search warrant at his home and found the Sennett’s VCR.\n\nThe sun sets in January behind Holman Correctional Facility, home to Alabama's death row. Jay Reeves/AP\n\nHe was convicted and sentenced to death, but an appeals court overturned that initial outcome and ordered a new trial, finding the state had based peremptory challenges to prospective jurors on their race.\n\nSmith was again convicted in the retrial. But the jury was apparently swayed during the penalty phase, which takes place after the guilt phase in trials for capital crimes. During the penalty phase, prosecutors and defense attorneys traditionally argue over aggravating and mitigating circumstances – reasons why they say the defendant should be executed or receive a lesser sentence like life in prison without parole.\n\nThis time, the jury voted 11-1 for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole after, his attorneys write, hearing evidence about Smith’s “character and life circumstances.”\n\nThe judge, however, felt that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating circumstances, Smith’s attorneys write, and overrode the jury’s vote, sentencing Smith to death.\n\nThe fall of judicial override\n\nJudicial override was intended to allow judges to essentially serve as a check on juries, preventing them from handing down death sentences in arbitrary or discriminatory ways, attorneys for the Innocence Project wrote in a 2020 brief at the Supreme Court in support of McMillan’s case.\n\nFlorida, Delaware and Indiana outlined specific standards for when a judge could override a jury’s vote for life, they wrote. In Florida and Delaware, for example, the facts supporting a death sentence needed to be so convincing that no “reasonable person” would disagree.\n\nAs a result, judicial override to impose a death sentence rarely took place – or a large bulk of the cases where it was used were later overturned. Additionally, Florida, Delaware and Indiana judges frequently used it to impose life sentences where juries had decided on death.\n\nAlabama instituted no such safeguards, the attorneys’ brief says, and judges there were required only to “consider” the jury’s verdict.\n\nThe state did away with the practice in 2017 by amending the law to specify that juries’ verdicts were no longer “advisory” but final.\n\n“You are entitled to a trial of a jury of your peers, and that ought to apply to sentencing too,” state Sen. Dick Brewbaker, who sponsored the bill, told CNN affiliate WSFA in February 2017, before the passage of his bill.\n\n“One of the most important things about our democracy is our laws are derived from the common law,” Brewbaker, a Republican, said. “That’s why a crime of violence is a crime against a community. That’s why we have a trial in the community. That’s why we pick a jury of the community and they decide guilt, innocence, and punishment.”", "authors": ["Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/12/29/delaware-development-the-projects-to-watch-entering-2023/69636825007/", "title": "Delaware development: The projects to watch entering 2023", "text": "Among the dominant development storylines in Delaware entering next year is the continued proliferation of industrial space across the state.\n\nOf the more than 30 projects on our list to watch in 2023 and future years, about a third involve a manufacturing or warehousing element.
