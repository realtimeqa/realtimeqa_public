To get ready, more states are taking steps to expand the vote and protect poll workers in 2023 compared with states working to make it harder to vote, according to expert analysis. Legislators and other advocates say those shifts represent a vibrant and growing pro-democracy movement.\n\nWhy are Americans losing faith in democracy?\n\nIn the past two election cycles, the fundamentals of democracy have faced significant threats, fueled largely by persistent lies from former President Donald Trump and his allies about whether he truly lost the 2020 contest (he did, according to Republican and Democratic election leaders across the nation).\n\nThose denials ignited a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but also fueled a number of states to pursue more restrictive voting laws in the name of election security. In the months that followed, hundreds of election deniers were inspired to seek public office, and although many failed to win they remain a part of the national conversation.\n\nPro-democracy advocates point to those losses in the 2022 midterm election as a sign of how seriously voters take the health of the nation's democracy.\n\n\"In recent elections, the majority of the people have sent a clear message: they wholly reject anti-democratic election denialism and want their basic rights protected,” former Attorney General Eric Holder, who has spearheaded a Democratic-led initiative on redistricting, told USA TODAY.\n\n“They want a truly representative democracy and the rights that should come with that.\"\n\nVoting rights depend largely on 'where you live'\n\nAt least 13 states have enacted about 15 restrictive voting rights laws in total this year, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan policy group. Seven laws seek to curb access to mail voting, for instance, which was popular during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAfter the 2020 elections, 14 states passed 22 restrictive laws in 2021.\n\n\"Where we're heading in terms of our democracy and voting rights depends a lot on which state you're in and increasingly, where you live rather than everybody in America having the same experience,\" said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the Brennan Center's Voting Rights division.\n\nAt the same time, legislators in 15 states took steps this year toward expanding voting rights. Of those, 23 measures made ballot access safer and easier, such as automatic voter registration, restoring voting rights for people upon their release from prison and imposing criminal penalties for intimidating poll workers, who saw a rise in threats.\n\nMinnesota, armed with a new Democratic \"trifecta\" in control of its state government, passed some of the most progressive voting laws in the country this year. It implemented automatic voter registration for residents once they turn 18, allowed pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds and created a permanent absentee voter list that sends a ballot to residents who sign up.\n\n\"The violent insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, really shocked the conscience of many voters,\" Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman told USA TODAY. \"What we found on the campaign trail, both in anecdotal stories from door knocking and from the data we collected from polling, was that voters were really concerned about our democracy in light of those incidents.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats are worried about future of American democracy\n\nThe health of U.S. democracy is something Americans agree about across the board, according to the USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll. It shows 74% of Democrats agree that \"democracy is imperiled.\" About 75% of Republicans agree and 66% of independents.\n\n\"This question does not cut off on political party,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"In fact, it's a validation that all political factions, whether you're in the left, right or in the middle, feel that democracy is imperiled, and that's pretty powerful.\"\n\nLarry Skinner, 72, a retired financial analyst and longtime Republican supporter from Riverside, California, said he remembers when President Ronald Reagan \"worked well\" with Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill in the 1980s to get legislation passed in Congress. These days, Skinner, who has been married for 54 years and has three adult children and nine grandchildren. said there is \"no road to compromise\" between the political parties.\n\nSkinner would like to see less of politicians \"from both parties making statements that clearly are not accurate. That makes so sense to me.\"\n\nPatrice Jackson, 48, a public school teacher for 18 years and GOP supporter from Chester, Pennsylvania, also said she wants less contentiousness in Washington.\n\n\"Can we please try to be more kind to one another, regardless of your party affiliation?\" Jackson asks. \"Can we reprioritize and focus on what the important issues are?\"\n\nFirst-term New Hampshire State Rep. Angie Brennan is a Democrat in a state that has a high concentration of registered independent voters. Strengthening the nation's democracy heavily depends on voter participation by removing barriers to the ballot box and proposing measures such as no-excuse absentee voting to ensure their constitutional rights, Brennan said.\n\n\"We all have a responsibility to fight for the future of our democracy,\" she said. \"It’s going to take all of us coming together to increase access and opportunities to vote. The future of our democracy depends on hope, humanity, and hard work, and I’m not giving up on any of that.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/24/us/white-christian-nationalism-blake-cec/index.html", "title": "An 'imposter Christianity' is threatening American democracy | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThree men, eyes closed and heads bowed, pray before a rough-hewn wooden cross. Another man wraps his arms around a massive Bible pressed against his chest like a shield. All throughout the crowd, people wave “Jesus Saves” banners and pump their fists toward the sky.\n\nAt first glance, these snapshots look like scenes from an outdoor church rally. But this event wasn’t a revival; it was what some call a Christian revolt. These were photos of people who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, during an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe insurrection marked the first time many Americans realized the US is facing a burgeoning White Christian nationalist movement. This movement uses Christian language to cloak sexism and hostility to Black people and non-White immigrants in its quest to create a White Christian America.\n\nA report from a team of clergy, scholars and advocates — sponsored by two groups that advocate for the separation of church and state — concluded that this ideology was used to “bolster, justify and intensify” the attack on the US Capitol.\n\nDemonstrators pray outside the US Capitol in Washington on January 6, 2021. Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMuch of the House January 6 committee’s focus so far has been on right-wing extremist groups. But there are plenty of other Americans who have adopted teachings of the White Christian nationalists who stormed the Capitol — often without knowing it, scholars, historians, sociologists and clergy say.\n\nWhite Christian nationalist beliefs have infiltrated the religious mainstream so thoroughly that virtually any conservative Christian pastor who tries to challenge its ideology risks their career, says Kristin Kobes Du Mez, author of the New York Times bestseller, “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation.”\n\n“These ideas are so widespread that any individual pastor or Christian leader who tries to turn the tide and say, ‘Let’s look again at Jesus and scripture,’ are going to be tossed aside,” she says.\n\nThe ideas are also insidious because many sound like expressions of Christian piety or harmless references to US history. But White Christian nationalists interpret these ideas in ways that are potentially violent and heretical. Their movement is not only anti-democratic, it contradicts the life and teachings of Jesus, some clergy, scholars and historians say.\n\nSamuel Perry, a professor of religious studies at the University of Oklahoma who is authority on the ideology, calls it an “imposter Christianity.”\n\nHere are three key beliefs often tied to White Christian nationalism.\n\nA belief that the US was founded as a Christian nation\n\nOne of the banners spotted at the January 6 insurrection was a replica of the American flag with the caption, “Jesus is My Savior, Trump is My President.”\n\nErasing the line separating piety from politics is a key characteristic of White Christian nationalism. Many want to reduce or erase the separation of church and state, say those who study the movement.\n\nOne of the most popular beliefs among White Christian nationalists is that the US was founded as a Christian nation; the Founding Fathers were all orthodox, evangelical Christians; and God has chosen the US for a special role in history.\n\nThis painting chronicles lawmakers' signing of the Constitution of the United States in 1787. MPI/Getty Images\n\nThese beliefs are growing among Christians, according to a survey last year by the Barna Group, a company that conducts surveys about faith and culture for communities of faith and nonprofits. The group found that an “increasing number of American Christians believe strongly” that the US is a Christian nation, has not oppressed minorities, and has been chosen by God to lead the world.\n\nBut the notion that the US was founded as a Christian nation is bad history and bad theology, says Philip Gorski, a sociologist at Yale University and co-author of “The Flag and the Cross: White Christian Nationalism and the Threat to American Democracy.”\n\n“It’s a half truth, a mythological version of American history,” Gorski says.\n\nSome Founding Fathers did view the founding of the nation through a Biblical lens, Gorski says. (Every state constitution contains a reference to God or the divine.)\n\nBut many did not. And virtually none of them could be classified as evangelical Christians. They were a collection of atheists, Unitarians, Deists, and liberal Protestants and other denominations.\n\nA Trump supporter holds a Bible as he gathers with others outside the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. John Minchillo/AP\n\nThe Constitution also says nothing about God, the Bible or the Ten Commandments, Gorski says. And saying the US was founded as a Christian nation ignores the fact that much of its initial wealth was derived from slave labor and land stolen from Native Americans, he says.\n\nFor evidence that the United States was founded as a secular nation, look no further than the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli, an agreement the US negotiated with a country in present-day Libya to end the practice of pirates attacking American ships. It was ratified unanimously by a Senate still half-filled with signers of the Constitution and declared, “the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on Christian religion.”\n\nDoes this mean that any White Christian who salutes the flag and says they love their country is a Christian nationalist? No, not at all, historians say. A White Christian who says they love America and its values and institutions is not the same thing as a White Christian nationalist, scholars say.\n\nGorski also notes that many devout Black Americans have exhibited a form of patriotism that does not degenerate into Christian nationalism.\n\nAmerican social reformer and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, circa 1880. Graphic House/Getty Images\n\nGorski points to examples of the 19th century abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, and the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Both were devout Christians who expressed admiration for America and its founding documents. But their patriotism also meant that “they challenged the nation to live up to its highest principles, to become a place of freedom, equality, justice and inclusion,” he says.\n\nThe patriotism of White Christian nationalists, on the other hand, is a form of racial tribalism, Gorski says.\n\n“It’s a ‘My tribe. ‘We [White people] were here first. This is our country, and we don’t like people who are trying to change it or people who are different’ form of nationalism,” Gorski says.\n\nA belief in a ‘Warrior Christ’\n\nVideos from the January 6 attack show a chaotic, tear-gas-soaked scene at the Capitol that looked more like a medieval battle. Insurrectionists punched police officers, used flagpoles as spears and smashed officers’ faces against doors while a mob chanted, “Fight for Trump!” The attack left five people dead and nearly 140 law enforcement officers injured.\n\nThe incongruity of people carrying “Jesus Saves” signs while joining a mob whose members are pummeling police officers leads to an obvious question: How can White Christian nationalists who claim to follow Jesus, the “Prince of Peace” who renounced violence in the Gospels, support a violent insurrection?\n\nA protester holds up a Bible amid the crowd storming the US Capitol Rotunda in Washington on January 6, 2021. Ashley Gilbertson/VII/ Redux/\n\nThat’s because they follow a different Jesus than the one depicted in the Gospels, says Du Mez, who is also a professor of history and gender studies at Calvin University — a Christian school — in Michigan. They follow the Jesus depicted in the Book of Revelation, the warrior with eyes like “flames of fire” and “a robe dipped in blood” who led the armies of heaven on white horses in a final, triumphant battle against the forces of the antichrist.\n\nWhite Christian nationalists have refashioned Jesus into a kick-butt savior who is willing to smite enemies to restore America to a Christian nation by force, if necessary, Du Mez and others say.\n\nWhile warlike language like putting on “the full armor of God” has long been common in Christian sermons and hymns, it has largely been interpreted as metaphorical. But many White Christian nationalists take that language literally.\n\nThat was clear on January 6. Some insurrectionists wore caps emblazoned with “God, Guns, Trump” and chanted that the blood of Jesus was washing Congress clean. One wrote “In God We Trust” on a set of gallows erected at the Capitol.\n\n“They want the warrior Christ who wields a bloody sword and defeats his enemies,” says Du Mez. “They want to battle with that Jesus. That Jesus brings peace, but only after he slays his enemies.”\n\nAnd that Jesus sanctions the use of righteous violence if a government opposes God, she says.\n\n“If you deem somebody in power to be working against the goals of a Christian America, then you should not submit to that authority and you should displace that authority,” she says. “Because the stakes are so high, the ends justify the means.”\n\nSupporters of then-President Donald Trump gather on the Ellipse near the White House to hear him speak on January 6, 2021. Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nThat ends-justify-the means approach is a key part of White Christian nationalism, says Du Mez. It’s why so many rallied behind former President Trump on January 6. She says he embodies a “militant White masculinity” that condones callous displays of power and appeals to Christian nationalists.\n\nBut with few exceptions, White Christian nationalists do not accept this “militant masculinity” when exhibited by Black, Middle Eastern and Latino men, Du Mez writes in “Jesus and John Wayne.” Aggression by people of color “is seen as a threat to the stability of home and nation,” she writes.\n\nWisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson echoed this double standard last year when he said on a radio talk show that he never really felt threatened by the mostly White mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6.\n\n“Now, had … President Trump won the election and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson later elaborated, saying “there was nothing racial about my comments– nothing whatsoever.”\n\nThis embrace of a warrior Christ has shaped some White evangelicals’ attitudes on issues ranging from political violence to gun safety laws.\n\nA survey last year by the Public Religion Research Institute revealed that of all respondents, White evangelicals were the religious group most likely to agree with the statement, “true American patriots might have to resort to violence in order to save the country.”\n\nThere are also some White Christian nationalists who believe the Second Amendment was handed down by God.\n\nGun rights activists carrying semi-automatic firearms pose for a photograph in the state Capitol Building on January 31, 2020, in Frankfort, Kentucky. Bryan Woolston/Getty Images\n\nSamuel Perry, co-author of “Taking America Back for God: Christian Nationalism in the United States,” wrote in a recent essay that among Americans surveyed who believe “The federal government should declare the United States a Christian nation,” over two-thirds rejected the idea that the federal government should enact stricter gun laws.”\n\n“The more you line up with Christian nationalism, the less likely you are to support gun control,” wrote Perry. “Guns are practically an element of worship in the church of white Christian nationalism.”\n\nA belief there’s such a person as a ‘real American’\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin introduced a new term to the political discourse. She talked about “the real America” and the “pro-America areas of this great nation.” Since then, many conservative political candidates have used the term “real Americans” to draw contrasts between their supporters and their opposition.\n\nSuch language has been co-opted into a worldview held by many White Christian nationalists: The nation is divided between “real Americans” and other citizens who don’t deserve the same rights, experts on White Christian nationalism say.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin speaks at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nGorski, author of “The Flag and the Cross,” says he found in his research a strong correlation between White Christian nationalism and support for gerrymandering—an electoral process where politicians manipulate district lines to favor one party or, some critics say, race over another. He found similar support among White Christian nationalists for the Electoral College, which gives disproportionate political power to many rural, largely White areas of the country.\n\nWhen White Christian nationalists claim an election was stolen, they are reflecting the belief that some votes don’t count, he says.\n\n“It’s the idea that we are the people, and our vote should count, and you’re not the people, and… you don’t really deserve to have a voice,” Gorski says. “It doesn’t matter what the voting machines say, because we know that all real Americans voted for Donald Trump.”\n\nWhy White Christian nationalism is a threat to democracy\n\nThose who want the US to become a Christian nation face a huge obstacle: Most Americans don’t subscribe to their vision of America.\n\nThe mainstreaming of White Christian nationalism comes as a growing number of Americans are rejecting organized religion. For the first time in the US last year, membership in communities of worship fell below 50%. Belief in God is at an all-time low, according to a recent Gallup poll.\n\nA parishioner bows his head to pray while celebrating midnight Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral on December 24, 2021, in New York City. Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images\n\nAdd to that the country’s growing racial and religious diversity. People who identify as White alone declined for the first time since the census began in 1790, and the majority of Americans under 18 are now people of color.\n\nOn the surface, White Christian nationalism should not be on the ascent in America.\n\nSo White Christian nationalists look for salvation from two sources.\n\nOne is the emboldened conservative majority on the US Supreme Court, where recent decisions overturning Roe vs. Wade and protecting school prayer offer them hope.\n\nCritics, on the other hand, say the high court is eroding the separation of church and state.\n\nNot all Christians who support the high court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade and its school prayer decision are White nationalists. For example, plenty of Roman Catholics of all races support racial justice yet also backed the overturning of Roe.\n\nBut White Christian nationalists are inspired by those decisions because one of their central goals is to erase the separation of church and state in the US.\n\nA recent study concluded that five of the justices on the Supreme Court are the “most pro-religion since at least World War II,” and that the six conservative justices are “all Christian, mostly Catholic,” and “religiously devout.”\n\nThe sun sets in front of the Supreme Court on June 28, 2022, in Washington. A Supreme Court decision last month overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling and erased a federal right to an abortion. Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n\nWhile some Americans fear the dangers of one-party rule, others like Pamela Paul, a columnist, warn of the Supreme Court instituting one-religion rule.\n\n“With their brand of religious dogma losing its purchase, they’re imposing it on the country themselves,” she wrote in a recent New York Times editorial.\n\nGorski, the historian, says White Christian nationalism represents a grave threat to democracy because it defines “we the people” in a way that excludes many Americans.\n\n“The United States cannot be both a truly multiracial democracy – a people of people and a nation of nations – and a white Christian nation at the same time,” Gorski wrote in “The Flag and the Cross.” “This is why white Christian nationalism has become a serious threat to American democracy, perhaps the most serious threat it now faces.”\n\nThe other source of hope for White Christian nationalists is a former occupant of the White House. Their devotion to him is illustrated by one of most striking images from the January 6 insurrection: A sign depicting a Nordic-looking Jesus wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat.\n\nIf Trump returns to the presidency, some White Christian nationalists may interpret his political resurrection as divine intervention. His support among White evangelicals increased from 2016 to 2020.\n\nAnd what the men carrying wooden crosses among the Capitol mob couldn’t achieve on January 6, they might yet accomplish in 2024.", "authors": ["John Blake"], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/politics/ranked-choice-voting-ctzn/index.html", "title": "Can ranked-choice voting save American democracy?

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nWelcome back to the CITIZEN newsletter after a brief vacation hiatus. In this edition, we’re focusing on a single big topic: ranked-choice voting.\n\nSome critics of the US election process argue that when most voters head to the polls in November, they don’t really have much of a choice on their ballots.\n\nThat’s because legislative and congressional districts have been carved up – largely by politicians themselves – to make the maps so heavily Republican or Democratic that the people who vote in primaries have effectively picked the general election winners. And that means die-hard partisan voters – rather than the broader electorate – exercise enormous sway over who holds elective office in this country.\n\nSo, some places are taking a different route.\n\nI reached out to Richard Pildes, a constitutional law professor at New York University’s School of Law – and one of the country’s leading experts on election law and democracy – to explain the ins-and-outs of this option: ranked-choice voting or RCV, as he calls it.\n\nHere are the results of the exchange, lightly edited for length and clarity:\n\nQ: First, the basics. Can you explain ranked-choice voting and where we’ll see it play out in the upcoming midterm elections?\n\nIn RCV, voters get to do more than simply vote for one candidate. They rank the candidates in the order they prefer them, and voters can typically rank as many candidates as they would like to. So if five candidates are running, voters can rank them 1-5. The system gives voters a way to express their views about a number of candidates, not just one.\n\nIf no candidate gets a majority of first-place votes, then a candidate is eliminated and the votes on the latter’s ballot are then given to the candidates who were ranked second on those ballots. There are different versions of RCV under which the rules for determining which candidate gets eliminated vary, but in the version used thus far in the US, it’s the candidate who gets the fewest first-place votes who is eliminated. So if I rank candidates A, B, C in that order, and candidate A is eliminated, my vote will then go to candidate B.\n\nIn the midterms for national offices, we are going to see RCV used for the first time in Alaska, including for their important Senate race, in addition to House races. The Alaska Senate race will be a particularly interesting test of RCV, because GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski might have lost support among Republicans, based on her vote to convict then-President Donald Trump after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. But she has always had broad appeal across the electorate, including Alaska’s large number of independents, as well as some Democrats. Her chances might be much better in an RCV election than a traditional plurality-vote system – a system in which whoever wins the most votes, when voters can vote for only one candidate, wins the office.\n\nAnother test looming even sooner involves Sarah Palin’s attempt to win the special election for Alaska’s one House seat. In the primary, Palin finished first among the top four candidates, with 27% of the vote; but the state GOP backed the candidate who came in second, Nicholas Begich III.\n\nThe August 16 general election will use RCV, and if Palin is a factional candidate, while Begich draws broader support, he might well defeat her.\n\nWe will see it being used for national offices also in Maine, where it has been used before and made the difference in the election of one Democratic congressman.\n\nQ: In a New York Times op-ed earlier this year, you described ranked-choice voting as offering promise in helping to “mitigate the forces of extremism in our politics.” Can you expand on that?\n\nOur traditional system of plurality-vote winners means factional candidates in crowded primary elections can end up winning nomination. In a crowded field, winning 30% of the vote can be enough to win the contest. If two candidates like that emerge from the two parties’ primaries, voters end up faced with a choice between two factional candidates – who might be two ideologically extreme candidates.\n\nIn addition, this system encourages negative styles of campaigning, because candidates are essentially pitted head-to-head. It also raises the risks that third party or independent candidates will become spoiler candidates – they will take away votes from candidates who have similar positions to their own, and thereby enable candidates with whom they strongly disagree to get elected. As a concrete example, in 2000, Ralph Nader likely attracted enough voters who would otherwise have voted for Al Gore to enable George W. Bush to win Florida – and thus become President.\n\nRCV, by contrast, encourages the election of candidates with the broadest electoral appeal. It also makes it likely that candidates who win will have the support of a majority of voters. A factional candidate might get 30% of the vote, but if that candidate doesn’t attract wider support, they won’t succeed in an RCV system. The system encourages candidates to reach out to voters who might not prefer that candidate as their first choice, but whom the candidate still wants to persuade to rank them second or third. In that way, it also encourages less hostile forms of campaigning. I do not want to brutally tear down an opposing candidate, because I want their supporters still to think well enough of me to rank me second or third.\n\nRCV also reduces the risk of spoiler candidates and so does not force voters into artificial choices. Suppose a moderate and a progressive (or staunch conservative) are running. I might prefer the progressive, but worry about whether that candidate is electable, and I have to decide whether to vote my sincere preference or vote for the more electable candidate. But with RCV, I can rank the progressive first and if they do not have enough votes, my vote will transfer to the moderate candidate.\n\nQ: Where has it worked? And do you expect it to spread elsewhere?\n\nSix states – Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina – use RCV for military and overseas voters. (They are used in the event a runoff election is required, for which those voters will not have enough time to receive and cast a runoff ballot.)\n\nSome political parties use it for their nomination contests; the Virginia GOP just used it at the nominating convention that led to Glenn Youngkin receiving the GOP nomination for governor. In the 2020 presidential contest, five states used RCV in the Democratic primaries or caucuses.\n\nThe only statewide use of RCV until recently has been in Maine; Alaska will now become the second state.\n\nWe have much more experience thus far with RCV at the local government level. Fifty-two cities now use it, including many large ones, such as Minneapolis, Oakland, and Salt Lake City. Those of us in New York City just used RCV for the first time, including in the all-important Democratic primary for mayor, which Eric Adams won.\n\nAs you see, RCV has been adopted in red jurisdictions, blue ones and purple ones.\n\nThere has definitely been an upsurge in adoptions of RCV even in the last few years. I think that’s a reflection of frustrations with how polarized our politics and choices have become. Whether it continues to spread elsewhere will probably be a function of how it’s perceived to go in high-profile races and places, such as in Alaska or Maine.\n\nIf it works as proponents believe, I would expect more adoptions to follow.\n\nQ: If ranked-choice voting is such a good tool for curbing political extremism, why isn’t it used more broadly?\n\nI don’t think RCV is a magic elixir to cure extremism. I think it can help, but I would not oversell it. But incumbent officeholders are not inclined to change the rules under which they got elected (unless they think some change will make it even more likely they will stay in office).\n\nSo elected politicians are not likely to lead the charge for RCV. And in general, Americans are very reluctant to change voting systems with which they are familiar and that they have used for many years. That’s understandable. Now that we have 55 or so jurisdictions using RCV, voters will get a chance to see how it works out in practice. If it’s perceived to improve our politics, more voters will be willing to endorse it.\n\nQ: OK, ranked-choice voting probably isn’t the cure for all that ails American democracy. What other changes need to happen in your view?\n\nHow big will you let me go? There are changes that largely stay within our existing structures. So I believe redistricting should give much more weight to the value of creating competitive districts, rather than the current reality in which around 90% of seats are safe for either party.\n\nI think the current structure of primary elections is a major force fueling extremism; I would like more states to experiment with structures like the top-four primary system Alaska has adopted.\n\nThe current system of campaign financing also helps fuel extremism; traditional forms of publicly financed elections, which 10 or so states use, could combat that (but not systems in which government matches contributions from small donors, since ideologically more extreme candidates benefit much more from small donors than do more moderate candidates).\n\nIn our presidential nominations process, I would like to see us find a way to give some distinct weight to the view of elected party figures from throughout the country, along with the view of primary voters. Those figures are likely to have more direct experience with potential candidates and insight into whether they will be competent leaders. We have largely eliminated all the intermediary, mediating institutions in our politics, which is part of why we have ended up with a politics increasingly dominated by outrage and extremism.\n\nYou need to read", "authors": ["Fredreka Schouten"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/08/19/donald-trump-not-problem-american-democracy-we-are-nichols/5563354001/", "title": "Trump is not the problem with American democracy, we are: Tom ...", "text": "Tom Nichols\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nI’ve written about a lot of unpleasant, even frightening, subjects.

Something was wrong, and I wanted to know why millions of the citizens of my own nation – some of them near and dear to me – were now, astonishingly, embracing illiberalism and authoritarianism.\n\nAnd so I wrote \"Our Own Worst Enemy,\" in which I identify what I see as the greatest threat to democracy in the United States: We, the people.\n\nThis is hard to say and it was hard to write. It would have been easier to find other culprits and unite with my fellow Americans in a tribal and bracing hatred of globalization, or China, or immigration, all of which are real issues that require wiser policies. But democracy is not unwinding because of container ships or communists. It is on the ropes because of our own choices.\n\nWe, ourselves, have become unwilling to engage in civic life at even the most basic level of regular voting. We, ourselves, have embraced consumerism that demands ever better and ever cheaper products no matter what the cost to our own economy. We, ourselves, have chosen to be solitary viewers of television and social media, and then to express ourselves in public only with performative and childish rage.\n\nOpinions in your inbox: The best insights and analysis every morning\n\nI wish I could say that my concerns were only reactions to the noxious rise of Donald Trump and the tragedy of the insurrection at the Capitol. But that is untrue; long before Trump and long before I began the book that would become \"Our Own Worst Enemy,\" I was worried.\n\nThe moments that weighed on me accumulated over the years. Friends who had grown up with me in economically strapped circumstances, for example, would tell me how they thought America was a disastrous mess – while sailing their boats, or sending me pictures from their multiple vacations. Political arguments that were once friendly jousting took on an almost religious hue.\n\nMoments of weird nostalgia became more common, with people remembering grim years of industrial decline with a golden glow that I knew to be false. One of my hometown friends, for example, once pointed to a factory across the street we both lived on as boys and railed to me how he remembered when it was busy and full. But I reminded him that such a memory was literally impossible, because the building was already a mostly empty hulk when we broke its windows as kids in the early 1970s.\n\nTom Nichols: Biden warns Putin on human rights and cybersecurity in Geneva. US moral clarity is back.\n\nWhat’s going on? Ironically, this growing illiberalism is not the product of bad times, but of a long trend of rising narcissism and a sense of entitlement that was enabled by peace, prosperity, and rapidly improving living standards. The United States and other democracies have real problems, but the rise of a sour and selfish abandonment of democracy is not happening because of social injustice or “economic anxiety.”\n\nWorse, our democracy now practically must run on autopilot independently of a public that is happily and willfully ignorant of the issues and wants nothing to do with the dreary business of governing. And with increasing frequency, our form of government is under attack by bored working and middle-class citizens – led by clever political and television figures – who have no use for democracy other than as slogans and window-dressing around their need to be the constant center of their own reality show.\n\nThe January 6 rioters were the most extreme example of this stupefying level of narcissism. These insurrectionists were not disenfranchised or oppressed people trying to engage in a peaceful assembly. They could barely express a coherent political thought. Rather, the whole event was a day-camp outing for middle-aged, middle-class, gainfully employed Americans who wanted to be heroes storming Congress – and perhaps lynching the vice president in the process – and then go back home to sell real estate, attend work retreats in Mexico, and brag about it all on Instagram.\n\nRevive maturity and stoicism\n\nOver a half-century ago, the writer Eric Hoffer presciently saw the way such madness might overtake the democracies when he warned that anti-democratic mass movements begin not with deprivation and suffering, but with boredom and plenty. “Our frustration is greater when we have much and want more than when we have nothing and want some,” he wrote in 1951. “To a deliberate fomenter of mass upheavals, the report that people are bored stiff should be at least as encouraging as that they are suffering from intolerable economic or political abuses.”\n\nSave us:Biden's top job is to autocrat-proof democracy after Trump. Six months in, he's failing.\n\nThe United States has fallen into this very trap. Our parents and grandparents had the fortitude to endure the 20th century, with two world wars and an economic disaster. In the 21st century, we lack the resilience even to overcome a pandemic, much less the great trials of a war or a depression. Worse, we are not mature or stoic enough even to endure the prosaic and often dull routines that are part of daily life.\n\nWe are suffering because we are successful. We are unhappy because we have what we want.\n\nTime is running out. If we are to recapture our civic life and reinvigorate our liberal and constitutional inheritance, we must stop, right now, and – unpleasant and searing though it will be – take stock of ourselves and our own role in the decline of our democracy.\n\nTom Nichols (@RadioFreeTom) is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College and an instructor at the Harvard Extension School.

Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThough Americans don’t agree on many political issues, there is one issue both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge poses a major problem: the state of American democracy. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 69% of Democrats and 69% of Republicans think the nation’s democracy is on the brink of collapse. And the figure for independents, 66%, isn’t much better.\n\nThis fear, if actualized, would have ripple effects around the world, given that so many nations look to the United States to be a global leader in democratic efforts. But it also has very real implications for our country’s immediate domestic politics and policy – as evidenced by the recent attacks against election officials across the country.\n\nThe threats after the 2020 presidential election were so serious, writes Philadelphia City Commissioner Lisa Deeley, that “I had two plain-clothes Philadelphia police officers assigned to follow me wherever I went – including the bathroom.”\n\nWe turned to a group of experts and asked what can be done to fix what is broken and restore faith in democracy.\n\nBill Bishop: This 1950s psychology study holds the answer\n\nBill Bishop courtesy Bill Bishop\n\nSocial psychologist Muzafer Sherif brought two highly similar groups of 11- to 12-year-old boys to Oklahoma’s Robbers Cave State Park in 1954. His intention was to study how hostilities arise between groups.\n\nThe boys arrived on separate buses and camped in different areas. One group decided to call themselves the Eagles; the other, the Rattlers. When the groups met, they fell into conflict. First, there was verbal sparring and then physical confrontation.\n\nSherif changed the terms of the experiment. He didn’t bring the boys around a campfire to express their feelings – polite chatter wasn’t the answer. Sherif gave both groups a problem to solve. He had jammed the camp’s water supply. If the boys wanted water, they would have to work together to fix the jam.\n\nThe boys collaborated on several problems. The hostilities dampened, and they stopped calling each other names. Several even asked if they could ride home together on the same bus.\n\nSince the mid-1970s, Americans have been self-segregating. We live in neighborhoods, go to churches, read news and join clubs that are increasingly politically homogenous. We even date and marry within our chosen party. We are Rattlers and Eagles – and the consequences in 2022 are the same as in 1954.\n\nWhat can we do? Mandatory national service. For a year or two, we would join others – a tossed salad of class, race, religion, party and way of life – to work on a problem facing the country. Not talk – do.\n\nIt could be through military service or a new version of the Appalachian Volunteers, the Peace Corps or Civilian Conservation Corps. But everyone at some point – Rattlers and Eagles – would have to work together to make the United States a better place.\n\nStudies of World War II support the notion that working together reduces tensions between groups that might otherwise be hostile toward one another. White troops who fought alongside Black soldiers held less racial animus post-war. The same was true with White merchant marines who served with Black sailors.\n\nSo let’s carry that lesson into the present day. And when our time of service is up, we just might choose to ride the same bus home together.\n\nBill Bishop is author of “The Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America Is Tearing Us Apart.”\n\nFatima Goss Groves: Build a representative judicial bench\n\nFatima Goss Graves National Women's Law Center\n\nDemocracy is broken because our trust is broken.\n\nFrom overturning access to reproductive rights to upholding state laws that suppress the right to vote, federal courts – in particular, the Supreme Court – keep making decisions that most Americans simply do not support.\n\nIt’s only natural that this would erode trust. But it’s not just that some of these decisions call the rule of law into question – it’s that it appears our judiciary isn’t really listening to how the law is lived for each and every one of us.\n\nAnd that contrast is made all the more stark when the courts are compared to the communities directly impacted by their decisions. The majority of federaI judges are White and male. They’re making decisions for communities they have often never been a part of – and that can have huge and irreparable implications, particularly for women and people of color.\n\nWe are in a pivotal moment. This session, the Supreme Court is hearing cases on affirmative action, voting rights and LGBTQ+ discrimination. We need a diverse judiciary – across all levels of the federal government – that gives the public confidence that the judges who hold our fates in their hands are seeking to fully understand the parties before them and are intent on reaching more fair-minded and informed decisions.\n\nPresident Joe Biden feels this urgency and remains committed to judicial diversity. His appointment of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, was a monumental milestone. And, as reported this July, 68% of Biden’s judicial nominees confirmed by the Senate are Black, Hispanic or Asian American.\n\nThis fall, we’re calling on the Senate to confirm all of Biden’s nominees – not just for the sake of the courts, but for the urgent and long overdue sake of restoring the public’s trust.\n\nFatima Goss Graves is the president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center.\n\nJoe Plenzler: Enlist veterans as election workers\n\nJoe Plenzler Joseph LeBlanc/Ars Nova Images\n\nDespite polling that indicates Americans think democracy is on the brink of collapse, we all have a choice. We can either cower before the challenge, or we can act to support, defend and strengthen our experiment in democracy.\n\nAfter spending two decades serving as a US Marine, I’ve chosen the latter approach. I now belong to We the Veterans, a nonpartisan pro-democracy group committed to building a more perfect union. We believe that positive civic engagement is an antidote to political tribalism and extremism – and that veterans can be a part of the solution.\n\nMore specifically, veterans can fill the poll worker deficit currently facing our country. Democracy runs on elections, and elections run on volunteers. If a community does not recruit enough volunteers, it will have fewer polling stations, longer lines and potentially disenfranchised voters.\n\nThe pandemic and threats of political violence have severely diminished volunteerism within the traditional cohort of election poll workers, many of whom are 61 years of age and older. According to one estimate, the US requires more than 1.1 million volunteer poll workers to administer elections, and experts now project a shortage of about 130,000 going into November.\n\nTo meet this challenge, We the Veterans has launched its first nationwide public awareness campaign called Vet the Vote to recruit 100,000 veterans and family members to become poll workers in their communities. To date, we have recruited more than 60,000 poll workers.\n\nThe military – including its veterans – is one of the most trusted institutions in our society, and it is our hope that when Americans see their veterans conspicuously serving in their polling stations, it will increase their faith in their electoral system and its outcomes. Additionally, veterans are trained to deescalate moments of tension and may be best suited to address any potential threats at the polls.\n\nJoe Plenzler is a 20-year veteran of the US Marine Corps who served in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is an entrepreneur and an election judge in Maryland. Plenzler is also on the board of We the Veterans and co-creator of Vet the Vote, a nationwide campaign to recruit 100,000 veterans and their family members to be poll workers.\n\nKatherine Mangu-Ward: Stop treating politics like a pinata\n\nKatherine Mangu-Ward Reason\n\nIf you lower a pinata packed with treats into a chaotic children’s birthday party, not only will you see some of the most astonishingly rapacious behavior imaginable, someone will almost certainly end up bleeding.\n\nEvery election, we essentially simulate those conditions in our democracy.\n\nTo retain whatever faith Americans have in our system of governance, we must arrest and reverse the dangerous tendency to turn everything into fodder for national political point-scoring. That means we must deregulate and devolve power to allow individuals to make their own choices about their love lives, their children’s education, the substances they put in their bodies, how they run their businesses – and many other topics about which Americans have widely varying and deeply held opinions.\n\nAs politics seeps into every single part of life, the stakes of our elections become untenably high. We must unstuff the pinata by reducing the size and scope of the government.\n\nThat means eliminating giveaways to corporations and other favored groups, as well as strengthening protections for economic and civil liberties in order to dramatically expand the sphere of privacy. With less power over others at stake, the temptation to cheat (or accuse the other side of cheating) is reduced.\n\nThis task isn’t easy, but it makes all subsequent policymaking much easier. I disagree with 69% of both Republicans and Democrats – nothing unusual there since I am a libertarian – and don’t think our democracy is on the brink of collapse. But I do think we are asking too much of our politicians and our political system, and that we shouldn’t be surprised when they act like spoiled children.\n\nKatherine Mangu-Ward is editor in chief of Reason magazine and co-host of The Reason Roundtable podcast.\n\nLarry Diamond: Eliminate the party primary\n\nLarry Diamond Hoover Institution\n\nToday, our congressional (and state) representatives are nominated in low-turnout party primaries, in which the most highly motivated, partisan voters predominate. Increasingly, the nominees that emerge from that process – particularly in Republican primaries – are the most uncompromising.\n\nThen, in November, elections are a “first past the post” contest only between the Republican and Democratic nominees, because a vote for a third-party or independent candidate is seen as wasted. This system stifles political choice and innovation – and leaves voters unsatisfied.\n\nThere is an alternative: ranked choice voting (RCV) with open primaries. Step one is a non-partisan “blanket” primary that advances the top four or five finishers to the November election. Pragmatic representatives couldn’t be knocked out at this stage because they would win enough votes from party moderates and independent voters to finish among the top four or five.\n\nIn the general election, RCV also would be used to choose the winner. Voters would rank their choices among the final five, and the winning candidate would need an absolute majority of votes. If no candidate won a majority of first-preference votes, the weakest finisher would be eliminated – and their preferences would be transferred to their second choices. This would continue until a candidate won a majority.\n\nIn this way, voters would be freed to vote for moderates and independents without fearing that they would be electing the candidate they most dislike. And pragmatism and flexibility would be encouraged because the process would tend to choose the most broadly appealing candidate.\n\nSome states are already moving in this direction. As a result of a 2020 voter initiative, Alaska is using the “top four” RCV system this year for its executive, legislative and US House and Senate elections, and Nevada is voting this November on an initiative to adopt “top five” RCV voting for its future elections.\n\nLarry Diamond is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, the Mosbacher Senior Fellow in Global Democracy at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI) and a Bass University Fellow in Undergraduate Education at Stanford University.\n\nDebra Cleaver: Make voting as easy as possible\n\nDebra Cleaver Helena Price Hambrecht\n\nThe ability to vote is the most crucial component of a functioning democracy. Yet voting rights are under constant attack – more than 440 restrictive bills were introduced during the 2021 legislative session alone – and the integrity of election results are being called into question by some of the very people we elected into public office.\n\nIn order to ensure that US democracy doesn’t just survive, but thrives, we need first to rebuild trust in the electoral process itself to increase voter turnout. We can easily remove many of the existing barriers which have been built to impede one’s ability to vote by implementing modern, proven, common sense solutions.\n\nFor example, Arizona first pioneered online voter registration in 2002. Yet 20 years later, states such as Arkansas, Mississippi and Texas still refuse to offer this service. Online registration not only increases voter participation among under-represented minority communities but also lowers administrative costs for state and local governments.\n\nEnforcing arbitrary registration deadlines weeks before an election only serves to compound the voter registration problem. These deadlines could be eliminated entirely if all states adopted same-day registration (or Election Day registration). Especially in states with strict voter ID requirements, such as Indiana, it’s a straightforward process to implement – and one which could enfranchise exponentially more voters than are disenfranchised by these ID laws. It’s also been shown to radically increase voter turnout and overall confidence in election results.\n\nThese simple and practical solutions must be made available to all eligible voters nationwide – both to increase voter participation and to rebuild their trust in our democracy.\n\nDebra Cleaver is the founder and CEO of VoteAmerica, a nonprofit which builds technology to simplify political engagement, increase voter turnout and strengthen American democracy.\n\nKen Burns: Remind Americans of history’s greatest lesson\n\nAs told to CNN Opinion\n\nKen Burns Courtesy Alvin Kean Wong\n\nLike many historians, I am an optimist. And American history provides a good baseline to assess the country’s potential. Given that the US has weathered three great crises – the Civil War, the Great Depression and World War II – there is reason to believe America can survive its latest crisis.\n\nBut this crisis – a loss of faith in American democracy – reflects a deep-seated anxiety about the very institutions this nation was founded on. In recent years, elements of democracy we took for granted, such as free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power, have been called into question.\n\nThat said, this isn’t the Weimar Republic in 1929, and there is still hope for American democracy. It begins by acknowledging that freedom has a cost, and it requires constant vigilance. In an era in which we are distracted by transactional opportunities – and not transformative ones – we lose sight of that fact.\n\nWe must ask ourselves where we wish to live. Think of the film “It’s a Wonderful Life.” The larger question of that film is whether we want to live in Bedford Falls, a largely welcoming and friendly town, or Potterville, a dark and hateful place. Most Americans would likely choose the former.\n\nThe only way we get to Bedford Falls is not through argument, but through story, conversation and connection. The novelist Richard Powers says, “The best arguments in the world won’t change a person’s mind. The only thing that can do that is a good story.”\n\nI’m in the business of trying to tell good stories. And my hope is that with each film I make, I move viewers. While I cannot control how they interpret the film, if I succeed, and the story lands some place inside of them, there is the potential for transformation.\n\nThough every story is different, the one commonality among them is really American resilience – how in the face of adversity, much internally-borne, America managed to survive and thrive. And it certainly can again.\n\nTo paraphrase historian Deborah Lipstadt who appears in my latest project, “The U.S. and the Holocaust,” the time to save a democracy is before it is lost – and that requires people paying attention, filtering sources of news and beginning a politics of compromise built on conversation and storytelling now.\n\nKen Burns is an award-winning documentary filmmaker who has been making films for PBS for more than 40 years. He recently released “The U.S. and the Holocaust,” a three-part, six hour series that examines America’s response to the Holocaust.\n\nLiza Donnelly: End ‘my way or the highway’ approach to politics\n\nLiza Donnelly\n\nLiza Donnelly is a cartoonist and writer for The New Yorker and many other publications. Her history, “Very Funny Ladies: The New Yorker’s Women Cartoonists,” was published in 2022.\n\nMark Schmitt: It’s time for multi-party democracy\n\nMark Schmitt New America\n\nTo break the deadly cycle of hyper-partisan polarization that threatens American democracy, we should have a system that creates and supports more viable political parties, simply by allowing parties to cross-endorse candidates.\n\nNotice that I didn’t say that we need a new party. In the current system of winner-take-all elections and single-member congressional districts, just creating a party isn’t enough. A third party’s candidates will often be spoilers, in many cases benefiting the party its voters like least. Instead, we need a system that encourages the formation of one, three or many new and lasting parties that can better represent the complex views of all voters at the local, state and national levels.\n\nWith more than two political parties, some might represent factions of existing parties, such as non-MAGA Republicans or political moderates, while others might try to put particular issues on the agenda, such as universal basic income or marijuana legalization. They would bargain and form coalitions where they agreed – and differ where they didn’t – creating some of the dynamics of a parliamentary democracy.\n\nThere’s just one modest step that could help us move toward that ideal of multi-party democracy: States should allow parties to nominate anyone who is eligible for the office, even if they have already been nominated by another party. This practice, known as “electoral fusion,” would let new parties emerge that might sometimes cross-endorse candidates from one of the major parties, if they agreed with them, sometimes run their own candidates or sometimes stay out of a race altogether.\n\nThey wouldn’t be spoilers unless they chose to be. Using fusion, new parties could influence the two major parties, even if they weren’t yet big enough to win elections on their own. In states with a tradition of fusion, such as New York and Connecticut, the Working Families Party exercises such a role – and other parties have done so in the recent past.\n\nAll but eight states enacted laws to prohibit parties from cross-endorsing candidates – mostly around the turn of the 20th century. Letting parties nominate whomever they want, including a candidate from another party, is just a partial step toward the fluid multi-party democracy we’ve had in the past. But it would restore some of the bargaining and compromise that we’ve been missing for the last several decades.\n\nMark Schmitt is the director of the Political Reform Program at New America, a nonpartisan policy research organization.\n\nCecile Scoon: Each state needs a citizens’ initiative process\n\nCecile Scoon Courtesy Cecile Scoon\n\nThreats to democracy are often examined through a national lens. However, a state approach can help strengthen democracy. For the past 50 years, pursuant to Florida’s state constitution, citizens have had a right to propose constitutional amendments for all Floridians to vote on. This process is called the “citizens’ initiative” process.\n\nThrough this process, Floridians have proposed whether to expand enfranchisement by restoring voting rights to persons who complete felony sentences, protect natural resources and ensure fairness in our political districts. These amendments, which all passed, have helped improve the lives of everyday Floridians and protect core facets of our democracy.\n\nUnfortunately, our state legislature continues to attempt to chip away at our precious citizens’ initiative process by proposing legislation that ultimately seeks an all-out elimination of our ability to propose meaningful constitutional amendments or willfully ignores laws already adopted by voters.\n\nAn instance of this can be easily exemplified. In 2010, more than 60% of Floridians voted for a pair of “fair districts” amendments. These amendments require our legislature to draw nonpartisan redistricting lines and protect minority voting power by prohibiting the diminishment of voting strength for racial or language minorities.\n\nIn 2012, the state legislature blatantly ignored these requirements and passed partisan, gerrymandered maps. After the League of Women Voters of Florida and others sued and won, the Florida Supreme Court upheld these amendments in 2015 and fair maps were enacted.\n\nIn 2022, the Florida legislature has again gutted the same fair districts amendments. Legislators have enacted a map drawn by our governor that cuts minority voting power in half and gives a stark advantage to one political party. The League and others have sued the legislature once more for violating the will of the people. This case is ongoing.\n\nIt is time Florida’s legislators stop ignoring successful citizens’ initiatives and stop attempting to pass laws that further limit the process. Other states without any sort of similar process should consider creating their own to allow the direct voices of the people to be heard.\n\nCecile M. Scoon, a lawyer, is the president of the League of Women Voters of Florida.\n\nYuval Levin: Make Congress actually… work\n\nYuval Levin American Enterprise Institute\n\nThere is no silver bullet for the problems confronting our democracy, but it is crucial to begin by recognizing that the political arena is intended to be a venue for disagreement and contention. Our political system now feels dysfunctional – not because we have forgotten how to agree with each other but because we have forgotten how to disagree constructively. Our two major parties spend too much time talking about each other and not enough time talking to each other.\n\nAt the national level, only Congress can change this. Congress is designed as an arena for productive disagreement, where members who represent the diversity of the American polity can make accommodations and come to agreements on behalf of their disparate constituents. When it works properly, Congress builds common ground in American life.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that Congress does not do this today. And it is hard to see any way we could improve the health of our democracy without helping Congress function better. That could mean creating incentives for people more inclined toward legislative bargaining to run for Congress – for instance by experimenting with electoral reforms like ranked-choice voting. And it could mean reforming the work of the institution to make traditional legislative negotiation more appealing to the ambitious men and women who run for Congress – for instance by re-empowering the committees.\n\nMore specifically, committees in both chambers could be given some direct control of floor time, as happens in some state legislatures, so that the work the committees do wouldn’t feel like a dead end. Or Congress could eliminate the boundary between authorizing bills (which create programs) and appropriating bills (which spend money) so that all members, and not just the few who are appropriators, could be involved in meaningful legislating with real-world consequences.\n\nThere is no shortage of ideas about how to move power from party leaders to rank-and-file legislators, but there has long been a shortage of will. Yes, electoral and congressional reform isn’t exciting work, but it’s essential for the future of our democracy. And we should want our politics to be a little less exciting anyway.\n\nYuval Levin is the director of Social, Cultural, and Constitutional Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, where he also holds the Beth and Ravenel Curry Chair in Public Policy.\n\nMichaela Terenzani: Model the change you wish to see in the world\n\nMichaela Terenzani Courtesy Emanuele Terenzani\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed some 30 years ago, people in Slovakia – my home country – looked to the American model of democracy as they built a new country founded on the principles of rule of law, human rights and civil liberties. The United States even aided those efforts, providing grants, training and exchange programs to guide our democratic efforts.\n\nOf course, Slovakia is far from perfect. It has made mistakes along the way – including in its use of police violence against the Roma minority, which a 2014 State Department report said was a hindrance to its democratic development. But the US has also lost the high ground on this issue, particularly in the wake of George Floyd’s death and other incidents of violence by the police against American minority populations.\n\nSimply put, how can we, Slovaks, accept advice or criticism from Americans, when they seem to be struggling with the same problems – and yet have a democracy that is over 200 years older than ours?\n\nIf the US wants to regain trust abroad – and to continue to inspire young democracies to believe in its form of governance – it needs to lead by example. In the case of police violence, there may not be a simple solution, but the US can put forward solutions.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has taken positive first steps by signing an executive order advancing accountability in the police force and criminal justice system. Congress should follow with a more comprehensive bill that includes specific training, instruction and incentives for law enforcement facing this issue.\n\nAmericans may not realize how much those of us beyond their borders look to the US to lead the democratic world. But it’s a truth worth reminding my American friends. Your country can be imperfect, but it should be at the forefront of putting forward ideas that address those imperfections – and guiding young countries like mine toward becoming more inclusive nations.\n\nMichaela Terenzani is the editor in chief of The Slovak Spectator, Slovakia’s English-language newspaper.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/07/20/trump-campaign-presidential-power-grab-2024-election/70430661007/", "title": "Is America on the brink of tyranny? Trump's plan if elected in 2024 ...", "text": "Austin Sarat and Dennis Aftergut\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nThe New York Times published an article Monday that's bone-chilling for anyone who cherishes our freedom, democracy and constitutional governance. The story recounted, with full cooperation of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, his plans to eliminate executive branch constraints on his power if he is elected president in 2024.\n\nThe obstacles to be eliminated include an independent Justice Department, independent leadership in administrative agencies and an independent civil service. Richard Neustadt, one of the country’s best known students of the American presidency, has said that in a constitutional democracy the chief executive “does not obtain results by giving orders – or not. ... He does not get action without argument. Presidential power is the power to persuade.”\n\nTrump’s plan would substitute loyalty to him for loyalty to the Constitution. This vision is simultaneously frightening and unsurprising. In 2019, he said, “I have to the right to do whatever I want as president.” And in December, Trump called for the “termination of ... the Constitution.”\n\nIn effect, he attempted to do exactly that in the run-up to the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by pressuring state officials to reverse President Joe Biden’s electoral victory, attempting to weaponize the Justice Department and bullying Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election.\n\nTrump now may face federal charges for his role in fomenting the riot.\n\nAnd while he was president, in addition to appointing subservient heads of executive departments, he took steps to increase his control over the regulatory authority of administrative agencies. To cite one example, in 2019, Trump forced climate change researchers in the Department of Agriculture to move from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City, Missouri, producing a huge exodus from federal employment.\n\nIn 2020, he attempted to undermine the independence of the civil service by issuing an executive order adopting “Schedule F.” It purported to vastly augment a president’s power to hire and fire federal officials by expanding the number of “political appointees” throughout government employment who were outside civil service protections.\n\nTrump's plan is to centralize power in Oval Office\n\nThe Times story outlined his 2025 road map to implement this command-and-control model of executive authority and centralization of power if he’s returned to the Oval Office. In effect, the article described how his team would replace our constitutional republic with an authoritarian state.\n\nSuch a state seeks to eliminate the independence of civil servants. Saying good things about bureaucracy may be unpopular, but federal employees' competence, expert judgment and commitment to governance by law is essential to democratic government.\n\nWill heat wave impact politics?Climate change isn't a top issue for Democrats or Republicans. Record heat should change that.\n\nOne definition of an authoritarian state is that it is characterized by the consolidation of power in a single leader, \"a controlling regime that justifies itself as a 'necessary evil.'\" That kind of control necessarily features \"strict government-imposed constraints on social freedoms such as suppression of political opponents and anti-regime activity.\"\n\nThose characteristics describe the contours of the 2025 blueprint that the Trump campaign wanted the public to see via the Times' report. As the story notes, they are setting the stage, if Trump is elected, “to claim a mandate” for the goal of centralizing power in him.\n\nThe Times quoted John McEntee, Trump’s 2020 White House director of personnel, defending the rejection of checks and balances on a president: “Our current executive branch was conceived of by liberals for the purpose of promulgating liberal policies. ... What’s necessary is a complete system overhaul.”\n\nFounders warned about danger of too much presidential power\n\nIn fact, the executive branch, like the two other branches, was devised by the framers of our Constitution, to limit power by dividing it. Even Alexander Hamilton, who defended energy in the executive branch, suggested that the path to tyranny was marked when government officials are “obliged to take refuge in the absolute power of a single man.”\n\nJames Madison joined Hamilton in warning in The Federalist 48 that “power is of an encroaching nature.” For that reason, The Federalist 51 states, “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”\n\nIt described the paradox facing the framers as this: One must “enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.”\n\nTrump’s 2025 blueprint would end governmental control on a president so he can dominate and control the governed.\n\nThe threat is real:Our nuclear weapons are much more powerful than Oppenheimer's atomic bomb\n\nAlong with divided power, the central constraint that our founding documents create is the overarching legal institution known as the rule of law. That is why Trump’s plan for a radical reorganization of the executive branch starts with ending “the post-Watergate norm of Justice Department independence from White House political control.”\n\nControlling the prosecutorial power allows a president to use it to favor friends, destroy enemies and intimidate ordinary citizens tempted to speak out.\n\nThat would sound the death knell of American freedom. As John Locke, the 17th century political philosopher who inspired the authors of the Declaration of Independence, wrote, “Wherever law ends, tyranny begins.” Or as Blake Smith put it in an article in Foreign Policy last year, “The bureaucratic ethos is essential to the functioning of the state and the preservation of private life as a separate, unpolitical domain of tolerated freedom.”\n\nAt the close of America’s first decade as a constitutional republic, George Washington voluntarily chose not to seek a third term as president to avoid setting the country on the road to the tyranny of lifetime rule by a president. He understood from the revolution against a king that retaining the personal power of one person is the central goal of authoritarianism.\n\nIf voters elect Trump president in 2024, he will implement the plan his campaign has purposefully leaked. The outcome is easy to foretell. A bureaucracy purged of those loyal to the Constitution rather than to Trump will send free and fair elections to history’s landfill, along with the Bill of Rights and the freedoms they were designed to protect.\n\nAustin Sarat is the William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts.

Then, later, appointments to high courts and ministries here and there. It may seem insignificant. You may not even hear about it,\" said Turkish journalist Ece Temelkuran, author of \"How to Lose a Country: The 7 Steps from Democracy to Dictatorship.\"\n\n\"Fascism does not walk toward political power in goose steps,\" she added, referring to the straight-legged, stiff-kneed marching steps of soldiers usually performed during military parades and ceremonies and often associated with Nazi Germany.\n\nTemelkuran said her anecdotal impression is that many Americans tend to believe authoritarianism and other forms of threats to democratic freedoms \"can't happen here,\" because of the strength of U.S. democratic institutions. \"There's also some arrogance in it. They think somewhere like Turkey is a crazy country,\" she said.\n\nWhat kind of president is Trump?\n\nIt may not help that there is massive divisiveness over a basic point: What is the most appropriate term to describe President Donald Trump's leadership style?\n\nTrump's supporters cheer an unconventional and gladiatorial figure who they claim defends their conception of American values and interests.\n\nHis critics often use alarming if imprecise words like autocratic (ruler who has absolute power), tyrannical (exercises power in a cruel or arbitrary manner), despotic (rules by brute force), demagogic (exploits emotions and prejudice) and xenophobic (hatred of the foreign or strange).\n\n\"This is fascism at the door,\" Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said of Trump after he chose not to immediately disavow white supremacy groups such as Proud Boys. Trump was directly asked to do so during the first presidential debate with his Democratic rival Joe Biden. The FBI considers Proud Boys, which only admits men, \"to be an extremist group with ties to white nationalism.\"\n\nWho are the Proud Boys?:Far-right group has concerned experts for years\n\nAfter Trump appeared on a White House balcony on Monday night following his release from the hospital where he was being treated for coronavirus and said \"I led\" in regard to COVID-19, historian Anne Applebaum wrote an analysis in The Atlantic magazine in which she drew some parallels to historical scenes involving Italy's fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who loved photo ops.\n\n\"Those staged pictures are what a lot of people want to see, and that false reassurance is what a lot of people want to hear. Don’t underestimate their power,\" wrote Applebaum, the author of \"Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism.\"\n\nHistory offers advice but not necessarily a guide.\n\n\"Some were recalcitrant; some tried not to show how much his favor meant to them; some were openly servile. In a short time, he was surrounded by a court of yes-men who frowned when he frowned or guffawed loudly whenever he deigned to tell a joke,\" the Polish-American poet Czeslaw Milosz wrote in 1951 in his book \"The Captive Mind.\"\n\nMilosz's words were written shortly after he defected from Stalinist-controlled Poland.\n\nThey formed part of Milosz's attempt to explain the rise of totalitarianism (where people are completely subservient to the state) under would-be authoritarians (generally evoked as someone who exerts close and precise control over a repressive and centralized state authority). The latter is a phrase that Trump's detractors have deployed to characterize a president who has refused to rule out staying beyond his legal term, sent unidentifiable federal forces to quell protests, described dissent as foreign interference and who routinely disseminates false and prejudicial information.\n\n(Studies have shown that Trump is the single largest spreader of disinformation related to coronavirus and election topics.)\n\nIn his choice of William Barr as America's top legal officer, Trump appointed an Attorney General who has been prepared to reduce the prison sentence of the president's close ally (Roger Stone) against the objections of U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors, while he has also sought to drop the prosecution of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nWho's going to derail the U.S. election?:The culprit may be close to home\n\nTrump has described Kim Jong Un, a bonafide dictator whose regime has for years presided over gruesome state-sponsored killings and a nationwide famine, as a \"friend.\" Tapes from the journalist Bob Woodward's book \"Rage\" reveal that Trump said he gets along better with foreign autocrats the \"meaner and tougher\" they are.\n\nWays the U.S. is different\n\nStill, it's important to note that the U.S. does not – yet – have a totalitarian system, an authoritarian leader or some other highly abusive and domineering form of government.\n\nThe U.S. has meaningful political participation by citizens. There is freedom of press, speech and religion. A robust political opposition and civil society provide a check on legislation, corruption and government decisions. Power is not so brazenly concentrated that state or federal authorities can demand blind submission. Trump's domestic opponents are not customarily subject to government surveillance or arbitrary detention, notwithstanding protesters in Portland who described being held by federal agents while demonstrating against police violence and racial injustice.\n\nFederal agencies from the CIA to the Environmental Protection Agency regularly challenge Trump. There is a growing cottage industry of former White House staffers who have been free to publish books and articles arguing that Trump's handling of everything from the coronavirus epidemic to his name-calling feuds with allies resembles a curious, chaotic and irrational mix of nihilism and temper tantrums.\n\nNone of these things are wholly true in places such as China, Russia or the Philippines, where strongman leaders exert tight control over political systems.\n\nChina's President Xi Jinping, for example, has defended detaining millions of Muslim minority Uighurs in what many call concentration camps by insisting they are being re-educated with the \"correct\" outlook on China. High-profile critics and rivals of Russian President Vladimir Putin have a tendency to die from poison. President Rodrigo Duterte openly admits – brags, even – about authorizing extrajudicial killings as part of his \"war on drugs\" in the Philippines.\n\nMaria Ressa:Why her fight for free speech and free press should be U.S.'s fight, too\n\nCritics may describe the Trump administration as dysfunctional and even open to abuse by bad actors. But the overall system isn't – as far as we know – maliciously rigged, according to Leonard Benardo, vice president of the Open Society Foundations, an organization that promotes democracy and human rights.\n\nIn the U.S. there are still, Benardo added, \"fundamental democratic institutions that have been able to present those kinds of excesses from happening. We don't have people in the U.S. being 'disappeared' by the state\" or other unrestrained strong-arm tactics.\n\nCase in point: After Trump cast doubt on the transition, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell vowed that there would be an \"orderly\" transfer of U.S. presidential power in January as there has been since 1792.\n\n\"The U.S. is not on the brink of authoritarianism,\" said Ian Bremmer, the founder of the global political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, in a recent tweet.\n\nIn fact, according to Salvatore Babones, an American-born expert on authoritarianism at Australia's University of Sydney, Trump is, if anything, anti-authoritarian.\n\n\"It's probably more reasonable to call him dictatorial,\" he said. \"You can't be an authoritarian when you disrespect all major bases of traditional authority,\" Babones said, referring to Trump's unconventional and unpredictable leadership approach on issues ranging from national security to campaigning.\n\nHowever, Babones noted that Trump is dictatorial only in the sense that he appears to \"simply dictate his policies,\" usually via Twitter, rather than arriving at them through discussion. He does not have absolute power without any constitutional limitations.\n\n\"I would not say he is a dictator. A dictator does not have to satisfy a Congress.\"\n\nBabones added that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the only president to serve more than two terms, was also dictatorial in his governance style.\n\n\"He refused to step down. He threatened to pack the courts. The difference is that the American establishment liked his policies. So for many, he's not viewed that way.\"\n\nWays the U.S. is not so different\n\nJason Stanley, a Yale University philosophy professor and author of \"How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them,\" published in 2018, goes one step farther.\n\n\"Trump believes only in himself as an authority. It's called the 'Führer principle,'\" he said, a reference to the machinery of state that oversaw Hitler's Third Reich – commonly understood as an ironclad belief in the infallibility of the leader's words and deeds. It led to the most extreme and calculated extermination campaign against a people in history.\n\n\"Fascists target racial minorities and immigrants. They use the police in political ways. We are seeing all this with Trump,\" Stanley said. \"We need to focus less on what the right word is to describe him and more on the consequences of his actions.\"\n\nIn addition to Trump's refusal to commit to providing a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election, the president has also encouraged his supporters to monitor Election Day polling places for instances of fraud – a federal crime if they are not there in an official capacity – raising fears of potential voter intimidation, violence and disorder more generally.\n\nThe number of Americans who feel they would be justified in using violence to achieve their political goals has increased sharply from 8% in 2017 to 33% today, and three-in-four Americans believe there will be violence following the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to YouGov, an online market research firm.\n\nAlthough Trump subsequently said his words during the debate with Biden were misinterpreted when he told the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by,\" and he later also said he condemned all white supremacists, the group itself took his original remarks to be a tacit endorsement of their violent tactics if the election doesn't go his way, according to messages on the group's messaging channel.\n\nInternational evidence that the U.S. should not be content to rest on its democratic laurels, that it too could be susceptible to the slow erosion of personal and democratic freedoms, is not difficult to find, according Benardo, of the Open Society Foundations, an organization founded by the Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros.\n\nHungary: Hitting media, judicial system and immigrants\n\nA decade ago, when Orbán came to power in Hungary the country was still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crisis and relatively recent ascension to European Union membership. Since then Orbán has slowly but aggressively consolidated his executive power and critics say the country is now a democracy in name only.\n\nDuring this time Orbán has gutted the country's civil service, redrawn electoral maps, appointed friendly judges, installed party loyalists to key watchdog posts in the media and promoted a version of Hungarian ethnic identity that is white, Christian and vehemently opposed to taking in refugees who, he claims, threaten \"our way of life.\"\n\nThe impact has been widespread but also specific.\n\n\"I was cornered and cut off from everything,\" said Béla Lakatos, a former member of Orbán's party and mayor of a small town who specialized in minority issues.\n\nLakatos, who is ethnically Roma, a minority group long discriminated against in Hungary, said he quit his position in disgust over the Hungarian government's immigration and Roma policies and was instantly targeted by online trolls and government-controlled media who accused him of beating up children and other crimes.\n\nHe also believes that he was effectively blacklisted from finding work as a school teacher, his profession before he worked for the government.\n\n\"(Orbán) has been peddling the same stories in the countryside since 2015: Brown and Black people will come and steal your chicken and rape your wife,\" he said, noting that the government has created a culture of fear where lying has become routine and where many are afraid to speak out over concerns for their careers and reputations.\n\nOpen Society Foundations shut its office in Hungary in 2018, leaving behind what it called \"an increasingly repressive political and legal environment.\" Soros, who is Jewish, has become a bogeyman for unfounded conspiracy theories, anti-semitic tropes and attacks by U.S. right-wing groups. Trump himself has pushed claims that Soros funds antifa, the radical left-wing political movement. Orbán rejects accusations of Hungary's authoritarianism as \"fake news\" spread by his political opponents, including Soros.\n\nTrump isn't the only one who wants to built a wall. These nations already did\n\nPoland: 'Horrible intolerances ... now articulated freely'\n\nIn nearby Poland, President Andrzej Duda and the powerful leader of his ruling Law and Justice party, Jarosław Kaczyński, have slowly dismantled many democratic checks and balances by filling the ranks of the nation's courts with loyal judges.\n\nThe Law and Justice Party has tightened the government's grip on state institutions and companies including the media, increased its powers to spy on its citizens and imposed new taxes on those who oppose socially conservative measures such as keeping gay marriage illegal, strict immigration laws and a proposed near-total ban on abortion in a country that already has some of Europe's most restrictive reproductive laws.\n\n\"Poland has become a place where horrible intolerances, whether anti-semitism or racism, are now articulated freely in the street,\" said Mateusz Klinowski, a law professor and former mayor of Wadowice, the birthplace of Pope John Paul II.\n\nIn 2019, Paweł Adamowicz , a friend of Klinowski's and the mayor of the Polish city of Gdansk who espoused liberal causes including giving refuge to asylum seekers at odds with Poland's conservative nationalist government, was assassinated by a former convict during an annual charity event. Klinowski has been stalked.\n\nTurkey: Jailing journalists\n\nTemelkuran, the writer from Turkey, left her country in 2016 after a failed military coup attempt against Erdoğan that led to tens of thousands of soldiers, police and civil servants being dismissed or suspended from their jobs, and thousands jailed.\n\nA little over a decade ago, Turkey was in serious talks to join the EU. Today, political opposition in Turkey has been so severely curtailed that it is too dangerous for Temelkuran and other outspoken journalists to return and Erdoğan has transformed his presidential power into an unassailable force that allows him to make law by decree.\n\nTemelkuran noted that Trump started questioning the perceived sacrosanctity of U.S. institutions and norms from the FBI to the courts right after he was elected. She said she was keeping an open mind about what this relatively quickened trajectory could eventually mean for American political culture compared to that of Turkey's and others', where tangible declines in democracy took several years to materialize.\n\nTurkey coup: One year later, country bitterly divided as crackdown continues\n\nBrazil: Undermining educated experts\n\nIn Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro was elected on a platform to reduce crime and corruption and strengthen the economy. He's spent the last few years trying to roll back the nation's democratic order established after its military dictatorship ended in 1985.\n\nBolsonaro has tried to appoint military leaders to important civilian posts, undermined Brazil's Supreme Court, accused environmental groups of deliberately starting wildfires in the Amazon and downplayed the gravity of coronavirus infections to deadly effect. He tried, but failed, to get his son nominated to be Brazil's ambassador to the U.S.\n\nBrazil’s leader fired his minister of health for advocating social-distancing measures.\n\nBrazil's Jair Bolsonaro followed Trump’ coronavirus blueprint. Cases are surging\n\nIndia: Attacking a minority Muslim population\n\nSix years of rule by Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narenda Modi has relentlessly marginalized India's Muslims.\n\n\"Sometimes they ignored you, sometimes they might criticize you. Post-2014, social media now questions me and my religious identity before they question my work,\" said Arfa Khanam Sherwani, a senior editor at The Wire, an Indian news and opinion website.\n\nIn addition to violence in Kashmir, a religion-based citizenship law was introduced that fast-tracks citizenship for religious minorities from three neighboring nations but excludes Muslims.\n\n\"First, I am discredited for being a Muslim, then for being a woman and only then as someone who criticizes the government,\" Sherwani said.\n\nBack to U.S.\n\nStill, in the U.S. context, Michael Ignatieff, a U.S.-educated, Canadian-born former politician, historian and president of the Soros-founded Central European University, said he sees an \"alarmist rhetoric about fascism and authoritarianism\" and connecting it to Trump that is not only counterproductive but leading to increased hysteria. Last year Central European University was forced to move all of its U.S. degree courses from Budapest to Vienna because of Orbán's crackdown on academic freedoms in Hungary.\n\n\"The problem in America is extreme polarization. I don't see it as incipient fascism. And I don't see it as a collapse of countervailing institutions,\" he said. \"Fascism is not just any politics you don't like. Fascism is the explicit use of political violence, hitting people, killing people, knocking people over, invading an assembly with armed thugs.\"\n\nIgnatieff added: \"What matters is that the 2020 results are respected.\"\n\nContributing: Szabolcs Panyi in Budapest, Hungary", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/28/us/eric-liu-american-democracy-resilient-cec/index.html", "title": "Why Eric Liu says it's too soon to write off democracy in America | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\n“You are more powerful than you think.”\n\nThat’s the title of one of Eric Liu’s most popular books, but it’s also a theme that runs throughout the work of the author and activist. He’s spent much of his life trying to persuade people that “democracy still works, and is worth believing in.”\n\nLiu, 54, is CEO and co-founder of Citizen University, a nonprofit group based in Seattle, Washington, that teaches people how to cultivate civic power. He also is an evangelist for democracy, a charismatic writer and speaker whose philosophy could be distilled in this observation from the late historian Howard Zinn: “Democracy is not what governments do; it’s what people do.”\n\n“I am a Democrat, but I am not a partisan for my party. I am a partisan for democracy,” Liu told CNN.\n\nLiu’s optimism may seem misplaced today. One recent poll found that 64% of Americans believe their democracy is “in crisis and at risk of failing.” Another recent poll found 72% of Americans say the US used to be a good model of democracy, but not in recent years. More than half of Americans now say they expect a civil war to erupt in the near future.\n\nBut where some see chaos, Liu sees vitality. He says engaged citizens get angry; apathetic and cynical citizens don’t make noise. And amid anxieties about Russian aggression and an emboldened China, Liu says America’s tumultuous political climate is not a weakness but a strength.\n\nEric Liu says the true power to remake society rests with ordinary people, not politicians or courts. Jared Soares/The New York Times/Redux\n\nIn “Become America: Civic Sermons on Love, Responsibility and Democracy,” Liu wrote:\n\n“American history is a record of small groups of people who keep remaking this country over and over, and who reveal to us all that the perpetual remaking is the greatest statement of fidelity to our creed and our national purpose, which is not to be like Russia, white and stagnant and oligarchic, or like China, monoethnic and authoritarian and centralized, but to be more like America, hybrid and dynamic and democratic and free to be remade.”\n\nLiu is the son of immigrants and a former White House speechwriter and policy adviser for President Bill Clinton. A popular TED Talk speaker (he calls his speeches “civic sermons”), he also conducts “Civic Saturday” events around the country at which people gather for music and spoken-word performances.\n\nThese include readings of “civic scripture,” foundational American documents such as Lincoln’s “Second Inaugural Address” and the speech the 19th-century women’s rights activist Susan B. Anthony gave when she was put on trial for attempting to vote.\n\nLiu is currently working on a new book, “What an American Should Know,” which seeks to detail the core civic knowledge all Americans should possess in this polarized era.\n\nCNN recently talked with Liu about why he remains optimistic about America’s future, how the move to censor history in public schools could backfire and his response to those who say they want to Make America Great Again. His comments were edited for brevity.\n\nOne sign of democratic decay is when most citizens don't vote because they are too apathetic or cynical, Eric Liu says. Seth Herald/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Rep. James Clyburn recently said it seems as if most Americans have given up on the pursuit of a more perfect union and that our democracy is in danger of “imploding.” What would you say to those who say that human beings are too tribal to make a multiracial democracy work in America?\n\nI would say when you succumb to cynicism you give it power. What we are doing is hard because it is unprecedented. We are trying to be planet Earth’s first multiracial, multicultural, and multifaith democratic republic at scale. That hasn’t existed before. To those who conclude it’s not possible, I would say it’s too early to say that. And by saying that, you’re dooming the project.\n\nThe only way to determine whether this project is possible is to act as if it’s possible — that is, to commit over and over again to become that country we’d like to see.\n\nYou’ve talked about the power of stories before. “Make America Great Again” seems like such an effective political slogan because there’s a story wrapped in it that implies that this country was once great when White Americans dominated and that people like Donald Trump are going to restore it to greatness. What kind of counter-story can those who have a different vision of America tell that address the fears of some White Americans?\n\nThe most simple and potent story to tell is, ‘We’re all better off when we’re all better off.’ This country will be the most competitive and powerful in the world when every fit and able competitor can participate — PS, everyone is potentially a fit competitor. The more of us that can participate, the stronger we are as a country.\n\nThe Make American Great Again slogan is effective because it demands a response from Americans who see the country's greatness in its future, not in its past, some say. Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe narrative of Make American Great Again assumes that America once was great for everybody, something went wrong and now you have to fix it. But I would say that the story of we’re all better off when we’re all better off also contains some assumptions, and the assumption is, we haven’t yet had a country that felt great for everybody, and when we do it will be great for everybody.\n\nBut the other assumption embedded in this second story line is that life is not zero-sum, that if people of color can enjoy opportunities, rights, and privileges in the same way that White Americans have always been able to do, that will not diminish the opportunities that White Americans have. It will actually enlarge the pie, not divvy it up.\n\nIs there anything from our country’s history to back up what you said, that we are all better off when we’re all better off?\n\nI would point to most institutions in the United States. I’m a baseball guy. The institution of major league baseball is stronger, healthier and more robust now that it includes players beyond White players. It’s a more thriving business.\n\nEvery Fortune 500 company is stronger, more resilient and with a deeper capacity for innovation and more widespread, diversified markets because the United States has moved into full economic citizenship, and economic power for people of color, as well as White Americans.\n\nThe military is another great example. Every chief of staff in each of the uniformed services will tell you that their service is stronger and more resilient and more adaptative and more capable because America is more diverse now. They didn’t think in zero-sum terms. They didn’t think starting in 1950 that if we desegregate the army there’s not going to be enough slots for White people in the army.\n\nThe US military has long been one of the most integrated institutions in America. The military grew stronger by becoming more diverse, and so can other institutions, Liu says. Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images\n\nThe military seems like one of the last institutions where all of these different Americans come together from all walks of life. How do we create more spaces like that for people in the US?\n\nI’m a champion of national service. It would be great to have more widespread expectation of national service for young people. I’m a champion of a year in the civilian or the military service, where you are coming together with a group of people unlike yourself, of having to work on something together to deepen your appreciation for one another and for the breadth, beauty and the diversity of our country.\n\nSome White parents and Republican legislators are campaigning against what they call “woke schooling” in public classrooms. School boards and teachers are being pressured not to teach history that they say shames people. If this battle against “wokeism” in public schools is successful, what will the end result be?\n\nThe result will be a citizenry that is less capable of self-government. An education that forces every student to avoid the uncomfortable parts, to steer clear of anything that might cause White students discomfort, is going to leave all students more emotionally brittle, more civically weak and less capable of governing themselves.\n\nThe point of public education is to make citizens capable together of living together in a diverse community. If all you’ve gotten is white-washed history and that everybody was a good guy and don’t talk about stuff that makes some people uncomfortable, then the minute you graduate and walk into a community where there are people with different views, and where there are bad things that have persisted since the beginning our country that have gone acknowledged, when you walk into the real world outside of the classroom, you are less capable of participating in democracy.\n\nThat kind of forced indoctrination is more befitting China than America. It’s more befitting a country that wants top-down indoctrination of correct thought other than viewpoint diversity.\n\nEfforts to ban the teaching of US history, such as this protest against the alleged teaching of critical race theory in schools, will weaken democracy, Liu says. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nI’ve heard you talk about the difference between optimism and hope. Why do you choose hope over optimism ?\n\nOptimism is a spectator’s posture. I’m optimistic that the Yankees are going to pull out of this funk and win the World Series. But I have nothing to do with whether that comes to pass. I’m just watching. Hope implies agency. Hope says I have something to do with the outcome.\n\nI have hope that American democracy is going to pull out of this funk, and it becomes stronger and more adaptive for all. Why do I have that hope? Because I literally spend every waking moment working on that with people in every part of the country who are not famous or who might not have a million followers but are doing the work of holding a community together.\n\nWhen you look back on the Jan. 6 insurrection and all the recent headlines, have you ever lost hope?\n\nI have not lost hope, ever.\n\nReally? Not even for a day?\n\nNot even for a day. Are there days where I’m tired? Yes. Are there days where I wonder if what I’m doing is enough? You bet. But that’s a long distance from losing hope.\n\nOnce you get started working with other people — yes, vote, read the news, pay attention —but the most important thing you can do is join a club. Join a group, and build that muscle of being in association with other people.\n\nAnd once you get involved with other people in trying to make something happen for some common purpose — it could be a civic purpose, it could be a hobby like building a book club — you realize how hard it is to kill hope.\n\nHope dies fastest when you are alone, when you are isolated and cut off from other people. But hope is a hard thing to kill when you are not alone.\n\nEric Liu says there are civic scriptures that every citizen should know. Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural address, pictured here, is a classic speech extolling the healing of a divided nation. General Photographic Agency/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nHow much of your activism is shaped by being the child of immigrants? (Liu’s parents were born in China and moved to the US from Taiwan).\n\nAlmost everything I do civically is shaped by the fact that I am the child of immigrants. When you’re second-generation American, it’s very vivid seeing how much most Americans take for granted. When you’re one generation removed from not having any of the rights and privileges of Americans, you realize how fragile and precious these things are.\n\nAnd by these things, I mean our Constitution, but I also mean a culture in which we create constant remixes and churn out new hybrids of music, food and song and bloodline — everything that happens here that doesn’t happen in other places.\n\nAmericans who were born here stop thinking about that. It’s just the water you swim in.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nEditor’s Note: This story, which was originally published on January 8, has been updated.\n\nAfter many repeated urgent warnings about the state of American democracy, there were several requests in the What Matters inbox for something more useful than a warning.\n\nWhat’s the average citizen supposed to do about it?\n\nI asked a politician, an activist and a professor who studies democracy back in January. And there were some interesting thoughts from Karl Rove, too. It all still rings true as Americans approach their first national election since the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nVote, protest and connect\n\nBarbara Walter is a professor at the University of California San Diego and wrote the book, “How Civil Wars Start and How to Stop Them.”\n\nShe’s among those who have warned the country’s democracy is in a dangerous place.\n\nWhen I asked her what everyday Americans could do to protect democracy, she sent back a thoughtful and lengthy email, which I’ll boil down to a few key points.\n\nVote. Even in presidential elections, there are millions of Americans not taking part in the democratic process. The share of nonvoters is even larger in midterm elections, and larger still at the local level.\n\n“If they voted it would perhaps change the makeup of Congress and break the minority’s hold on power in many places,” Walter said.\n\nProtest. Walter pointed to research from Harvard University and argued that nonviolent protest is an effective tool for change.\n\n“It would be very, very hard for politicians to refuse to reform our democracy if even 3% of Americans continued to protest in the street until changes were made,” Walter said. “Americans did that during the civil rights era, when citizens demanded equal rights and freedoms for African Americans, and the government responded, satisfying a desire for equity and justice.”\n\nConnect. It’s this last thought that caught my attention. Walter shared an excerpt from her book in which she argues Americans need to reclaim and mediate public discourse so we can “get off the path of self-segregating, predatory factionalism and restore hope in the long-term health of our country.” She offered examples of local groups across the country trying to get people talking to each other.\n\n“Americans have begun to realize how fragile our democracy is and take action to preserve it,” Walter said. “It is at the local level – in churches, voluntary associations and grassroots groups – that we can once again come together and relearn the power of citizenship and community.”\n\nGet engaged\n\nThere are plenty of activist groups looking to bring more Americans into the political process. RepresentUs is a group that vows to fight corruption at the federal level and enact laws at the local level.\n\n“Keep informed with multiple credible news sources, and participate in the conversations happening in your community,” RepresentUS CEO Joshua Graham Lynn told me in an email.\n\nThere are plenty of reports on the kinds of civil servants, poll workers and volunteers who make democracy run being targeted and quitting.\n\n“If you see your local election officials, school boards, poll workers and other guardians of democracy under attack, show up to support them. That can be anything from sending a quick email of support to going to community meetings,” Lynn said.\n\nI’ll add here that you can call your local election office and see if there are positions that need filling. We know from Steve Bannon that Trump supporters are looking to get into as many election-related positions as possible.\n\n“In this period of heightened anxiety, it can be tempting to tune out the world. But we truly need all hands on deck to make sure our democracy doesn’t crumble,” said Lynn.\n\nDon’t generalize. Accept facts.\n\nBeing respectful and honest is not, and should not be, partisan.\n\nIn the Wall Street Journal, the Republican spinmeister Karl Rove wrote that Democrats and Republicans have responsibilities to truth and civility.\n\nStop generalizing about Republicans. Democrats, he said, need to resist the “petty habit of aggravating partisan fault lines by indiscriminately condemning all who came to Washington that day.”\n\nAccept facts. Proving the point that Democrats need to separate Republicans of goodwill from those who stormed the Capitol, he admitted his own party has more work to do.\n\nI was shocked to see these words come from Rove:\n\n“I’ve been a Republican my entire life, and believe in what the Republican Party, at its best, has represented for decades. There can be no soft-pedaling what happened and no absolution for those who planned, encouraged and aided the attempt to overthrow our democracy. Love of country demands nothing less. That’s true patriotism.”\n\nRespect one another\n\nFormer Ohio Gov. John Kasich, now a CNN contributor, is a Republican who has been critical of Trump and ran against him in the 2016 Republican presidential primary.\n\nHe’s acknowledged the threat of January 6, and when I asked him what everyday Americans should do to protect democracy, he had a ready answer:\n\n“The most important thing that we can do as individuals is to recognize the intrinsic value of all other people – even people we don’t like, people we don’t agree with, people we fight with, maybe people that we get so angry we insult.”\n\nI pushed him on how that helps save democracy.\n\n“Because then people have, you know, we have a set of expectations.”\n\nWe then veered into an anecdote about him having to accept a friend who has chosen not to get the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\n“It’s very frustrating and it makes some of us angry that he won’t do it. OK, but at the basic level, I care about him and I respect him as a human being.”\n\nI did not follow the link between Covid-19 and democracy, and the conversation seemed to agitate Kasich, who said there is no surface-level answer.\n\n“I know you’re looking for some pithy little line here. I’m giving it to you,” he said. “Until we all begin to recognize the intrinsic value of all human beings, we are going to continue to erode and have danger in our culture and in the … strength of our country.”", "authors": ["Zachary B.

That’s when patriots fired “the shot heard around the world,” taking on the mightiest army of their era to preserve the birth of democracy in America.\n\nUkrainians are now building their own monuments to democracy, with their blood. For more than a week, the world has been transfixed by their battle to repel the mighty Russian army and preserve the birth of democracy in their homeland.\n\nIn recent days stories of Ukrainian courage have also been heard around the world: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turning down an offer to evacuate him from the country by saying, “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride”; the besieged defenders of Snake Island who told a Russian warship to “go f**k yourself”; the images of Ukrainian civilians making Molotov cocktails and carrying assault rifles while heading to the front lines.\n\n“Each passing day adds more stories that Ukrainians will tell not only in the dark days ahead, but in the decades and generations to come,” the author and historian Yuval Noah Harari said in a recent essay. “This is the stuff nations are built from. In the long run, these stories count more than tanks.”\n\nMembers of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Force in Kyiv prep their weapons to defend themselves against Russian forces on February 26. Mikhail Palinchak/AP\n\nBut here’s another reason why the Ukraine struggle is so inspiring:\n\nThis is also the stuff that built the US.\n\nThe war in Ukraine isn’t just a geopolitical struggle – it’s a call to remember. The courage of the Ukrainian people is a reminder of what the US used to be – a “beacon of liberty,” where virtually every schoolchild memorized the “Concord Hymn” poem inscribed at the base of the Minute Man statue.\n\nThe Ukrainians are teaching Americans two lessons about democracy that many of us have forgotten.\n\nLesson 1: The most ferocious defenders of democracy are those who have been denied it\n\nUkrainian’s democratic tradition bears little comparison to the US at first glance. The country has been independent for only 31 years.\n\nAnd it’s not clear that everyone opposing Russia is fighting for liberal democracy in Ukraine. There’s evidence that ultra-nationalists and far-right groups are part of the armed Ukraine resistance.\n\nUkraine also borders Russia, an oppressive regime that has installed puppet governments in the country before. The country is familiar with brutal leaders imposing their will on its people. The Russian dictator Joseph Stalin caused the deaths of nearly 4 million Ukrainians in the 1930s by engineering a famine. The German invasion of Ukraine in World War II led to the deaths of an estimated seven million people.\n\nBut that history of brutality is partly why so many Ukrainians are willing to fight so hard for democracy.\n\nFreedom tastes sweeter for those who have never had it.\n\nThis is the same dynamic that helped make the US.\n\nMembers of the Japanese-American 442nd Infantry Regiment stand at attention while their citations are read in France on November 12, 1944, during World War II. U.S. Army Signal Corps/AP\n\nThe most fervent believers in American democracy tend to come from groups that have been denied liberty and equality – either in the US or from their country of origin.\n\nThe first martyr in the fight for American independence was a runaway slave named Crispus Attucks, shot by British redcoats during the Boston Massacre.\n\nThe most decorated unit in US military history was a Japanese American regiment that fought during World War II. These “Nisei” soldiers volunteered for combat though they came from families that had their property confiscated and were placed in internment camps by the US government.\n\nThe first people who made a genuine democracy a reality in the US were Black civil rights marchers in Selma, Alabama, and other Southern cities. They forced the US to abandon its neo-apartheid political system by pushing Congress to pass the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n\nYou can’t talk about exclusion in the US without mentioning immigrants. The country’s history is filled with spasms of intolerance and raw racism directed at immigrants. And yet many immigrants outwork, outvote and outfight many native-born Americans.\n\nUkrainian militia members set up anti-tank barricades in Kyiv on March 2. Timothy Fadek/Redux for CNN\n\nOne in five Medal of Honor winners have been immigrants. Immigrants are nearly twice as likely to start businesses as native-born Americans. Nearly half of all Fortune 500 companies – including Apple, Google and Amazon – were founded by immigrants or their children.\n\nMany of these immigrants left countries run by dictators and convulsed by civil wars and political violence because of one American trait: Our democratic ideas.\n\n“Since World War II, that has been the single most important driver of American influence and power,” said Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, in a recent interview. “Yes, we have a big military. Yes, we have a strong economy. But it’s our ideas that attract others. Russia under Putin doesn’t really have that power of attraction. He only has the power of coercion, and we are seeing that now in Ukraine in a brutal way.”\n\nLesson 2: Ordinary people are the true heroes of democracy\n\nWhen a CNN crew recently interviewed Ukrainan President Zelensky in a bunker in Kyiv, the country’s capital, he said something that was revelatory.\n\nA journalist asked him what it was like to go from being a comic actor to becoming a globally acclaimed wartime leader. But Zelensky was not interested in adding to the Western praise of his charismatic leadership.\n\n“I’m not iconic,” he said. “I think Ukraine is iconic.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has received global acclaim for his couragous leadership during the Russian invasion. CNN\n\nIt’s the kind of statement that would have made the “embattled farmers” who fought at Concord during the Revolutionary War nod in recognition. Ordinary people, not charismatic leaders, sustain democracy. This was an abiding belief throughout US history.\n\nThere was a time when most young men were expected to join the military or go into government as part of some form of public service. This expectation also applied to the wealthy and the famous. That’s part of the reason why former president George H.W. Bush, the grandson of a steel industrialist and scion of a wealthy family, enlisted as a fighter pilot in World War II.\n\nActor Jimmy Stewart turned down an offer to stay stateside as a flight instructor and volunteered for combat duty as a US Army Air Force pilot. He flew 20 bombing missions in harrowing combat conditions, an experience he rarely talked about after the war.\n\nThis attitude, though, wasn’t confined to World War II. It was there at the nation’s beginning. It was Nathan Hale, an American Revolutionary War officer, who reputedly said, “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.”\n\nAnd it wasn’t confined to the military. There’s a generation of Americans who entered the Peace Corps because of what President John F. Kennedy declared at his 1960 inaugural address:\n\n“Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can for your country.”\n\nWhen asked what he learned from studying US history, historian Howard Zinn once said, “Democracy is not what governments do; it’s what people do, too.”\n\nCivil rights protesters arrive in Montgomery, Alabama, on March 29, 1965, after their march from Selma to seek expanded voting rights. Central Press/Getty Images\n\nHis message: Don’t depend on saviors.\n\n“Don’t depend on the founding fathers, on Andrew Jackson, on Theodore Roosevelt, on Lyndon Johnson, on Obama,” Zinn said. “Don’t depend on our leaders to do what needs to be done, because whenever the government has done anything to bring about change, it’s done so only because it’s been pushed and prodded by social movements, by ordinary people organizing.\n\n“Lincoln was pushed by the antislavery movement,” he added. “Johnson and Kennedy were pushed by the Southern Black movement…”\n\nThis power of ordinary people is what Zelensky evoked when he released a taped appeal to the Russian and Ukrainian people before Russia’s invasion. He said there was one group that could ultimately prevent war: “Regular people. Regular, normal people.”\n\nIt’s a lesson many contemporary Americans have seem to have forgotten. Our political discourse is driven by searches for a savior: a charismatic leader who will vanquish the other side; a pivotal Supreme Court appointment that will finally “take back” the country, a commentator who will “destroy” opponents on TV.\n\nMany have stopped believing that ordinary people can change anything because of political gridlock.\n\nThe spirit of democracy in the US feels like it’s under siege\n\nMore Americans even now doubt the power of their democratic ideas. One recent poll showed that 64% of Americans believe their democracy is “in crisis and at risk of failing.” Another recent poll found 72% of Americans say the US used to be a good model of democracy for other countries to follow but has not been in recent years.\n\nIt’s not as if the democratic spirit has been extinguished in the US. The 2020 presidential election was held during a pandemic but saw the highest voter turnout in a century. The nationwide protests after the murder of George Floyd that same year have been described as the largest movement in the country’s history. And there was a palpable hope early in 2020 that the pandemic would bring Americans together.\n\nBut that burst of civic participation was followed by 19 states passing voter restriction laws. The pandemic became a political wedge issue. And the US still lags behind most developed nations when it comes to voter turnout.\n\nToday it’s Ukranians – not Americans – who are embodying Kennedy’s exhortation: They’re asking what they can do for their country, not the other way around.\n\nVitali Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, right, and his brother Wladimir Klitschko, also a former boxing champion, have vowed to help defend Ukraine against Russia. Efrem Lukatsky/AP\n\nUkrainian citizens are blocking Russian tanks with their bodies. Ukrainians are leaving safety and well-paying jobs in Europe to go fight for their homeland. Famous figures like Ukrainian boxer Vasiliy Lomachenko, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, are giving up lucrative paydays to go home and join a defense battalion. Ukrainian tennis star Sergiy Stakhovsky left his wife and their three young children in Hungary to join the fight in his homeland.\n\nAnd now Americans and other foreign fighters are traveling to Ukraine to defend the country.\n\nThese stories don’t just inspire, they force people in the West to reexamine our cynicism, Tom McTague wrote in a recent Atlantic essay.\n\nMcTague said the US and Western Europe have lost their sense of being a force for moral good and taking on heroic struggles in the cause of freedom. Instead we follow cynical opportunists in shows like “Succession” and “Billions” and pragmatic, cautious leaders who lack any overt idealism, he said.\n\nUkraine changes that, McTague said. One of the reasons why Zelensky reduced hardened politicians – and even a translator – to tears in his appeals to freedom is because “Western countries don’t have this type of leadership anymore: unembarrassed, defiant belief in a cause.”\n\nResidents of Uzhhorod, Ukraine, prepare Molotov cocktails to defend their city on February 27 after Russia launched a massive military operation against Ukraine. Serhii Hudak/Reuters\n\nIn standing up to Putin, McTague wrote, “Ukraine is articulating a certain idea of itself that is righteous and dignified and heroic – virtues we long ago dismissed as old-fashioned. How tragic it is that Zelensky’s idea has to be attacked for us to be reminded of ours.”\n\nIt would be more tragic if Americans could no longer remember the ideas we stand for at all.\n\nOur country’s history is filled with brutality. It is also riddled with hypocrisies. Yet that’s why monuments like the Minute Man still stand. They remind us of who we are at our best, that democracy is something worth fighting, and dying for.\n\nUkrainians know that. We used to know that.\n\nTheir story echoes our story.\n\nLet us not forget.", "authors": ["John Blake"], "publish_date": "2022/03/06"}]}

While the Democratic Party is expected to coalesce behind President Biden, who has already announced his reelection bid, the Republican side remains more of a toss-up. Former President Trump is leading in the polls, but plenty of other GOP hopefuls have thrown their hat in the ring.\n\nAmid the uncertainty surrounding the next presidential election, one thing is for sure – on the first Tuesday of November 2024, the public will again be faced with a choice: Who best represents the country? Here's what you should know:\n\nWho's running for president in 2024?Meet the Democratic and Republican candidates running\n\nWhen is the next presidential election?\n\nNov. 5, 2024. Presidential elections are held in the United States every four years.\n\nU.S. law dictates that federal elections be held \"the Tuesday next after the 1st Monday in November.\" Presidential and congressionalmidterm elections are always held in even-numbered years (e.g. 2016, 2018, 2020.)\n\nWhen is the Republican primary?A guide to the 2024 schedule\n\nWho is running for president in 2024?\n\nA Trump-Biden rematch may be in order for 2024: both candidates have announced they are running.\n\nThe GOP field is more crowded with former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and several others running to unseat Trump as the de-facto leader of the party.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Biden is likely to be his party's nominee, but Marianne Williamson, and Dean Phillips have also entered the race.\n\nHere's a full down of who's running in 2024.\n\nWhen is the Democratic primary?Here's a state-by-state guide to the 2024 schedule\n\nIs Trump running in 2024?\n\nYes.\n\nIn an event at his Mar-A-Lago beach club on Nov. 15, the former president announced his plans to run. His campaign has filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission confirming those plans.\n\nIs Biden running in 2024?\n\nYes.\n\nBiden's long-awaited announcement came early the morning of April 25 with a three-minute video indicating the President planned to run for a second term. \"Let's finish this job I know we can,\" Biden says in the clip.\n\nWhen did Biden take office?\n\nBiden was sworn into office Jan. 20, 2021.\n\nThe inauguration date is the same with each presidential election, taking place the 20th of January – as required by the U.S. Constitution which set the date in 1933.\n\nWhen was Joe Biden elected?\n\nThe last presidential election was Nov. 3, 2020.\n\nWhile this was ultimately the election that made Joe Biden president, his win was not confirmed by most mainstream media outlets until Nov. 7, after four days of vote counting.\n\nHow often is there a vote for a new president?\n\nAmericans vote for a new president every four years, as outlined in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThat vote does not always result in a ''new'' president, of course. There have been many presidentswho served more than one four-yearterm. In fact, before presidents were limited to eight years in office,President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected four times. He served three consecutive terms in the White House before dying on April 12, 1945, in the middle of his fourth.\n\nHow old is Joe Biden?

And in 2024 that will likely leave control of the White House in the hands of a very small number of states that are themselves divided almost exactly in half between the parties – a list that looks even smaller after this month’s outcomes.\n\nStanley Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster, speaks for many strategists in both parties when he points to the enormous “continuity among the elections” since Donald Trump emerged as a national figure. “We’ve now gone through 2016, ’18, ‘20 and ‘22 – and all looked pretty much alike,” he says. “And it has locked in the coalitions.”\n\nLooking at the Electoral College, this year’s results offered more reason for optimism to Democrats than Republicans. Five states decided the last presidential race by flipping from Trump in 2016 to Joe Biden in 2020 – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Democrats have already won six of the eight Senate and governor races decided across them this month and could notch a seventh victory if Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock defeats Herschel Walker in a Georgia run-off in December.\n\n“Republicans can’t be happy that in the states they have to win, we won – and by not just a little bit,” says Simon Rosenberg, founder and president of NDN, a Democratic research and advocacy group, who was the most visible skeptic in either party of the “red wave” theory this year. “It’s very encouraging as we go into 2024 because we were able to stare them down and beat them … [even] with inflation being so high. And it wasn’t just their bad candidates – its far more than that.”\n\nStill, the results also showed Republicans tightening their grip on Ohio, Iowa and Florida: though Democrats won all three in both of Barack Obama’s presidential victories, each now appears securely in the GOP’s column for 2024 (and likely beyond). And the perennial liberal hope of putting a “blue Texas” in play clearly looks like it will be deferred again after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s double-digit victory against an energetic and well-funded opponent (former Rep. Beto O’Rourke) squashed the limited momentum Democrats had built there in the 2018 and 2020 elections. Republicans once again beat Democrats for all of Texas’ statewide offices, continuing a shutout that stretches back to the 1990s.\n\nThese offsetting and hardening partisan strengths could, once again, provide the power to decide the White House winner to a few hundred thousand voters in a very few closely balanced states. That’s a windfall for the owners of television stations who will be deluged with television advertising in states such as Nevada, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona. But it’s also another reason for the prodigious stress in our fraught modern politics. Each side in an intensely polarized nation of 330 million recognizes that the overall direction of national policy now pivots on the choices of a miniscule number of people living in the tiny patches of contested political ground – white-collar suburbs of Atlanta and Phoenix, working-class Latino neighborhoods in and around Las Vegas and the mid-sized communities of the so-called BOW counties in Wisconsin.\n\nThe partitioning of the nation into distinct and intractable partisan camps is one of the defining features of modern US politics. The Democratic and Republican presidential nominees have each carried 20 states in every election since at least 2008. That means 80% of the states have voted the same way in at least the past four presidential elections – a level of consistency unmatched through the 20th century. Even during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four consecutive presidential victories from 1932 through 1944, only about two-thirds of the states voted the same way each time.\n\nThe 20 states that Democrats have carried in each presidential election since at least 2008 will award 232 Electoral College votes in 2024; the 20 states Republicans have carried in at least the past four elections will award 155.\n\nBut that tally offers a misleading picture of the parties’ real standing. Of the 10 states that have flipped between the parties in at least one presidential race since 2008, four have not voted for a Democratic presidential nominee since Obama and have clearly tilted red in the Trump era. Those four states – Ohio, Florida, Iowa and Indiana – add another 64 Electoral College votes to the GOP tally and raise the party’s total to 219. North Carolina, also one of the 10, isn’t as securely locked down. But the GOP still has to be favored to capture its 16 Electoral College votes again after Republican Rep. Ted Budd’s solid three-point victory in this month’s US Senate race exceeded the margin in Rep. Thom Tillis’ much narrower 2020 win.\n\nIn this month’s election, each side generally consolidated that dominance across its core 20 states. Democrats notched runaway gubernatorial victories in California and Illinois, recaptured governorships previously held by moderate Republicans in Maryland and Massachusetts and posted blowout 15-point victories in Colorado and Washington Senate races that Republicans touted as much more competitive.\n\nIn turn, Republican Govs. Ron DeSantis in Florida and Mike DeWine in Ohio won landslide victories in which their winning margins exceeded 1 million votes, while Abbott in Texas triumphed by over 700,000 votes. For all the controversy over restrictions or bans on abortion that proliferated across the red states after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer, the GOP did not lose control of a state legislative chamber in any of the states that acted.\n\nOn balance, Democrats showed more cracks than Republicans in their 20 fortress states. That may not be surprising, given that the first midterm election of a president’s term is almost always difficult for his party, especially when voters are as discontented over the economy as polls show them to be now. Democrats faced unexpectedly difficult contests for the governorship in New York and Oregon before toughing out narrow wins that probably represent a high-water mark for Republicans. In New Hampshire, another core 20 blue state that Republicans sometimes hope to target, Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan’s decisive victory was likely more indicative of its leaning in a presidential contest than the easy reelection for moderate GOP Gov. Chris Sununu.\n\nBut Nevada, another of the Democrats’ base states, showed clear signs of vulnerability for the party, with Republican Joe Lombardo narrowly winning the governorship and Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto surviving in the Senate race by less than 10,000 votes. Those outcomes confirmed the trend that Nevada, after moving sharply toward Democrats under Obama, again tipped back toward toss-up status in the Trump era. Yet it also showed that the vaunted Democratic turnout machine in the state retains the ability to win very close contests.\n\nDemocrats did not demonstrate the capacity to threaten any of the GOP’s core 20 states, as Republicans did in Nevada. But for Democrats that inability to dent the red citadel was offset by clear indications of continuing momentum in the five states that decided the 2020 race.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer won by over 10 percentage points and nearly 500,000 votes over a Trump-backed opponent – bigger margins than she posted in 2018 even though about three-fourths of voters called the nation’s economy only fair or poor in the exit poll conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. In Pennsylvania, against Trump-backed GOP nominees, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Josh Shapiro romped to an even bigger victory, and Lt. Gov. John Fetterman won the US Senate race by a surprisingly comfortable five-point margin despite his visible struggles with a stroke. Fetterman’s roughly 225,000 vote margin of victory nearly tripled Biden’s 2020 advantage in the state.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the picture was only slightly more mixed for Democrats. Even amid intense economic discontent, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers won reelection by about 90,000 votes – roughly triple his margin in 2018 when he unseated Republican incumbent Scott Walker in a much better year for Democrats. (Biden in 2020 won the state by only about 20,000 votes.) And while Republican Sen. Ron Johnson won reelection, he survived by only a little over 25,000 votes against an opponent, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who Republicans (and even some Democrats) had considered much too liberal to viably contest the state.\n\nMichigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were the three Rustbelt states that Trump in 2016 dislodged from what I termed in 2009 “the blue wall” – the 18 states that had voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1992. But Biden recaptured all three of them, and this month’s results strongly encouraged Democrats hopes of holding them again in 2024, especially if inflation recedes and any possible recession passes through before then. The exit polls showed that solid majorities in each state supported abortion rights – and that preponderant majorities of those residents voted Democratic.\n\n“On the blue wall states, I came away feeling better about Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin,” says Greenberg.\n\nThe remaining two Sunbelt states that flipped between 2016 and 2020 seemed to move in opposite directions. Arizona continued to drift toward the Democrats – at least when presented with GOP nominees in the Trump mold. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly won reelection over Republican Blake Masters by a resounding 125,000 votes – roughly double the margin in Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s breakthrough victory in 2018, and far more than Biden’s 10,457 vote edge in the state. And while Democrat Katie Hobbs only won the governor’s race by about 17,000 votes over Trump acolyte Kari Lake, that represented a huge advance from the Democrats’ nearly 340,000 vote loss in the 2018 gubernatorial contest.\n\nIn Georgia, by contrast, most results suggested a shift back toward the GOP. Gov. Brian Kemp’s roughly 300,000 vote margin over Democrat Stacey Abrams was nearly six times bigger than his 2018 victory over her. Republicans posted solid victories in all of the other major state contests as well. Only the US Senate race broke this pattern, with Warnock leading Walker in the initial results before next month’s run-off.\n\nGeorgia may offer the most revealing measure of the opportunities and obstacles for Republicans to reverse the Democratic advantage in the states that decided the presidency in 2020.\n\nIn the Senate balloting, Warnock crushed Walker, another Trump-backed nominee, in the populous Atlanta suburbs, including Cobb and Gwinnett counties. Despite unhappiness with the economy, Warnock essentially matched Biden in capturing nearly 60% of the vote in those two counties-which voted reliably Republican not long ago.\n\nThat was indicative of a larger pattern this month. Even without Trump on the ballot, Democratic Senate and governor candidates matched (or even exceeded) Biden’s 2020 vote share in white-collar largely suburban counties around the country that recoiled from the former president – a list that included Maricopa in Arizona, Montgomery and Delaware in Pennsylvania, Dane in Wisconsin, Arapahoe and Jefferson in Colorado, and Oakland and Kent counties in Michigan. Those populous counties provided Democrats huge margins; if they persist into 2024, it will be extremely difficult for Republicans to win those states. In suburban places like these, “if the Republican Party’s focus in the future is going to be enforcing loyalty to Donald Trump … then we’re done,” says Jason Cabel Roe, the former executive director of the Michigan GOP.\n\nBut Georgia also signals how Republicans might avoid that fate. Though Kemp lost Gwinnett and Cobb, he ran more competitively there than Walker. Kemp posted that relatively better showing even though he advanced a staunchly conservative social agenda that faced substantial resistance in such areas – including a ban on abortion after six weeks now blocked by a state judge – by stressing traditional Republican economic themes and demonstrating his independence from Trump in their battles over certifying the 2020 election.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Tom Davis, who served as chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, says that while such suburban areas “are lost for the foreseeable future for Republicans,” the GOP “doesn’t need to win them, you just need to improve” to tip some of the states it has lost in the Trump era. He’s confident that if Republicans choose someone other than Trump, such as DeSantis or Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, the GOP can regain ground in these places, even if those candidates must adopt a conservative social agenda to win the nomination.\n\nDemocrats remain confident about their ability to defend these places, particularly against Trump, but also against other Republicans such as DeSantis echoing many of his culture war themes. Greenberg says the prerequisite to any such defense is Democrats defusing voter concerns about their positions on crime and the border by moving at least somewhat toward the center. But, he says, “if you deal with those issues, I don’t see anything about DeSantis … that is attractive on the whole set of issues that working people want to have addressed” around economic opportunity and corporate responsibility.\n\nHow big a map does this leave the two sides contesting in the 2024 presidential race? No GOP presidential candidate would entirely concede Michigan or Pennsylvania, but the magnitude of the 2022 Democratic wins there – extending the party’s recovery in 2018 and 2020 – show how difficult it will be for any Republican nominee to take them in 2024, especially if he or she supports further restrictions on legal abortion. (Under Trump, says Roe, Michigan has become “a wasteland” for Republicans.) The results even more emphatically extinguished the prospect of Democrats in two years seriously bidding for Ohio, Florida or Iowa.\n\nThat could leave as few as four genuine toss-ups in 2024: Wisconsin in the industrial Midwest, and Nevada, Georgia and Arizona across the Sunbelt. That list could shift slightly depending on circumstances and the candidates. Rosenberg, for instance, believes Democrats should now target North Carolina with the same intensive organizing efforts they mounted in the key battlegrounds this year. And Republicans may continue to push for Minnesota and New Hampshire. But all will be difficult to dislodge from their current allegiance.\n\nA race with just Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia and Arizona as true battlegrounds would begin with Democrats favored in states holding 260 Electoral College votes (including Washington, DC) and Republicans in states with 235. Democrats would need to win just one of Wisconsin, Arizona or Georgia to reach an Electoral College majority – yet that last piece could prove very challenging for them to secure. After 2022, the list of genuinely competitive presidential states may be shrinking, but, if anything, that could increase the tension as the nation remains poised on the knife’s edge between two deeply entrenched, but increasingly antithetical, political coalitions.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/14/2024-presidential-candidates-republicans-democrats/71691815007/", "title": "Who are the 2024 presidential candidates? These are the ...", "text": "The 2024 election cycle has kicked off, and the race is heating up even as Election Day is months away.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is seeking another term in the White House, and with former President Donald Trump's hat also in the ring, a 2020 rematch is a real possibility. Democrats are expected to fall firmly behind Biden, and Trump has held a stubborn lead in polls on the Republican side.\n\nWith mounting legal troubles, and several high-profile candidates aiming to unseat him, however, Trump is not yet a sure-fire winner.\n\nHere are the latest developments on the path to the 2024 election:\n\nDEMOCRATS\n\nDespite concerns over his age, Biden remains a strong frontrunner for his party's nomination. Several lesser-known Democratic candidates are mounting challenges to the president, but they have yet to gain much traction.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nBackground: First elected in 1972, Biden served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before being elected vice president in 2008, mounting a victory alongside former President Barack Obama. After serving two terms as vice president, he took a brief hiatus from government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020.\n\nViews: Biden's campaign is focused on the \"battle for the soul of America,\" doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago. He said the question facing the nation is \"whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer.\"\n\nDean Phillips\n\nBackground: Phillips represents Minnesota in the House of Representatives and was first elected to Congress in 2018. Before entering politics, Phillips made his name as a businessman, heading up Phillips Distilling and serving as chair of Talenti Gelato.\n\nHis views: Phillips is a moderate with a reputation in Washington for reaching across the aisle. A member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, one of his major legislative accomplishments was the creation of the Paycheck Protection Program, which he co-authored with Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy. The program provided loans to businesses to help them during the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nBackground: Williamson is a self-help author and spiritual leader who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020.\n\nHer views: Williamson supports abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for descendants of formerly enslaved Americans. She has suggested creating a U.S. Department of Children and Youth to increase child advocacy and a U.S. Department of Peace.\n\nREPUBLICANS\n\nSince his win in 2016, Trump has served as de facto leader of the Republican Party, his influence still looming large in Washington. After Trump-endorsed candidates suffered in the 2022 midterms, however, speculation swirled that there was an opening for a new leader to rise. Here are the candidates who have thrown their hat in the ring.\n\nRyan Binkley\n\nBackground: Binkley is CEO, president, and co-founder of the mergers and acquisitions conglomerate Generational Group. He is also a faith leader, co-founding and serving as the pastor at Create Church in Richardson, Texas.\n\nHis views: Binkley has said he hopes to prioritize balancing the budget, lowering health care costs, creating bipartisan immigration reform and putting more community emphasis on education. Binkley is against abortion rights. His campaign website says he was \"thankful\" when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, but that a \"culture of life\" means prioritizing adoption as well.\n\nChris Christie\n\nBackground: Christie was appointed U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey in 2001 and served for six years, before being elected governor of the state in 2010 and serving until 2018. Christie has been a prominent figure in the GOP for many years. In 2016, he mounted an unsuccessful presidential campaign and, despite prior criticism, ultimately endorsed Trump and later joined his campaign.\n\nHis views: Christie is anti-abortion, but does support some exceptions in the case of incest, rape and danger to the mother. He is not for a federal ban. Instead, he believes the issue should be left to the states. He has advocated for a more secure border to stem the flow of fentanyl into the country, saying earlier in his campaign he planned to deploy the National Guard.\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nBackground: DeSantis serves as the 46th governor of Florida. While in law school, DeSantis joined the U.S. Navy as a JAG officer, later deploying to Iraq for active duty. Before his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018.\n\nHis views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida. He is anti-abortion and has signed a 6-week abortion ban in his home state. On the border, DeSantis has been outspoken in his vision for a crackdown. He has promised to complete a border wall, reimpose the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, and possibly end birthright citizenship. Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to Former President Donald Trump.\n\nNikki Haley\n\nBackground: Haley started her political career in South Carolina's state legislature, where she served for 6 years before mounting a successful campaign for the governor's office in 2010. In 2016, former President Donald Trump nominated Haley to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a position she held for a year before unexpectedly stepping down in 2018.\n\nHer views: Haley opposes abortion rights and has been a vocal supporter of Israel in its ongoing war with Hamas. While on the campaign trail, she has focused on illegal immigration, advocating for a return of the Trump-era \"Remain in Mexico\" policy as well as the defunding of sanctuary cities. Haley has told voters she hopes to crack down on China's influence on the U.S. economy. She has supported Trump in the past but also criticized him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nBackground: Hutchinson was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to serve Arkansas' 3rd district in 1997. He served until 2001 when he was appointed director for the Drug Enforcement Administration and later undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security for former President George W. Bush's administration. After leaving Washington, he was elected 46th Governor of Arkansas. He served for two terms, from 2015 to 2023.\n\nHis views: On immigration, Hutchinson has promised to send more resources to Border Patrol as well as resume construction of a border wall. He opposes abortion and has said he would sign a federal ban if elected but supports exceptions. He is also a vocal critic of Trump, saying he \"is not the right leader” for the nation or the Republican Party.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nBackground: Ramaswamy is a former biotech investor who founded the pharmaceutical research company Roivant Sciences in 2014. He stepped down as CEO in 2021 after going more public with his opposition to ESG and 'woke' politics in the corporate sector. He moved on to found Strive Asset Management, before stepping down to dedicate time to his 2024 run.\n\nHis views: Ramaswamy is framing himself as an outsider, an entrepreneur-turned-political-hopeful who will give the establishment a run for its money. He has peddled ideas such as ending affirmative action programs and eliminating the Department of Education.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nBackground: Prior to 2016, Trump dabbled in politics, often sounding off on issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on former President Barack Obama's citizenship and the case surrounding the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump won the White House, serving a full four-year term before being defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.\n\nHis views: The former president has, without evidence, centered much of his campaign on the claim that his political enemies are fueling his ongoing criminal cases. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which his critics say was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.\n\nTHIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES\n\nThe potential of a tight Trump-Biden rematch opens the door for a third-party candidate to be integral in determining the results of the race. A third name on the presidential ballot could drain votes from either of the two major party nominees, tipping the scales toward either Biden or Trump.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nBackground: Kennedy is an environmental lawyer known for trumpeting a debunked theory that vaccines can be linked to autism. In 2017, Trump invited Kennedy to head up a presidential commission on vaccine safety.\n\nHis views: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the \"liberties guaranteed by the Constitution,\" according to his campaign website. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy opposed vaccine mandates, calling them an infringement on individual liberty and at times used the Holocaust as a historical comparison.\n\nCornel West\n\nBackground:West is an American academic and philosopher known for his progressive ideals. He has taught at several Ivy League institutions and works now as a professor of philosophy at Union Theological Seminary.\n\nHis views: West is a proponent of establishing Medicare for All, and barring oil and gas subsidies, as well as drilling on public lands. Long a vocal opponent of militarism, West's campaign website lists \"end the wars\" as a key priority, which would include disbanding NATO and banning nuclear weapons across the globe.\n\nJill Stein\n\nBackground: Stein is a doctor and organizer who has championed causes like campaign finance reform and environmental protection. She has run for president twice before, launching bids in 2012 and 2016.\n\nHer views: Stein paints herself as an outsider, coming in to disrupt a political system ruled by money and special interests. In her campaign launch video, posted to X, she called for an economic bill of rights including \"the right to a job, to health care, to housing, to food, education and more.\n\nCandidates who dropped out", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/us-intelligence-russia-withdrawal-midterm-election/index.html", "title": "US intelligence suggests Russia put off announcing Kherson retreat ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US has intelligence that Russia may have delayed announcing its withdrawal from the Ukrainian city of Kherson in part to avoid giving the Biden administration a political win ahead of the midterm elections, according to four people familiar with the intelligence.\n\nSenior Russian officials discussed the US midterms as a factor during deliberations about the withdrawal announcement, one person familiar with the intelligence said. Waiting until after the US election was always a “pre-planned condition” of Russia’s withdrawal from Kherson, a second person familiar with the intelligence told CNN.\n\nStill, the election was far from the only consideration in Russia’s retreat, officials said. Military analysts say Russia had few other operational options and had been preparing to pull back for weeks, leading US officials to wonder when the Russians would officially acknowledge the withdrawal.\n\nWhile the intelligence is not a formal assessment of Russia’s intentions, it is a sign that Russia has a continued interest in influencing the US political landscape — although the sources said Russia probably miscalculated the impact such an announcement would actually have on the elections.\n\n“I doubt Americans would really have noticed,” said another source familiar with western intelligence.\n\nPresident Joe Biden last week appeared to hint that the US believed that the timing of Russia’s announcement was more than mere coincidence.\n\n“I find it interesting they waited until after the election to make that judgement, which we knew for some time they were going to be doing, and it’s evidence of the fact that they have some real problems – the Russian military,” Biden said at a press conference last Wednesday.\n\nBiden also said he hopes that with the elections over, the Russians will be more willing to negotiate the release of US citizens detained in Russia, including Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan. After the midterm elections, Griner’s attorney announced that the US basketball star would be moved to a Russian penal colony where she is due to serve the remainder of a nine-year drug smuggling sentence that was upheld in late October.\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns was in Ankara on Monday discussing the American prisoners with his Russian counterpart, the National Security Council said, though the bulk of the discussion centered around managing the risk posed by nuclear weapons. The NSC declined to comment for this story.\n\nThe intelligence suggesting that Russia wanted to avoid giving the Democratic administration and Congress positive news on the eve of the elections adds to a growing body of evidence that Russia is betting that a Republican-led United States will offer less support to Ukraine.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has hinted as much in recent interviews, telling CNN that a Republican House will more closely monitor and control the money and weapons flowing to Kyiv. Some Republicans say his public comments have been taken out of context and military support for Ukraine will remain high no matter who controls the House. Still, there remain vocal critics of US support for Ukraine in the GOP conference, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and JD Vance, the incoming Republican senator from Ohio.\n\n“Even though there is still robust bipartisan agreement on Ukraine, the party that has been much more vocally supportive is the Democratic Party, and particularly the Biden administration,” said one of the people familiar with the intelligence.\n\nKremlin-linked oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin appeared to confirm last week what the US intelligence community has known for years: that the Russian government sought to support Republican Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in the 2016 and 2020 elections because it deemed him friendlier to its interests.\n\n“We interfered, we interfere and we will interfere” in US elections, Prigozhin, who runs the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm deployed during past US elections to spread disinformation, said on Telegram.\n\nAccording to private researchers, suspected Russian operatives also used far-right media platforms to denigrate Democratic candidates in a handful of battleground states in the week leading up to this year’s midterm elections.\n\nStill, multiple US and congressional officials who track Russian influence operations say that if Russia did choose to time its official withdrawal from Kherson to the US midterms, it likely overestimated how much Americans care about individual battles in Ukraine. That demonstrates a lack of sophistication in Russia’s information operations, these sources said.\n\n“For all our hoopla about their information operations and political meddling, they’re still not that great at it in the grand scheme,” said the source familiar with western intelligence. “There is some really fundamental cultural misunderstanding there.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin himself did not announce the withdrawal — which Russia has termed a “maneuver” rather than a “retreat” — distancing himself from what has become a profound embarrassment for the Russian military. The withdrawal has been heavily criticized on Russian pro-war blogs.\n\n“An announcement like this — no matter how Russia tries to spin it — it’s still clear that they’re giving up the only provincial capital that they seized during the invasion,” said one of the people familiar with the intelligence. “So it’s a ton of egg on their face.”", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis Zachary Cohen Natasha Bertrand", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Zachary Cohen", "Natasha Bertrand"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/05/07/why-puerto-rico-residents-cant-vote-even-though-they-are-us-citizens/1119543001/", "title": "Why Puerto Rico residents can't vote even though they're U.S. citizens", "text": "WASHINGTON – Puerto Rico voters upset at President Donald Trump for his long-running feud with the island over disaster aid don't have much recourse at the ballot box in 2020 – not unless they move to the mainland.\n\nThat's because the nearly 3.2 million American citizens who live in Puerto Rico play no direct role in electing U.S. presidents. Residents of the other four U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands) also do not have the right to vote in general elections.\n\nThe District of Columbia (a.k.a. Washington, D.C.) is the only jurisdiction outside the 50 states whose residents can vote for the president. It has three electoral votes.\n\nTerritories can help choose each party's nominee, however. The political parties have the ability to include them in the primary selection process.\n\nIn 2016, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio won Puerto Rico's GOP primary, trouncing Trump 71% to 13% and winning all 20 of the territory's Republican delegates. It was one of only three primaries Rubio won (along with Minnesota and the District of Columbia).\n\nThe larger risk for Trump is the relocation to the mainland of thousands of Puerto Ricans who fled the island after the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017.\n\nResearchers say it's difficult to pinpoint exactly where those fleeing Maria's aftermath resettled, but a large percentage are believed to have moved to Florida, where more than 1 million Puerto Ricans reside.\n\nThat could be bad news for Trump, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in Florida in 2016 by fewer than 113,000 votes out of nearly 9.5 million cast.\n\nA poll conducted last year by the Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs at Florida International University found that more than 70% of Puerto Ricans who moved to the Sunshine State since 2017 have a negative view of the president.\n\nPressure on Trump:Disaster aid fight heats up as Donald Trump plans visit to hurricane-hit Panama City\n\nTrump tweet:Donald Trump slams Puerto Rico as Congress considers disaster aid bill", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/23/trump-choice-for-vice-president/71974799007/", "title": "Who would Trump choose as vice president? See the potential ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — Though the Republican presidential primaries and caucuses haven't started yet, former President Donald Trump’s commanding lead in the polls has already spurred debate over potential running mates.\n\nSome names being floated are lawmakers who’ve said in interviews they would be interested in the job. Other names are generated when Trump meets with a high-profile supporter, which happened this week when he was spotted at Mar-a-Lago with Rep, Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., according to aides.\n\nBut his aides add that stories about an array of possible appointments − from running mate to White House chief of staff − are premature at best.\n\n\"Second term policy priorities and staffing decisions will not - in no uncertain terms - be led by anonymous or thinly sourced speculation in mainstream media news stories,” the Trump campaign said in a statement. \"President Trump is solely focused on winning the Republican nomination for president.\"\n\nTrump himself said in an interview with NBC in September that he hasn’t thought too much about the role but added he “likes the concept” of a woman as vice president.\n\n\"We're going to choose the best person,\" he said.\n\nEither way, numerous political experts said loyalty would be a prime consideration for Trump as he chooses his running mate. And some of his supporters being floated as a running mate could very well end up on Trump’s ticket.\n\nHere’s a look at some potential contenders.\n\nTim Scott\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who dropped out of the presidential race last month, was floated as a potential running mate early on in the primary race. Unlike some of his rivals, the lawmaker did not criticize Trump directly when he was on the campaign trail.\n\nScott worked on opportunity zones − a bipartisan initiative − in Trump's 2017 tax cut legislation. He is also 58 and Black, which would be key for Trump as he seeks to expand his coalition of supporters.\n\nTrump was asked on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" whether he would choose Scott as a running mate in July, and said he thinks Scott is a “very good guy” and talented.\n\n“We did opportunity zones together. It's never been talked about. It's one of the most successful economic development things ever done in this country. And Tim is very good,” Trump said. “I mean, I could see Tim doing something with the administration.”\n\nThough Scott said he wouldn’t endorse anyone for the primary, he did defend Trump’s economic record and acknowledged his poll numbers in an interview with CNBC earlier this month.\n\nNikki Haley\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has argued that former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley would be a good pick for Trump’s vice president as she would pull independent voters to his circle of supporters.\n\nHaley, 51, worked in the Trump administration as an ambassador to the United Nations from 2017 to 2018, where she supported U.S. relations with Israel and led the initiative to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. As a woman of color, she would diversify Trump’s ticket.\n\n\"A large gender gap exists in his current polling and attempting to reach out to more moderate suburban female voters in swing states will be crucially important in the general election,” said Aaron Kall, an elections expert at the University of Michigan. “Given the advanced ages of Trump and Biden, selecting a younger candidate could help alleviate any concerns over health.”\n\nHaving Haley on Trump’s ticket might also increase his chances of beating Biden. Numerous polls have found that Haley has a higher chance of winning against Biden in a hypothetical matchup than other Republican candidates.\n\nBut when asked by a voter in Iowa this month whether she would consider being Trump’s number two, she made clear she wouldn’t accept the position.\n\n“I don't play for second,\" she said. \"I've never played for second my entire life.\"\n\nThe two have also battled on the campaign trail. Haley said that Trump is not the right president for the country in 2024. The Trump campaign has called Haley \"birdbrain,\" and sent a birdcage and bird food to her hotel room in October to mock her.\n\nKristi Noem\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, one of Trump’s fiercest allies, is also being floated after she endorsed the former president at an event in September. Trump said in an interview with NBC that same month he has his eye on Noem as a potential running mate.\n\n“I think she’s fantastic. She’s been a great governor. She gave me a very full-throated endorsement - a beautiful endorsement actually,” Trump said. “And, you know, it’s been a very good state for me and certainly she’d be one of the people I’d consider.”\n\nNoem, 52, has also made clear she is interested in the position, saying in an interview with Newmax in September she would consider the role “in a heartbeat.”\n\nShe’s criticized Trump’s criminal indictments and the Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling to disqualify Trump from the state’s presidential primary ballot this week. She’s also passed anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment policies. Before she was governor, Noem served in Congress where she helped pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 − key legislation under the Trump administration.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, 41, is another lawmaker Trump could potentially choose. Sanders endorsed Trump at a rally in Miami, Florida, last month, calling him “my former boss, my friend, and everybody’s favorite president.”\n\nSanders served as the White House press secretary in the Trump administration from 2017 to 2019, advising him on personnel, policy and communications strategy, according to her website. When Sanders stepped down from her position, Trump acknowledged in a news conference that the pair have been through a lot together and that she did an incredible job.\n\n“She’s tough and she’s good,” Trump said.\n\nIf 2024 does end up being a match between President Joe Biden and Trump, Sanders would serve as a key player for Trump. She delivered a combative response against Biden when he delivered his State of the Union address in February, saying Biden’s weakness puts the nation and world at risk.\n\nHowever, allegations that her office illegally altered public records could make a comeback if she ends up on the ticket.\n\nBen Carson\n\nBen Carson, who served as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Trump administration, said he would be willing to serve as Trump’s running mate when the former president ran in 2016.\n\nUltimately, Trump chose former Vice President Mike Pence for the spot. But Carson’s name is now being floated again after the retired neurosurgeon endorsed him for the 2024 race.\n\nIf Carson were chosen however, it is unclear whether he would take the spot.\n\nWhen Carson announced he would leave after Trump’s first term, he was pressed in a 2019 Newsmax interview on whether he would be interested in serving in a second Trump administration. Carson said, “I would be interested in returning to the private sector, because I think you have just as much influence — maybe more — there.”\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene\n\nStaunch Trump supporter Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., told the Atlanta-Journal Constitution in August that it would be an “honor” if she was chosen for the vice president spot and would consider it “very, very heavily.”\n\nShe’s spoken at numerous Trump campaign events and was one of the 147 Republicans who voted to decertify the 2020 election results.\n\nGreene also supports an impeachment inquiry against Biden - joining other Republican lawmakers in alleging Biden was involved in his family's business dealings as vice president - and accused him of treason, while defending Trump against his indictments.\n\nHowever, Greene’s far-right stances and rhetoric might not bode well for Trump if he is seeking to attract moderate Republicans to his base.\n\nElise Stefanik\n\nRumors about Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., being a possible running mate for Trump have also been floated, as she is one of the former president’s fiercest allies.\n\nShe endorsed Trump last year before he announced he was running. The endorsement came after the midterm elections, when some Republicans were blaming him for failing to generate a red wave, according to The Associated Press.\n\nStefanik has also criticized his indictments and filed ethics complaints with judges who have overseen cases related to the former president.\n\nShe is 39 and could appeal to younger women looking to back the former president. However, she is from New York, which has voted blue in recent presidential elections.\n\n\"Electoral considerations are often at play in Vice-Presidential selections, so someone who could help Republicans flip a state like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia, or Arizona could be especially helpful,\" Kall previously told USA TODAY.\n\nKari Lake\n\nThough former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake launched a Senate bid in October, there's some speculation that she could land higher office as Trump’s potential running mate.\n\nLake, 54, has defended Trump against his criminal indictments and spread allegations that the 2020 election was stolen - despite evidence to the contrary.\n\nShe came out first in a poll conducted by the Conservative Political Action Conference in March that asked voters who they would like to see as the Republican candidate for vice president. Lake won 20% of the vote, topping the other candidates on the list.\n\nHowever, she did lose the governor’s race in the midterms last year which could affect whether she has enough political standing to pull in more supporters to Trump’s circle.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nThough businessman and self-proclaimed outsider Vivek Ramaswamy is competing for the Republican nomination, he has defended Trump numerous times on the campaign trail and acknowledged Trump was the best president of the 21st century.\n\nTrump has also taken notice of Ramaswamy’s efforts, crowning him the winner of the first Republican debate in August.\n\n\"He's a very, very, very intelligent person. He's got good energy, and he could be some form of something. I tell you, I think he'd be very good,” Trump said in August when asked by conservative host Glenn Beck what he thought of Ramaswamy as vice president.\n\nHowever, Ramaswamy has no political experience, and he said he wasn't interested in playing for second place in an interview.\n\n“Donald Trump and I share something in common and that is that neither of us would do well in a number 2 position,” he said on Fox News in August.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/11/05/donald-trump-joe-biden-2024-poll/71466781007/", "title": "Donald Trump leads Joe Biden in 2024 battleground states: new poll", "text": "Former President Donald Trump led President Joe Biden in five battleground states in a hypothetical matchup ahead of the 2024 presidential election, according to a new poll.\n\nEven a year before the 2024 presidential race, Trump has long been the frontrunner in the crowded field of White House hopefuls. And heading in to the election, Democrats are expected to throw their support behind Biden as the incumbent president seeking a second term in office.\n\nBut new polls from The New York Times and Siena College, published Sunday, found that Trump led Biden by 10 points in Nevada, six points in Georgia, five points in Arizona, five points in Michigan and four points in Pennsylvania.\n\nBiden only defeated Trump in one of the swing states in the poll, Wisconsin, and he led Trump in the Badger State by just 2 points.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHow did Trump, Biden compare?\n\nBiden won each of the six battleground states listed in the poll in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut the survey showed that Biden’s popularity among groups of voters who supported his victory, such as voters under 30, appear to be declining.\n\nBlack voters registered 22% support in the six states for Trump. That's a base that’s rare for Republican presidential candidates in modern politics.\n\nVoters, by a 59% to 37% margin, said they trusted Trump over Biden on the economy. That support spanned among genders and education and income levels, according to the poll.\n\nHowever, survey participants said they trusted Biden over Trump on the debate surrounding abortion, an issue that Democrats used to garner victories across the country after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That's the landmark decision that established the right to an abortion in the U.S.\n\nWhat do other 2024 polls say?\n\nTrump and Biden both commanded 37% of the vote in a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll released last month, with independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. costing Trump what would have been a narrow lead.\n\nKennedy, scion of the nation's most revered Democratic family, won 13% of the vote in a hypothetical match up, drawing voters who by 2-1 said they would otherwise support the probable Republican nominee.\n\nProgressive activist Cornel West, who also plans an independent campaign, was at 4% in the poll last month. His supporters would break to Biden if he weren't on the ballot.\n\nCarl Hickey, 85, a retired Methodist minister from Monkton, Maryland, told USA TODAY that he planned to vote for Biden but would consider a third-party candidate if the right one emerged.\n\n\"We've got to do something that's different,\" he said in a follow-up interview after being polled. \"The division has to stop; we have to work together.\"\n\nThe survey from The New York Times and Siena College was conducted from Oct. 22 to Nov. 3, and it includes responses from 3,662 registered voters.

In all that may be guideposts and red flags for the real people who will run or are thinking about it.\n\nDavid Paleologos, director of the Suffolk Political Research Center, said the job posting could go something like this: \"Wanted – a 51-to-65-year-old governor with business experience and willing to compromise to get things done. Military experience a bonus.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the presidential election of 2024 currently has no declared ideal candidates,\" he said, and neither President Joe Biden nor former president Donald Trump is a neat match to the description. In the poll, he notes, \"Over 6 in 10 say they don't want Trump or Biden to run in 2024.\"\n\nThe survey of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cellphone Dec. 7-11, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nHow old should the president be?\n\nThe sweet spot is later middle age, between 51 and 65 years old, the age group chosen by 50% of those surveyed. An additional 25% picked earlier middle age, 35 to 50 years old.\n\nThose findings could be cautionary for Trump, who last month announced another presidential bid. The former president will be 78 years old on Inauguration Day in 2025; just 8% said an ideal president would be 66 to 80 years old.\n\nIt's an even greater caution for Biden, who says he is inclined to seek a second term. He'll be 82 at the next inauguration; less than 1 percent chose a president 80 or older. Put another way, just four respondents among 1,000 people surveyed chose that oldest age group.\n\nYounger voters were more likely to prefer younger presidents. Among those under 35 years old, 41% said their ideal president would be between 35 and 50, the youngest age group eligible for the office.\n\nIs it time for a female president?\n\nMaybe not.\n\nMost voters, a 55% majority, volunteered that gender doesn't matter. That would be news to Hillary Clinton and other female candidates, who believe they encountered political headwinds because of their sex.\n\nFor a significant number of Americans, the Oval Office remains a man's world. Overall, those who expressed a preference chose a man over a woman as ideal by more than 2-1, 28%-12%.\n\nAmong Republicans, 50% said the ideal president would be male while a negligible 2% said she would be female. In contrast, Democrats with a preference chose a woman over a man by 2-1, 24%-11%.\n\nPolitical independents were the most likely to say gender doesn't matter. Nearly two-thirds, 63%, volunteered that view.\n\nIs there a gender gap on gender?\n\nAmong those voters with a preference, men by 8-1 preferred a male president over a female one, 32%-4%. Women were somewhat more likely to prefer a male president as well, 25%-19%.\n\nThe hometown effect: Where are you from?\n\nMost of those surveyed, 57%, said it doesn't matter where a president is from.\n\nThose who said it does matter were inclined to favor someone from their own part of the country. The regional pull was strongest in the heartland, chosen by 27% of Midwesterners. The East Coast was preferred by 20% of those from the Northeast; the South by 18% of those from the South; the West Coast by 16% of those from the West.\n\nWhich party? How about neither?\n\nIt's no surprise that Democratic voters overwhelmingly wanted a Democratic president (71%) and Republican voters overwhelmingly wanted a Republican one (74%).\n\nBut there was notable support for a president not affiliated with either major political party. That was the preference not only of two-thirds of independents (67%) but also of 17% of Democrats and 13% of Republicans.\n\nYounger voters were the least tethered to a party. Among those 18 to 35 years old, 31% preferred a Democratic president and 19% a Republican one, but a 41% plurality said their ideal president would be an independent.\n\nLeadership style: Compromise or not?\n\nBy double digits, 57% to 34%, Americans want a president who compromises in order to get things done, rather than one who stands on principle no matter what.\n\nBut the differences behind the numbers help explain why actually getting things done often has proved to be so difficult in Washington.\n\nUnhappy new year? Poll finds Americans wary of the nation's course, its leaders and its future ahead of 2023\n\nBy 4-1, 74%-19%, Democrats want a president who will cut a deal. Republicans by 50%-38% prefer a president who stands on principle, even if it means things don't get done.\n\nThat gap on leadership styles was one of the biggest partisan divides in the poll.\n\nPolitical experience? Yes, but...\n\nExperience in politics was seen as a plus by most voters. Democrats preferred senators over governors, 37%-32%. Republicans, in what may reflect a GOP antipathy for all things Washington, preferred governors over senators by 3-1, 36%-11%.\n\nAmong Republicans, there seemed to be some backlash to political experience. One-third, 32%, would prefer someone with no political experience.\n\nBusiness experience? Yes, but...\n\nThere was also a partisan divide on the value of business experience in the perfect president.\n\nOverall, 56% said an ideal president would have a background in business. That included an overwhelming 85% of Republicans.\n\nAmong Democrats, however, there seemed to be some backlash to corporate experience. By 55%-29%, they preferred a president with no business background. That may reflect opposition to Trump, the real-estate magnate and reality-TV star who had never run for office until he won the presidency in 2016.\n\nMilitary experience? Yes, but...\n\nService in the military was a clear asset among Republicans; 61% said their ideal president would have served in the military. Democratic views were more mixed: 31% favored a president who had served; 37% preferred one who had not. Another 31% volunteered that it didn't matter one way or the other.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/12/09/fact-check-joe-biden-won-most-votes-ever-and-fewest-counties/3865097001/", "title": "Fact check: Joe Biden won most votes ever and fewest counties", "text": "The claim: Joe Biden won the most votes in history, though he won a record low number of counties\n\nMore than a month after Election Day, the votes have been counted and the results of the presidential contest are complete.

The report showed that Biden won 477 counties, while Trump won 2,497 counties. Results from dozens of counties were not finalized at the time, per Time magazine.\n\nAccording to that data, Biden won just 16% of counties with finalized results.\n\nOn Dec. 8, the think tank updated its report with new data. The updated report showed that Biden won 509 counties, while Trump won 2,547 counties. Results from 28 counties have still not been finalized, per Brookings Institution.\n\nBut according to the updated data, Biden won 16.7% of counties with finalized results. That represents a record-low proportion for a winning presidential candidate.\n\nObama set the previous record in 2012 – with 689 counties, equal to 22%. Before that, he also set a record in 2008 with just 28% of counties, per NBC News.\n\nFact check:Image from 2017 White House event altered to make claim about votes for Biden\n\nCounties vary by population, so county wins don't correlate with the popular vote\n\nUltimately, the fact that Biden and Obama were victorious in a relatively small number of counties is not relevant to their popular vote numbers.\n\nThat's because there is an incredible amount of variance in county population size, per a report by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nSome counties have minuscule populations – for example, Hawaii's Kalawao County has just 88 residents, and Texas' Loving County has 169 residents.\n\nOther counties have enormous populations – for example, California's Los Angeles County has 10.1 million residents, and Illinois' Cook County has 5.2 million residents.\n\nThe same 2017 report by the U.S. Census Bureau found that more than half of the U.S. population lives in just 143 counties, or 4.3% of all counties.\n\nTherefore, it's plausible that Joe Biden set a popular vote record by carrying only 509 counties, or 17% of all counties.\n\nFact check:Biden won popular, Electoral College votes in several battleground states\n\nOu r rating: Missing co nte xt\n\nWe rate memes that call into question whether Joe Biden won the most ever votes based on the fact that he won a record-low number of counties as MISSING CONTEXT, because without additional context they could be misleading. With over 81 million votes, Biden received the most votes of any presidential candidate in history. It is also true that he won a record-low number of counties – but counties vary by population size, from those with a few hundred people to others with millions of residents, so county wins don't correlate with the popular vote.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

The deciding seat was called just before midnight Tuesday.\n\nTheir success means Youngkin will have an uphill battle with his proposed 15-week abortion limit, which Democrats in the state already blocked in January.

Yet he is in a fight to stave off Republican challenger Daniel Cameron, Kentucky's attorney general.– Joey Garrison\n\nActivists eye Black voter turnout in Mississippi after repeal of Jim Crow-era law\n\nMississippi is holding its first gubernatorial election since the overturning of a Jim Crow-era measure in Mississippi’s 1890 state constitution that targeted the power of Black voters.\n\nThe measure required any individual running for state office to win the majority of the popular vote and a majority of the state’s 122 House districts to be elected. If no candidate was able to do both, then the Mississippi House decided on the election outcome.\n\nIn 2020, voters repealed the system, instead requiring candidates to receive only a majority of the popular vote to get elected in the state.\n\n\"Now that it's just a popular vote, then the influence of the Black vote means more,\" said Charles V.

Andy Beshear or replace him with Republican Daniel Cameron.\n\nMuch of Beshear’s first term was dominated by his response to a series of natural disasters and the pandemic. But his reelection campaign often focused on dire warnings about the future of abortion rights.\n\nCameron would be the nation’s first Black Republican to be elected governor if he wins. He has reaffirmed his support for the current Kentucky law, which bans all abortions except when carried out to save a pregnant woman’s life or to prevent a disabling injury.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nBallots run out at several Mississippi county precincts\n\nMultiple locations in Hinds County, Mississippi, ran out of ballots, and the Hinds County Election Commission was in the process of trying to print more ballots and deliver them as time was running out on voting Tuesday afternoon, according to Pete Perry of the Hinds County Republican Party.\n\nAs many as nine precincts have run out of ballots.\n\n\"The election commission did not print enough ballots for the precincts.

Democrats have warned that a red Virginia would lead to further abortion restrictions, while Republicans defend their proposed 15-week limit, with exceptions, as a “common sense” compromise.\n\nOut of a list of issues ranging from crime to taxes, abortion was second most top of mind for voters in a Christopher Newport University Wason Center poll last month.\n\nNext on that list: K-12 education.\n\nVirginia Republicans have campaigned on “parents’ rights\" in education, a rallying cry that began in the state during Gov.

After the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging Philadelphia officials violated state law while ballots were being tallied, which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed.\n\nWhoever is elected to the state's Supreme Court this year could be crucial, as fights could play out again in Pennsylvania in 2024.\n\nThe court has a 4-2 Democratic majority after the death of Justice Max Baer. If Carluccio were to be elected, the majority balance between parties wouldn’t change. But there have been cases where justices have deadlocked, even with a Democratic majority.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKy election results: Will the race for governor map out a blueprint for a Trump, Biden rematch?\n\nRepublican Daniel Cameron is competing against Democratic incumbent Andy Beshear in Kentucky's governor race on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans rule Kentucky politically, yet its liberal-leaning governor remains one of the country's most popular figures, even as the national Democratic brand takes a nosedive in the state.\n\nThose close to Cameron, who is a protege of Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., believe making this race a proxy battle for next year's likely presidential election rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump is the better counterpunch to the governor's popularity.\n\n– Phillip M.

Officials aim to earn your trust in 2024\n\nWASHINGTON − Ahead of another election cycle that is already shaping up to be contentious, federal and state election officials are in the midst of campaigns of their own to reassure wary voters about the integrity of casting their ballots.\n\nThey are recruiting poll workers, certifying voting machines and hosting lessons on how election systems work in community centers, classrooms and libraries.\n\nThe steps are needed, experts say, to restore voters' confidence in a system that, despite some flaws and outspoken election deniers, was mostly trustworthy and secure in the first place.\n\nThose fraud claims, in part, gave rise to calls for major overhauls of election systems in some states led mostly by Republican lawmakers. Some, particularly voters of color, were already skeptical of a system with a history of discrimination that hasn't always been open to them. New laws to restrict access has fueled that mistrust, experts said.\n\nMuch of the work of assuring voters will fall to local elections officials, experts said. Americans have more trust in their local election systems, which they’re more familiar with, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\n\n\"People know their local election officials. They know when they go to city or town hall that they trust the people that work there,'' said Rob Rock, Rhode Island's deputy secretary of state. \"It's really important to make sure that people understand the process.''\n\n–Deborah Barfield Berry and Terry Collins\n\nRead the story:Fearful of voter fraud?

It's a good idea to arrive early, especially if you need to register at the door. This year, some Democratic satellite caucus locations begin earlier. However, some of those sites require preregistration and some of those deadlines have passed.\n\nSo just how does the caucus process work? Read on for a detailed description of both the Democratic and Republican caucuses.\n\nMore:How to find your caucus site, register and be informed about the candidate you want to support\n\nWhat is a caucus?\n\nA caucus is a gathering of party members to discuss presidential preferences, elect local party leaders and talk about policy positions that make up a party’s platform.\n\nThere are major differences between the Democrats’ and the Republicans’ way of caucusing. The key one is that at a Democratic caucus participants separate into groups based on which presidential candidate they support. In a Republican caucus, participants simply cast a vote to indicate their support.\n\nA caucus begins with a call to order, and other general business, including election of a chair for the night’s proceedings.\n\nIn both parties’ caucuses, candidates or their representatives may speak to caucusgoers before the preference selection begins.\n\nHow is a primary different?\n\nCaucuses are run by the parties; primaries are run by the states. A primary resembles a general election, where registered voters cast a vote by secret ballot for their preferred candidate.\n\nMore:\n\nThe Democratic caucus\n\n1. PICKING A CANDIDATE\n\nCaucusgoers show their presidential preference by standing in a section of the room devoted to their candidate.\n\n2. BECOMING VIABLE\n\nThe people in each of those groups are counted. If the size of the group is at least 15% of those attending, that group is considered viable and the people in that group must fill out a presidential preference card, sign it, and turn it in. After they fill out that card, those in a 15% group can leave or watch the rest of the caucus. They cannot vote again.\n\n3. REALIGNING\n\nThose in groups that did not reach 15% in the first count can select a candidate again, either by joining a viable group, earning support for their group or another group or joining an uncommitted group.\n\n4. FINAL COUNT\n\nAfter realignment, the groups’ size will be counted again. That will be the final count.\n\n5. DETERMINING DELEGATES\n\nAfter the final count, delegates are awarded to the candidates, based on how many supporters those groups had.\n\nChanges in the 2020 Democratic caucus\n\nTwo counts: In previous cycles, caucusgoers could realign multiple times. Starting this year, there is only one realignment and people who supported a viable candidate cannot vote again.\n\nSatellite caucuses: For the first time in 2020, Democrats have allowed caucuses at dozens of satellite locations, both in Iowa and in other states and three other countries, to allow people who could not caucus at 7 p.m. at their assigned precinct in Iowa to participate. Some of those satellite caucuses start earlier or later than 7 p.m. and some require preregistration.\n\nReporting results: Democrats will make public the raw vote numbers from the first and second alignments, as well as the delegate strength candidates have. In previous years, the party reported only the delegate strength.\n\nView the final delegate totals as well as the first and second alignment vote numbers at DesMoinesRegister.com on Feb. 3.\n\nThe Republican caucus\n\n1. PICKING A CANDIDATE\n\nParticipants are asked to cast a vote for their preferred candidate for president. The delegates that will represent Iowa at the Republican National Convention will be divided proportionally to the statewide vote.\n\n2. TALLYING VOTES\n\nThe votes are counted and the chair announces the number of delegates to be elected by the precinct to attend the county convention.\n\n3. SELECTING DELEGATES\n\nThe delegates are nominated based on the candidates receiving the most votes and confirmed by all caucus participants.\n\nWhere are the caucuses held?\n\nA caucus is usually held at a school or other public building in a precinct, depending on expected turnout. Churches, union halls, fire stations, businesses and private homes also serve as caucus sites.\n\nFind your polling place through the Iowa Democratic Party or the Republican Party of Iowa.\n\nLook up Democratic caucus locations at the Iowa Democratic Party website\n\nat the Iowa Democratic Party website Look up Republican caucus locations at the Republican Party of Iowa website\n\nSome locations will host caucuses for multiple precincts on caucus night, so it will be helpful to know your precinct number so that you caucus with the right group.\n\nTo find your precinct, go to the Secretary of State’s website: https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterreg/pollingplace/search.aspx\n\nBoth parties recommend arriving 30 to 45 minutes early. The Democratic Party specifies that you must be signed in or in line by 7 p.m. to participate.\n\nWho can caucus?\n\nYou must be eligible to vote in the state of Iowa; 18 years old by the date of the presidential election, Nov. 3, 2020; and registered as a Democrat or Republican.\n\nDemocrats require no specific identification. Republicans say those seeking to register on caucus night should bring an ID and proof of residency.\n\nMore:\n\nOther caucus business\n\nResults: Once the presidential preference proceedings are done, the results are reported to the state party, where they will be verified, then reported to the media and the public.\n\nAdditional business: Caucus participants conduct additional committee elections and discuss the party platform to help prepare for the county convention.\n\nAfter the caucuses: Conventions\n\nThe delegates elected during the caucuses will attend county conventions in March. The delegates elected during the caucuses will attend county conventions in March. District conventions are held in April and state conventions in June.\n\nDelegates are further narrowed to attend the party national conventions in July and August.

These are the ...", "text": "The 2024 election cycle has kicked off, and the race is heating up even as Election Day is months away.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is seeking another term in the White House, and with former President Donald Trump's hat also in the ring, a 2020 rematch is a real possibility. Democrats are expected to fall firmly behind Biden, and Trump has held a stubborn lead in polls on the Republican side.\n\nWith mounting legal troubles, and several high-profile candidates aiming to unseat him, however, Trump is not yet a sure-fire winner.\n\nHere are the latest developments on the path to the 2024 election:\n\nDEMOCRATS\n\nDespite concerns over his age, Biden remains a strong frontrunner for his party's nomination. Several lesser-known Democratic candidates are mounting challenges to the president, but they have yet to gain much traction.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nBackground: First elected in 1972, Biden served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before being elected vice president in 2008, mounting a victory alongside former President Barack Obama. After serving two terms as vice president, he took a brief hiatus from government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020.\n\nViews: Biden's campaign is focused on the \"battle for the soul of America,\" doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago. He said the question facing the nation is \"whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer.\"\n\nDean Phillips\n\nBackground: Phillips represents Minnesota in the House of Representatives and was first elected to Congress in 2018. Before entering politics, Phillips made his name as a businessman, heading up Phillips Distilling and serving as chair of Talenti Gelato.\n\nHis views: Phillips is a moderate with a reputation in Washington for reaching across the aisle. A member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, one of his major legislative accomplishments was the creation of the Paycheck Protection Program, which he co-authored with Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy. The program provided loans to businesses to help them during the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nBackground: Williamson is a self-help author and spiritual leader who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020.\n\nHer views: Williamson supports abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for descendants of formerly enslaved Americans. She has suggested creating a U.S. Department of Children and Youth to increase child advocacy and a U.S. Department of Peace.\n\nREPUBLICANS\n\nSince his win in 2016, Trump has served as de facto leader of the Republican Party, his influence still looming large in Washington. After Trump-endorsed candidates suffered in the 2022 midterms, however, speculation swirled that there was an opening for a new leader to rise. Here are the candidates who have thrown their hat in the ring.\n\nRyan Binkley\n\nBackground: Binkley is CEO, president, and co-founder of the mergers and acquisitions conglomerate Generational Group. He is also a faith leader, co-founding and serving as the pastor at Create Church in Richardson, Texas.\n\nHis views: Binkley has said he hopes to prioritize balancing the budget, lowering health care costs, creating bipartisan immigration reform and putting more community emphasis on education. Binkley is against abortion rights. His campaign website says he was \"thankful\" when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, but that a \"culture of life\" means prioritizing adoption as well.\n\nChris Christie\n\nBackground: Christie was appointed U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey in 2001 and served for six years, before being elected governor of the state in 2010 and serving until 2018. Christie has been a prominent figure in the GOP for many years. In 2016, he mounted an unsuccessful presidential campaign and, despite prior criticism, ultimately endorsed Trump and later joined his campaign.\n\nHis views: Christie is anti-abortion, but does support some exceptions in the case of incest, rape and danger to the mother. He is not for a federal ban. Instead, he believes the issue should be left to the states. He has advocated for a more secure border to stem the flow of fentanyl into the country, saying earlier in his campaign he planned to deploy the National Guard.\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nBackground: DeSantis serves as the 46th governor of Florida. While in law school, DeSantis joined the U.S. Navy as a JAG officer, later deploying to Iraq for active duty. Before his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018.\n\nHis views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida. He is anti-abortion and has signed a 6-week abortion ban in his home state. On the border, DeSantis has been outspoken in his vision for a crackdown. He has promised to complete a border wall, reimpose the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, and possibly end birthright citizenship. Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to Former President Donald Trump.\n\nNikki Haley\n\nBackground: Haley started her political career in South Carolina's state legislature, where she served for 6 years before mounting a successful campaign for the governor's office in 2010. In 2016, former President Donald Trump nominated Haley to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a position she held for a year before unexpectedly stepping down in 2018.\n\nHer views: Haley opposes abortion rights and has been a vocal supporter of Israel in its ongoing war with Hamas. While on the campaign trail, she has focused on illegal immigration, advocating for a return of the Trump-era \"Remain in Mexico\" policy as well as the defunding of sanctuary cities. Haley has told voters she hopes to crack down on China's influence on the U.S. economy. She has supported Trump in the past but also criticized him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nBackground: Hutchinson was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to serve Arkansas' 3rd district in 1997. He served until 2001 when he was appointed director for the Drug Enforcement Administration and later undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security for former President George W. Bush's administration. After leaving Washington, he was elected 46th Governor of Arkansas. He served for two terms, from 2015 to 2023.\n\nHis views: On immigration, Hutchinson has promised to send more resources to Border Patrol as well as resume construction of a border wall. He opposes abortion and has said he would sign a federal ban if elected but supports exceptions. He is also a vocal critic of Trump, saying he \"is not the right leader” for the nation or the Republican Party.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nBackground: Ramaswamy is a former biotech investor who founded the pharmaceutical research company Roivant Sciences in 2014. He stepped down as CEO in 2021 after going more public with his opposition to ESG and 'woke' politics in the corporate sector. He moved on to found Strive Asset Management, before stepping down to dedicate time to his 2024 run.\n\nHis views: Ramaswamy is framing himself as an outsider, an entrepreneur-turned-political-hopeful who will give the establishment a run for its money. He has peddled ideas such as ending affirmative action programs and eliminating the Department of Education.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nBackground: Prior to 2016, Trump dabbled in politics, often sounding off on issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on former President Barack Obama's citizenship and the case surrounding the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump won the White House, serving a full four-year term before being defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.\n\nHis views: The former president has, without evidence, centered much of his campaign on the claim that his political enemies are fueling his ongoing criminal cases. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which his critics say was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.\n\nTHIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES\n\nThe potential of a tight Trump-Biden rematch opens the door for a third-party candidate to be integral in determining the results of the race. A third name on the presidential ballot could drain votes from either of the two major party nominees, tipping the scales toward either Biden or Trump.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nBackground: Kennedy is an environmental lawyer known for trumpeting a debunked theory that vaccines can be linked to autism. In 2017, Trump invited Kennedy to head up a presidential commission on vaccine safety.\n\nHis views: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the \"liberties guaranteed by the Constitution,\" according to his campaign website. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy opposed vaccine mandates, calling them an infringement on individual liberty and at times used the Holocaust as a historical comparison.\n\nCornel West\n\nBackground:West is an American academic and philosopher known for his progressive ideals. He has taught at several Ivy League institutions and works now as a professor of philosophy at Union Theological Seminary.\n\nHis views: West is a proponent of establishing Medicare for All, and barring oil and gas subsidies, as well as drilling on public lands. Long a vocal opponent of militarism, West's campaign website lists \"end the wars\" as a key priority, which would include disbanding NATO and banning nuclear weapons across the globe.\n\nJill Stein\n\nBackground: Stein is a doctor and organizer who has championed causes like campaign finance reform and environmental protection. She has run for president twice before, launching bids in 2012 and 2016.\n\nHer views: Stein paints herself as an outsider, coming in to disrupt a political system ruled by money and special interests. In her campaign launch video, posted to X, she called for an economic bill of rights including \"the right to a job, to health care, to housing, to food, education and more.\n\nCandidates who dropped out", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2023/06/05/iowa-caucuses-2024-what-to-know-how-they-work/70244890007/", "title": "What to know about the 2024 Iowa presidential caucuses", "text": "Register staff\n\nMuch of the U.S. political world is looking toward the Iowa caucuses in 2024.\n\nThe caucuses mark the first statewide vote on a field of candidates seeking the major parties' presidential nominations, effectively acting as a starting gun for the 2024 election.\n\nBut Iowa's caucuses aren't like a typical election, where you show up and cast a ballot.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\n2024 Iowa caucuses:Where and when are presidential candidates visiting Iowa?\n\nWhat are the Iowa caucuses?\n\nMembers of Iowa's political parties gather for caucus meetings every presidential election cycle. Caucuses are held locally across the state, with members attending to elect local party leadership, discuss the party's platform and support a presidential candidate.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans hold their caucuses separately, and with different rules.\n\nIn 2024, Iowa will no longer be the first state on the primary election calendar for both major parties. While Republicans will still recognize Iowa as first in the nation, the national Democratic Party has opted for South Carolina as its first state.\n\nWhen are the Iowa caucuses?\n\nRepublicans will caucus Jan. 15.\n\nHow do the Iowa caucuses work?\n\nTHE REPUBLICAN CAUCUSES\n\nPicking a candidate: Participants are asked to cast a vote for their preferred candidate for president. The 40 delegates who will represent Iowa at the Republican National Convention will be divided proportionally to the statewide vote.\n\nTallying votes: The votes are counted and the chair announces the number of delegates to be elected by the precinct to attend the county convention. That number is predetermined by the county party according to the number of votes cast for the Republican candidate for governor in 2022, which was Gov. Kim Reynolds.\n\nSelecting delegates: The delegates are nominated based on the candidates receiving the most votes and confirmed by all caucus participants.\n\nTHE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUSES\n\nIowa Democrats have dramatically changed the way they caucus in 2024.\n\nIn 2020, Democrats gathered at 7 p.m. on caucus night to physically stand in corners of the room to be counted on a first and second alignment. But that process is all gone now.\n\nIn an effort to simplify their process and make it more inclusive, Iowa Democrats have moved to an entirely mail-in system of casting their presidential preferences. Starting Nov. 1, Iowa Democrats could request an absentee presidential preference card, which functions like a ballot, that they can fill out and return to the state party until March 5, when results will be announced.\n\nThe party will still hold in-person caucuses on Jan. 15, but only to conduct other party business unrelated to picking a presidential nominee.\n\nWhere are the Iowa caucuses held?\n\nCaucuses are usually held at local public buildings, like schools, churches, union halls, fire stations. They can also be held at private buildings or homes depending on the needs and makeup of a precinct.\n\nThere are nearly 1,700 precincts total across the state, though sometimes different precincts will caucus in different rooms at the same location.\n\nMore:Where do I caucus? Republicans release Iowa Caucus sites for presidential nominations\n\nWho can caucus in Iowa?\n\nYou can caucus if you meet the following requirements:\n\nYou must be eligible to vote in the state of Iowa.\n\nYou will be 18 years old by Nov. 5, 2024. That means if you're 17 and turn 18 between the date of the caucuses and the general election, you can caucus.\n\nYou must be registered as a Republican to participate in the Republican caucus or as a Democrat to participate in the Democratic caucus. If you're registered under a third party or no party, you won't be able to caucus, unless you change your registration to Republican or Democrat, which you can do on caucus night.\n\nHow are results calculated in the Iowa caucuses?\n\nOnce caucus proceedings are done at a precinct, the results are immediately reported to the state party. The state party will verify the results and report them to the public and to news outlets.\n\nDelegates elected during the caucuses will later attend a series of conventions in Iowa and will later be narrowed to a group sent to the national party conventions. The Republican and Democratic presidential nominees are confirmed during those national conventions, which usually take place over the summer.\n\nWhich candidates can I support in the Iowa caucuses?\n\nRepublican candidates for president include former President Donald Trump, former South Carolina Gov. and U.N. Amb. Nikki Haley, entrepreneur and author Vivek Ramaswamy, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Texas businessman Ryan Binkley.\n\nCandidates who have dropped out include: Michigan businessman Perry Johnson, conservative commentator Larry Elder, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, former Vice President Mike Pence, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, and former Texas U.S. Rep. Will Hurd.\n\nMore:Iowa Democrats put 3 presidential candidates' names on mail-in caucus cards. Who's named:\n\nDemocratic candidates include President Joe Biden, U.S. Rep.

Andy Beshear was reelected, Ohio voters passed a ballot measure to protect abortion rights in the state and Democrats in Virginia won control of the state's Senate and House of Delegates.\n\nBut Republicans won in Mississippi, after Democratic candidate Brandon Presley conceded the state's governor race to Gov.

Tate Reeves defeats Democratic challenger Brandon Presley\n\nRepublican Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves won reelection on Tuesday, officially defeating Democratic challenger candidate Brandon Presley.\n\nReeves was favored in part because he – like other Southern Republicans – cast his opponent as a tool of national Democrats who support abortion rights and other policies rejected by conservatives from coast to coast.\n\n\"Joe Biden and his buddies have funded his campaign,\" Reeves said last week during his debate with Presley, which was marked by insults and interruptions.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nAnother blow to Youngkin: Virginia Democrats win House majority\n\nDemocrats in Virginia took the House of Delegates majority back from Republicans Tuesday, dealing Gov. Glenn Youngkin a major setback.\n\nYoungkin had rallied Republicans in the state behind a vision of a red Virginia and total Republican legislature. Democrats already put a stop to the governor's plans earlier on election night by holding their state Senate majority.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nBiden fares better than Youngkin on Virginia election night\n\nPresident Joe Biden released his list of Virginia endorsements over the weekend, including 23 Democrats running for both the House of Delegates and state Senate. Each faced competitive match ups against Youngkin-backed Republicans.\n\nBy midnight Tuesday, 16 of those races had been called, and all but one were wins for Biden's picks.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nPresley concedes race, congratulates Reeves\n\nAround 10:45 p.m. Tuesday, Democratic candidate Brandon Presley came to greet his supporters. He said he came up a little short on votes. Presley thanked his supporters and said the campaign was not about him.\n\n\"So many of you laid so much on the line to do this,\" he said.\n\nMinutes before, Presley spoke with Gov. Tate Reeves and congratulated him on the win.\n\n— Lici Beveridge\n\nDemocrats declare success in Virginia\n\nDemocrats Tuesday effectively won Virginia by holding on to their state Senate majority and officially stunting Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Republicans’ plans for a red Virginia.\n\nDemocrats had said they were “cautiously optimistic” heading into Election Day, particularly about their chances in the upper chamber. The deciding seat was called just before midnight Tuesday.\n\nTheir success means Youngkin will have an uphill battle with his proposed 15-week abortion limit, which Democrats in the state already blocked in January. Candidates on the left made abortion a top campaign message in 2023, and the final outcome could be a bellwether for 2024.\n\nHeather Williams, interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Monday that Democrats would consider winning just one chamber “a huge win.”\n\n“With this victory, Gov. Youngkin has been denied a governing trifecta and our newly elected majority stands ready to defend Virginia from Republican extremism,” Williams said in a statement Tuesday evening.\n\nThe House of Delegates majority has yet to be called, though Democrats currently lead in that chamber as well.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMember of ‘Central Park Five’ elected to NYC council\n\nYusef Salaam, one of the \"Central Park Five\" who was exonerated for a 1989 attack on a jogger, won election Tuesday to be a member of the New York City Council. Salaam ran unopposed.\n\nThen a New York-based real estate magnate, Donald Trump called for Salaam's execution, taking out a newspaper ad calling on New York state to re-institute the death penalty.\n\nSalaam and four other Black and Latino men were imprisoned after being wrongfully convicted for the 1989 rape and beating of a white jogger in Central Park. DNA evidence exonerated Salaam and the other co-defendants.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMom of daughter killed in Robb Elementary School shooting loses Uvalde mayor race\n\nCody Smith won the Uvalde, Texas, mayoral race. He defeated Kimberly Mata-Rubio, whose 10-year-old daughter Lexi Rubio was killed during the shooting at Robb Elementary School last year.\n\nSmith will succeed Mayor Don McLaughlin, who is stepping down after nearly 10 years leading the city to pursue a seat in the Texas House.\n\nHis campaign has called for “better communications among police agencies and mobilizing volunteers from the community to help those in need,” according to the New York Times.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVirginia Democrat makes history as state’s first transgender senator\n\nDanica Roem became Virginia’s first, and the country’s second ever, openly transgender state senator. Roem won her race in northern Virginia by defeating Republican opponent Bill Woolf by about four points.\n\nThe former journalist entered politics in 2017, when she became the first transgender state legislator in Virginia. Having served three terms in the Virginia House of Delegates, Roem ran for a state Senate seat following statewide redistricting ahead of 2023.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nOhio voters approve ballot measure to legalize marijuana\n\nOhio voters have voted to legalize recreational marijuana in the Buckeye State.\n\nIssue 2 would allow adults 21 and older to buy, possess and grow cannabis.

Andy Beshear \"to congratulate him on his re-election win tonight.\"\n\nBiden also hailed Ohio's approval of a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights.\n\n\"My Administration will continue to protect access to reproductive health care,\" said Biden, who plans to make abortion a key issue in his 2024 re-election campaign.\n\nBiden also appeared to take aim at former President Donald Trump on election night, sharing in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter \"Across the country tonight, democracy won and MAGA lost.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nOhio voters approve abortion ballot measure\n\nOhio voters on Tuesday approved a ballot measure to protect abortion rights until viability - typically around 24 weeks gestation - and the right to access contraception, fertility treatment and other services in the state.\n\nSince the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, abortion rights activists have been on a winning streak, with voters in six other states either passing measures to protect abortion access or rejecting efforts to restrict it.\n\nThe move sends a strong signal ahead of the 2024 election, when multiple other states will consider similar measures.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nAndy Beshear wins Kentucky governor race\n\nDemocratic incumbent Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won a second term on Tuesday, defeating Republican challenger Daniel Cameron.\n\nBeshear is one of the most popular governors across the country. Experts told USA TODAY ahead of Election Day that Beshear's charm coupled with incumbency would be the irresistible force that gave him an edge going into Tuesday.\n\n\"I'd like to think that it's about doing a good job, working as hard as you can every day and caring about people because we've been through a ton,\" Beshear told USA TODAY in an interview when asked about his first-term high marks.\n\n– Phillip M.

Polls will remain open there until 9 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe state’s top-of-the-ticket race is an open seat for state Supreme Court, which could play an important role in settling legal challenges in the 2024 presidential election in the battleground state.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nRhode Island makes history after electing its first Black representative\n\nDemocrat Gabriel Amo made history after winning Rhode Island’s 1st Congressional District Tuesday. He will be the state's first Black representative to Congress\n\nHe competed against Republican candidate Gerry Leonard for former Democratic Rep. David Cicilline’s seat. Cicilline stepped down this summer to become president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAmo most recently served as the deputy director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs under the Biden administration. – Sudiksha Kochi\n\nOhio Issue 2 election results: Voters consider marijuana ballot measure\n\nAn effort to legalize recreational marijuana in Ohio is passing, according to unofficial early votes.\n\nIssue 2 would allow adults 21 and older to buy, possess and grow cannabis.

Gwendolyn Gray is also running as an independent in the race.\n\nLouisiana held a gubernatorial election last month in which Republican Jeff Landry won the governor’s mansion in a race against Democrat Shawn Wilson.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nRhode Island could make history tonight by electing its first Black representative\n\nThe race between Democratic candidate Gabe Amo and Republican candidate Gerry Leonard for Rhode Island’s first congressional district seat could make history.\n\nThe two candidates are competing for former Democratic Rep. David Cicilline’s seat after he stepped down earlier this year to become president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIf Amo is elected, he could be the state’s first Black representative to Congress. He most recently served as the deputy director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs under the Biden administration.\n\n– SudEiksha Kochi\n\nMississippi election results: Some precincts given extra time due to ballot issues\n\nMany voting precincts in Hinds County have been given a one-hour extension to 8 p.m. to allow more people time to vote, according to the Mississippi Democratic Party. Party Chairman Cheikh Taylor said that extension could be changed to 9 p.m., but that has not been confirmed yet.\n\nSome locations in the county ran out of ballots, and the Hinds County Election Commission was in the process of trying to print more ballots and deliver them as time was running out on voting Tuesday afternoon, according to Pete Perry of the Hinds County Republican Party.\n\nAs many as nine precincts have run out of ballots.\n\n– Mississippi Clarion Ledger\n\nWhen is the next presidential election? Tonight is a prelude to Nov. 5, 2024\n\nThe political world is looking at these off-year elections for signs of what might happen in one year's time: The next presidential election on Nov. 5, 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Republican presidential candidates like former President Donald Trump and their aides are already analyzing how various issues will play out, from abortion rights to Trumpism.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin continues to avoid talking 2024\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin again sidestepped questions about a potential last-minute presidential bid, telling CNN Tuesday night he is “humbled” by the inquiries but “laser focused” on his state.\n\nYoungkin also dodged committing to endorse former President Donald Trump in 2024.\n\n“After polls close, I’m not going to endorse anyone,” Youngkin said. “I think the voters should choose who the nominee is, and then of course I will support the Republican nominee.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nThree critical races for Joe Biden to watch\n\nOne year out from the 2024 presidential election, the outcomes of Tuesday's off-year elections in a handful of states could provide major clues for President Joe Biden's road ahead.\n\nHere are three races you can bet the White House will be watching closely tonight:\n\nOhio: Ohio voters will vote on Issue 1, which would change the Ohio Constitution to add abortion protections. Abortion rights are an issue Biden and Democrats are looking to campaign on in 2024.\n\nVirginia: In another bellwether on the power of abortion politics, control of Virginia's state legislature is up for grabs.\n\nKentucky: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a rare Democrat leading a southern state, is by some metrics the most popular Democratic governor in the country. Yet he is in a fight to stave off Republican challenger Daniel Cameron, Kentucky's attorney general.– Joey Garrison\n\nActivists eye Black voter turnout in Mississippi after repeal of Jim Crow-era law\n\nMississippi is holding its first gubernatorial election since the overturning of a Jim Crow-era measure in Mississippi’s 1890 state constitution that targeted the power of Black voters.\n\nThe measure required any individual running for state office to win the majority of the popular vote and a majority of the state’s 122 House districts to be elected. If no candidate was able to do both, then the Mississippi House decided on the election outcome.\n\nIn 2020, voters repealed the system, instead requiring candidates to receive only a majority of the popular vote to get elected in the state.\n\n\"Now that it's just a popular vote, then the influence of the Black vote means more,\" said Charles V. Taylor Jr., the executive director of the Mississippi state conference of the NAACP.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nPolls close in parts of Kentucky\n\nPolls have closed in parts of Kentucky as voters consider whether to reelect Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear or replace him with Republican Daniel Cameron.\n\nMuch of Beshear’s first term was dominated by his response to a series of natural disasters and the pandemic. But his reelection campaign often focused on dire warnings about the future of abortion rights.\n\nCameron would be the nation’s first Black Republican to be elected governor if he wins. He has reaffirmed his support for the current Kentucky law, which bans all abortions except when carried out to save a pregnant woman’s life or to prevent a disabling injury.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nBallots run out at several Mississippi county precincts\n\nMultiple locations in Hinds County, Mississippi, ran out of ballots, and the Hinds County Election Commission was in the process of trying to print more ballots and deliver them as time was running out on voting Tuesday afternoon, according to Pete Perry of the Hinds County Republican Party.\n\nAs many as nine precincts have run out of ballots.\n\n\"The election commission did not print enough ballots for the precincts. That's the bottom line,\" Perry said. \"Folks have been standing in line for hours waiting to vote and many of them have left.\"\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are discussing options for keeping polls open after the 7 p.m. deadline.\n\n– Ross Reily\n\nVirginia election results: What's at stake this year?\n\nAbortion has emerged as a key voter concern in Virginia in 2023. Democrats have warned that a red Virginia would lead to further abortion restrictions, while Republicans defend their proposed 15-week limit, with exceptions, as a “common sense” compromise.\n\nOut of a list of issues ranging from crime to taxes, abortion was second most top of mind for voters in a Christopher Newport University Wason Center poll last month.\n\nNext on that list: K-12 education.\n\nVirginia Republicans have campaigned on “parents’ rights\" in education, a rallying cry that began in the state during Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s successful 2021 gubernatorial campaign.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nDan McCaffery vs. Carolyn Carluccio: Pennsylvania’s state Supreme Court race could shape 2024\n\nThis year, Democratic candidate Dan McCaffery and Republican candidate Carolyn Carluccio are competing for a spot on Pennsylvania’s state Supreme Court.\n\nIn recent years, lawsuits over voting disputes and allegations of election fraud have rocked Pennsylvania. After the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging Philadelphia officials violated state law while ballots were being tallied, which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed.\n\nWhoever is elected to the state's Supreme Court this year could be crucial, as fights could play out again in Pennsylvania in 2024.\n\nThe court has a 4-2 Democratic majority after the death of Justice Max Baer. If Carluccio were to be elected, the majority balance between parties wouldn’t change. But there have been cases where justices have deadlocked, even with a Democratic majority.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKy election results: Will the race for governor map out a blueprint for a Trump, Biden rematch?\n\nRepublican Daniel Cameron is competing against Democratic incumbent Andy Beshear in Kentucky's governor race on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans rule Kentucky politically, yet its liberal-leaning governor remains one of the country's most popular figures, even as the national Democratic brand takes a nosedive in the state.\n\nThose close to Cameron, who is a protege of Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., believe making this race a proxy battle for next year's likely presidential election rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump is the better counterpunch to the governor's popularity.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nDisinformation, AI and poll-worker problems: How elections this week could preview 2024\n\nElection experts told USA TODAY several statewide elections on Tuesday − which include governor races in Kentucky and Mississippi − could preview challenges that might arise during the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThat includes whether states can overcome challenges to recruit poll workers, adapt to voting law changes, maintain high voter turnout levels and combat the spread of disinformation.\n\n“There are elections all around the country that I think serve kind of as a bellwether for how next year will go,” said Tammy Patrick, CEO for programs at the National Association of Election Officials.\n\n− Rachel Looker and Joey Garrison\n\nWhat is today's election?\n\nThe 2023 election is what's known as an off-year election. It's not a year where voters will cast their ballots for a presidential candidate.\n\nThey also won't weigh in on a \"midterm\" race, which usually comes halfway into a president's term and can serve as a referendum on the commander in chief. .\n\nBut that doesn't mean there aren't contentious elections this year. From ballot measures on abortion rights and marijuana legalization, to competitive legislative races, Americans will still make their voices heard Tuesday night.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen do polls close?\n\nIt depends on your state or local area. Here's a look at some of the poll schedules across the country:\n\nIn Ohio, voters must cast ballots at their designated polling place between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.\n\nIn Kentucky, polls open at 6 a.m. and close at 6 p.m.\n\nIn Virginia, polling hours are from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nKentucky man allegedly threatens voters\n\nA Louisville man was arrested Tuesday after allegedly damaging a machine and threatening voters at a polling location on Election Day. The incident took place just after 9:15 a.m. Tuesday, according to area police.\n\nOfficers who responded found a man on the scene who was \"making threatening gestures toward voters\" while \"wielding a flag attached to a fishing pole.\" The man, identified by police as 40-year-old Jacen Cockerell, is also accused of damaging a voting machine by ripping off a printer that was attached to it.\n\nCockerell is charged with tampering/destruction of a voting machine and interfering with an election, both felonies, along with two misdemeanor counts of menacing.\n\n− Lucas Aulbach\n\nVirginia race results may be close and slow to come\n\nAll eyes might be on Virginia, but the country could have to be patient for the state’s final results.\n\nWith the state's deadline for mail in ballots at noon on Monday and some races potentially coming down to a tight margin, there's a “strong likelihood” that the outcome will not be set by the end of Election Day, said Heather Williams, interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\n\n“These races are on a razor's edge,” Williams said in a press conference Monday. “We want to prepare you all for a long wait.”\n\nIt could be a waiting game then to see if Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Republicans are successful in their push to turn the state legislature red, or whether Democrats there manage to hold their state Senate majority.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nMother of 10-year-old girl killed in Uvalde school shooting runs for mayor\n\nKimberly Mata-Rubio, whose 10-year-old daughter Lexi Rubio was killed during the shooting at Robb Elementary School last year, is running for mayor of Uvalde in this year’s election.\n\nMata-Rubio, 34, is seeking to succeed Mayor Don McLaughlin, who is stepping down after nearly 10 years leading the city to pursue a seat in the Texas House.\n\n“I grieve for the woman you would have become and all the difference you would have made in this world,” Mata-Rubio wrote on X when she announced her run. “I grieve for the woman I was when you were still here. But, one part of me still exist, I am still your mom. I will honor your life with action. This is only the beginning.\n\n− Ryan Autullo and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nColorado voters consider Proposition HH\n\nIn the Centennial State, voters will weigh in on a measure known as Proposition HH.\n\nThe proposal asks whether voters want the state to keep some amount of surplus tax revenue that Colorado's constitution requires be refunded to taxpayers. In exchange, the measure would lower property tax rates for a decade. A portion of the funds the state retains would be spent on education and rental assistance.\n\nThe proposal was introduced by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis and Democratic lawmakers.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nVirginia sends a 2024 signal\n\nVirginia might be the country's modern bellwether, with their constituents having a near-perfect track record for picking recent national election winners. But before 2024's national elections can officially begin, voters and activists from both parties in the state say they're focused on winning this year.\n\nSenators and representatives from the Virginia State Senate and House of Delegates are all up for reelection for the first time in four years.\n\nYoungkin and other Virginia Republicans hope to hold their majority in the state House and flip their Senate red, much like the national GOP aspires to keep the U.S. House of Representatives and take back the majority in the Senate. But Democrats are hoping to block Youngkin's conservative agenda into 2024 and beyond.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nOhio election results: Abortion ballot measure in the Buckeye State\n\nThe eyes of the nation are on Ohio as voters in the state head to decide on an abortion ballot measure that has the potential to rock the state and send a message to the rest of the country.\n\nOhio voters will consider Issue 1, a measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution through viability, typically around 24 weeks gestation.

Officials aim to earn your trust in 2024\n\nWASHINGTON − Ahead of another election cycle that is already shaping up to be contentious, federal and state election officials are in the midst of campaigns of their own to reassure wary voters about the integrity of casting their ballots.\n\nThey are recruiting poll workers, certifying voting machines and hosting lessons on how election systems work in community centers, classrooms and libraries.\n\nThe steps are needed, experts say, to restore voters' confidence in a system that, despite some flaws and outspoken election deniers, was mostly trustworthy and secure in the first place.\n\nThose fraud claims, in part, gave rise to calls for major overhauls of election systems in some states led mostly by Republican lawmakers. Some, particularly voters of color, were already skeptical of a system with a history of discrimination that hasn't always been open to them. New laws to restrict access has fueled that mistrust, experts said.\n\nMuch of the work of assuring voters will fall to local elections officials, experts said. Americans have more trust in their local election systems, which they’re more familiar with, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\n\n\"People know their local election officials. They know when they go to city or town hall that they trust the people that work there,'' said Rob Rock, Rhode Island's deputy secretary of state. \"It's really important to make sure that people understand the process.''\n\n–Deborah Barfield Berry and Terry Collins\n\nRead the story:Fearful of voter fraud?

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe cruel truth of American democracy, usually experienced by Democrats, is that a political party can get more votes than the other without winning much power.\n\nThis year, however, it’s Republicans who got more votes – more than 3 million more votes for GOP House candidates – and don’t have as much to show for it.\n\nRepublicans actually lost ground in the Senate, where Democrats will have a slim 51-49 majority. The GOP House majority, while an important check on the White House, is small and spread across a broad enough ideological spectrum that it will be difficult for potential House speaker Kevin McCarthy, or whoever is ultimately able to win that position, to use the majority to act decisively.\n\n“Simply put, Republicans picked up the votes they needed, just not where they needed them most. Clearly something or someone intervened, affecting the outcome of the election in the places that mattered,” Cook Political Report founder Charlie Cook wrote in November.\n\nVotes at that time were still trickling in from California and Washington, and the margins have thinned, but Cook argued that Republicans’ edge should have gained them 20-30 seats and a larger majority than the 222-212 margin they’re going to have in the House in January. There will be one House vacancy.\n\nInstead of suffering massive losses, Democrats lost a net of nine seats. It cost them the House majority, but at the same time made President Joe Biden appear strong. Presidents usually lose scores of seats in the House.\n\nRepublicans’ failure in the Senate has been attributed to poor statewide candidates who were sidetracked by personal issues and former President Donald Trump’s election fantasies.\n\nRepublicans aren’t used to this feeling\n\nThe GOP frequently, in recent years, gets more power even with fewer votes.\n\nTrump in 2016 and George W. Bush in 2000 both won the White House with fewer votes than their Democratic opponents. Democrats won substantially more votes than Republicans in 2012, when they reelected then-President Barack Obama, but Republicans kept the House majority.\n\nThe 2022 midterm is the first election in which Republican candidates got more votes than Democrats since 2014, when the GOP picked up House seats and the Senate majority.\n\nA close election = slim margins in the House and Senate\n\nNot everyone in a congressional district can vote, and not everyone did.\n\nThere was extremely good turnout in certain states, like Georgia, which featured hotly contested Senate and governor’s races and set records for midterm turnout, according to the state’s top election official, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\n\nTurnout was down in places like California, which featured statewide races that were not so hotly contested. The California Secretary of State’s office pegs turnout at 50.8% of voters, far below the more than 64% turnout it reported in the last midterm in 2018, but above the 42% turnout in 2014.\n\nRELATED: See how your votes aren’t equal\n\nFrustrations at the state level too\n\nRepublicans can also be frustrated that they failed to gain control of any new state legislatures.\n\nOn the one hand, it’s a historic failure by Republicans – the first midterm election since 1900 when the party out of power nationally did not gain control of at least one state chamber, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nOn the other hand, Republicans still control a majority of state houses after focusing on making gains in state politics for the past decade-plus. Republicans will still control both legislative houses in 27 states, compared with Democrats, who will control both houses in 19.\n\nFewer Americans overall voted\n\nThe overall US turnout rate for the 2022 midterm was 46.8% of the voting eligible population, according to the US Elections Project, which is run by the political scientist Michael McDonald at the University of Florida.\n\nThat’s down from more than 50% in 2018, but well above the 36.7% recorded by the project in 2014.\n\nThere is going to be a lot of debate about how controversial voting laws in key states like Georgia and Texas may have kept some people from voting. Read more on that from CNN’s Fredreka Schouten, who covers voting rights.\n\nIn a separate report, CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere notes that Black voter turnout was down in 2022, which has alarmed Democratic operatives as they look ahead to the coming presidential election.\n\nThe New York Times analyst Nate Cohn wrote this week that turnout was much higher in predominantly White areas than it was in predominantly Black and Hispanic areas. This could explain how Republicans got so many more votes without getting many more House seats. In many states, redistricting can clump like voters together, creating safe districts.\n\nSplit tickets are a thing\n\nIt’s also important to note here that while American voters have gotten more tribal in recent years, split-ticket voting is an important feature of the system.\n\nMore voters chose Republicans in House races, but a lot of voters supported both parties on their ballots.\n\nGeorgia, most notably, picked a Republican governor and a Democratic senator. But it wasn’t the only state to do so – Vermont, New Hampshire and Nevada also chose Democratic senators and a Republican governor.\n\nMaryland and Massachusetts went the other direction in 2022, replacing Republican governors with Democrats to match their senators. Kansas and Wisconsin chose Republican senators and Democratic governors.\n\nThe national popular vote is an interesting side note, but doesn’t mean much, as Republicans will tell you this year.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Or, Democrats may email their request forms to preferencecardrequest@iowademocrats.org.\n\nIowa Democrats have until 5 p.m. Feb. 19 to request a ballot. Those ballots will be mailed to participants beginning Jan. 12, 2024.\n\nIowans with questions or who wish to ask for a request form by phone can call a helpline at (515) 216-3893. The line will be monitored by Iowa Democratic Party staff and volunteers.\n\nThe request form requires the requester to attest that they are eligible to vote in the 2024 general election, that they are a registered Democrat and that they live at the address listed on the form.\n\nThey will also be required to attest that they have not participated in any other political party's caucus.\n\nHow and when do Iowa Democrats need to return their preference cards for the 2024 presidential primary?\n\nPreference cards must be put back in the mail and postmarked by March 5 in order to count.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party did not share any information Wednesday about how Democrats will be able to send in their preference cards.\n\nWhat will Iowa Democrats' 2024 presidential preference cards look like?\n\nThe party said the preference cards will have Democratic candidates' names printed on them, just as they would be on a ballot.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party's State Central Committee will meet Dec. 2 to vote on which candidates' names will appear on the preference cards.\n\nWhen will we know the results of Iowa's 2024 Democratic primary?\n\nIowa Democrats have said they plan to release the results on March 5, which is known as \"Super Tuesday,\" when voters head to the polls in more than a dozen states. But they have not said at what time they plan to announce the results.\n\nThe party says it plans to accept any preference cards postmarked by March 5, even if they arrive later. They have not yet said if there will be a cutoff date when they will no longer accept late-arriving results.\n\nThat means that the results the party releases on March 5 could change as late-arriving preference cards are counted.\n\nWho is the vendor and what will this cost?\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party will contract with a team led by Amber McReynolds, who is the founding CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonprofit that encouraged mail-in voting in the 2020 election.\n\nMcReynolds was appointed to the U. S. Postal Service board of governors by President Joe Biden and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2021. She formerly worked as director of elections for the city and county of Denver.\n\nHer LinkedIn profile lists her as the principal and founder of Strategy Rose LLC.\n\n\"It’s important to me that this process runs smoothly and that’s why we’re excited to partner with Amber and her team, which has a combined 50 years of election administration experience,\" Hart said in the news release.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party has not said how much it expects the process to cost, though it expects it will be less than the 2016 and 2020 caucuses.\n\nBecause it is not a state-run primary conducted by state infrastructure, the Iowa Democratic Party will bear the cost, like it always has for the caucuses. But since Iowa Democrats are no longer holding the first-in-the-nation contest, there's likely to be less money coming in from donors or through major fundraisers that helped support previous caucuses.\n\nHow will Iowa Republicans caucus in 2024?\n\nIowa Republicans will continue to caucus the same way they have for decades.

That should especially be the case when there is once-in-a-generation inflation and when the vast majority of Americans think the country is on the wrong track.\n\nInstead, Biden and the Democrats are in a position to have one of the four best midterms for the party controlling the White House in the last century.\n\nSo just what happened? It’s pretty clear that general election voters punished Republican candidates they saw as too extreme – on issues such as abortion and/or for being too closely tied to former President Donald Trump.\n\nStill, the election results were extremely unusual. I went back through the record books. Since 1922, there have been three previous instances of the president’s party gaining (or losing no) Senate seats and losing fewer than 10 House seats in the president’s first midterm.\n\nAll of them – 1934, 1962 and 2002 – are thought to be monumental achievements for the president’s party and major exceptions to rule, which suggests the party controlling the White House usually loses seats in a midterm.\n\nDemocrats’ performance this year has funneled down to the state level as well. We already know, based on projected races, that this will be the first time since 1934 that the president’s party had a net gain of governorships in a president’s first midterm. (1986 is the only other post-1934 midterm, regardless of when it fell in a presidency, when the president’s party had a net gain of governorships, though Ronald Reagan’s GOP had massive losses in the Senate that year.)\n\nThe shocking thing about this year (assuming the current trends hold) is that Biden is quite unpopular. His approval rating was 44% in the exit polls. His favorable rating was 41%.\n\nWe don’t have any polling from 1934, though considering Franklin Roosevelt won two landslide victories on either end of that midterm, he was likely quite popular.\n\nThe polling from 1962 and 2002 shows the presidents at the time (John F. Kennedy and George W. Bush respectively) with approval ratings north of 60%.\n\nThe ability for Democrats to defy expectations this year starts simply with whom Republicans nominated for statewide elections. Analysts, myself included, noted that Republicans seemed to have a candidate likability problem. Pre-election polling showed that Republicans in all the key races had negative net favorability ratings. Democrats in pretty much all the key races were better liked than their opponents.\n\nMany of those Republicans were endorsed by Trump and had said (at least at one point) that they believed he had won the 2020 election. (This, of course, is false, as Biden won the election.)\n\nThe exit polls bear out Republicans’ “candidate problem” in the 2022 midterms. In every Senate race (save Georgia) that Inside Elections had rated as a toss-up or only tilting toward a party before the election, more voters said the Republican candidate’s views were too extreme than said the same for the Democratic candidate.\n\nWe see this in gubernatorial elections, as well. Republicans nominated 2020 election deniers for governor in a number of blue or swing states. None of them has been projected a winner, and only Republican Kari Lake of Arizona has any chance of winning.\n\nPerhaps the lack of success by these GOP candidates shouldn’t be a surprise given that some 60% of voters – both in pre-election surveys and the exit polls – believe Biden was legitimately elected.\n\nStill, Democrats look to have scored an incredible achievement in the 2022 midterms, especially given how unpopular polls showed Biden was.\n\nThe last two Democratic presidents with approval ratings matching Biden’s in their first midterm (Bill Clinton in 1994 and Barack Obama in 2010) saw their party suffer a net loss of more than 50 House seats, at least five Senate seats and at least five governorships.\n\nTwo presidents on the trail\n\nOf course, bad Senate or gubernatorial candidates weren’t the only reason Republicans had a disappointing midterm election.\n\nOn the national level, there are two presidents in the spotlight: the current one (Biden) and the former one (Trump). Both men sported negative net favorable ratings, per the exit polls.\n\nThe fact that you have a current president and a former president who are both unpopular isn’t unusual. Both Obama and George W. Bush were unpopular before the 2010 midterm.\n\nWhat is unusual is that of the 18% who viewed neither Biden nor Trump favorably in the exit polls, 40% of them voted for Democrats. The backlash against one president this year may have been canceled out by the backlash against the other.\n\nIn 2010, a September CNN poll had Democrats winning just 21% of those who viewed neither Bush nor Obama favorably.\n\nThe reason for the difference between 2010 and 2022 is pretty obvious. I had pointed out before the election that Trump was getting more Google search traffic than Biden (i.e. the former president was in the minds of voters). Bush wasn’t receiving anywhere near the search traffic as Obama in 2010, though.\n\n‘Abortion first’ voters\n\nArguably, what truly made this midterm unique was abortion. Despite high inflation, only 31% of voters in the exit poll said it was the most important issue to their vote. A nearly identical percentage (27%) said abortion, and these voters overwhelmingly chose Democratic candidates for Congress.\n\nThis matches the dynamic we saw in the special House elections following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June. Democrats started doing considerably better than before the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nAnd while Republicans somewhat recovered their standing in national House polls in the closing weeks of the campaign, they never made it back to where they were during the spring.\n\nThe fact that “abortion first” voters overwhelmingly chose Democrats makes sense given that 60% of exit poll respondents said the procedure should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nWhen you put it all together, Biden and the Democrats appear to have done something others have tried – and failed – in previous midterms: They turned the election into a choice between two parties instead of the usual referendum on the president’s party.", "authors": ["Harry Enten"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/2022-midterm-election-day-takeaways/index.html", "title": "Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections: Battle for control of the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe battle for control of Congress is still up in the air, with the Senate coming down to three key races while Democrats and Republicans are still hanging onto hopes of winning a narrow majority in the House.\n\nRepublicans began Tuesday night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.\n\nBut in the hours that have followed, Democrats reclaimed ground. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN analyst: Here's what DeSantis' projected victory could mean for the GOP 02:18 - Source: CNN\n\nHere are takeaways as votes are still being counted in key races:\n\nQuestions over control remain\n\nElection Day is over but the fundamental questions of this election cycle remain unanswered.\n\nTo start, control of the Senate remains up for grabs. Fetterman’s victory in Pennsylvania, flipping a GOP seat, gave Democrats some breathing room as they await results from Arizona, Nevada and Georgia. Republicans now need to win two of those three to claim a majority, but the Georgia Senate race will go to a runoff in December after no candidate won more than 50% of the vote.\n\nThe shape of the House, too, remains uncertain. Republicans appear poised to take control but there are scant signs of the big night they were hoping for. As the votes continue to be counted, the coming days will likely reveal the strength of a new GOP House majority – and whether a potentially underwhelming performance undermines Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s standing within a rancorous GOP conference. The GOP is now in a race-by-race fight that will ultimately determine McCarthy’s ability to govern.\n\nKey states are still counting ballots\n\nVotes are still being counted in several key states – including Arizona and Nevada, where a sweep of the Senate races by either party would result in control of the chamber.\n\nArizona and Nevada also have competitive races for governor, secretary of state and more to be decided in the coming days.\n\nIn Arizona, as of late Wednesday night, about 600,000 votes remained to be counted – the bulk of them in Maricopa County, the home of Phoenix and the state’s most populous. Those votes could decide the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican nominee Blake Masters, as well as the gubernatorial contest between Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and Republican former television journalist Kari Lake, an election denier.\n\nIn Nevada, CNN estimates that as of Wednesday night, about 160,000 known ballots remain to be counted. Mail-in ballots can be accepted through Saturday so more could be en route to elections offices. The state is the home of a crucial Senate contest between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican challenger Adam Laxalt.\n\nThe final House landscape also depends on races that have not yet been decided as a handful of states, including California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona, continue to count ballots.\n\nIn Alaska, a Republican will win the Senate race – but it’s not clear whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski or her Donald Trump-backed challenger Kelly Tshibaka will cross the 50% threshold to avoid the race being decided by ranked choice voting. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola leads the House race there, but it’s also not clear whether that race’s outcome will be decided by ranked choice voting.\n\nDemocrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority\n\nRepublicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country.\n\nFetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats. While the race long represented the best chance for the party to pick up a Senate seat in 2022, Fetterman’s near fatal stroke in May – and the lengthy recovery he endured in public – injected uncertainty into the race. But on Wednesday morning, the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor gave Democrats the pick-up they needed to have a better chance to hold the United States Senate next year.\n\n“Fetterman’s win makes it next to impossible for the GOP to get a majority. Pennsylvania was the fire wall,” said Mike Mikus, a Democratic operative based in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nAlthough a number of key Senate races remain uncalled – including contests in Nevada and Arizona and in Georgia which will go to a runoff – earlier on Tuesday, CNN projected one Democratic incumbent: Sen. Maggie Hassan, a first-term Democrat who faced Republican retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, won her race.\n\nA Hassan loss would have effectively ended Democrats’ hopes of retaining their majority. And CNN projected Wednesday that Republican Ron Johnson will keep his Senate seat in Wisconsin. The Democrats are still defending seats in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – so it will take time to settle Senate control.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN political director breaks down top issue for most voters 03:40 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump’s no good, very bad night\n\nFew Republicans were more involved in these midterms than Trump and the former president had a particularly bad night.\n\nIt appears that Trump knows it, too: He is “livid” and “screaming at everyone,” a Trump adviser who has been in contact with Trump’s inner circle told CNN on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe most striking loss for Trump came in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate, Oz, fell to Fetterman in what was the most expensive Senate race in the country. Trump endorsed Oz during the contentious Republican primary, effectively pulling through a brutal primary and narrowly into the general election. But where the former president’s backing was decisive in the primary, it was an albatross in the general election for a Republican Senate candidate who was attempting to make inroads in the suburbs by touting his own moderation.\n\nWhile Trump did score some Senate wins – Trump-backed Republican JD Vance defeated a stronger-than-expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan in the Ohio Senate race, while Republican Ted Budd defeated Democrat Cheri Beasley in North Carolina – those wins have so far been limited to Republican states.\n\nIn the House, too, some Trump acolytes lost in what were seen as competitive contests that Republicans needed to win if they were going to build a significant majority in the legislative body.\n\nIn New Hampshire, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt lost to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in what was seen as a highly competitive contest. In North Carolina, Trump-backed Republican Bo Hines lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel in a race that was widely seen as a test of the former president’s influence. And in Ohio, Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert who bullishly touted her ties to Trump.\n\nTrump’s evening was particularly bad when viewed through the lens of DeSantis’ romp of a night.\n\nDeSantis, Trump’s clearest rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, overwhelmingly won reelection on Tuesday, crushing Democrat Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points, continuing to consolidate Latino support in Florida and even by winning populous counties like Miami-Dade.\n\nThe headline in Trump’s one-time hometown paper, the New York Post, said it all: “DeFUTURE,” the headline blared, showing the Florida Republican on stage with his family.\n\nDemocrats hold their own in the suburbs\n\nIn 2018, the suburbs delivered Democrats the House majority. In 2020, they vaulted Joe Biden to the presidency.\n\nAnd in 2022, suburbs across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave.\n\nRepublicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet.\n\nIn a district made up of the Kansas City suburbs, CNN projected Democrat Sharice Davids would win reelection. In Ohio, CNN projected two suburban wins: Democrat Greg Landsman defeated Republican Rep. Steve Chabot in a district that included Cincinnati and some of the surrounding suburbs and Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert in a district that includes areas around Cleveland and all of Akron. In Illinois, CNN projected that Democratic incumbent Lauren Underwood would win reelection against Republican Scott Gryder in the Chicago suburbs. And in Virginia, CNN projected Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger would win reelection, largely because of the votes she picked up from the suburbs of Washington, DC.\n\nRepublicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.\n\nAnother January 6 committee member loses\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elaine Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected.\n\nLuria’s loss to Kiggans, Republican Navy veteran, was the latest demonstration that the lasting focus on the insurrection – even as it sheds light on a dark chapter in the nation’s capitol – is a political anchor for those involved.\n\nLuria had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.\n\nAnd Luria provided the latest evidence that voters are not rewarding those involved in the committee probing the insurrection. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was routed in a primary by Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman, while Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Florida Democrat, both retired rather than seeking reelection.\n\nDeSantis’ big win could be a 2024 launchpad\n\nDeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination.\n\nThe easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.\n\nThe most eye-popping outcome – and one that demonstrates the breadth of DeSantis’ appeal in the eyes of Sunshine State voters – came in Miami-Dade County, which is heavily Hispanic and historically a huge source of Democratic votes.\n\nRepublicans had made gains there in recent years: Hillary Clinton defeated former President Trump there by 29 percentage points in 2016. DeSantis did slightly better in the 2018 governor’s race, losing the county by 21 points. Trump made inroads there in 2020, losing by just 8 points. But a GOP candidate for governor hadn’t actually won Miami-Dade County since Jeb Bush in 2002.\n\nThe political reality is straightforward: Democrats have no realistic path to victory in statewide races in Florida without big wins in Miami-Dade County. That reality makes county’s outcome into an exclamation point on a dominant GOP performance.\n\nDeSantis’ win comes as a battle over the future of the Republican Party takes shape, with Trump signaling a potential 2024 announcement next week. Exit polls in Florida showed that 45% of the state’s voters would like to see DeSantis run for president, compared to 33% who want Trump to run in 2024.\n\nIn a victory speech Tuesday night, DeSantis offered a glimpse at how he might describe his governorship to a national audience. Touting his refusal to impose lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said that Florida “was a refuge of sanity when the world went mad.” He also described the state as “where woke goes to die” and “a ray of hope that better days still lie ahead.”\n\nGOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida\n\nRepublicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues.\n\nThe strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population.\n\nBut Latinos are not a monolith, and there were more important signs in Florida, too: Another traditional Democratic stronghold won by DeSantis was Osceola County, a majority Latino county south of Orlando with a heavily Puerto Rican population.\n\nHowever, it’s not clear if those GOP gains are materializing outside Florida.\n\nOne key gauge was the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where three House races in heavily Latino districts were up for grabs. Democrats have won two of those races, CNN projected. Rep. Henry Cuellar, the only House Democrat who votes against abortion rights, won reelection in his Laredo-based 28th District, while Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez defeated Republican Rep. Mayra Flores – the two were drawn into the same district – in the McAllen-based 34th District. The 15th District race, which was widely seen as the GOP’s best chance, is still too early to call.\n\n“The RED WAVE did not happen. Republicans and Independents stayed home,” Flores tweeted just after midnight.\n\nArizona and Nevada, both competitive states with significant Latino populations, are also important to watch. So are a spate of House races in California, where it could take days or weeks for winners to become clear.\n\nDemocrats had a good night in governor’s races\n\nCNN projected Wes Moore the winner in Maryland and Maura Healey the victor in Massachusetts, two seats that are currently in Republican control. Democratic governors in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico and others are projected to hold their seats, while Democrat Josh Shapiro defeated Republican Doug Mastriano in a seat where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf was term limited.\n\nBut as Tuesday turned into Wednesday, Democrats have a shot at strengthening their grip of governor’s offices across the country.\n\nCNN projected Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly the winner in her bid for reelection on Wednesday morning, while Democrats are competitive in Oregon and Nevada, two states that would represent Democratic holds, and Arizona, a state that would represent a Democratic flip.\n\nThe night is far from an unmitigated victory for Democrats – and how the three outstanding key races tip could shift the way Democrats see their gubernatorial successes. And some of the most famous Democratic gubernatorial candidates did lose: CNN projected Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams failed to unseat Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp in a rematch of their 2018 race, and Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke was unable to defeat Republican incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nBut few Democratic operatives would have said weeks ago that they would be in line to have this kind of night in governors races.\n\nAbortion rights, and its defenders, triumph\n\nIn referendums and races where the Supreme Court’s June decision to reverse Roe v. Wade was a central issue, voters sided overwhelmingly with Democrats and in favor of abortion rights.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles.\n\nMichigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights.\n\nVoters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers had made abortion a central focus of his campaign. Republicans there have rejected Evers’ efforts to amend the state’s 1849 abortion ban to include exceptions for rape and incest. He highlighted that split by calling the GOP-led legislature into a special session in October and urging them to act on the issue – and then used lawmakers’ decision to adjourn in less than 30 seconds without taking action as a campaign cudgel.\n\nIt’ll take time to sort out which issues were decisive, particularly in suburban House battles. But according to CNN exit polls, 27% of voters in House races said abortion was the most important issue – second only to inflation at 31%. Among those who cited abortion as the most important issue, 76% voted Democratic.\n\nA night of firsts\n\nUp and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Healey is poised to become the state’s first elected female governor and the nation’s first out lesbian state executive. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, has been elected the first female governor of Arkansas. And Moore will be the Maryland’s first Black governor.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Massachusetts elected its first female governor.

With all House districts in the commonwealth projected by CNN, the results hint at a night where Democrats could lose the House – but would not face a 2014-style wave.\n\nDemocrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020.\n\nCNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. Republicans were hoping Wexton could fall on Tuesday if the night was particularly bad for Democrats.\n\nIn an even more competitive race, CNN projected Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. Spanberger was widely seen as a vulnerable incumbent, especially after Republican Glenn Youngkin carried the district in his successful gubernatorial campaign in 2021.\n\nBut Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen.

(AP) — A presidential primary filing period marked by lights, cameras and (in)action has come to a close at the New Hampshire secretary of state's office.\n\nTwo weeks before he dropped out, former Vice President Mike Pence was the only candidate to have his own studio lights shining on him as he signed up for the yet-to-be-scheduled Republican contest next year.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's staff ripped up tape from the carpet that reserved spots for local journalists and put his campaign photographer up front instead.\n\nPresident Joe Biden skipped signing up altogether, in deference to changes that the Democratic National Committee is making to the nominating calendar.\n\nWhile Biden will rely on a write-in campaign, the Democratic ballot hardly will be blank. U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota simultaneously announced his campaign and signed up to get on the ballot on Friday, the final day of the filing period. Self-help author Marianne Williamson filed her paperwork Oct. 12.\n\nBut wait, there's more.\n\nThere will be 21 names on the Democratic ballot and 24 on the GOP ballot. That is fairly routine in New Hampshire, where there is one state lawmaker for every 3,400 people. In 2020, 33 Democrats and 17 Republicans signed up. The all-time high was in 1992, when 61 people got on the ballot.\n\nThe simplest path to get on the New Hampshire presidential primary ballot is to submit a Declaration of Candidacy and pay a $1,000 filing fee. The minimal filing requirements usually result in a crowded field.\n\n\"For any person who in the fourth grade had the dream to grow up and be president of the United States, New Hampshire is a place where they can come and try to make that happen,\" said Secretary of State David Scanlan. \"And that certainly is reflected by the large number of lesser-known candidates that we have file for our presidential primary.\"\n\nThe entries included Republican Rachel Swift, who showed up in a skirt and top decorated with American flags and said her platform includes legalizing marijuana and prostitution, ending human trafficking and reengineering Ford Focus cars to run for 30 years and a million miles. Democrat Terissa Bukovinac, who appeared surprised to have an audience of reporters when she signed up, wants her party to join the push to outlaw abortion.\n\n\"I am hoping to bring visibility to the victims of abortion and help create a strong place for pro-life Democrats in the political sphere,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to Trump and Pence, the Republican ballot will include the six other candidates who qualified for the most recent debate: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and business entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nNew Hampshire has held the nation's first presidential primary for the past century, successfully fending off challenges from other states, thanks in large part to a New Hampshire law that gives the secretary of state sole authority to set the date and mandates that it be at least a week before any similar contest. In 2024, New Hampshire will defy a new Democratic calendar that has South Carolina leading off presidential primary voting on Feb. 3 and Nevada going three days later.\n\nThe changes, made at Biden's request, are meant to better empower Black and minority voters by leading off in a state with more people of color than New Hampshire has. Scanlan counters that no state truly represents the nation's demographics and that New Hampshire deserves to stay first for a multitude of reasons: It's neither red nor blue, it's a small state geographically and it has a small media market. Voter turnout is high and citizens are engaged, he said.\n\n\"Whether it's the president or the former president or if it's one of the lesser-knowns that have come in, if that person walks down Main Street and wants to engage with a New Hampshire voter, they're going to be received and treated politely and with respect,\" he said. \"That's the role we play.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/30"}]}

Ron DeSantis, perhaps Trump's biggest rival, made his first Iowa pit stop on Friday.\n\nBut why are so many Republicans flocking to Iowa and New Hampshire? Here's a brief explainer.\n\nWhy are Iowa and New Hampshire important?\n\nSince 1972 Iowa has held the crucial first-in-the-nation caucuses. Since 1920, New Hampshire has held the first primary of the presidential campaign season.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary has helped to make or break campaigns by building national excitement and momentum for the winners. Low-ranking losers have generally dropped out of the presidential race following their defeat.\n\nIn some years, successful candidates were able to overcome a loss in the two states and capture the presidency.\n\nTrump lost the Iowa caucuses to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016. President Joe Biden lost in Iowa in 2020, calling it a “gut punch.”\n\nHe also lost the New Hampshire primary to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and then he went on to become the Democratic presidential nominee after building momentum from winning the South Carolina primary.\n\nWill he or won't he?:Republican Sen. Tim Scott weighs a historic White House bid\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nTimothy Hagle, political scientist at the University of Iowa and author of \"Riding the Caucus Rollercoaster 2020: The Democrats' Race to Win the Iowa Caucuses,\" said Republicans have been late this election cycle to spending time introducing themselves to Iowans mainly due to Trump.\n\n\"We normally see people coming here fairly early and in fact we would often see people coming and helping out our candidates in the midterm elections,\" Hagle said.\n\n2024 race:Nikki Haley begins Iowa courtship, tells those considering Trump to 'look forward'\n\n\"Trump is unusual. He's not an incumbent, but as a former president, who's running again, he certainly has much higher name recognition and support base than most other candidates would have,\" he added. \"And so I think it's kind of delayed some people for getting into the race.\"\n\nHaley is the only major candidate to have entered the race to challenge Trump for the GOP nomination. Other candidates like DeSantis are inching closer to a formal presidential announcement and are holding tours and meetings with Republicans across the nation.\n\nBut Trump continues to cast a shadow over the race for the nomination.\n\nTrump's support in Iowa eroding but still leading in New Hampshire\n\nA new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows Trump's support may be fading.\n\nLess than half of Iowa Republicans, 47%, said they would \"definitely\" vote for Trump according to the poll; In June 2021, 69% said they would support him./ That's a 22 percentage point drop.\n\nTrump and DeSantis have roughly the same \"very favorable\" rating at 44% and 42% respectively, which is well above Haley at 16% and Pence at 17%.\n\nYet in a survey of New Hampshire voters released Tuesday, 58% said they would support Trump, while only 17% would support DeSantis—a 41 percentage point lead.\n\nIowa Poll:Donald Trump’s Republican support erodes in Iowa, even as many remain committed\n\nThe survey, conducted, by Emerson College Polling/7 News WHDH, also showed Gov. Chris Sununu polling at 7%.\n\nTyler Clark, a New Hampshire Republican consultant, said voters in the Granite State are looking to choose a Republican who can also help local and state GOP candidates win in 2024.\n\n\"What we've been dealing with since 2016 is we haven't been able to recapture that initial Trump factor spark where it propelled our candidates in areas that we underperformed in the past,\" Clark said.\n\nClark said Trump helped the GOP perform well with rural voters, \"but we've lost suburban educated voters the last few cycles.\"\n\nWhose running for president?:Current and former governors offer glimpse into what could be contentious 2024 presidential election\n\nDNC shakes up primary calendar\n\nThis year, the Democratic National Committee approved a plan that reorders the 2024 primary season.\n\nThe plan demotes Iowa and moves South Carolina in first position. Next, Nevada and New Hampshire hold joint primaries. The next two states in the early primary season are Georgia and Michigan.\n\nYet, New Hampshire state law requires it to be first in the primary season, which has caused consternation for local Democrats. And Iowa law also requires it to be the first-in-the-nation caucus.\n\n\"Because of the uncertainty, we don't know what the Democrats are going to do,\" said Hagle of the dilemma Iowa Democrats face.\n\nClarke, meanwhile, said New Hampshire voters take their first-in-the-nation status seriously.\n\n\"Despite what pundits in D.C. say or party bosses, particularly (what) the DNC says about how we're not representative of the rest of the country, demographically, I think we produce better candidates because we really take it seriously,\" Clarke said.\n\nThe race to 2024:Democrats approve 2024 primary calendar that demotes Iowa, boosts South Carolina", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/08/30/election-2020-why-is-iowa-the-first-state/2165043001/", "title": "Iowa caucus: The history of why Iowa is first-in-the-nation", "text": "Iowa's position as the first state to weigh in on the country's presidential nominees was under scrutiny again Tuesday, after chaos and confusion around reporting the vote count in the previous night's caucuses forced the state's Democratic Party to delay the release of the official results.\n\nSome other states don't have their primaries until June, a month before the national convention. So why does Iowa start so early? More importantly, out of all the states, why is Iowa first?\n\nThe answer to those questions involves a little bit of pragmatism, a little bit of political conflict, and, these days, a strong desire to stick to tradition.\n\nMore:The Democratic Party is planning to reject Iowa's virtual caucus plan. Here's how we got here.\n\nIowa has almost always held caucuses for presidential selection rather than the primary system used in other states like New Hampshire, which is the second state to vote on presidential picks. But it wasn't always first in the nation.\n\nRoots in the 1960s\n\nAfter the tumultuous 1968 Democratic convention, the DNC decided it needed to open up its process to lessen the power of party leaders and involve more grassroots activists. That paved the way for the shake-up that led to Iowa moving to first on the calendar.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Democrats in Iowa said they were frustrated with the state's caucus system, which they felt was run by party bosses and didn't respond to grassroots voices and desires.\n\nChanges to address this problem involved holding separate district and state conventions, which meant that the whole caucus process needed to start earlier.\n\nKathie Obradovich, the Register's opinion editor, speaking for a video about Iowa's caucus history, says that \"the old story is that they figured out how long it would take to print all the paperwork on their elderly mimeograph machine.\"\n\nSo Iowa was first.\n\nWhen did the caucuses become powerful?\n\nThe question remained: who cared? In 1972, Gary Hart cared. Obradovich recounts the story: \"In the 1972 presidential race, Sen. George McGovern’s campaign was managed by a young political whiz kid named Gary Hart. Hart noticed that Iowa was going to be first in the nation and decided to make a bid here as a way to get (McGovern) a media boost before the New Hampshire primary. It worked.\"\n\nIn 1976, Jimmy Carter replicated McGovern's success. The media paid attention paid to his performance in Iowa and it illustrated the caucuses as an important metric of a candidate's strength. Carter went on to become president.\n\nBut Iowa had to fight for its right to be first\n\nHowever, this first-in-the-nation status wasn't set in stone.\n\nPrompted by Carter's re-election loss in 1980, the national Democratic Party theorized that the drawn-out nomination process was more of a hindrance than a help to their party's nominee. They rolled out new rules that would restrict how early any state's nomination processes could be held, but still allowed Iowa to caucus first. At that point, it seemed like everyone was happy.\n\nThen, Vermont moved up the date of its straw poll. In response, New Hampshire made its primary earlier. In defiance of the national party, Iowa chose to move the caucuses earlier than its nationally assigned date to maintain the buffer between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.\n\nIn November of 1983, with the caucuses (whatever their date was to be) soon approaching, state party officials gathered to resolve the disagreement and vote on the official date. Those in favor of the earlier date wanted to preserve both Iowa and New Hampshire's unique roles in the nomination process. Those in favor of the later date wanted the whole process shortened to help the eventual nominee.\n\nThe party leaders voted 20-10 for the earlier date. Iowa's status as first in the nation was, at least for the moment, secured.\n\n\"Today,\" Obradovich said, \"Iowa caucuses are first-in-the-nation mainly because the state insists on remaining first.\"\n\nbecause of the outsized media attention on Iowa, many candidates build their strategy around it, seeing it as a way to give them a catapult of momentum through the primaries. Barack Obama credits the Iowa caucuses for giving him the initial momentum that propelled him to the White House.\n\nAs long as the state is first, it's seen as the first serious litmus test of a candidate. And as Iowa indicates or influences later success, candidates will keep coming, journalists will keep reporting, and in February, the eyes of the nation will stay on Iowa.\n\nClare Ulmer is a politics reporter for the Register.

The date also means candidates vying for the New Hampshire’s 22 delegates have less than 10 weeks to win over its historically independent-minded voters.\n\nFor some onlookers, the announcement comes as little surprise. New Hampshire is required by state law to hold that first-in-the-nation primary, and, after Iowa Republicans announced in June their Jan. 15 caucus, many predicted New Hampshire would hold its primary a week later.\n\n“New Hampshire has held the first-in-the-nation presidential primary election for over 100 years,” Scanlan said Wednesday. “In today's society, it seems that we're quick to eliminate traditions and ignore them. But years from the people of this country will really be glad we still have this one.”\n\nA Democratic shuffle\n\nWhile not unexpected, Scanlan’s decision does put the last nail in the coffin for Granite State Democrats in their battle with the Democratic National Committee over its reshuffled primary calendar.\n\nLast year, in a move to elevate more diverse voters, the DNC ripped New Hampshire of its first-in-the-nation status, forcing the state party to move its primary to Feb. 6, on the same day as Nevada, or risk losing critical delegates. The updated calendar also moved South Carolina's Democratic primary to Feb. 3, ahead of New Hampshire and three weeks before the Palmetto State's Feb. 24 GOP contest.\n\nNew Hampshire’s GOP-run legislature has refused to change the state’s election laws to accommodate the DNC, and Scanlan previously said there was “no chance” he would break the state's tradition of going first.\n\nNow that the primary date officially defies the DNC calendar, New Hampshire Democrats are likely to lose many of their 2024 delegates to the national convention, and so will any candidate who participates in the election.\n\nThat includes Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, who launched a longshot bid challenging President Joe Biden last month in New Hampshire, despite warnings that he would not be eligible to win delegates in the state.\n\nBiden opted not to file in New Hampshire, citing the potential penalties. As a result, his supporters in the state have launch a write-in campaign, urging Democrats and independents, who can cast a ballot in either party primary, to vote for the president anyway.\n\nNew Hampshire's Democratic Party will not be involved in the write-in effort. After Scanlan's announcement, Party Chair Ray Buckley addressed the legacy of first-in-the-nation in a statement, saying: \"For more than 100 years, presidential candidates of both parties have come to the Granite State time and again because, no matter who they are, where they come from or how much money they have, they know they will get a fair shot from Granite Staters.\"\n\nChoosing the date\n\nScanlan, a Republican, previously told USA TODAY he was intentionally waiting to announce the date of the primary until after the filing window closed Oct. 27, because of the state's dispute with the DNC.\n\nHe also likely wanted to ensure other states did not pre-empt New Hampshire’s contest, said Jim Splaine, a longtime New Hampshire politico and sponsor of the law mandating the state's first-place status.\n\n\"He could wait another month if he needed to,\" Splaine said. \"But he's patiently waited ... checking with the other states to make they aren't going to play hopscotch with their dates.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Scanlan expressed concern over Iowa Democrats’ proposal to use absentee ballots in their caucuses – a move he argued would effectively turn the format into a primary.\n\nThose worries were alleviated in October when Iowa Democrats announced they would comply with the new Democratic calendar, which also stripped them of their early-voting position. Democrats in the Hawkeye State will begin mailing presidential preference cards to voters Jan. 12 but will wait to announce the results until March 5, or Super Tuesday.\n\nWhile Iowa Democrats plan to hold in-person meetings on Jan. 15, the same day Republicans caucus in the state, all their presidential voting will occur exclusively through the mail, the party said.\n\nScanlan last month described the plan as a “positive” step toward “preserving the traditional positions of the Iowa Caucuses and New Hampshire Presidential Primary.”\n\nA sprint to the finish\n\nWith the primary date officially set, the countdown begins for candidates and election officials alike who will spend the next two months furiously preparing for a smooth election day.\n\nThis year, 24 candidates will appear on the New Hampshire GOP ballot – including the qualifiers for the third GOP debate last week and a slew of smaller contenders. Republicans like former Vice President Mike Pence and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who filed to appear on the ballot but dropped out before the contest, could also pick up votes.\n\nOn the Democratic side, voters will have 21 candidates to choose from, including Phillips.\n\nBut the candidates don't appear phased by the now fast-approaching primary deadline. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said the date “doesn’t really matter” after a town hall last week.\n\n“No one's been here more than me,” Christie, who announced his campaign at Saint Anselm College, said. “It’s not like I'm running out of time to make an impression.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/01/iowa-caucus-nevada-early-primary-election-new-hampshire-2024-presidential-election-primaries/7489061002/", "title": "Nevada lawmakers try to jump Iowa caucuses with early primary ...", "text": "Lawmakers in Nevada are angling to jump to the front of the presidential nominating calendar, passing a bill this week that seeks to place the state's contest ahead of both Iowa's caucuses and New Hampshire's primaries.\n\nThe state Legislature this week approved and sent to the governor AB126, a bill transforming Nevada's caucuses into primary elections and setting their date early in the year in an effort to supersede Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\n“It’s time for Nevada to take its rightful place, not just first in the West but in the nation, as a diverse state, a state with diverse issues,” said Nevada Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation.\n\nThe bill still must be approved by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak to become law, and the change would also need support from the national political parties. Without the parties' backing, Nevada could be denied delegates to national party conventions or face other sanctions.\n\nEven if the change does advance, it would almost certainly be met with resistance from leaders in Iowa and New Hampshire. Both states have laws on the books that require their presidential nominating contests to be held before any other similar contests.\n\nThe Nevada legislation sets its primary for the first Tuesday in February of a presidential election year. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, in particular, has acted aggressively in the past to move New Hampshire's primary date as early in the year as necessary to remain first behind Iowa.\n\nMore:A year after Iowa caucus collapse, the stage is set for a bitter debate over the presidential nominating calendar\n\n\"Iowa going first does not take away from other state’s abilities to hold primaries, it adds to the conversation,\" Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Ross Wilburn said in a statement. \"I believe Democrats have a real opportunity in Iowa to connect with a diverse electorate that includes voters of color and rural working class Americans. Iowa also provides the perfect grassroots opportunity for candidates who don’t have the name recognition or funding to break through in larger states. We are working hard to ensure Iowa continues to have a crucial voice in the Presidential nominating process.\"\n\nFormer U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has led the lobbying effort to bump Nevada to the front of the line. He and other Democrats have seized on Iowa's calamitous 2020 caucuses to argue the calendar and the caucuses no longer serve their intended purpose.\n\nIowa Democrats in February 2020 hosted the largest, most diverse field of presidential candidates in history. But the party failed to deliver timely, accurate results, paving the way for renewed calls to dismantle the caucuses and replace Iowa as the lead-off state.\n\nBut for now, the dissatisfaction has emanated primarily from Democrats. Though former Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said publicly that caucuses should be phased out and Iowa should not go first, current Chair Jaime Harrison has declined to formally weigh in on the issue.\n\nMore:‘The Iowa caucuses are on’: Republicans say early political trips reinforce plans for 2024 caucus\n\n\"We are going to continue to let the process play out, as it does every four years, and look forward to hearing the insight and recommendations from all interested parties on the 2020 reforms and on the 2024 calendar at the appropriate time in the process,\" he said in a statement.\n\nIowa Republicans say they remain committed to hosting caucuses in 2024. Already, potential candidates like former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley are beginning to trickle into the state. Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann was not immediately available to comment Tuesday.\n\n— This story includes reporting from the Associated Press.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

Instead, South Carolina – a state with a substantial Black population that helped deliver the nomination to Biden in 2020 – will lead an early voting window that will be significantly more diverse than in years past.\n\nNevada, New Hampshire, Georgia and Michigan will follow – a slate of states that the committee says will reflect the many pockets of diversity that make up the party’s growing base.\n\n“I’m so proud that we're going to hear from more voices – voices of those who simply yearn to be heard. To be seen,” said committee member Donna Brazile, a former acting chair of the DNC.The calendar “is going to speak to all of us, because we know that our role in this party and our role as Democrats and as Americans is to open doors.”\n\nThe committee voted overwhelmingly to approve the plan, which must now be ratified by the full DNC early next year. Iowa and New Hampshire were alone in voting against the proposal, which the panel's chairs shared with the committee late Thursday after Biden weighed in and offered his recommended calendar.\n\nUnder the proposal, South Carolina will vote first, and Nevada and New Hampshire will share a second primary date. Georgia and then Michigan round out the early voting period before Super Tuesday. However, the order is contingent on the states proving to the committee that they are able to change the date of their primary.\n\nLIVEFollow the Friday updates from the Democratic National Committee's rules meeting\n\nThe proposal was met with appreciation by many of the committee members, who praised it as a welcome step forward in complicated negotiations over how to evolve with the changing face of their party.\n\n“The logistics of this window will be something we need to navigate as a committee,” said committee co-chair Minyon Moore. “But I agree with the president that this is a bold window that reflects the values of our party, and it is a window worth fighting for.”\n\nBut leaders in Iowa and New Hampshire, who did not receive their preferred spot on the calendar, are already promising to buck the committee’s decision and hold contests as they see fit.\n\n“New Hampshire does have a statute. We do have a law. And we will not be breaking our law,” said Joanne Dowdell, New Hampshire’s representative to the committee. “And I feel that any lawyer in the room or around the table would agree that it is not in the best interest of this body to even suggest that we do that.”\n\nMore:Iowa and New Hampshire Democrats vow to rebel against DNC's presidential primaries plans\n\nGraham Wilson, general counsel to the DNC, said that while the body doesn’t have the power to mandate a change to state's law, it does have the power to dictate the process by which it selects its presidential nominee.\n\n“The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized political parties' rights under the First Amendment to select the manner of choosing our own nominee and has in fact repeatedly invalidated state laws that limit or infringe on a party's ability to dictate how they select their nominee,” he said.\n\nThe order of states is contingent on each certifying in a signed letter by Jan. 5 that they have made any necessary statutory changes and will hold their primary on the date prescribed by the committee, regardless of when any other state holds its primary contest.\n\nThe requirements for New Hampshire go further.\n\nThe state's governor, Senate majority leader and House majority leader – all Republicans – must provide signed letters to the committee agreeing to make the statutory changes necessary to hold the state's primary on the prescribed date.\n\nThose state officials must also certify that they will expand access to early voting.\n\nStates could be punished for not following the DNC calendar\n\nCommittee members noted changes they approved earlier this year that will inflict greater penalties on states and candidates that defy the DNC’s chosen calendar.\n\n“We've also empowered the chairman to enforce this decision in a way that gives it more teeth than I think it ever has before,” said D.C. committee member Mo Elleithee.\n\nIowa’s representative to the committee, Scott Brennan, said that despite the enforcement rules, the vote will create a climate of confusion and jockeying among states that could drag out through much of 2023.\n\nHe pointed to the limited amount of time on the calendar, a tangle of conflicting state laws and “a GOP calendar that no longer bears any resemblance to ours.”\n\n“We can vote on this calendar. We can approve this calendar. But we will leave here with nothing settled,” he said.\n\nBut members, by and large, cheered their passage of the calendar for 2024.\n\nThe job of the committee, noted member Stuart Appelbaum of New York, is “not just to choose states and the order in which they go but to tell the story of who we are as a party and who we are as a nation.”\n\n“Our early states must reflect the overall diversity of our party and our nation, economically, geographically, demographically,” he said. “I think that the story we are telling with these selections is a story we can be proud of as the Democratic Party of the United States.

A vote could come as soon as Friday.\n\nThough members of the committee have discussed the issue at length over the past year, they have made no public proposals ahead of this week’s meeting. Nor has President Joe Biden publicly weighed in as the leader of the national party.\n\nStill, committee members have made their preferences clear as they’ve considered proposals from more than a dozen states interested in taking over Iowa’s role as the front-runner. They’ve said they prefer states that hold state-run primary elections, have a diverse electorate and are competitive general election battlegrounds.\n\nMore:What does it take to be first? These states want to an early place on Democrats' presidential calendar\n\nAny state they select must also be able to legally and quickly move up the date of their presidential primary election.\n\nThe result, committee members say, will better align the party with its base and boost Democrats’ chances of taking the White House in 2024 and beyond.\n\nNew Hampshire, Nevada compete for first-in-the-nation status\n\nStates such as New Hampshire and Nevada, which have traditionally followed Iowa on the calendar, are competing to take over the leadoff spot in 2024 with aggressive pitches.\n\nAnd newcomers Michigan and Minnesota are angling to join the early window as two Midwestern states with more diverse populations than Iowa's. Committee members have identified the two as possible additions.\n\nEach state is making its case to the committee this week, arguing the 2020 midterm election results prove it is an ideal launching point for the Democratic Party's primary process.\n\nBut each state comes with drawbacks.\n\nNevada and New Hampshire have argued they are clear battleground states after Democratic senators won reelection in both states even as Republicans claimed both governor’s mansions.\n\n\"The 2022 midterm results further underscore that no state is better positioned or would deliver more for the national Democratic Party by holding the First-In-The-Nation presidential primary than Nevada,\" Nevada Democratic strategist Rebecca Lambe wrote in a memo to the committee circulated just after the midterms. \"It is even clearer today that no other state meets every key aspect of the DNC’s own criteria for the early window of diversity, competitiveness, and accessibility except Nevada.\"\n\nBut Nevada also showed in the midterms it is slow to count votes, a key drawback in a nominating process that requires quick tabulation — a lesson underscored by the Democrats' delays in Iowa in 2020.\n\nAnd New Hampshire, though geographically small and easily traversed by campaigns, has an even less diverse population than Iowa.\n\nDemocrats in Michigan won a clean sweep of the state Legislature in November, giving them full control to change the date of their primary election by altering state law — resolving a key concern for the committee. Members of the state Senate made a first run at the issue Tuesday, passing legislation that would move the state's presidential primary from the second Tuesday in March to the second Tuesday in February.\n\nBut concerns remain about the cost of competing in such a large state with relatively expensive media markets.\n\nIn Minnesota, Democrats also control the levers of government and have promised to change state law to allow for an early primary. Gov. Tim Walz and state legislative leaders wrote a letter to the committee Monday promising to do so.\n\n\"As governor and incoming leaders of the Minnesota Senate and House of Representatives, we are committed to swiftly passing and signing into law legislation that would allow for this move to take place,\" they wrote.\n\nHowever, Minnesota Democrats face an additional hurdle: They must strike an agreement with Republicans to change the date of the state's presidential primary.\n\nMo Elleithee, a committee member and the executive director of Georgetown’s Institute of Politics and Public Service, has urged the committee to think broadly about the calendar without being “held hostage to tradition.\" He has floated “creative” solutions, like allowing New Hampshire and Nevada to hold their primaries on the same day to kick off the calendar.\n\n“That could be something that really sends a strong message to the country,” he said at the committee’s July meeting.\n\nIowa Democrats make a final pitch to the committee\n\nFor their part, Iowa officials haven't given up, lobbying the committee directly in the days ahead of the meeting and issuing a memo Monday night outlining the strengths the state brings to the table.\n\n“It’s critical that small rural states like Iowa have a voice in our presidential nominating process,” Iowa Democratic Party Chair Ross Wilburn wrote. “Democrats cannot abandon an entire group of voters in the heart of the Midwest without doing damage to the party for a generation.”\n\nDemocrats in the mostly white state have lost considerable ground to Republicans in recent elections, and Iowa is required by law to hold caucuses instead of primaries. But Iowa Democrats noted that the state has one of the nation’s premier nonpartisan redistricting systems, which has resulted in fair congressional maps that could help Democrats stay competitive in years to come.\n\nStill, Iowa Democratic activists and party leaders concede that retaining any role in the early voting window would be a victory for the state party.\n\nState Auditor Rob Sand, who narrowly won reelection this year and is the lone surviving Democrat elected statewide in Iowa, wrote that the party's lackluster election result \"makes it all the more important for Iowa to remain first, or at least early.\"\n\n\"More than ever, Iowans need Democrats to show up, to listen, and to do the work,\" he wrote.\n\nThe DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee is expected to vote on a proposal this week and send it to the full body of the DNC for ratification in the coming months.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

Republicans release Iowa Caucus sites for presidential nominations\n\nOn Jan. 15, registered Republicans may attend their local caucus site at 7 p.m. sharp and voice their support for a candidate. It's a more social affair than primaries: Rather than silently filling out a ballot, caucus attendees will hear speeches from their neighbors on behalf of the different Republican candidates.\n\nAfter the speeches, caucusgoers will write down their favorite candidate on a blank slip of paper. Leaders from each precinct will tally the ballots and report the total for each candidate to the Republican Party of Iowa.\n\nWhen all the results are in, the party will allocate Iowa's 40 delegates proportionally, based on how many times caucusgoers wrote down a candidate's name.\n\nMost other states have primary elections, which are similar to general elections.\n\nIn places like New Hampshire or South Carolina, voters may go to the polls on the day of the primary, or they can request an absentee ballot in the mail. The ballot lists all of the candidates, and voters secretly select their preferences.\n\nState governments organize primaries, instead of state political parties.\n\nSome states award delegates proportionally, while others use a \"winner-take-all\" method, awarding delegates only to the first-place finisher.\n\nMore:Everything you need to know about the Iowa caucuses ahead of the 2024 presidential race\n\nWhy does it matter that Iowa has a caucus? Why is Iowa first?\n\nIowa has almost always held presidential caucuses, but it has only been first-in-the-nation since 1972.\n\nThat year, Iowa was first on the calendar, and political operative Gary Hart encouraged Sen. George McGovern to focus on Iowa campaigning to get a boost. McGovern came in second in Iowa, but went on to win the Democratic nomination that year. (Then he lost the general election in a landslide, but that's not Iowa's fault.)\n\nJimmy Carter employed the same Iowa campaigning strategy in 1976, winning the caucuses, the Democratic nomination, and the presidency. Since then, presidential candidates have flocked to Iowa, eager for the media attention and the momentum of a caucus win.\n\nSupporters of the caucus process say it's beneficial for candidates to develop deep support networks among Iowans. Winning someone's vote is one thing, but inspiring them to attend an event on a snowy January evening requires a different kind of enthusiasm. Plus, the social caucus process encourages conversation among neighbors.\n\nCritics of caucuses argue the process isn't accessible to people with evening shifts, disabilities, or caregiving responsibilities. It's also a process run by party volunteers, potentially creating more room for errors than a state-run primary — like the Republican precinct captain who went to bed in 2012 without sending along her results, or the meltdown of the Democrats' caucus app in 2020.\n\nBut Iowa's caucuses are more than just a state preference. The caucus is part of a complicated web of state laws, handshake deals and intra-party politics that decides the order of the presidential nominating contest.\n\nOne key agreement: Iowa Republicans may have the first nominating contest, but New Hampshire Republicans have dibs on holding the first presidential primary.\n\nIf Iowa's caucus process veers too close to a primary, New Hampshire may try to hold its contest before Iowa.\n\nWhat's up with the Democratic caucuses?\n\nIowa Democrats have dramatically changed the way they caucus in 2024.\n\nIn 2020, Democrats gathered at 7 p.m. on caucus night to physically stand in corners of the room to be counted on a first and second alignment. But that process is all gone now.\n\nIn an effort to simplify their process and make it more inclusive, Iowa Democrats have moved to an entirely mail-in system of casting their presidential preferences. Starting Nov. 1, Iowa Democrats could request an absentee presidential preference card, which functions like a ballot, that they can fill out and return to the state party until March 5, when results will be announced.\n\nMore:Where do I caucus? Iowa Democrats release 2024 sites for party business on caucus night\n\nThe party will still hold in-person caucuses on Jan. 15, but only to conduct other party business unrelated to picking a presidential nominee.\n\nKatie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register.

Kim Reynolds has signed a law requiring the Iowa caucuses to take place in person, potentially escalating a fight with Democrats who plan to offer a mail-in caucusing option in 2024.\n\nReynolds, a Republican, signed the law Thursday. It passed the Iowa Legislature last month with only Republican support.\n\nIowa GOP leaders have said the in-person requirement is essential to protect Iowa's first-in-the-nation status. Democrats say Republicans are undermining decades of bipartisan efforts to protect the caucuses by acting unilaterally.\n\nThe 2024 presidential nominating calendar is still unsettled for both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n2024 Iowa caucuses:See when presidential candidates are visiting Iowa\n\nWhat Iowa Democrats have planned for their caucuses\n\nIowa Democrats have released a draft plan saying they intend to hold caucuses on the same day as Iowa Republicans, despite the fact that the Democratic National Committee voted this year to remove Iowa from its lead-off spot.\n\nAt the caucuses, Iowa Democrats would conduct party business and select unbound delegates to county conventions. But the party intends to offer a separate caucus-by-mail process for Democrats to express their presidential preference.\n\nThe new Iowa law says if an Iowa political party “chooses to select its delegates as part of the presidential nominating process at political party precinct caucuses” and goes first, then the caucuses need to be held in person.\n\nIowa Democrats have not been clear about how they believe the law will affect their caucus plans, although some have suggested the measure may be unconstitutional.\n\nIowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in a statement Thursday that the party is \"committed to moving forward with the most inclusive process in Iowa's history, no matter what.\"\n\n\"No political party can tell another political party how to conduct its party caucuses. Iowa Democrats will do what's best for Iowa, plain and simple,\" Hart said. \"For many years, Iowa Democrats have worked in good faith with the Republicans to preserve our caucuses. This legislation ends decades of bipartisanship, and now Kim Reynolds has signed off on this attempt to meddle in Democratic party business.\"\n\nThreat of New Hampshire jumping Iowa muddles caucus planning\n\nIowa Republicans say the mail-in process proposed by Democrats is tantamount to a primary and will cause New Hampshire to jump the state and hold the first presidential nominating contest.\n\nNew Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, has said if Iowa moves forward with the mail-in proposal, he would consider it a primary and use his authority to set the date of New Hampshire’s primaries ahead of Iowa’s caucuses.\n\nBecause New Hampshire's Democratic and Republican primaries must be held the same day, any move by New Hampshire is also a threat to Iowa Republicans' first-in-the-nation spot.\n\nIowa GOP Chair Jeff Kaufmann says Iowa Republicans are eyeing \"a mid-January caucus.\" But the final date has not been set, in part because of the uncertainty about what New Hampshire will do.\n\nMore:Iowa Republicans eye a January caucus date: Why the calendar is more complicated this year.\n\nRonna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, told the Des Moines Register last month that the RNC cannot apply sanctions if New Hampshire moves its primaries ahead of Iowa this cycle.\n\n“We have no ability in our rules to do anything if that happens,” she said.\n\nKaufmann praised the law in a statement Thursday, saying it gives Iowa Democrats \"the tools to stand up to the destructive, far-left members in their party who oppose the caucus system and Iowa's first-in-the-nation status as a whole.\"\n\n\"Hopefully, today's bill signing by the governor will mark an end to the Iowa Democrats pushing and then doubling down on an ill-advised, primary-in-all-but-name caucus proposal,\" Kaufmann said. \"The fate of middle Americans having a voice in selecting our next president depends on it.\"\n\nPolitical parties can set deadlines to register to be allowed to participate in caucuses\n\nThe Iowa law also gives political parties the power to set their own deadlines for when Iowans have to be registered members of the party to participate in the caucuses.\n\nThat would allow Republicans, for instance, to require Iowans to be registered as Republican voters in advance before they can caucus.\n\nCurrently, Iowans can register with a political party at the time they go to caucus and still participate.\n\nThe original legislation would have required anyone wishing to caucus to register with their chosen party at least 70 days ahead. Several Republican lawmakers said they were concerned about Democrats attempting to interfere in the GOP caucuses to support or oppose certain candidates.\n\nThe law does not affect Iowa's existing same-day voter registration for voters participating in federal, state and local elections.\n\nSome Democrats say law is intended to help Donald Trump\n\nSome Democrats have said Republicans are working to ensure former President Donald Trump wins the GOP caucuses as he competes against a growing field of contenders for the party's presidential nomination.\n\nThe bill's author, Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, is an adviser to Trump's Iowa campaign and the son of Republican Party of Iowa Chair Jeff Kaufmann.\n\nMore:Donald Trump says 'there's no way we lose Iowa' as he bashes Ron DeSantis in Des Moines\n\n\"I want to remind everybody that an employee of the Trump campaign ran a bill to change the rules of the Iowa caucuses on the floor of the Iowa House and that is clearly just to make it so that Donald Trump has the edge in this state,\" House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, told reporters on May 4.\n\nBobby Kaufmann has denied the bill is intended to favor a specific candidate, telling reporters \"this is making sure that everybody's playing by the same rules.\"\n\nLaw changes method for deciding ties in legislative primaries, lets Iowa leave voter data-sharing group\n\nThe law changes the mechanism for choosing a political party's nominee in the case of a primary election tie for state representative or state senator.\n\nThe law changes the process so that party committee members from the precincts within the legislative district will meet to choose between the tied candidates. Currently, the winners of such primaries are chosen by drawing a name out of a hat.\n\nAnd it allows Iowa to leave the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, a multistate group formed in 2012 as a way for states to share voter data and more easily remove ineligible voters from voter rolls.\n\nMore than half a dozen Republican-led states have left the group over the past year, and Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate announced in March that he was pulling Iowa out.\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

So why does Iowa start so early? More importantly, out of all the states, why is Iowa first?\n\nThe answer to those questions involves a little bit of pragmatism, a little bit of political conflict, and, these days, a strong desire to stick to tradition.\n\nMore:The Democratic Party is planning to reject Iowa's virtual caucus plan. Here's how we got here.\n\nIowa has almost always held caucuses for presidential selection rather than the primary system used in other states like New Hampshire, which is the second state to vote on presidential picks. But it wasn't always first in the nation.\n\nRoots in the 1960s\n\nAfter the tumultuous 1968 Democratic convention, the DNC decided it needed to open up its process to lessen the power of party leaders and involve more grassroots activists. That paved the way for the shake-up that led to Iowa moving to first on the calendar.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Democrats in Iowa said they were frustrated with the state's caucus system, which they felt was run by party bosses and didn't respond to grassroots voices and desires.\n\nChanges to address this problem involved holding separate district and state conventions, which meant that the whole caucus process needed to start earlier.\n\nKathie Obradovich, the Register's opinion editor, speaking for a video about Iowa's caucus history, says that \"the old story is that they figured out how long it would take to print all the paperwork on their elderly mimeograph machine.\"\n\nSo Iowa was first.\n\nWhen did the caucuses become powerful?\n\nThe question remained: who cared? In 1972, Gary Hart cared. Obradovich recounts the story: \"In the 1972 presidential race, Sen. George McGovern’s campaign was managed by a young political whiz kid named Gary Hart. Hart noticed that Iowa was going to be first in the nation and decided to make a bid here as a way to get (McGovern) a media boost before the New Hampshire primary. It worked.\"\n\nIn 1976, Jimmy Carter replicated McGovern's success. The media paid attention paid to his performance in Iowa and it illustrated the caucuses as an important metric of a candidate's strength. Carter went on to become president.\n\nBut Iowa had to fight for its right to be first\n\nHowever, this first-in-the-nation status wasn't set in stone.\n\nPrompted by Carter's re-election loss in 1980, the national Democratic Party theorized that the drawn-out nomination process was more of a hindrance than a help to their party's nominee. They rolled out new rules that would restrict how early any state's nomination processes could be held, but still allowed Iowa to caucus first. At that point, it seemed like everyone was happy.\n\nThen, Vermont moved up the date of its straw poll. In response, New Hampshire made its primary earlier. In defiance of the national party, Iowa chose to move the caucuses earlier than its nationally assigned date to maintain the buffer between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.\n\nIn November of 1983, with the caucuses (whatever their date was to be) soon approaching, state party officials gathered to resolve the disagreement and vote on the official date. Those in favor of the earlier date wanted to preserve both Iowa and New Hampshire's unique roles in the nomination process. Those in favor of the later date wanted the whole process shortened to help the eventual nominee.\n\nThe party leaders voted 20-10 for the earlier date. Iowa's status as first in the nation was, at least for the moment, secured.\n\n\"Today,\" Obradovich said, \"Iowa caucuses are first-in-the-nation mainly because the state insists on remaining first.\"\n\nbecause of the outsized media attention on Iowa, many candidates build their strategy around it, seeing it as a way to give them a catapult of momentum through the primaries. Barack Obama credits the Iowa caucuses for giving him the initial momentum that propelled him to the White House.\n\nAs long as the state is first, it's seen as the first serious litmus test of a candidate. And as Iowa indicates or influences later success, candidates will keep coming, journalists will keep reporting, and in February, the eyes of the nation will stay on Iowa.\n\nClare Ulmer is a politics reporter for the Register.

But while a win in Iowa can spring candidates into the spotlight, the caucuses don't necessarily forecast the rest of the race.\n\nSince the caucuses began in 1972, there have been 18 caucus winners between the two parties: 10 Democrats and 8 Republicans. More than half of those winners went on to secure their party's nomination in that cycle, but only three would go on to be elected president.\n\nThe list includes two incumbents who faced significant primary challenges in Iowa. Incumbent President Gerald Ford, a Republican, was challenged by former California governor Ronald Reagan in 1976. Though Ford narrowly won the Iowa caucus and secured the Republican nomination, he lost the presidency to Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.\n\nCarter faced a similar situation four years later as he ran for a second term. Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts challenged Carter in Iowa. Carter won the caucus and the Democratic nomination, but went on to lose lose the general election to Reagan.\n\nIncumbent presidents who ran unopposed or faced negligible competition Iowa are excluded from the data.\n\nTwo men are counted twice in the data: Carter and former Kansas U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, who each won two opposed Iowa caucuses. Dole was not the Republican nominee in 1988 but did clinch the nomination his second time around, in 1996. He would go on to lose the general election to the Democratic incumbent, President Bill Clinton.\n\nIowa caucus winners who became president varies by party\n\nIowa Democratic caucus winners have more often become their party's nominee and the winner of the presidential election than the winners of Iowa's Republican caucuses.\n\nSeven of 10 Democrats who won their Iowa caucus went on to become the Democratic nominee in the general election. Meanwhile, just 3 of 8 Iowa Republican caucus winners would become the party's nominee a few months later.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic caucuses over the last 20 years have been especially accurate at choosing the nominee: Every caucus winner since 2000, from Vice President Al Gore to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has gone on to become the party's general election nominee.\n\nThe opposite is true for Iowa Republicans: No Iowa Republican caucus winner has gone on to represent the party in a general election since Texas governor George W. Bush, in 2000.\n\nWhen it comes to selecting the winner of the presidential election, Democratic caucuses maintain an edge over Republicans. Since 1972, two Democrats who placed first on caucus night were elected president that November: Carter did it in 1976, then former U.S. Sen. Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nOnly one Republican, George W. Bush, won an opposed Iowa caucus, secured his party's nomination and went on to become president.\n\nSo what does it all mean for the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates?\n\nAs candidates scramble to charm Iowans and the caucuses creep ever-closer, it is clear that the winner of the Iowa caucus is most often not the person who eventually sits in the Oval Office.\n\nStill, Democratic caucuses in the last two decades have been eerily good at predicting the nominee. Expect to see candidates pouring time and money into the state and hoping they can continue that trend.\n\nMore results: Dig deeper into Iowa Caucus history and results, including recent county-level results.\n\nKatie Akin is a politics reporter for the Des Moines Register.

Here's what to know for 2020", "text": "The Register\n\nThe Iowa caucuses for the Democratic and Republican parties will be held Feb. 3, 2020.\n\nThe caucuses begin at 7 p.m. at most locations (you have to be in line by 7 p.m. to participate). It's a good idea to arrive early, especially if you need to register at the door. This year, some Democratic satellite caucus locations begin earlier. However, some of those sites require preregistration and some of those deadlines have passed.\n\nSo just how does the caucus process work? Read on for a detailed description of both the Democratic and Republican caucuses.\n\nMore:How to find your caucus site, register and be informed about the candidate you want to support\n\nWhat is a caucus?\n\nA caucus is a gathering of party members to discuss presidential preferences, elect local party leaders and talk about policy positions that make up a party’s platform.\n\nThere are major differences between the Democrats’ and the Republicans’ way of caucusing. The key one is that at a Democratic caucus participants separate into groups based on which presidential candidate they support. In a Republican caucus, participants simply cast a vote to indicate their support.\n\nA caucus begins with a call to order, and other general business, including election of a chair for the night’s proceedings.\n\nIn both parties’ caucuses, candidates or their representatives may speak to caucusgoers before the preference selection begins.\n\nHow is a primary different?\n\nCaucuses are run by the parties; primaries are run by the states. A primary resembles a general election, where registered voters cast a vote by secret ballot for their preferred candidate.\n\nMore:\n\nThe Democratic caucus\n\n1. PICKING A CANDIDATE\n\nCaucusgoers show their presidential preference by standing in a section of the room devoted to their candidate.\n\n2. BECOMING VIABLE\n\nThe people in each of those groups are counted. If the size of the group is at least 15% of those attending, that group is considered viable and the people in that group must fill out a presidential preference card, sign it, and turn it in. After they fill out that card, those in a 15% group can leave or watch the rest of the caucus. They cannot vote again.\n\n3. REALIGNING\n\nThose in groups that did not reach 15% in the first count can select a candidate again, either by joining a viable group, earning support for their group or another group or joining an uncommitted group.\n\n4. FINAL COUNT\n\nAfter realignment, the groups’ size will be counted again. That will be the final count.\n\n5. DETERMINING DELEGATES\n\nAfter the final count, delegates are awarded to the candidates, based on how many supporters those groups had.\n\nChanges in the 2020 Democratic caucus\n\nTwo counts: In previous cycles, caucusgoers could realign multiple times. Starting this year, there is only one realignment and people who supported a viable candidate cannot vote again.\n\nSatellite caucuses: For the first time in 2020, Democrats have allowed caucuses at dozens of satellite locations, both in Iowa and in other states and three other countries, to allow people who could not caucus at 7 p.m. at their assigned precinct in Iowa to participate. Some of those satellite caucuses start earlier or later than 7 p.m. and some require preregistration.\n\nReporting results: Democrats will make public the raw vote numbers from the first and second alignments, as well as the delegate strength candidates have. In previous years, the party reported only the delegate strength.\n\nView the final delegate totals as well as the first and second alignment vote numbers at DesMoinesRegister.com on Feb. 3.\n\nThe Republican caucus\n\n1. PICKING A CANDIDATE\n\nParticipants are asked to cast a vote for their preferred candidate for president. The delegates that will represent Iowa at the Republican National Convention will be divided proportionally to the statewide vote.\n\n2. TALLYING VOTES\n\nThe votes are counted and the chair announces the number of delegates to be elected by the precinct to attend the county convention.\n\n3. SELECTING DELEGATES\n\nThe delegates are nominated based on the candidates receiving the most votes and confirmed by all caucus participants.\n\nWhere are the caucuses held?\n\nA caucus is usually held at a school or other public building in a precinct, depending on expected turnout. Churches, union halls, fire stations, businesses and private homes also serve as caucus sites.\n\nFind your polling place through the Iowa Democratic Party or the Republican Party of Iowa.\n\nLook up Democratic caucus locations at the Iowa Democratic Party website\n\nat the Iowa Democratic Party website Look up Republican caucus locations at the Republican Party of Iowa website\n\nSome locations will host caucuses for multiple precincts on caucus night, so it will be helpful to know your precinct number so that you caucus with the right group.\n\nTo find your precinct, go to the Secretary of State’s website: https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterreg/pollingplace/search.aspx\n\nBoth parties recommend arriving 30 to 45 minutes early. The Democratic Party specifies that you must be signed in or in line by 7 p.m. to participate.\n\nWho can caucus?\n\nYou must be eligible to vote in the state of Iowa; 18 years old by the date of the presidential election, Nov. 3, 2020; and registered as a Democrat or Republican.\n\nDemocrats require no specific identification. Republicans say those seeking to register on caucus night should bring an ID and proof of residency.\n\nMore:\n\nOther caucus business\n\nResults: Once the presidential preference proceedings are done, the results are reported to the state party, where they will be verified, then reported to the media and the public.\n\nAdditional business: Caucus participants conduct additional committee elections and discuss the party platform to help prepare for the county convention.\n\nAfter the caucuses: Conventions\n\nThe delegates elected during the caucuses will attend county conventions in March. The delegates elected during the caucuses will attend county conventions in March. District conventions are held in April and state conventions in June.\n\nDelegates are further narrowed to attend the party national conventions in July and August.

Caucuses are held locally across the state, with members attending to elect local party leadership, discuss the party's platform and support a presidential candidate.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans hold their caucuses separately, and with different rules.\n\nIn 2024, Iowa will no longer be the first state on the primary election calendar for both major parties. While Republicans will still recognize Iowa as first in the nation, the national Democratic Party has opted for South Carolina as its first state.\n\nWhen are the Iowa caucuses?\n\nRepublicans will caucus Jan. 15.\n\nHow do the Iowa caucuses work?\n\nTHE REPUBLICAN CAUCUSES\n\nPicking a candidate: Participants are asked to cast a vote for their preferred candidate for president. The 40 delegates who will represent Iowa at the Republican National Convention will be divided proportionally to the statewide vote.\n\nTallying votes: The votes are counted and the chair announces the number of delegates to be elected by the precinct to attend the county convention. That number is predetermined by the county party according to the number of votes cast for the Republican candidate for governor in 2022, which was Gov. Kim Reynolds.\n\nSelecting delegates: The delegates are nominated based on the candidates receiving the most votes and confirmed by all caucus participants.\n\nTHE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUSES\n\nIowa Democrats have dramatically changed the way they caucus in 2024.\n\nIn 2020, Democrats gathered at 7 p.m. on caucus night to physically stand in corners of the room to be counted on a first and second alignment. But that process is all gone now.\n\nIn an effort to simplify their process and make it more inclusive, Iowa Democrats have moved to an entirely mail-in system of casting their presidential preferences. Starting Nov. 1, Iowa Democrats could request an absentee presidential preference card, which functions like a ballot, that they can fill out and return to the state party until March 5, when results will be announced.\n\nThe party will still hold in-person caucuses on Jan. 15, but only to conduct other party business unrelated to picking a presidential nominee.\n\nWhere are the Iowa caucuses held?\n\nCaucuses are usually held at local public buildings, like schools, churches, union halls, fire stations. They can also be held at private buildings or homes depending on the needs and makeup of a precinct.\n\nThere are nearly 1,700 precincts total across the state, though sometimes different precincts will caucus in different rooms at the same location.\n\nMore:Where do I caucus? Republicans release Iowa Caucus sites for presidential nominations\n\nWho can caucus in Iowa?\n\nYou can caucus if you meet the following requirements:\n\nYou must be eligible to vote in the state of Iowa.\n\nYou will be 18 years old by Nov. 5, 2024. That means if you're 17 and turn 18 between the date of the caucuses and the general election, you can caucus.\n\nYou must be registered as a Republican to participate in the Republican caucus or as a Democrat to participate in the Democratic caucus. If you're registered under a third party or no party, you won't be able to caucus, unless you change your registration to Republican or Democrat, which you can do on caucus night.\n\nHow are results calculated in the Iowa caucuses?\n\nOnce caucus proceedings are done at a precinct, the results are immediately reported to the state party. The state party will verify the results and report them to the public and to news outlets.\n\nDelegates elected during the caucuses will later attend a series of conventions in Iowa and will later be narrowed to a group sent to the national party conventions. The Republican and Democratic presidential nominees are confirmed during those national conventions, which usually take place over the summer.\n\nWhich candidates can I support in the Iowa caucuses?\n\nRepublican candidates for president include former President Donald Trump, former South Carolina Gov. and U.N. Amb. Nikki Haley, entrepreneur and author Vivek Ramaswamy, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Texas businessman Ryan Binkley.\n\nCandidates who have dropped out include: Michigan businessman Perry Johnson, conservative commentator Larry Elder, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, former Vice President Mike Pence, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, and former Texas U.S. Rep.

Instead, South Carolina – a state with a substantial Black population that helped deliver the nomination to Biden in 2020 – will lead an early voting window that will be significantly more diverse than in years past.\n\nNevada, New Hampshire, Georgia and Michigan will follow – a slate of states that the committee says will reflect the many pockets of diversity that make up the party’s growing base.\n\n“I’m so proud that we're going to hear from more voices – voices of those who simply yearn to be heard.

Iowa and New Hampshire were alone in voting against the proposal, which the panel's chairs shared with the committee late Thursday after Biden weighed in and offered his recommended calendar.\n\nUnder the proposal, South Carolina will vote first, and Nevada and New Hampshire will share a second primary date.

However, the order is contingent on the states proving to the committee that they are able to change the date of their primary.\n\nLIVEFollow the Friday updates from the Democratic National Committee's rules meeting\n\nThe proposal was met with appreciation by many of the committee members, who praised it as a welcome step forward in complicated negotiations over how to evolve with the changing face of their party.\n\n“The logistics of this window will be something we need to navigate as a committee,” said committee co-chair Minyon Moore. “But I agree with the president that this is a bold window that reflects the values of our party, and it is a window worth fighting for.”\n\nBut leaders in Iowa and New Hampshire, who did not receive their preferred spot on the calendar, are already promising to buck the committee’s decision and hold contests as they see fit.\n\n“New Hampshire does have a statute. We do have a law. And we will not be breaking our law,” said Joanne Dowdell, New Hampshire’s representative to the committee. “And I feel that any lawyer in the room or around the table would agree that it is not in the best interest of this body to even suggest that we do that.”\n\nMore:Iowa and New Hampshire Democrats vow to rebel against DNC's presidential primaries plans\n\nGraham Wilson, general counsel to the DNC, said that while the body doesn’t have the power to mandate a change to state's law, it does have the power to dictate the process by which it selects its presidential nominee.\n\n“The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized political parties' rights under the First Amendment to select the manner of choosing our own nominee and has in fact repeatedly invalidated state laws that limit or infringe on a party's ability to dictate how they select their nominee,” he said.\n\nThe order of states is contingent on each certifying in a signed letter by Jan. 5 that they have made any necessary statutory changes and will hold their primary on the date prescribed by the committee, regardless of when any other state holds its primary contest.\n\nThe requirements for New Hampshire go further.\n\nThe state's governor, Senate majority leader and House majority leader – all Republicans – must provide signed letters to the committee agreeing to make the statutory changes necessary to hold the state's primary on the prescribed date.\n\nThose state officials must also certify that they will expand access to early voting.\n\nStates could be punished for not following the DNC calendar\n\nCommittee members noted changes they approved earlier this year that will inflict greater penalties on states and candidates that defy the DNC’s chosen calendar.\n\n“We've also empowered the chairman to enforce this decision in a way that gives it more teeth than I think it ever has before,” said D.C. committee member Mo Elleithee.\n\nIowa’s representative to the committee, Scott Brennan, said that despite the enforcement rules, the vote will create a climate of confusion and jockeying among states that could drag out through much of 2023.\n\nHe pointed to the limited amount of time on the calendar, a tangle of conflicting state laws and “a GOP calendar that no longer bears any resemblance to ours.”\n\n“We can vote on this calendar. We can approve this calendar. But we will leave here with nothing settled,” he said.\n\nBut members, by and large, cheered their passage of the calendar for 2024.\n\nThe job of the committee, noted member Stuart Appelbaum of New York, is “not just to choose states and the order in which they go but to tell the story of who we are as a party and who we are as a nation.”\n\n“Our early states must reflect the overall diversity of our party and our nation, economically, geographically, demographically,” he said. “I think that the story we are telling with these selections is a story we can be proud of as the Democratic Party of the United States. This is what our party looks like. This is what America looks like.”\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Des Moines Register. Reach her at bpfann@dmreg.com or 515-284-8244.

In October, party leaders said they would acquiesce to national Democrats and give up their long held first-in-the-nation status in favor of a Super Tuesday contest in March.\n\n\"I’m excited to officially begin our 2024 Iowa Caucus process. We’re committed to making this the most inclusive Iowa caucus in history.\" Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in a news release Wednesday. \"Iowans who work a third shift, families that may not have access to childcare or seniors who are homebound can now make their voices heard in our presidential process.\"\n\nHere's what we know about how the process will work.\n\nAre Iowa Democrats holding a caucus or a primary in 2024?\n\nIowa Democrats are essentially shifting to a party-run primary, though they continue to use the vocabulary of a caucus.\n\nThe party is still calling its presidential nominating event a \"caucus,\" even though it does not require Democrats to gather together to cast presidential preferences.\n\nMore:Iowa Democrats compromise with DNC, plan to release 2024 caucus results on Super Tuesday\n\nThey have also adopted \"presidential preference cards,\" which will functionally act as ballots. For years, Iowa Democrats have avoided any form of paper balloting to help distinguish their caucuses from New Hampshire's primaries.\n\nAlthough absentee voting for the caucus begins in January, the results won't be announced until March 5, effectively meaning that Iowa will have a Super Tuesday contest with more than a half-dozen other states.\n\nThe party will still hold in-person caucuses on Jan. 15 — the same day Iowa Republicans will hold their traditional first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses — but only to conduct other party business unrelated to picking a presidential nominee. The party said Wednesday that it will announce a list of in-person caucus locations soon.\n\nHow can Iowa Democrats request a preference card for the 2024 presidential primary?\n\nStarting Nov. 1, any registered Iowa Democrat may request a presidential preference card through a form that can be submitted online or downloaded, printed and mailed in.\n\nDemocrats can go to https://iowademocrats.org/2024-caucus-2 to fill out the online form. A Spanish version of the form is also available on the website.\n\nAlternatively, Democrats can choose to download and print a physical form, rather than filling it out online.\n\nPrinted request forms must be mailed to the Iowa Democratic Party at 5661 Fleur Drive, Des Moines, Iowa 50321. Or, Democrats may email their request forms to preferencecardrequest@iowademocrats.org.\n\nIowa Democrats have until 5 p.m. Feb. 19 to request a ballot. Those ballots will be mailed to participants beginning Jan. 12, 2024.\n\nIowans with questions or who wish to ask for a request form by phone can call a helpline at (515) 216-3893. The line will be monitored by Iowa Democratic Party staff and volunteers.\n\nThe request form requires the requester to attest that they are eligible to vote in the 2024 general election, that they are a registered Democrat and that they live at the address listed on the form.\n\nThey will also be required to attest that they have not participated in any other political party's caucus.\n\nHow and when do Iowa Democrats need to return their preference cards for the 2024 presidential primary?\n\nPreference cards must be put back in the mail and postmarked by March 5 in order to count.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party did not share any information Wednesday about how Democrats will be able to send in their preference cards.\n\nWhat will Iowa Democrats' 2024 presidential preference cards look like?\n\nThe party said the preference cards will have Democratic candidates' names printed on them, just as they would be on a ballot.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party's State Central Committee will meet Dec. 2 to vote on which candidates' names will appear on the preference cards.\n\nWhen will we know the results of Iowa's 2024 Democratic primary?\n\nIowa Democrats have said they plan to release the results on March 5, which is known as \"Super Tuesday,\" when voters head to the polls in more than a dozen states. But they have not said at what time they plan to announce the results.\n\nThe party says it plans to accept any preference cards postmarked by March 5, even if they arrive later. They have not yet said if there will be a cutoff date when they will no longer accept late-arriving results.\n\nThat means that the results the party releases on March 5 could change as late-arriving preference cards are counted.\n\nWho is the vendor and what will this cost?\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party will contract with a team led by Amber McReynolds, who is the founding CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonprofit that encouraged mail-in voting in the 2020 election.\n\nMcReynolds was appointed to the U. S. Postal Service board of governors by President Joe Biden and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2021. She formerly worked as director of elections for the city and county of Denver.\n\nHer LinkedIn profile lists her as the principal and founder of Strategy Rose LLC.\n\n\"It’s important to me that this process runs smoothly and that’s why we’re excited to partner with Amber and her team, which has a combined 50 years of election administration experience,\" Hart said in the news release.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party has not said how much it expects the process to cost, though it expects it will be less than the 2016 and 2020 caucuses.\n\nBecause it is not a state-run primary conducted by state infrastructure, the Iowa Democratic Party will bear the cost, like it always has for the caucuses. But since Iowa Democrats are no longer holding the first-in-the-nation contest, there's likely to be less money coming in from donors or through major fundraisers that helped support previous caucuses.\n\nHow will Iowa Republicans caucus in 2024?\n\nIowa Republicans will continue to caucus the same way they have for decades. They will meet at 7 p.m. Jan. 15 at precinct locations scattered across the state to cast their own presidential preferences in person.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

I think there’s going to be some big announcement,\" Pompeo joked, alluding to as much. \"We’re in Iowa and all.”\n\nTwo other potential contenders — GOP Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina — have also announced trips to Iowa next month. Others, like former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, visited the state to help Republicans campaign late last year.\n\n“These individuals are coming in to party build. They’re coming in to help other Republicans. And, you know, let's face it, they're coming in to, I wouldn't say test the waters, but to introduce themselves to Iowans,” said Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann. “And listen, the more that come in here, the better off we are.”\n\nThe Democrats’ botched handling of the 2020 Iowa caucuses touched off a renewed national debate over the presidential nominating process and Iowa’s place in it. But Iowa Republicans say the early visits from national political leaders help reinforce their expectation that they, at least, will hold the nation’s first caucus again in 2024 — regardless of what Democrats do.\n\n“I cannot think of a reason that would derail the Republican process even if the Democrats opt not to have a caucus,” said Iowa Republican operative Eric Woolson. “I don't know why we would be dependent on what the Democrats choose to do with their nomination process.”\n\nDemocrats — both nationally and some in Iowa — argue the overwhelmingly white state of Iowa and its convoluted caucus process no longer represent the party's goals of diversity and inclusion.\n\nRepublicans, who use a simpler caucus process than Democrats, have not raised such concerns. Kaufmann said he has yet to hear of any rumblings within the national Republican Party about rearranging the nominating calendar, though they may yet come.\n\n“We've already heard rumors of several other would-be presidential candidates or rumored presidential candidates that are planning visits in the near future,” said Iowa Republican operative Luke Martz. “The Iowa caucuses are on, and we hope the Democrats join us.”\n\nMore:A year after Iowa caucus collapse, the stage is set for a bitter debate over the presidential nominating calendar\n\n'It's absolutely earlier than before'\n\nAfter breakfast with the Westside Conservatives Club, Pompeo planned a meeting with the Bull Moose Club in downtown Des Moines with Terry Branstad, the former Iowa governor and former U.S. ambassador to China. The day before, Pompeo met with the Pottawattamie County Republicans at an event in Council Bluffs.\n\nPompeo, who was a U.S. representative for the state of Kansas and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency before becoming secretary of state, previously was in Iowa last summer to speak at the Family Leadership Summit hosted by the Family Leader, a Christian conservative advocacy group.\n\nHe’s among a handful of Republicans who found reasons to travel to Iowa last year, including Tim Scott, Haley, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. Former Vice President Mike Pence was also a frequent visitor to Iowa while serving in the Trump administration.\n\nRick Scott, who is also the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, will be in Cedar Rapids April 1 for an event organized by the Republican Party of Iowa. And Tim Scott will return to speak at a party event in Davenport April 15.\n\nKaufmann said the presidential activity is beginning sooner than it has in past years.\n\n“It is absolutely earlier than before,” he said. “No doubt about it.”\n\nAccording to Des Moines Register data, a handful of potential candidates — Mike Huckabee, Tim Pawlenty, Ron Paul, Rick Santorum and Sarah Palin — held a dozen events across the state in 2009, just after Democrat Barack Obama had taken office for his first term. But most of those events were held late in the year, during the fall and winter.\n\nRepublican visits ramped up dramatically in 2010, when they made 123 separate appearances. And the caucus cycle hit its peak in 2011, when Republicans made more than 1,000 Iowa appearances ahead of the January 2012 caucuses.\n\nWould-be candidates followed a similar schedule at the outset of the 2016 cycle, as Republicans made their first visits to the state in May of 2013.\n\nMore:Iowa's Johnson County Democrats calls for replacing caucuses with a presidential primary\n\nDemocrats, eager to take on Trump after his surprise victory in 2016, began arriving in Iowa at the end of February 2017, holding 63 throughout that year. By the time Caucus Day rolled around, Democrats had made roughly 2,600 appearances in the state.\n\nThe visits already underway this year underscore the political inertia that has, for decades, helped keep Iowa at the front of the presidential nominating calendar. Until the political world settles on and accepts an alternative, Iowa remains the place for presidential aspirants to test their appeal and grow their name recognition.\n\n“They always say the proof is in the pudding,” Kaufmann said. “And I can sit here and preach all I want about first in the nation. But if we've got our top national leaders coming into this state — in some cases this being their first step in the process — that speaks louder than anything I can say.”\n\nMore:Iowa Senate passes bill shortening early voting period, creating stricter cutoff for absentee ballots\n\nA wild card for 2024: The Trump factor\n\nEven as potential candidates begin making early moves in Iowa, Trump’s shadow looms.\n\nAt the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, he continued to falsely claim he won the 2020 election and teased a 2024 campaign, saying “I may even decide to beat them for a third time.”\n\nTrump remains popular among Iowa Republicans, who voted to send him back to the White House by an 8 percentage point margin. According to a March Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll, 89% of Iowa Republicans view him favorably.\n\nAnd at CPAC in February, a straw poll showed him dominating a field of potential candidates. Trump won easily, earning 55% of the vote. At 21%, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was the only other Republican to crack into double digits.\n\nBut Kaufmann said he doesn’t believe politicians run the risk of alienating Trump or his supporters simply by showing up in Iowa.\n\n“In my conversations with many of these leaders — and I've had conversations with many of them — not one time, not one time did I hear one of these national leaders or a member of their team actually say anything negative or even imply anything negative towards the former president,\" he said. \"So no, I don't think there's any risk whatsoever.”\n\nBut some Republicans say they’re ready to move on from Trump. Longtime Iowa operative Doug Gross said in January after the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6 that he would personally try to block Trump’s rise in Iowa if he were to run again.\n\n“I’m going to dedicate my efforts to try to make sure that Trump finds Iowa as his Saint Helena — that it's an island he'll be on that he never comes back from,” he said, referencing Napoleon Bonaparte’s place of exile and death.\n\nIn the meantime, politicians with relatively low national profiles can help raise their name recognition and build relationships with key activists.\n\n“Maybe these people don't run. Maybe they do,” Martz said. “But until they make the decision, it's not a bad idea to invest the time in Iowa.”\n\nIowa's place could still be challenged\n\nEven as Iowa Republicans project confidence about their 2024 caucuses, they acknowledge that challenges could still arise and could come from unexpected places.\n\nSo far, Nevada Democrats have made the most concerted push to surpass Iowa on the nominating calendar. The state Legislature introduced a bill that calls for the state to switch from a caucus to a primary and move its date earlier in January in a specific bid to be first.\n\nBut the legislation ignores laws on the books in Iowa and New Hampshire that require the states to hold the first caucus and first primary respectively and that give wide latitude to state leaders to set their dates accordingly.\n\nKaufmann said his counterpart in Nevada’s state Republican Party has assured him he would not support the effort. And he said other threats to Iowa's caucuses have yet to materialize on the Republican side.\n\nMore:Iowa GOP forms alliance with other carve-out states to preserve presidential nominating calendar\n\n“I have heard nothing at this point of any kind of official type of challenge to Iowa being first in the nation in the Republican National Committee,” he said. “That doesn't necessarily mean it will not come. In fact, I fully expect that I'm going to have to explain myself and explain the state and explain the justification. I feel very, very comfortable building on the last two caucuses. In fact, to be honest with you, I look forward to doing that.”\n\nEven if the national party were to make changes, he and others say there is very little likelihood Iowa's Republican governor and Republican-controlled Legislature would move to change the state law.\n\n\"I can't see anything in the sentiment of our legislators or our state leaders to change the timing of the Iowa caucuses,\" Woolson said. \"The state law says that we're first, and I think everyone's inclination is to keep us first.\"\n\nKaufmann said he sought another term as Republican Party of Iowa chairman in January in part because he felt compelled to help protect the caucuses.\n\n“There is nothing more important to me than remaining first in the nation,” he said. “And I'll be honest with you, I can think of very little I won't do within the confines of the law in order for us to keep it.”\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe cruel truth of American democracy, usually experienced by Democrats, is that a political party can get more votes than the other without winning much power.\n\nThis year, however, it’s Republicans who got more votes – more than 3 million more votes for GOP House candidates – and don’t have as much to show for it.\n\nRepublicans actually lost ground in the Senate, where Democrats will have a slim 51-49 majority. The GOP House majority, while an important check on the White House, is small and spread across a broad enough ideological spectrum that it will be difficult for potential House speaker Kevin McCarthy, or whoever is ultimately able to win that position, to use the majority to act decisively.\n\n“Simply put, Republicans picked up the votes they needed, just not where they needed them most. Clearly something or someone intervened, affecting the outcome of the election in the places that mattered,” Cook Political Report founder Charlie Cook wrote in November.\n\nVotes at that time were still trickling in from California and Washington, and the margins have thinned, but Cook argued that Republicans’ edge should have gained them 20-30 seats and a larger majority than the 222-212 margin they’re going to have in the House in January. There will be one House vacancy.\n\nInstead of suffering massive losses, Democrats lost a net of nine seats. It cost them the House majority, but at the same time made President Joe Biden appear strong. Presidents usually lose scores of seats in the House.\n\nRepublicans’ failure in the Senate has been attributed to poor statewide candidates who were sidetracked by personal issues and former President Donald Trump’s election fantasies.\n\nRepublicans aren’t used to this feeling\n\nThe GOP frequently, in recent years, gets more power even with fewer votes.\n\nTrump in 2016 and George W. Bush in 2000 both won the White House with fewer votes than their Democratic opponents. Democrats won substantially more votes than Republicans in 2012, when they reelected then-President Barack Obama, but Republicans kept the House majority.\n\nThe 2022 midterm is the first election in which Republican candidates got more votes than Democrats since 2014, when the GOP picked up House seats and the Senate majority.\n\nA close election = slim margins in the House and Senate\n\nNot everyone in a congressional district can vote, and not everyone did.\n\nThere was extremely good turnout in certain states, like Georgia, which featured hotly contested Senate and governor’s races and set records for midterm turnout, according to the state’s top election official, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\n\nTurnout was down in places like California, which featured statewide races that were not so hotly contested. The California Secretary of State’s office pegs turnout at 50.8% of voters, far below the more than 64% turnout it reported in the last midterm in 2018, but above the 42% turnout in 2014.\n\nRELATED: See how your votes aren’t equal\n\nFrustrations at the state level too\n\nRepublicans can also be frustrated that they failed to gain control of any new state legislatures.\n\nOn the one hand, it’s a historic failure by Republicans – the first midterm election since 1900 when the party out of power nationally did not gain control of at least one state chamber, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nOn the other hand, Republicans still control a majority of state houses after focusing on making gains in state politics for the past decade-plus. Republicans will still control both legislative houses in 27 states, compared with Democrats, who will control both houses in 19.\n\nFewer Americans overall voted\n\nThe overall US turnout rate for the 2022 midterm was 46.8% of the voting eligible population, according to the US Elections Project, which is run by the political scientist Michael McDonald at the University of Florida.\n\nThat’s down from more than 50% in 2018, but well above the 36.7% recorded by the project in 2014.\n\nThere is going to be a lot of debate about how controversial voting laws in key states like Georgia and Texas may have kept some people from voting. Read more on that from CNN’s Fredreka Schouten, who covers voting rights.\n\nIn a separate report, CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere notes that Black voter turnout was down in 2022, which has alarmed Democratic operatives as they look ahead to the coming presidential election.\n\nThe New York Times analyst Nate Cohn wrote this week that turnout was much higher in predominantly White areas than it was in predominantly Black and Hispanic areas. This could explain how Republicans got so many more votes without getting many more House seats. In many states, redistricting can clump like voters together, creating safe districts.\n\nSplit tickets are a thing\n\nIt’s also important to note here that while American voters have gotten more tribal in recent years, split-ticket voting is an important feature of the system.\n\nMore voters chose Republicans in House races, but a lot of voters supported both parties on their ballots.\n\nGeorgia, most notably, picked a Republican governor and a Democratic senator. But it wasn’t the only state to do so – Vermont, New Hampshire and Nevada also chose Democratic senators and a Republican governor.\n\nMaryland and Massachusetts went the other direction in 2022, replacing Republican governors with Democrats to match their senators. Kansas and Wisconsin chose Republican senators and Democratic governors.\n\nThe national popular vote is an interesting side note, but doesn’t mean much, as Republicans will tell you this year.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

That's almost 47% of the popular vote. He won 232 electoral votes – 270 are needed to win. His opponent and current president Joe Biden won 306 electoral votes.\n\nThe Electoral College is the presidential voting process established by the Constitution. Generally, the candidate who wins the most votes in a state gets that state’s electoral votes. Maine and Nebraska split up these votes. For example, Nebraska gave Trump four of its five electoral votes in 2020 and Biden one. How many electoral votes a state gets is based on how many members of Congress it has, which is based on population size.\n\nIn 2020, Trump won electoral votes from these states, according to USA TODAY’s election results tracker:\n\nAlabama\n\nAlaska\n\nArkansas\n\nFlorida\n\nIdaho\n\nIndiana\n\nIowa\n\nKansas\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisiana\n\nMaine (one out of four)\n\nMississippi\n\nMissouri\n\nMontana\n\nNebraska (four out of five)\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nOhio\n\nOklahoma\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nTennessee\n\nTexas\n\nUtah\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWyoming\n\nTrump falsely claimed the results of many states were incorrect after the votes were tallied, alleging fraud and demanding recounts by hand. The recounts affirmed Biden’s victory. Shortly after the election, Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to change the outcome of the election.\n\nUp for president?A closer look at each 2024 candidate\n\nWho won the popular vote in 2020?\n\nBiden won both the popular vote and the Electoral College in the 2020 election.\n\nWinning the popular vote does not necessarily guarantee the presidency – there have been five presidents who have lost the popular vote but won the presidency thanks to the Electoral College. In 2016, for example, Trump won 304 electoral votes to Hillary Clinton’s 227 but lost the popular vote by almost 2.9 million votes.\n\nFact check:Biden did not receive 22 million phantom votes in 2020\n\nJust Curious for more?

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump wants to do a full Grover Cleveland and match the only US president to lose a presidential election and then rise from the ashes to regain the White House four years later.\n\nOther examples of former presidents trying to regain power have gone poorly. Theodore Roosevelt’s progressive rebellion split open a schism in the GOP; neither Herbert Hoover nor Martin Van Buren could get nominations from their parties after previous losses.\n\nWith the announcement of his third White House run, Trump is trying to emulate Cleveland, who won, lost and then won the White House in 1884, 1888 and 1892.\n\nIn many other ways, Trump, a native New Yorker, and Cleveland, the only president born in New Jersey, have little in common. Most of what’s below comes from reading about Cleveland at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center and also the University of California Santa Barbara’s American Presidency Project.\n\nTrump, a Republican, lost the popular vote twice. He lost both the Electoral College and the popular vote to Joe Biden in 2020, but Trump also got fewer popular votes compared with Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and first lady, when he beat her in the Electoral College in 2016.\n\nCleveland, a Democrat, won the popular vote three times. He got more popular votes than his opponent when he won the White House in 1884 and 1892, and while he lost the Electoral College vote to Benjamin Harrison in 1888, Cleveland beat him in the popular vote. Regardless of the popular vote, Cleveland’s first win in 1884 was thanks to an extremely narrow 1,200-vote margin that delivered him New York’s decisive electoral votes.\n\nTrump rejected his loss. The former president skipped Biden’s inauguration, still won’t admit he lost in 2020 and has infected the Republican Party with a vein of denialism.\n\nCleveland held the umbrella as his opponent became president. At a rainy inauguration in March 1889, Cleveland held an umbrella over Harrison’s head as the latter took the oath of office.\n\nCleveland holds an umbrella over Harrison as he takes the oath of office. Library of Congress\n\nTrump is one of the oldest presidents. Seventy when he took office in 2017, Trump would be 78 if he wins and takes office again in January 2025. That would make him the second-oldest president after Biden.\n\nCleveland was a young president. Just 47 when he first took the oath of office, Cleveland was 55 when he won reelection. Cleveland died at 71, an age at which Trump was in the first half of his term.\n\nTrump revels in the campaign. He lives for winding speeches eaten up by adoring crowds.\n\nCleveland barely campaigned. Candidates of the day didn’t campaign as much, but when he first won the White House in 1884, Cleveland gave just two campaign speeches.\n\nHe was similarly disinterested in campaigning four years later, which could explain his defeat in 1888, but doesn’t explain how he won again in 1892.\n\nTrump is famous for denying scandals. One example: He disputed paying hush money to women who alleged affairs with him despite the confirmation of his former attorney Michael Cohen, who set up the payments.\n\nCleveland admitted an affair. Attacked by Republicans in 1884, Cleveland admitted he may in fact have fathered an illegitimate child with a woman later sent to an insane asylum.\n\n“Ma, Ma, Where’s my Pa,” went the attack ad of the day. Cleveland turned honesty into a campaign attribute and urged supporters to tell the truth.\n\nTrump imposed tariffs. One of Trump’s lasting policy legacies are the tariffs he imposed on China and other countries.\n\nCleveland fought tariffs. A reason he lost in 1892 was Cleveland’s opposition to high tariffs, an unpopular position exploited by Harrison.\n\nThere are, however, some other similarities between Trump and Cleveland.\n\nCleveland and Frances Folsom's wedding in June of 1886 was the only marriage of a sitting president in the White House. She was 21 and had been his ward. Getty Images\n\nThey both married younger women. Melania Trump is 24 years younger than her husband, Donald. Cleveland married his wife Frances during his first term in the White House, still the only marriage of a sitting president conducted at the White House. Frances Cleveland was 21 at the time and had been Cleveland’s ward after her father, Cleveland’s former law partner, died.\n\nThey both considered using troops on Americans. Trump considered calling out the military on protesters in front of the White House, and some of his advisers considered trying to impose martial law as they sought to overturn his defeat in 2020.\n\nCleveland called out federal troops to put down the Pullman railcar strike, a controversial and unprecedented use of force against striking workers.\n\n(Related: Today, the odds of a railroad union strike are on the rise after a third union rejected a proposed contract. Read more.)\n\nThey both promised to clean up Washington. Trump won in 2016 promising to “drain the swamp” in Washington, and Cleveland’s main issue was to put corrupt Republicans in check, something that resonated with anti-corruption Republicans known as the “Mugwumps.”\n\nThey both cut down on some immigration. The issue that most animated Trump was building a wall at the southern border. He also curbed legal immigration to the US and imposed a travel ban on certain countries. Cleveland renewed the Chinese Exclusion Act and prevented Chinese laborers from returning to the US. But Cleveland rejected a law that would have imposed a literacy test on immigrants.\n\nThey both relied on the South. Trump could not win his home state of New York like Cleveland did, but both men relied on a southern base of support for their political power.\n\nJoshua Zeitz wrote for Politico recently that when Cleveland ran in 1892 after losing in 1888, it was largely out of boredom. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be more interested in revenge for what he falsely calls a fraudulent election.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Martin Van Buren’s political party.

Fight on Patriots – to #Victory!” a Nov. 29 Facebook post reads.

The Biden-Harris ticket gained roughly 51% of the popular vote to the Trump-Pence ticket’s 47%, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\nBut as the 2000 and 2016 elections showed, the popular vote is not the sole determinant of presidential elections; the Electoral College makes the final call.\n\nEach state is allowed a number of electors, which is determined by adding its number of senators (always two) to its number of House representatives (varies by state). Nationwide, there are 538 electoral votes to cast.\n\nOn Election Day, people vote for their preferred candidate's electors, who are chosen by political parties or independent candidates before the election. Those individuals, collectively the Electoral College, then cast votes for president and vice president, usually representing the choice their state's voters made.\n\nCandidates have to win at least half of the country's electoral votes (270 votes) to be elected president.\n\nBiden is projected to receive 306 electoral votes to Trump’s projected 232, thanks to wins in key states like Georgia (16 electoral votes), Michigan (16 votes), Wisconsin (10 votes), Pennsylvania (20 votes) and Arizona (11 votes). Trump won by the same Electoral College breakdown in 2016, which he called a “massive landslide victory” at the time.\n\nThe Trump campaign and its allies flooded state and federal courts after the election, filing over 40 lawsuits, primarily in battleground states, according to a running tally by Marc Elias, a Democratic elections expert and founder of Democracy Docket. The lawsuits claimed ballots had errors because voters were required to use Sharpies, observers didn't have enough access to monitor ballot counting and late-arriving mail ballots were improperly mixed with legal votes.\n\nNone has gotten very far; just one case has been won and at least eight are pending.\n\nMore:Texas attorney general asks Supreme Court to block Biden victory in 4 states\n\nDave Wasserman, House editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, told USA TODAY that Trump has no path to victory.\n\n\"The case for Trump having won the election is so preposterous that the only explanation is that the losing side does not like the results,\" he said.\n\nMore:For these Trump supporters primed to disbelieve defeat, challenging the election was a civic duty\n\nBiden improved on Clinton’s gains\n\nMany Trump supporters have expressed disbelief that Biden won, and by such margins. But Biden’s campaign won by persuading just enough swing voters, making gains in unexpected states and rebuilding the coveted “blue wall” that toppled in 2016.\n\nAccording to CNN’s national exit poll, 94% of self-described Democrats voted for Biden in 2020 compared to Hillary Clinton’s 89% of self-described Democrats in 2016, and 89% of self-described liberals, compared to Clinton’s 84%.\n\nBiden’s victory was really won on the basis of support from moderates and independents, though. He received 64% of votes cast by self-described moderates, 12 points ahead of Clinton, and won independents by 13 points – a group that Clinton lost by 4 points.\n\nBiden continued to build on the groundwork laid out by Clinton in historically red states like Arizona and Georgia. Clinton did not win Arizona or Georgia in 2016, but she did perform better than Obama in both. The swing toward Biden in those states was more than double his national swing, CNN reported.\n\nWasserman said he predicted prior to the election that Arizona and Georgia would flip, but the similar states of Texas and Florida would not due to their Hispanic electorate.\n\n\"It's the fact that Texas and Florida have such high Hispanic shares, but in particular, in Florida, the Hispanic electorate is substantially Cuban, and we knew that that was a particular strength for Trump entering this election, whereas in Arizona, Hispanic voters are predominantly of Mexican ancestry and Trump did not make as strong astride among those voters,\" he said. \"In Georgia, there's not much of a Hispanic vote to speak of so it was really a question of what the shift would be in the Atlanta suburbs.\"\n\nFact check:Video claim that Dominion tech manipulated Georgia votes is false\n\n'Blue wall' rebuilt with suburban votes\n\nTrump suggested throughout his campaign that Biden would \"destroy the beautiful suburbs,\" but it turned out many suburbanites disagreed.\n\nBiden won back a number of crucial Midwest states that Clinton lost to Trump in 2016 largely thanks to suburban voters. The cluster of historically Democrat-won states, dubbed the “blue wall,” include three of the five major battleground states this election cycle.\n\n\"We saw a consistent pattern across the country, in both close states and states that weren't so close, that Biden made significant strides compared to Clinton's performance four years ago in suburbs, predominantly affluent suburbs, of major metro areas,\" Wasserman said.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the divide between the state's rural and urban populations was defined, as 42 Wisconsin counties, many small and rural, cast more ballots for Trump than in 2016. Biden won Wisconsin by bolstering support in the populous suburbs of Milwaukee and Madison, despite average turnout in the cities themselves. Biden erased Trump's entire 2016 margin in Wisconsin in just the counties surrounding Milwaukee, Wasserman said.\n\nThat same divide made Michigan competitive. Biden made gains in counties like Kent, where Grand Rapids is located, and the Detroit metropolitan area, though he underperformed Clinton in the city of Detroit. Trump improved his margins statewide, but not enough to surpass Biden’s lead.\n\nBiden again leaned on the suburbs of major metropolitan areas in Pennsylvania, outperforming Clinton by more than 150,000 votes in the four counties surrounding Philadelphia. Wasserman said Biden erased Trump's 2016 margin in just two of those counties.\n\nSince cities are typically Democratic strongholds, as are rural areas for Republicans, the suburbs in between the two have always been highly contested. According to the Brookings Institute, there was a shift in large suburban counties from a 1.2 million vote advantage for Trump in 2016 to a 613,000 vote advantage for Biden as of mid-November.\n\nTrump and his allies have largely pointed toward cities as the crux of unfounded claims of fraud, but cities aren't to blame for the president's loss.\n\n\"There's also a pretty consistent pattern that cities are some of the only places where Trump performed better than he did four years ago,\" Wasserman said, pointing to Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Detroit – all cities in swing states – as well as New York and Chicago.\n\n\"The idea that somehow the patterns don't line up is preposterous, because we're seeing them in both the close states and the non-competitive states.\"\n\nThe \"blue wall\" wasn't the only place Biden won back with help from the suburbs. In Georgia, the state was flipped blue due to a combination of higher turnout in Atlanta and massive gains in the suburbs around it.\n\nIn Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta, Biden beat Trump by 240,000 votes to Clinton's 180,000 votes. And, in growing suburban counties Gwinnett and Cobb, which are farther out from Atlanta, Biden beat Trump by 132,000 votes. Clinton won those counties combined by just 26,000 votes.\n\nWasserman said that Biden's success in the suburbs is likely due to both attitudinal change in the past four years and the exodus of Black voters nationwide from cities to suburbs.\n\nFact check:Biden won popular, Electoral College votes in several battleground states\n\nBiden team already working toward transition\n\nBiden will be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, whether Trump acknowledges his win as legitimate or not. Biden has already begun the process of transitioning to the country’s highest office.\n\nThough Trump has not formally conceded, his administration has granted the new administration access to intelligence briefings, office space, secure computers and other government services, USA TODAY previously reported. Trump tweeted Nov. 23 that the move was made at his recommendation.\n\nThe announcement, made by Emily Murphy of the General Services Administration, allocated over $6 million to Biden’s transition team for hiring and other transition-related expenses. Since then, Biden has made a number of Cabinet picks, including his chief of staff, Treasury secretary, director of national intelligence, head of the Department of Homeland Security, ambassador to the United Nations, climate change envoy, secretary of State, Defense secretary and Health and Human Services secretary.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nAnalyses of the 2020 election results explain Trump's loss to Biden.

That is, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes more proportionally.\n\nBut what happens if electors who are pledged to vote according to the statewide or district popular vote pick someone else? That's called a \"faithless elector.\"\n\nHere's what they could mean for the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHow are electors chosen?\n\nThe Electoral College is made up of 538 delegates. The total number of electors represents the total number of U.S. senators, 100 (two per state); the total number of state representatives, 435; and three more electors for the District of Columbia.\n\nEach state has a number of electoral votes equal to the combined total of its congressional delegation, and each state legislature determines how it will select its own electors, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan association of legislatures.\n\nAccording to the association, the two most common methods that states use are nomination by state party convention and by state party committee. The parties typically select members \"known for their loyalty and service to the party,\" such as party leaders, state and local elected officials, and party activists.\n\nIn some states, the electors' names appear on the ballot along with the names of the candidates for president and vice president, according to the association.\n\nExplainer:Why can the Electoral College pick a president who got fewer votes?\n\nWhen does the Electoral College vote?\n\nThe electors meet in their respective states to cast a ballot for president and a second for vice president.\n\nElectors cast their ballots on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December of the presidential election – about a month after Americans cast their ballots in the popular vote. This year, electors will meet on Dec. 14.\n\nIt takes 270 or more electoral votes to win a presidential election.\n\nCan Electoral College really tie? Yes. It's not likely but here's how it works\n\nWhich states have laws against faithless electors? What does the Supreme Court say?\n\nThe Constitution and federal law are silent on the matter, but some states have passed laws that require their electors to vote as pledged. In July, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of these laws.\n\n\"The Constitution’s text and the nation’s history both support allowing a state to enforce an elector’s pledge to support his party’s nominee – and the state voters’ choice – for president,\" Associate Justice Elena Kagan wrote in an opinion.\n\nDuring the last oral argument of the court's term in May, justices on both sides of the ideological aisle expressed concern that electors could be bribed, particularly by the losing party in a close election.\n\n\"The Supreme Court made it clear that the elector is not there to vote his or her conscience. The elector is there to vote how the state dictates,\" said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley Law School. \"Most states now forbid faithless electors.\"\n\nSupreme Court rules:Presidential electors can be forced to uphold popular vote\n\nAt least 32 states and the District of Columbia have laws that attempt to bind the votes of electors. Those states are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nIn some of those states, rogue electors can be replaced or fined.\n\n\"Most of them do not have an enforcement mechanism, and the ones that do often simply punish the elector instead of purporting to correct the vote,\" said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n\nHow common are faithless electors?\n\nFaithless electors are not common, and they've never changed the outcome of a presidential election, according to FairVote, a nonprofit that advocates electoral reform.\n\nOnly one elector has cast a vote for the opposite party’s nominee instead of their own in a close contest, in 1796, according to the organization.\n\nOf the more than 23,000 electoral votes counted across 58 presidential elections, only 90 electors have cast \"deviant\" votes – not ordinary votes for the presidential nominee of the elector’s political party, according to FairVote.\n\n\"Faithless electors in the past ... have generally been trying to make a statement, not to change the result,\" Roosevelt said. \"In 1968, a North Carolina elector voted for George Wallace instead of Richard Nixon, but said explicitly later that he wouldn’t have done this if it would have changed the outcome.\"\n\nWhat happened in 2016?\n\nThere were an unusually high number of faithless electors in 2016.\n\nThat year, Donald Trump won with 304 electoral votes. It was the fifth time in American history that the winner of the presidential election lost the popular vote. And it was the second time since 2000 – when Al Gore won the popular vote but George W. Bush won the Electoral College – that a candidate lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College.\n\nTen electors were disloyal or tried to be in 2016. Eight were Democratic electors – from Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota and Washington – and two were Republican electors, both from Texas.\n\nMore than 4.5 million people signed a petition advocating for electors to have a change of heart.\n\n\"There were an unusual number in 2016 because there was a movement to try to get the electors to exercise independent judgment — either in order to throw the election to Hillary Clinton because she won the popular vote, or in order to make the House of Representatives resolve the election,\" Roosevelt said.\n\nCould faithless electors change the 2020 presidential election outcome?\n\nRoosevelt said he doesn't expect to see any faithless electors this year, especially after what happened last cycle.\n\n\"Electors are usually chosen pretty carefully, and after the 2016 election put a spotlight on them, I think the parties were probably even more focused on ensuring that they chose reliable people,\" he said.\n\nChemerinsky said the Supreme Court's decision \"might decrease\" the likelihood of there being any faithless electors this year.\n\nStill, faithless electors could alter the outcome of a close election, Roosevelt said.\n\n\"If we do end up with a close electoral vote, we could easily see a similar campaign to influence the votes of electors, but I don’t think it would succeed,\" Roosevelt said.\n\nRichard Pildes, a professor of constitutional law at the NYU School of Law, said the topic of faithless electors was \"not the issue for now.\"\n\nChemerinskyadded that it's \"potentially an issue, but, at this point, there are so many more salient questions to be resolved.\n\n\"Who’s going to win Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania?\"\n\nContributing: Richard Wolf", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/28/election-results-and-electoral-college-pick-next-president/4718619002/", "title": "End the Electoral College? Why some states want the popular vote", "text": "DENVER – As the presidential election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden focuses increasingly on a few swing states that will determine the winner, millions of Americans are asking why their votes are essentially being taken for granted.\n\nNow, a long-running effort to make the nation's presidential election a \"one person, one vote\" system is gaining favor among partisan Democrats still angry that Trump won the 2016 presidency despite losing the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes. Anxious voters continued waiting Thursday for results, which at the time showed Biden ahead of Trump with a significant amount of both popular and Electoral College votes.\n\nColorado is the latest state to adopt the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which seeks to essentially abolish the Electoral College without going through the near-impossible task of amending the U.S. Constitution. Coloradans on Nov. 3. approved the measure 52.1% to 47.8%, according to preliminary results.\n\nThe idea of abolishing the Electoral College has been around for decades, but the current proposal became more popular after Al Gore lost the 2000 election. It hinges on states agreeing to dedicate their electoral votes to whoever wins the overall popular vote for president, rather than dedicating their votes to the candidate who won their individual state.\n\nUnlike most elections in the U.S., the presidency is decided not directly by voters but by members of the Electoral College, who are assigned based on the results of the popular vote in each state.\n\nColorado now joins 14 states and Washington, D.C., as members of the compact, which takes effect once states with a total 270 electoral votes sign on. Colorado's nine electoral votes take the total to 196.\n\nSupporters say the measure would force candidates to campaign in states that today are often taken for granted because they vote so reliably Democrat or Republican that they can be safely ignored.\n\nThe proposal received new attention after the U.S. Supreme Court in July ruled that Electoral College electors in 32 states are legally obligated to cast their vote for the winner of their state's vote, rather than selecting someone else.\n\nClinton's 2016 loss emboldened Electoral College critics\n\nWhile the plan's longtime backers have pushed it in large part on a philosophical basis, some frustrated Democrats have hopped aboard in hopes of avoiding a repeat of the 2000 and 2016 elections, where Republicans George W. Bush and Trump lost the popular vote but still claimed the presidency.\n\nMany of the former 2020 Democratic presidential candidates generally supported either abolishing the Electoral College entirely or just using the compact to make it obsolete. Biden, however, has said he opposes changing the current system.\n\n\"The 2016 election was a good reminder of our democracy and what we need to do protect every single piece of it,\" said Daniel Ramos, former executive director of the LGBTQ advocacy group One Colorado. \"The conversation (supporting the initiative) seemed even more prominent given that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote and Donald Trump still became the president.\"\n\nElectoral College votes are generally distributed based on population, but highly populated states like California and New York, which tend to favor Democrats, have proportionally fewer votes. That's because the Electoral College system was also designed to give rural states a larger vote than they might otherwise be entitled to, especially those at the time with large populations of enslaved African Americans.\n\nToday, California, for instance, has 40 million residents and 55 electoral votes, while Wyoming has about 560,000 residents and three votes. That means Wyoming's electors represent about 186,300 voters apiece, while California's are proxy for more than 727,000 each. In other words, Wyoming's Electoral College votes count almost four times more than California's on a per-person basis.\n\nEach state has as many Electoral College votes as it does members of Congress. The 2020 Census will likely cause some states to lose votes while others gain as the nation's population shifts.\n\nRace to White House hangs on swing states\n\nBecause most states have a \"winner take all\" policy for awarding those electoral votes, a candidate who just barely loses a large state's popular vote gets zero electoral college votes. That means candidates are increasingly focusing on swing states they might win while largely ignoring states that will either reliably support them or their opponent.\n\nIn the 2020 presidential election, much of the focus has been on close races in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In the waning days, both Trump and Biden campaigned frequently in Pennsylvania in particular, which is still counting votes as of Thursday afternoon. Neither has campaigned heavily in either California, which is firmly Democratic, or Wyoming, which largely votes Republicans.\n\nThe League of Women Voters, the nonpartisan elections advocacy group, has long called for the Electoral College to be abolished or changed, and it has backed the popular-vote compact for 50 years. The league argues every vote should be weighted the same, regardless of who it benefits politically, because the concept of \"one person, one vote\" is so central to the American ideal.\n\nAmong the states that have adopted the compact: Vermont, California, New York and Illinois.\n\n\"We think elections should be done with 'one vote for one person' for every election, right down to student council,\" said Ruth Stemler, president of the Colorado League of Women Voters. \"We're sorry that it's taken us 50 years, but it's time for our democracy to take care of this now.\"\n\nSupporters of a popular vote point out that while independent presidential candidate Ross Perot won 19% of the overall vote in 1992, he didn't collect a single electoral vote because he didn't \"win\" a single state. And while generally the winner of the popular vote becomes president, the Electoral College picked someone else five times, in 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000 and 2016.\n\nSome Democrats and Republicans want the popular vote to pick the president\n\nA poll in Colorado a year ago by Magellan Strategies found that support for joining the compact split largely along party lines, strongest among younger Democrats and opposed most strongly by older Republicans.\n\nFormer California Republican legislator Ray Haynes Jr. said he has always counted himself a fan of the Electoral College but now also supports the popular-vote compact because it would force candidates to campaign in more places.\n\nHaynes, who served in both the California Assembly and Senate starting in 1992 and was chairman of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, argues the winner-takes-all approach used by 48 states and the District of Columbia improperly makes candidates focus on \"a battleground precinct in a battleground city in a battleground county in a battleground state,\" giving residents in those areas a disproportionate amount of influence.\n\n\"The party spends so much time to persuade these moderate Republicans in their battleground states that they lose the conservative message,\" said Haynes, who has campaigned for the popular-vote compact. \"A lot of the national policy gets driven by very narrow slices of voters in very narrow slices of certain states. You ought to listen to everybody.\"\n\nHayes said the Republican Party can overcome the natural inclination of urban residents to vote Democrat by offering a consistent conservative message: \"You get in the trenches, I get in the trenches and we battle it out over ideas.\"\n\nIn the 2016 general election campaign, half of all campaign events were held in just Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Ohio, highlighting their importance in the Electoral College calculations, according to compact backers.\n\nBut critics say the measure would actually give more power to Democrat-dominated coastal cities in New York and California, where in 2016 Clinton ran up huge overall margins but still lost the Electoral College and therefore the presidency to Trump. Under the popular vote, a Democrat could campaign more efficiently by focusing on large cities that already tend to lean liberal, counting on their support to overwhelm less-populated but more conservative areas.\n\nIn Colorado, conservative commentator Krista Kafer, who opposes the popular vote, said she's convinced the current system forces more coalition-building. Many conservatives joke that direct democracies are the equivalent of two wolves and a sheep voting on what to eat for dinner.\n\n\"Politicians would spend the season courting Californians, New Yorkers, Illinoisans and Floridians,\" Kafer said. \"Those of us in flyover country and our concerns would be ignored.\"\n\nSupporters of the current system say the Electoral College has served the nation well for generations by ensuring rural areas are heard.\n\n\"The Constitution, in a lot of ways, is designed to make sure we don't have big cities just running everything,\" said Trent England, director of Oklahoma-based Save Our States, which opposes the popular-vote compact.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/12/15/fact-check-joe-biden-legally-won-presidential-election/6537586002/", "title": "Fact check: Joe Biden legally won presidential election", "text": "The claim: Joe Biden did not legally win the presidential election\n\nEven as the Electoral College certified Joe Biden's 2020 election victory and Inauguration Day nears, some still claim the U.S. has yet to legitimately elect a president.\n\n\"Biden did not win legally everyone post and drive Facebook censors crazy!\" reads a Dec. 12 Facebook post, which has been shared nearly 5,000 times.

But in his memoir, he largely defends Trump – touting the former president’s achievements, downplaying controversies and excusing Trump’s personal vendettas, including against the late Arizona Sen. John McCain.\n\nStill, Pence – who said Trump was “reckless” with his tweet attacking his vice president that day – was critical of Trump over the events surrounding the insurrection, writing that he told Trump directly afterward that he was angry and that what he’d seen that day infuriated him.\n\n“The truth was, as reckless as the president’s tweet was, I really didn’t have time for it. Rioters were ransacking the Capitol,” Pence wrote. “Some of them, I was later told, were chanting, ‘Hang Mike Pence!’ The president had decided to be part of the problem. I was determined to be part of the solution. I ignored the tweet and got back to work.”\n\nThe conversations between Trump and Pence have been one of the key themes of the House’s January 6 committee hearings, and the book gives Pence, who has not testified before the committee, the chance to weigh in on his exchanges with Trump.\n\nPence said that he’d begun election night in 2020 confident, but things changed later in the evening, he wrote, when results in states with large shares of mail-in ballots “began to shift” and the Trump-Pence ticket’s lead “started to vanish.”\n\n“The mood in the White House, initially ebullient, began to sour,” Pence wrote.\n\nHe described watching Trump claim in an early Wednesday morning speech that the election process had been “a fraud on the American public” and said the days that followed the election were “a little like the twilight zone,” as Trump’s team challenged states’ results.\n\nThe Saturday after the election, Pence wrote, Trump’s son-in-law and top aide Jared Kushner called him to ask whether he thought there had been fraud in the election. He told Kushner there likely was some fraud, but he doubted it was why they’d lost, according to the book.\n\nHere are other key moments Pence described in his memoir:\n\n‘What if we hadn’t had the rally?’\n\nWhile Pence acknowledges the reality of the electoral vote count, he does not describe Joe Biden as having won the 2020 race fairly, or take issue with the Trump campaign’s strategy of fighting swing states’ results in court. He discusses turning the Texas effort to challenge some states’ electoral votes into an applause line while campaigning in Georgia for two Republican senators in runoff elections.\n\nPence wrote that he asked his general counsel for a briefing on the procedures of the Electoral Count Act after Trump in a December 5 phone call “mentioned challenging the election results in the House of Representatives for the first time.”\n\nOver lunch on December 21, Pence wrote, he tried to steer Trump to listen to the White House counsel’s team’s advice, rather than outside lawyers.\n\n“I said, ‘You’ve got a good team at the White House,’ to which he grumbled, ‘No, I don’t,’” Pence wrote. “If the president had chosen to listen to those good men and not the gaggle of outside lawyers who took over the election challenges from the campaign, things would have been very different.”\n\nPence wrote that Trump told him in a New Year’s Day phone call: “You’re too honest,” he chided, predicting that “hundreds of thousands are gonna hate your guts” and “people are gonna think you’re stupid.”\n\n“Mr. President, I don’t question there were irregularities and fraud,” Pence wrote that he told Trump. “It’s just a question of who decides, and under the law that is Congress.”\n\n“With that, the president said that he guessed it probably just ‘takes courage,’ implying that was what I lacked,” Pence continued. “I paused before replying and, facing him from my seat in front of the Resolute Desk, said firmly, ‘Mr. President, I have courage, and you know that.’”\n\nPence wrote that Trump relented and “said with more than a little sadness, ‘Well, I’m gonna have to say you did a great disservice.’”\n\nPence, who said he refused to leave the Capitol on January 6, also wrote about his meeting with Trump in the days after January 6. Trump asked Pence, “Were you scared?” the former vice president wrote. “‘No,’ I replied, ‘I was angry. You and I had our differences that day, Mr. President, and seeing those people tearing up the Capitol infuriated me.’”\n\nPence wrote that he told Trump he was praying for him and encouraged him to pray. Trump didn’t say anything initially, Pence said, and then responded with “genuine sadness” in his voice: “What if we hadn’t had the rally? What if they hadn’t gone to the Capitol?”\n\nA personal warning to Putin\n\nPence wrote that in 2018, when he was representing the United States at the ASEAN conference in Singapore – the type of meeting he says Trump “was never big on” – he was approached at a plenary session with a tap on the shoulder by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“I noticed that Putin projected a familiarity toward me. It came, I concluded, from his friendly meeting with Trump earlier in the year. It was as if we were old acquaintances,” Pence wrote. “I didn’t return the favor. I kept my expression firm and fixed, and the photo of me looking down at him with a furrowed brow and a grim expression was published around the world, just as I’d hoped it would be.”\n\nAt the end of the session, during a brief meeting requested by the Russians, Pence said Putin “was just inches from me, expecting a friendly chat.”\n\nWhen Putin wrapped up his comments about restarting nuclear nonproliferation negotiations, Pence said he told the Russian leader: “Mr. President, we know what happened in 2016, and it can’t happen again.”\n\n“Though Putin speaks English, he listened as his translator leaned in, relaying my message. His expression grew incredulous. He turned with a question to his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, presumably asking what I was talking about. The only word I recognized was ‘elections,’” Pence wrote. “Then he spoke through his translator, saying Russia had nothing to do with the election. To which I responded, ‘Mr. President, I’m very aware of what you’ve said about that, but I’m telling you we know what happened in 2016, and it can’t happen again.’ Putin seemed taken aback. Then he shrugged and changed the subject back to his upcoming summit in Argentina.”\n\nPence wrote that it was “absolutely right” for the FBI to investigate claims of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, but pushed back on the idea “the investigation was into the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia and into Trump himself.”\n\nPence acknowledged that Russia did interfere in the 2016 election but insisted “its mischief had not elected Trump president” and called it an “attempt to sow discord, to destabilize US democracy, to spread false information across both left-wing and right-wing platforms so as to turn Americans against one another.”\n\n“I always had the impression that the president felt that acknowledging Russian meddling would somehow cheapen our victory,” he wrote. “But in my view, there was no reason for Trump not to call out Russia’s bad behavior; it wasn’t an admission of collusion but a declaration that our intelligence services knew what Putin’s regime had been up to. I had no problem calling Russia out.”\n\nMeeting with North Koreans at 2018 Olympics scrapped\n\nPence confirmed that he had been set to meet with North Korean officials during the 2018 Olympic Games, but the meeting was pulled down hours beforehand by Pyongyang.\n\nThe North Koreans had been the ones pushing for engagement in Pyeongchang, Pence said, also noting that former South Korean President Moon Jae-in had “wanted to politely force a meeting.”\n\nThe former vice president said that while the Olympics began, “the North Korean government was making back-channel overtures to me about having a meeting.”\n\n“I relayed the information to Trump. See what they have to say, he told me. If the meeting can be arranged, take it,” Pence recounted.\n\nThe meeting “appeared to be a go” and was arranged to take place on Pence’s last day in South Korea, at the Blue House. However, “two hours before the meeting was set to begin, we got word that the North Koreans were no longer willing to participate and we were told that the order ‘came from Pyongyang,’ leading to speculation that Kim Jong Un was irritated by my refusal to engage with his sister while the cameras clicked and the world watched.”\n\nPence had been seated in the same box with Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, at the Olympic Stadium, but as Pence put it: “I ignored her.”\n\nThe former vice president also described what he said were efforts by the former South Korean leader to get him to engage with the North Korean leaders.\n\n“Before the opening ceremony, there was a large reception and dinner for the two hundred national leaders in attendance,” he recalled, noting that Moon had arranged for he and the North Koreans to be seated at the head table, and that “a group photograph was arranged at the outset of the banquet.” Pence and former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe intentionally arrived late to the banquet and did not participate in the group photo.\n\n“That would have been a huge symbolic victory for North Korea. No chance,” Pence said.\n\nTrump’s relationship with Fauci\n\nPence delves into his role in the Trump administration’s battle against the coronavirus pandemic, and details the relationship between Trump and Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert.\n\nPence praised Fauci, writing, “I was glad he was there. He was a reassuring voice to the public; Mitch McConnell had advised me, correctly, that Fauci would be a valuable member of the team because of his stature.”\n\nHowever, Pence expressed how he didn’t understand why Fauci “was so insistent that Covid-19 had not emerged from a Chinese lab,” adding that he believed Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during most of the Trump administration, held a correct assessment in the lab leak theory.\n\n“Dr. Robert Redfield of the CDC always held that it had, and the more we have learned, the more I believe that Bob was right,” Pence wrote.\n\nPence commented on Trump and Fauci’s relationship, writing that it was “very good” initially.\n\n“Trump is from Queens, Fauci from Brooklyn, and Fauci was not put off by Trump’s New York brashness. He had grown up around it. He is a brash New Yorker, too,” Pence wrote.\n\nFrustration with McCain over Obamacare vote\n\nPence detailed the personal angst between Trump and McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee who died in 2018. Trump had attacked McCain during the 2016 presidential campaign, saying he didn’t consider the man who had been a prisoner of war in Vietnam to be a hero.\n\n“They were both sharp-elbowed men who punched back hard when attacked. But I always believed that had McCain lived, they would eventually have become friends,” Pence wrote.\n\nHe also made clear that he still resents the terminally ill McCain’s return to the Senate floor to cast the vote that would doom the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPence wrote that he had put Trump and McCain on the phone together. McCain, in Pence’s retelling of the call, told Trump he was honored by the call, and gave no indication he would vote against the GOP bill.\n\n“Then he walked out of the office, onto the Senate floor, caught the eye of the Senate clerk, gave a thumbs-down, walked over to his desk, and sat down,” Pence wrote. “There was an audible gasp. The effort to repeal and replace Obamacare was dead. The Trump administration had just been knocked back on its heels. Trump was irate. I was, too.”\n\nPence wrote that South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close friend of McCain, “deserved better” on the Obamacare repeal effort from his friend.\n\n“In a fitting twist, immediately after McCain voted down Obamacare repeal, Rand Paul blocked consideration of the fiscal-year spending for the Departments of Defense, Energy, and State, which was nicknamed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act,” Pence wrote. “Trump was delighted. McCain was incensed. He actually said, ‘It is unfortunate that one senator chose to block consideration of a bill our nation needs right now.’ Takes one to know one.”", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Jeremy Herb Jennifer Hansler Maegan Vazquez Nikki Carvajal Veronica Stracqualursi Kit Maher", "Eric Bradner", "Jeremy Herb", "Jennifer Hansler", "Maegan Vazquez", "Nikki Carvajal", "Veronica Stracqualursi", "Kit Maher"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/09/donald-trump-nation-world-obama/93534352/", "title": "President-elect Trump vows to bring nation 'together as never before'", "text": "David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK — The political establishment, the nation as a whole, and the world at large began coming to terms Wednesday with a new reality: President-elect Donald J. Trump.\n\nAmid shocked reactions across the globe, President Obama and Trump — who attacked each other vociferously during the long campaign — spoke by phone as the president invited his successor-in-waiting to the White House on Thursday for transition planning.\n\nIn a statement at the White House, Obama asked his staff to work for a smooth transition, just as President George W. Bush and his team did for them eight years ago. He called the peaceful transfer of power \"one of the hallmarks of our democracy.\"\n\nObama: Americans must support President-elect Trump\n\nThe Trump-Obama rivalry fuels 2016 campaign\n\nIn accepting victory early Wednesday, the New York businessman struck a conciliatory tone after a brutal campaign against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division — have to get together,\" Trump told screaming supporters gathered at the New York Hilton. \"To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.\"\n\nIn a concession speech, defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton said her party needs to accept the election of Trump, adding that \"we owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.\"\n\nTrump himself has no events on Wednesday's schedule, as he and he aides begin putting together a White House staff and Cabinet.\n\nTrump win will also roil Republican Party\n\nTrump claims victory in stunning upset, calls for healing divisions\n\nIn claiming the presidency during the wee hours of Wednesday, the incoming Republican president did not mention his most criticized proposals, including calls to rework trade deals and his pledge to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump also issued his first tweet as president-elect: \"Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as never before.\"\n\nThere has never been a president like Trump, someone who has never held political office or a military leadership position. In a campaign that began in June 2015, Trump argued that \"the establishment\" and the government have betrayed Americans with bad trade deals, leaky immigration policies, and moves toward a globalized economy that leaves people behind.\n\nThursday's meeting at the White House will match the nation's first African-American president with a challenger who made his political name in part by becoming the de facto leader of the \"birther movement,\" the false idea that Obama was not born in the United States. Some analysts said racist and sexist animus drove part of Trump's insurgent campaign.\n\nU.S. political analysts said Trump's status as a non-politician \"outsider\" threatening to shake up the establishment resonated with voters, as did his attacks on trade and immigration policies. The election winner did better than expected with female voters and cranked out a large number of white working-class votes, especially in rural areas.\n\nPredictions that blacks, women and Millennials would not vote Trump proved largely untrue\n\nHow anti-establishment outsider Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States\n\nTrump will enter office with a Republican Senate and House. GOP congressional leaders praised Trump's election and said they would launch an agenda that ranges from repeal of the Obama health care law to a reduction of government regulations on business.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters that Trump \"earned a mandate\" and \"we're going to hit the ground running.\"\n\nPolitical analysts attributed Trump's victory to a number of factors.\n\nRepublican consultant Bruce Haynes, founding partner of Washington-based Purple Strategies, called it a reaction to an \"economic and cultural globalism\" that has triggered a \"populist revolt\" against trade and immigration policies. He said Trump became \"the right candidate with a the right message at the right time.\"\n\nTexas-based political consultant Matt Mackowiak, a critic of Trump during the campaign, said no one knows what lies on the other side of an extraordinary election. The new president \"will need a first rate Cabinet and senior staff. 'cause his learning curve will be steep,\" he said.\n\nMark McKinnon, a former aide to President George W. Bush, said he is hopeful that President Trump can exceed expectations.\n\n\"The good news is that people who thought they were disenfranchised now have a voice,\" McKinnon said. \"Now maybe we can start healing.\"\n\nClinton will probably win the actual popular vote, but Trump won enough states to prevail in the Electoral College.

In interviews with WABC radio and the New York Post – the first times Santos has spoken publicly about the controversy – he acknowledged that he had fabricated some facts.\n\n“I am not a criminal. Not here, not abroad, in any jurisdiction in the world have I ever committed any crimes,” Santos said in an interview with WABC radio host John Catsimatidis.\n\n“To get down to the nit and gritty, I’m not a fraud.

CNN confirmed details of that reporting, including about his college education and employment history.\n\nCNN’s KFile also reported last week that claims by Santos that his grandparents “survived the Holocaust” as Ukrainian Jewish refugees from Belgium who changed their surname are contradicted by sources including family trees compiled by genealogy websites, records on Jewish refugees and interviews with multiple genealogists.

In some cases, they told him to his face that his information was wrong.\n\nTestimony to the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has revealed that it wasn’t only journalists, elections officials and Democrats who were rejecting Trump’s lies about what happened in the election he lost but claimed to win. People Trump selected for important positions, from his campaign manager to the US attorney general, were also saying – mostly in private – that Trump’s fraud allegations were baseless.\n\nThe January 6 hearings are ongoing, and the public has only seen committee-selected video clips of certain former officials’ testimony. We know that some other figures in Trump’s orbit were joining him in promoting lies about the election, not rejecting those lies.\n\nBut the hearings have already shown that Trump’s government appointees or people on his campaign dismissed at least 10 of his false claims – from the overarching lie that the election was stolen to various specific tales about what happened in swing states he lost.\n\nHere’s a list.\n\n1) The false claim of a ‘stolen’ election\n\nTrump has incessantly repeated the false claim that the election was stolen from him – baselessly insisting that he would have been returned to the White House if not for massive fraud and other nefarious Democratic behavior.\n\nBut William Barr, who served as attorney general under Trump, testified to the committee: “I made it clear I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff, which I told the President was bullshit.” Barr testified that “my opinion then and my opinion now is that the election was not stolen by fraud.”\n\nRichard Donoghue, who served as principal associate deputy attorney general and then as acting deputy attorney general, also testified that claims of major fraud were untrue – and that he told Trump directly: “I said something to the effect of, ‘Sir, we’ve done dozens of investigations, hundreds of interviews. The major allegations are not supported by the evidence developed. We’ve looked at Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada. We’re doing our job. Much of the info you’re getting is false.’”\n\nJeffrey Rosen, who served as deputy attorney general and then briefly, after Barr’s resignation in December 2020, as acting attorney general, said that when Trump would cite a supposed election impropriety, claiming that “people are telling me this” or “I heard this” or “I saw on television,” they could correct him: “We were in a position to say, ‘Our people already looked at that. And we know that you’re getting bad information. That’s – that’s not correct. It’s been demonstrated to be incorrect from our point of view. It’s been debunked.”\n\nDerek Lyons, who was White House staff secretary and counselor to Trump, testified that, at a meeting about a month and a half after Election Day, top White House lawyers Pat Cipollone and Eric Herschmann “told the group, the President included, that, you know, none of those allegations had been substantiated to the point where they could be the basis for any litigation challenge to the election.”\n\nAlex Cannon, who was a lawyer for the Trump campaign, testified that he told Vice President Mike Pence at the White House in November 2020 that he had not found “anything sufficient to alter the results of the election” and that he had told White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on a November 2020 call that “we weren’t finding anything that would be sufficient to change the results in any of the key states.”\n\nMatt Morgan, who was the Trump campaign’s general counsel, testified that, as of early January 2021, he and top Pence advisers – chief of staff Marc Short and attorney Greg Jacob – were in agreement that even “if aggregated and read most favorably to the campaign,” election “fraud, maladministration, abuse or irregularities” were “not sufficient to be outcome-determinative.”\n\n2) The false claim that Trump had won on Election Night\n\nTrump falsely claimed in a speech on Election Night that he had won the election because he had leads in the vote counts in several key states. Trump used similar language in his rally speech on January 6, 2021 – claiming that “our election was over at 10 o’clock in the evening,” when the vote counts showed him leading in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, but “then late in the evening or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bullshit.”\n\nBut it was clear to other key figures in Trump’s orbit – as it was to millions of others – that his leads in the early Election Night count, as millions of votes remained uncounted, did not mean he had won. Bill Stepien, who was Trump’s campaign manager, testified that Election Night was “too early to call the race”: “It was far too early to be making any calls like that. Ballots – ballots were still being counted. Ballots were still going to be counted for days.”\n\nStepien said he had explained to Trump that early returns would be “positive,” but they would then have a long night waiting for the counting of additional ballots. The fact that states’ vote counts got worse for Trump as the hours went by, Barr said, was not indicative of fraud: Barr noted that “people had been talking for weeks, and everyone understood for weeks, that that was going to be what happened on Election Night.”\n\nIndeed, Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, testified that people at the White House on Election Night were a little nervous to see what would happen with “the red wave or the red mirage.” Red mirage was a term media outlets had been citing for months to explain that early results would almost certainly be misleadingly favorable to Trump because it would take time for states to count the mail-in ballots Trump had warned his own supporters against using.\n\nMiller testified that he recalled saying on Election Night “that we should not go and declare victory until we had a better sense of the numbers.” Ivanka Trump, Trump’s daughter and senior adviser, testified that she didn’t know if she had held a “firm view” about what Trump should say on Election Night, but she added, “The results were still being counted. It was becoming clear that the race would not be called on Election Night.”\n\n3) A false claim about fraudulent totals in Philadelphia\n\nTrump tweeted in December 2020 that there were “MORE VOTES THAN ACTUAL VOTERS” in Philadelphia. He repeated that claim in a January 2022 interview with NPR, though he phrased it as a question.\n\nBarr testified that the claim was “absolute rubbish.” (In reality, about two-thirds of Philadelphia’s registered voters cast a ballot in the 2020 election.) Barr added: “The turnout in Philadelphia was in line with the state’s turnout and in fact it was not as – as impressive as many suburban counties. And there was nothing strange about the Philadelphia turnout. It wasn’t like there was all these unexpected votes that came out in Philadelphia.”\n\n4) A false claim about absentee ballots in Pennsylvania\n\nTrump tweeted in late November 2020 to promote a graphic that suggested Pennsylvania had recorded far more mail-in votes in the general election than the number of mail-in ballots it had actually distributed to voters. Trump added, “The 1,126,940 votes were created out of thin air.”\n\nBut the graphic was plain wrong; the supposed 1,126,940 extra votes did not exist at all, as Pennsylvania journalists quickly explained. The graphic – which had been posted by Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, now the Republican gubernatorial nominee – improperly contrasted numbers from the November 2020 general election with numbers from the state’s June 2020 primaries.\n\nBarr explained in his testimony that Mastriano had been comparing apples to oranges. “Once you actually go and look and compare apples to apples, there’s no discrepancy at all,” he said.\n\n5) A false claim about a truckload of ballots being driven from New York to Pennsylvania\n\nIn December 2020, Trump tweeted out a video clip featuring a Fox interview with a truck driver who claimed he had been unwittingly used in a scheme to transport numerous completed mail-in ballots from New York to Pennsylvania.\n\nDonoghue testified that he told Trump: “I essentially said, ‘Look, we looked at that allegation. We looked at both ends, both the people who load the truck and the people unload the truck. And that allegation was not supported by the evidence.”\n\n6) False claims about Dominion voting technology\n\nTrump and some of his allies made multiple false claims about the election technology provided by a company called Dominion Voting Systems. They inaccurately alleged that Dominion technology had switched Trump votes to Biden votes in large numbers and that Dominion was a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez. (Dominion is pursuing a series of defamation lawsuits over such claims; the company was actually founded in Canada, is not connected to Chavez, and did not flip or otherwise manipulate 2020 votes.)\n\nBarr testified: “I saw absolutely zero basis for the allegations, but they were made in such a sensational way that they obviously were influencing a lot of people, members of the public, that there was this systemic corruption in the system and that their votes didn’t count and that these machines controlled by somebody else were actually determining it, which was complete nonsense. And it was being laid out there. And I told them that it was – that it was crazy stuff and they were wasting their time on that. And it was doing a great, grave disservice to the country.”\n\nBarr added of Trump and Dominion: “And I was somewhat demoralized because I thought, boy, if he really believes this stuff he has, you know, lost contact with – with – he’s become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff.” Barr also said of Trump: “There was never an indication of interest in what the actual facts were.”\n\nCannon testified that he told Trump adviser Peter Navarro in mid-November 2020 that he “didn’t believe the Dominion allegations.” And Herschmann dismissed various theories put forward by lawyer Sidney Powell, who promoted a variety of conspiracy theories about election technology and foreign interference. (Powell is one of the people being sued by Dominion.) Herschmann called at least one theory “completely nuts” – it wasn’t clear in the clip shown by the committee which theory he was referring to – and scoffed at claims about “Hugo Chavez and the Venezuelans.”\n\n7) A false claim about Dominion machines in Michigan\n\nTrump tweeted in December 2020 to claim that there was a “68% error rate in Michigan Voting Machines” – exaggerating a conspiratorial consultant’s finding, about a single Michigan county, that was itself quickly debunked by Michigan media.\n\nDonoghue, too, rejected the “68% error rate” claim. He testified of a conversation with Trump: “And then I went into, for instance, this thing from Michigan, this report about ’68% error rate.’ Reality is it was only 0.0063% error rate, less than 1 in 15,000. So the President accepted that. He said, ‘OK, fine, but what about the others?’”\n\n8) A false claim about non-citizens voting in Arizona\n\nTrump falsely claimed in his January 6, 2021, rally speech that, in Arizona, “over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens.”\n\nStepien testified that the claim that “thousands of illegal citizens, people not eligible to vote” had cast Arizona ballots was a “wild claim” that “on its face didn’t seem, you know, realistic or possible to me.” He said that after asking Cannon to look into the claim, it turned out “the reality of that was not illegal citizens voting in the election” but rather that the votes were cast by “people who were eligible to vote.”\n\n9) The false story about election workers in Georgia\n\nTrump and some of his allies, notably including lawyer Rudy Giuliani, repeatedly made false claims about fraud they insisted had been committed by elections workers in Fulton County, Georgia, home to Atlanta. Trump declared in his January 6, 2021, rally speech that workers had pulled “suitcases of ballots out from under a table” and illegally scanned “tens of thousands of votes.”\n\nDonoghue testified that he debunked the claim at length to Trump: “The President kept fixating on this suitcase that supposedly had fraudulent ballots and that the suitcase was rolled out from under the table. And I said, ‘No sir, there is no suitcase.’ You can watch that video over and over. There is no suitcase. There is a wheeled bin where they carry the ballots, and that’s just how they move ballots around that facility. There’s nothing suspicious about that at all. I told him that there was no multiple scanning of the ballots – one of the – one part of that allegation was that they were taking one ballot and scanning it through three or four or five times to rack up votes, presumably for Vice President Biden. I told him that the video did not support that.”\n\nByung “BJay” Pak, a Trump-appointed former US attorney in Georgia who was previously a Republican state legislator, testified that the supposed “suitcase” was actually an “official lockbox” for storing ballots at that facility and that the full video disproved the fraud claims Giuliani had tried to promote by showing Georgia legislators a limited section of the footage. Pak, who resigned in January 2021, testified: “We interviewed – the FBI interviewed – the individuals that are depicted in the videos, that purportedly were double, triple counting of the ballots, and determined that nothing irregular happened in the counting, and the allegations made by Mr. Giuliani were false.”\n\n10) The false claim that “2000 Mules” proves the election was rigged\n\nTrump has seized on a movie called “2000 Mules,” made by a right-wing filmmaker, that claims to contain proof of a major fraudulent scheme involving Democrats and the submission of mail-in ballots at drop boxes. Trump has suggested that the movie proves his assertion that the election was rigged.\n\nBut similar to numerous others who have pointed out major holes in “2000 Mules,” Barr described the movie’s purported cell phone evidence as “singularly unimpressive,” said its purported photo evidence was “lacking,” and noted that it “didn’t establish widespread illegal harvesting” of ballots.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/12/08/fact-check-president-donald-trump-did-not-win-2020-election/6467942002/", "title": "Fact check: President Donald Trump did not win 2020 election", "text": "The claim: President Donald Trump won the 2020 election\n\nWeeks after the bitterly fought presidential race ended with the naming of Joe Biden as the projected winner over President Donald Trump, some are still claiming a victor can not yet be named.\n\n“President Trump won and the world is starting to see!

The user who made the post did not respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment.\n\nThat same claim has been promoted by the president himself, who has not yet conceded the election to Biden.\n\n“NO WAY WE LOST THIS ELECTION!” Trump tweeted Nov. 29, along with a video of his supporters.\n\nFact check:Image from 2017 White House event altered to make claim about votes for Biden\n\nTrump falls short in popular, electoral votes; lawsuits fail\n\nDespite efforts to convince the country and the courts otherwise, Trump did not win reelection.\n\nTrump broke President Barack Obama’s popular vote record with over 74 million votes, but still fell short of Biden, who surpassed Trump – and all previous presidential candidates – by racking up a record-shattering 81 million votes. The Biden-Harris ticket gained roughly 51% of the popular vote to the Trump-Pence ticket’s 47%, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\nBut as the 2000 and 2016 elections showed, the popular vote is not the sole determinant of presidential elections; the Electoral College makes the final call.\n\nEach state is allowed a number of electors, which is determined by adding its number of senators (always two) to its number of House representatives (varies by state). Nationwide, there are 538 electoral votes to cast.\n\nOn Election Day, people vote for their preferred candidate's electors, who are chosen by political parties or independent candidates before the election. Those individuals, collectively the Electoral College, then cast votes for president and vice president, usually representing the choice their state's voters made.\n\nCandidates have to win at least half of the country's electoral votes (270 votes) to be elected president.\n\nBiden is projected to receive 306 electoral votes to Trump’s projected 232, thanks to wins in key states like Georgia (16 electoral votes), Michigan (16 votes), Wisconsin (10 votes), Pennsylvania (20 votes) and Arizona (11 votes). Trump won by the same Electoral College breakdown in 2016, which he called a “massive landslide victory” at the time.\n\nThe Trump campaign and its allies flooded state and federal courts after the election, filing over 40 lawsuits, primarily in battleground states, according to a running tally by Marc Elias, a Democratic elections expert and founder of Democracy Docket. The lawsuits claimed ballots had errors because voters were required to use Sharpies, observers didn't have enough access to monitor ballot counting and late-arriving mail ballots were improperly mixed with legal votes.\n\nNone has gotten very far; just one case has been won and at least eight are pending.\n\nMore:Texas attorney general asks Supreme Court to block Biden victory in 4 states\n\nDave Wasserman, House editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, told USA TODAY that Trump has no path to victory.\n\n\"The case for Trump having won the election is so preposterous that the only explanation is that the losing side does not like the results,\" he said.\n\nMore:For these Trump supporters primed to disbelieve defeat, challenging the election was a civic duty\n\nBiden improved on Clinton’s gains\n\nMany Trump supporters have expressed disbelief that Biden won, and by such margins. But Biden’s campaign won by persuading just enough swing voters, making gains in unexpected states and rebuilding the coveted “blue wall” that toppled in 2016.\n\nAccording to CNN’s national exit poll, 94% of self-described Democrats voted for Biden in 2020 compared to Hillary Clinton’s 89% of self-described Democrats in 2016, and 89% of self-described liberals, compared to Clinton’s 84%.\n\nBiden’s victory was really won on the basis of support from moderates and independents, though. He received 64% of votes cast by self-described moderates, 12 points ahead of Clinton, and won independents by 13 points – a group that Clinton lost by 4 points.\n\nBiden continued to build on the groundwork laid out by Clinton in historically red states like Arizona and Georgia. Clinton did not win Arizona or Georgia in 2016, but she did perform better than Obama in both. The swing toward Biden in those states was more than double his national swing, CNN reported.\n\nWasserman said he predicted prior to the election that Arizona and Georgia would flip, but the similar states of Texas and Florida would not due to their Hispanic electorate.\n\n\"It's the fact that Texas and Florida have such high Hispanic shares, but in particular, in Florida, the Hispanic electorate is substantially Cuban, and we knew that that was a particular strength for Trump entering this election, whereas in Arizona, Hispanic voters are predominantly of Mexican ancestry and Trump did not make as strong astride among those voters,\" he said. \"In Georgia, there's not much of a Hispanic vote to speak of so it was really a question of what the shift would be in the Atlanta suburbs.\"\n\nFact check:Video claim that Dominion tech manipulated Georgia votes is false\n\n'Blue wall' rebuilt with suburban votes\n\nTrump suggested throughout his campaign that Biden would \"destroy the beautiful suburbs,\" but it turned out many suburbanites disagreed.\n\nBiden won back a number of crucial Midwest states that Clinton lost to Trump in 2016 largely thanks to suburban voters. The cluster of historically Democrat-won states, dubbed the “blue wall,” include three of the five major battleground states this election cycle.\n\n\"We saw a consistent pattern across the country, in both close states and states that weren't so close, that Biden made significant strides compared to Clinton's performance four years ago in suburbs, predominantly affluent suburbs, of major metro areas,\" Wasserman said.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the divide between the state's rural and urban populations was defined, as 42 Wisconsin counties, many small and rural, cast more ballots for Trump than in 2016. Biden won Wisconsin by bolstering support in the populous suburbs of Milwaukee and Madison, despite average turnout in the cities themselves. Biden erased Trump's entire 2016 margin in Wisconsin in just the counties surrounding Milwaukee, Wasserman said.\n\nThat same divide made Michigan competitive. Biden made gains in counties like Kent, where Grand Rapids is located, and the Detroit metropolitan area, though he underperformed Clinton in the city of Detroit. Trump improved his margins statewide, but not enough to surpass Biden’s lead.\n\nBiden again leaned on the suburbs of major metropolitan areas in Pennsylvania, outperforming Clinton by more than 150,000 votes in the four counties surrounding Philadelphia. Wasserman said Biden erased Trump's 2016 margin in just two of those counties.\n\nSince cities are typically Democratic strongholds, as are rural areas for Republicans, the suburbs in between the two have always been highly contested. According to the Brookings Institute, there was a shift in large suburban counties from a 1.2 million vote advantage for Trump in 2016 to a 613,000 vote advantage for Biden as of mid-November.\n\nTrump and his allies have largely pointed toward cities as the crux of unfounded claims of fraud, but cities aren't to blame for the president's loss.\n\n\"There's also a pretty consistent pattern that cities are some of the only places where Trump performed better than he did four years ago,\" Wasserman said, pointing to Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Detroit – all cities in swing states – as well as New York and Chicago.\n\n\"The idea that somehow the patterns don't line up is preposterous, because we're seeing them in both the close states and the non-competitive states.\"\n\nThe \"blue wall\" wasn't the only place Biden won back with help from the suburbs. In Georgia, the state was flipped blue due to a combination of higher turnout in Atlanta and massive gains in the suburbs around it.\n\nIn Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta, Biden beat Trump by 240,000 votes to Clinton's 180,000 votes. And, in growing suburban counties Gwinnett and Cobb, which are farther out from Atlanta, Biden beat Trump by 132,000 votes. Clinton won those counties combined by just 26,000 votes.\n\nWasserman said that Biden's success in the suburbs is likely due to both attitudinal change in the past four years and the exodus of Black voters nationwide from cities to suburbs.\n\nFact check:Biden won popular, Electoral College votes in several battleground states\n\nBiden team already working toward transition\n\nBiden will be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, whether Trump acknowledges his win as legitimate or not. Biden has already begun the process of transitioning to the country’s highest office.\n\nThough Trump has not formally conceded, his administration has granted the new administration access to intelligence briefings, office space, secure computers and other government services, USA TODAY previously reported. Trump tweeted Nov. 23 that the move was made at his recommendation.\n\nThe announcement, made by Emily Murphy of the General Services Administration, allocated over $6 million to Biden’s transition team for hiring and other transition-related expenses. Since then, Biden has made a number of Cabinet picks, including his chief of staff, Treasury secretary, director of national intelligence, head of the Department of Homeland Security, ambassador to the United Nations, climate change envoy, secretary of State, Defense secretary and Health and Human Services secretary.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nAnalyses of the 2020 election results explain Trump's loss to Biden.

Bush, ten Commanders-in-Chief throughout U.S. history have run for re-election and lost.\n\nLet's take a look into the past — at U.S. presidents who didn't get a second four years because they were denied by voters in the general election.\n\nVoting 2020 live updates:Long lines plague New York; Election Day forecast shows good weather across US; Zeta storm\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush\n\nThe most recent one-term president was George H.W. Bush. The Republican incumbent served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993, but lost re-election to Democrat William (Bill) Clinton, who went on to complete two terms.\n\nBush's White House biography attributes his defeat to the country's \"discontent at home from a faltering economy, rising violence in inner cities, and continued high deficit spending.\"\n\nJimmy Carter\n\nThe 39th president of the United States, Democrat James (Jimmy) Carter, served from 1977 to 1981. He lost his re-election campaign to Republican Ronald Reagan, who went on to two full terms.\n\nCarter's biography points to several factors that contributed to his loss — including a short recession and the hostage-taking of U.S. embassy staff in Iran. On the day Carter left office, Iran released 52 Americans.\n\nGerald Ford\n\nServing from 1974 to 1977, Gerald Ford was the 38thpresident of the United States. The Republican incumbent lost re-election to President Carter.\n\nFollowing the resignation of President Richard Nixon after the Watergate scandal, Ford became the first unelected president in U.S. history. Ford's controversial pardon of Nixon had consequences — and many blame it (along with numerous issues including a poor economy and the fall of South Vietnam) to have cost him the presidency.\n\nHerbert Hoover\n\nRepublican Herbert Hoover was the 31stpresident of the United States, serving from 1929 to 1933. He lost re-election to Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt, who went on to complete three full terms.\n\nWithin months of Hoover's election, the stock market crashed — spiraling the country into the Great Depression.\n\n\"His opponents in Congress, who he felt were sabotaging his program for their own political gain, unfairly painted him as a callous and cruel President,\" reads his White House biography. \"Hoover became the scapegoat for the Depression and was badly defeated in 1932.\"\n\nWilliam Howard Taft\n\nThe 27th president of the United States, Republican William Howard Taft, served from 1909 to 1913. He lost his re-election campaign to Democrat Woodrow Wilson, who went on to complete two full terms.\n\nAccording to Taft's biography, the president \"alienated many liberal Republicans who later formed the Progressive Party.\" The party's divide ended his presidency. When Republicans renominated Taft in 1912, Roosevelt left to lead to Progressives, guaranteeing the election of Wilson.\n\nBenjamin Harrison\n\nServing from 1889 to 1893, Benjamin Harrison was the 23rd president of the United States. The Republican incumbent lost re-election to Democrat Grover Cleveland. Many point to growing discontent of third-party Populists, unpopularity of high tariffs and government spending at contributors to his defeat.\n\nHarrison had initially replaced Cleveland in the Democrat's 1888 campaign for re-election. But Cleveland ran again in 1892 and won — making him a two-term (though not consecutive) president.\n\nMartin Van Buren\n\nThe 8th president of the United States, Democrat Martin Van Buren, served from 1837 to 1841. He lost his re-election campaign to William Henry Harrison of the Whig party, who died not long after taking office.\n\nHis biography points to the panic of 1837, where hundreds of banks and businesses failed — halting prosperity the country had witnessed in recent years. Van Buren \"devoted himself to maintaining the solvency of the national Government,\" but his remedies prolonged the depression, and he lost reelection.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams\n\nServing from 1825 to 1829, John Quincy Adams of the Whig party was the 6th president of the United States. The incumbent lost re-election to Andrew Jackson of the Democratic-Republicans.\n\nAccording to his White House biography, Adams' loss is attributed to Jacksonian opponents' accusations of corruption and public plunder — \"an ordeal Adams did not easily bear.\"\n\nJohn Adams\n\nThe first one-term president was John Adams. The Federalist incumbent served as the 2nd president of the United States from 1797 to 1801, but lost re-election to Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson.\n\n\"In the campaign of 1800 the Republicans were united and effective, the Federalists badly divided,\" Adams' biography reads, noting that Adams polled just a few electoral votes less than Jefferson.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/state/2022/11/03/how-some-maryland-candidates-who-never-held-office-got-elected-larry-hogan-glenn-youngkin/69599656007/", "title": "How some Maryland candidates who never held office got elected", "text": "You don’t have to look very far to find a governor who never got elected before becoming governor. Outgoing two-term Republican Gov. Larry Hogan fit that description when he won Maryland’s top job in 2014.\n\nAcross the Potomac River from Southern Maryland, Republican Glenn Youngkin also never held elected office before becoming Virginia’s governor earlier this year. And Donald Trump famously became president in 2017 without having held any elected office.\n\nRegardless of whether Republican Dan Cox or Democrat Wes Moore wins the election, Maryland’s next governor will be inaugurated without any experience in a statewide office. Currently, nearly a quarter of the nation’s current governors (12) have never held any elected office prior to obtaining the post, and Moore fits that description.\n\nPolitical experience is not necessarily a prerequisite to being an effective leader, analysts say, but building a coalition is key.\n\nWilder ran for lieutenant governor first\n\nFormer Virginia Democratic Gov. L. Douglas Wilder took a 60-day, 3,600-mile road trip of Virginia in a borrowed station wagon during the summer of 1985 — just to become lieutenant governor.\n\n“I made it a point to travel the state and to stay in no hotels, but to stay in the homes of the people that I met,” said Wilder, in an Oct. 20 interview. He said he was shocked how few people knew him despite serving the prior decade-and-a-half in the state legislature.\n\nCarin Robinson, an associate professor of political science at Hood College in Frederick, Maryland, is seeing a similar dynamic of lack of name recognition of the gubernatorial candidates during the race this year. She cites just having one debate as a possible cause.\n\nIn addition to the barrier of name recognition, Wilder faced the hurdle of becoming the nation's first African American governor.\n\n“I knew that to move up I needed to have an entry level test,” said Wilder, of his run for lieutenant governor, during a CBS interview that aired in 2000. He won the governorship four years after his road trip and became the nation's first African American governor in 1990.\n\nNeither of Maryland’s current gubernatorial candidates have had such a statewide entry level test, but experts, including Wilder, say that is OK.\n\nNow a professor at the school of government and public affairs named after him at Virginia Commonwealth University, Wilder said Youngkin’s election is an example that proves it’s not necessary to hold elected office first to be a successful governor. (Wilder was one of the former Virginia governors who advised Youngkin during the transition.)\n\nRobinson said she does not see the candidates' lack of political experience as a \"deal breaker\" for voters in Maryland.\n\n\"It doesn't score you a lot of points to say, 'I'm a career politician,'\" she said.\n\nBuilding a coalition, and a cabinet is key\n\nKey to running an administration is building an experienced staff who can effectively deal with policy.\n\n“The kind of expertise that is expected of a modern political executive is whether they are able to build a coalition,” said Sunil Dasgupta, professor of political science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\n\nDasgupta notes that Moore may have a larger pool of talent from which to draw based on support from moderate Republicans. Hogan has said publicly he will not support Cox, his party's nominee, for governor.\n\nMoore, who comes with a military background, has never held elected office, and Cox served just one term in the state legislature after spending time as the president of a small town’s commission. Dasgupta said the lack of political experience is not necessarily a concern.\n\n“There’s a learning curve for everybody,” he said. “Running for office and being in office are two vastly different things.”\n\nWilder suggested that the next governor make certain that people who are in the cabinet are like-minded.\n\n\"If they are not (of the same mindset),\" he said, \"then you're not obligated to keep them.\"\n\nDifferent electorate, historic candidacies\n\nOver 30 years after his road trip and being inaugurated as the nation’s first African American elected governor, Wilder said the electorate is different now than during his statewide tour.\n\n“Things have changed to the extent that people are not surprised at someone of color being elected, or a female being elected,” Wilder said.\n\nMoore would be the first African American governor in Maryland's history, and just the third elected in the nation’s history behind Wilder and former Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick, who held office from 2007 to 2015. Across the nation, four other African Americans are seeking governorships this year.\n\nMoore’s running mate, former state Del. Aruna Miller, D-Montgomery, would be the first immigrant elected to the post, as would Cox’s running mate, Gordana Schifanelli. Miller is a native of Hyderabad, India, while Schifanelli hails from the Eastern European city of Belgrade, Serbia's capital. Miller also would be the first woman of color to be lieutenant governor in Maryland.\n\n“You’re there to represent everybody, not just those who would identify with you by virtue of race or sex,” Wilder said. “The job is (to do) what’s in the best interest of the people of Maryland.”\n\nHe said that comes from listening to the people.\n\n“Don’t put blame on anyone,” Wilder said. “Once you’re in the seat, the responsibility is yours.”\n\nDwight A.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/americas/bolsonaro-brazil-elections-protests-intl-latam/index.html", "title": "Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro does not concede, but signals cooperation ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBrazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro said Tuesday that he would “continue to fulfill all the commandments of our constitution” in a short speech at the presidential palace in Brasilia, after days of silence following his election loss to the leftist former leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\n\nHe did not explicitly concede defeat, though the event appeared to signal his intention to cooperate with the transfer of power.\n\nTaking the podium after the President, chief of staff Ciro Nogueira said that he would work with the new government and is waiting for Lula da Silva’s transition team to begin the handover.\n\n“President Jair Messias Bolsonaro authorized me, when it is time, based on the law, to start the transition process,” Nogueira said.\n\nNotably, Bolsonaro’s brief address did not contest the vote result. Instead, he thanked those who voted for him and hit out at critics. “I have always been labeled undemocratic and, unlike my accusers, I have always played within the four lines of the constitution,” he said.\n\nProtesters are currently blocking Brazil's highways at 267 points across the country.

He wants to show strength and in the culture of this movement, admitting you lost is to show weakness,” Brian Winter, the editor in chief of Americas Quarterly, told CNN.\n\n“By saying that he’s going to respect the Constitution and by discouraging violence at some of the protests that have been happening, I think that (Bolsonaro) essentially paves the way now for a relatively normal transition,” Winter said.\n\nBruna Santos, a senior advisor at the Wilson Institute’s Brazil Center, said Bolsonaro was likely thinking of the long-term future of his movement.\n\n“Bolsonarismo is a strong opposition force and got even stronger after this election despite Bolsonaro’s loss,” she said.\n\nIn the last legislative elections, Bolsonaro’s Liberal Party increased its representatives in the lower house from 76 to 99, while in the Senate it doubled from seven members to 14. Though Lula da Silva’s Workers’ Party has also increased representation in both houses, conservative-leaning politicians will dominate the next legislature overall.\n\nAerial view showing supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro, mainly truck drivers, blocking Castelo Branco Highway, on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Brazilian Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco publicly congratulated Lula da Silva and his supporters, as has Chamber of Deputies President Arthur Lira – a close Bolsonaro ally.\n\n‘Let’s go out to the streets’\n\nSome pro-Bolsonaro Telegram groups seemed to take encouragement from Bolsonaro’s speech, which described ongoing protests as “the result of indignation and a feeling of injustice at how the electoral process took place.”\n\nCNN saw messages from supporters lauding Bolsonaro for not accepting defeat, and green lighting protests.\n\n“He didn’t recognize the defeat! He didn’t greet his opponent! He reaffirmed his respect for the Constitution!

Brazil’s highway police said Tuesday morning that protesters had blocked roads at 267 points across the country.\n\nThe highway police agency itself has faced criticism within Brazil over its response, after videos circulating on Brazil’s social media appeared to show officers telling protestors that they would not disrupt or shut down their protests.\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday morning, highway police executive director Marco Antonio de Barros defended his agency’s actions, saying clearing the roads was a “complex operation.”\n\n“Groups of up to 500 protesters, with children on their laps, elderly are participating in it. So the PRF had to act with plenty of caution,” he said, using an acronym for the highways agency.\n\nHighway police general inspector Wendel Matos added the institution does not support the protests or the shutdown of federal highways, and that any potential breaches of protocol were being investigated. “Sometimes two or three officers speak or act in a way that is incompatible with our orders. We are investigating if there has been any misconduct by those officers,” Matos said.\n\nAfter Bolsonaro spoke, Brazil’s Federal Supreme Court said that it was important to emphasize the “President of the Republic’s speech in guaranteeing the right to come and go in relation to blockades, and, when determining the beginning of the transition, in recognizing the result of the elections.”\n\nPresident-elect Lula da Silva has not commented on the protests, though he expressed disappointment on Sunday evening at Bolsonaro’s initial failure to concede.\n\nThe leader of Lula da Silva’s Worker’s Party, Gleisi Hoffman, said on Tuesday that the party was confident protests would not interfere with the eventual transfer of power. “We trust Brazilian institutions,” she said.", "authors": ["Rodrigo Pedroso Camilo Rocha Julia Jones Hira Humayun Jorge Engels", "Rodrigo Pedroso", "Camilo Rocha", "Julia Jones", "Hira Humayun", "Jorge Engels"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}]}

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nReaders of this newsletter are frequently reminded of the shortcomings of the US form of government:\n\nA generational conservative shift at the Supreme Court is upending precedent to erode abortion rights and enshrine gun rights;\n\nAn intractable minority in the Senate can filibuster most meaningful change, particularly on climate change;\n\nGerrymandering means politicians are picking their voters rather than the other way around.\n\nThe format feels immovable; the country has outgrown a Constitution there is no hope of changing.\n\nSo it might be a surprise to read this edition focused on how the Constitution has changed for the better and might promise new changes sooner than you think.\n\nAfter picking up the recently published book The People’s Constitution: 200 Years, 27 Amendments, and the Promise of a More Perfect Union, I was surprised at the optimism from authors John Kowal and Wilfred Codrington III of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law.\n\nI talked to Kowal about what’s happening now and why he’s optimistic about the future. Key portions of our phone conversation, edited lightly for flow, are below.\n\nPeople should try to do big things\n\nWHAT MATTERS: First, briefly talk about these decisions on abortion and guns recently and whether addressing them will require changing the Constitution.\n\nKOWAL: We wrote the book to challenge the kind of pervasive sense of defeatism about amending the Constitution where people assume it’s not even worth trying. We tried to tell the story of how amendments have come in waves for the most part, and so there can be long periods where it feels impossible to amend the Constitution similar to the way it feels today. But then, certain conditions lead to a shaking of the tectonic plates, if you will, and in a very short period of time there can be three, four or five amendments.\n\nThe heart of the Constitution is in the changes\n\nWHAT MATTERS: You point out in your book that the Constitution was written by 55 men over four months, hundreds of years ago, but much of what we consider the heart of the document at this point comes from the 3,000 words that have been added afterward, and some of those even in our lifetimes. Explain that.\n\nKOWAL: So when we talk about the Constitution, people tend to focus on those four months in 1787 and it is a remarkable story of people with very different views and priorities coming together on a compromised Constitution.\n\nBut it’s rarely taught in school that more than 40% of the Constitution was written after 1787 in the form of these 27 Amendments. These amendments, over time, have made the Constitution a more progressive document by making it more democratic, more inclusive and more suited to the needs of a changing country.\n\nThe framers … expected the Constitution would be amended, and in fact, the generation that wrote the Constitution, approved 12 amendments to the Constitution in a short period of time, so they didn’t expect it to be rare. They expected it to be a little difficult but not impossible.\n\nBut legislation can’t even get past the filibuster.\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Amending the Constitution requires a lot.\n\nFirst, either 2/3 vote of both houses of Congress (that’s a higher threshold than the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate) or 2/3 of state legislatures calling a convention.\n\nSecond, passage by either legislatures or special conventions called in 3/4 of the states.\n\nMeaningful legislation can’t even get past the filibuster in the Senate.\n\nWhy should we be focusing on doing something that’s more than what seems possible today?\n\nKOWAL: The filibuster is a real and unfortunate impediment to democratic action, because it allows a minority to block action. But if you eliminated the filibuster today, which would be a salutary change, it would open the door to all kinds of legislation that has been stuck, but it wouldn’t actually necessarily allow for certain fundamental changes that can really only be done by amending the Constitution. For example, changing the Electoral College would require amending the Constitution; 60 senators can’t will it away.\n\nWhy this could be the end of a dry spell\n\nWHAT MATTERS: You put the 27 amendments into four essential waves. There’s the Bill of Rights amendments, the Reconstruction amendments, this era of progressive amendments and then the Civil Rights era amendments. What era are we in right now?\n\nKOWAL: I would say that we’re at the end of the fourth long dry spell. After the Bill of Rights era it was 61 years before another amendment was added to the Constitution.\n\nAnd then after the Reconstruction amendments, it was four decades until the progressive amendment era.\n\nAnd then it was another four decades until the ’60s and the Civil Rights era where there was this permanent change.\n\nAs of now, it’s been 50 years. … So if past is prologue, we’re in the what might be the end stages of just the cyclical dry spell. … There are indicators that suggest that in the foreseeable future, not immediate future, but foreseeable future that there could be a dramatic opening for new amendments.\n\nThese indicators point to amendments?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: What are the indicators that you see?\n\nKOWAL: So we talked about certain indicators that come up time and again.\n\nOne, of course, is unhappiness with the Supreme Court that that blocks progressive change and democratic action.\n\nAnother, and this is a counterintuitive point, is that long periods of gridlock and closely divided government tend to lead to a frustration that over time forces people to turn to more drastic remedies. When short term change is thwarted, people start to focus on the long term.\n\nIf you were to analogize today to another period in history I would look at the period of the late Gilded Age – the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\nThen, as now, the country was sharply polarized along regional lines. At that time, it was the East and West versus the heartland. Today, it’s the Red State/Blue State divide. The politics was gridlocked.\n\nThere were many closely fought elections for president.\n\nParty control of Congress switched every few years throughout that period.\n\nThere were two elections in which the Electoral College delivered the presidency to someone who did not win the popular vote.\n\nAlso, at that time, there was dramatic change. And that’s another indicator that sometimes periods of dramatic social and cultural transformation lead to pressure for change. So then, as now:\n\nimmigration was changing the face of the country in a way that stirred up tremendous anxiety;\n\nnew technologies were transforming the way people lived;\n\neconomic inequality was increasing dramatically.\n\nWe talked about the story of the of the 16th Amendment, the income tax amendment, which is very much driven by popular outrage that the rich dominated politics – the rich and corporations – and they made sure that they paid no taxes and that almost the entire tax burden was borne by poor people. We described in the book how an ordinary working person was spending two thirds of their income on taxes hidden in the form of tariffs and other regressive taxes.\n\nThe other indicator, and that is highly relevant, if you look at the Gilded Age period, progressive reform was being blocked at every turn by a reactionary Supreme Court that acted to protect the interests of big corporations and the rich.\n\nThe importance of a more representative Supreme Court\n\nWHAT MATTERS: FDR failed in his effort to reform the makeup of the court. You’ve argued for an amendment to reform the court to:\n\nget every President two nominees and\n\nimpose 18 year terms on justices.\n\nWould changes likes this have precluded some of these recent decisions on guns, on Roe v. Wade, on the EPA that have frustrated so many people?\n\nKOWAL: I think it would have had an impact. So for a long time, people wanted to cling to the idea that the judiciary is above politics. But for 50 years the Republican Party has made getting the right kind of nominees on the bench a priority and they did it for a reason. They did it so that they could advance an agenda. And so they have successfully used the failures of the current system. …\n\nWhat if this amendment had been in place for the last 30 years, the composition of the Supreme Court would more closely follow the results of presidential elections. …\n\nIf you go back 18 years, it’s the beginning of the second George W. Bush administration, so it’s 2004. So he would have gotten two nominees, but then Obama would have gotten four nominees, and then Trump would have gotten two nominees and then Biden would have already gotten one. So we wouldn’t have you would not have a six-three court in favor of conservatives, which is done through gamesmanship.\n\nWhat about an amendment compromise?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Conservatives have suggested a constitutional convention to impose things like term limits on lawmakers and judges and require a balanced budget. Progressives are more likely to push for an Equal Rights Amendment or to tweak the Second Amendment.\n\nIs there any precedent for amendment bargaining? Could the two sides come together and each come up with an amendment, for instance, term limits on congresspeople in addition with term limits on judges? Is there any precedent for that?\n\nKOWAL: Politics has played a role in amendments. For example, so the conservative Republicans in 1909 supported the income tax amendment as part of a bargain to basically persuade Congress not to pass an income tax law. And it blew up in their face because the amendment passed. They had been hoping that the amendment would die on the vine and not get ratified.\n\nWhy would smaller states ever agree to give up some power?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: The most obvious next amendment for a lot of Americans would be to reform the Electoral College. What should a new electoral college amendment do and how would that be accomplished?\n\nKOWAL: Let me back up. If Americans really think about what the Framers did, they basically did not provide that the people have any role in picking the President. They gave this role to states. … States don’t have to allow people to vote. If they wanted to pass a law saying, ‘We’re picking the name out of a hat,’ the Constitution doesn’t, on its face, forbid it.\n\nThe American people insisted that they have the right to pick the electors, and so by the early 1800s, every state but one had such a law. South Carolina eventually relented as well. …\n\nIf it weren’t for the fact that Republicans benefited from the Electoral College twice in the last couple decades, I think there would be more significant bipartisan support for an amendment. An amendment had a lot of support in 1970 but fell short due to a filibuster. It seems these kinds of amendments always run into the problem that one side might feel that status quo is benefiting them.\n\nWhat could really work and what could make an Electoral College amendment move to the front of the line is if you can get success in passing the interstate popular vote compact. … If we could get that, then our elections become de facto national popular vote, plebiscites, and the strategies of the parties have to change. And I believe that that would bring people to the table to create a more enduring and bulletproof solution in the form of a constitutional amendment. …\n\nOne of the one of the points we tried to raise in the book is that these are long-term strategies. They don’t happen overnight. … Having people listen to your side to changing people’s minds to building a popular movement around getting another constitution and a vision of democracy, that has benefits of its own even if it’s going to take a while to pass the amendment.\n\nThese efforts can last generations\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Some of the people you talk about – the real transformational figures pushing for amendments – often don’t live to see them enacted.\n\nKOWAL: Susan B. Anthony is a great example of that.\n\nOthers do and it’s a kind of warm and fuzzy story. There’s a guy named Jennings Randolph, who was a freshman congressman in West Virginia, and proposed during World War II, that they lower the voting age to 18, seeing that so many young men were going to fight the war. … It didn’t bear fruit until 1970 in the middle of a huge societal transformation, but he was still around, and he was able to introduce the amendment for the 11th time and to do a victory lap. So sometimes patience is actually rewarded.\n\nYou’re right in other instances, it takes so long it’s like Moses. You can’t bring it to the promised land with you but you’re getting them there.\n\nWhat’s the most likely next amendment?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Is there any evidence you see of an amendment percolating right now?\n\nKOWAL: There’s a lot of interest in the Equal Rights Amendment. (Note: The amendment has passed through 3/4 of state legislatures, but not in time for a deadline Congress initially set.) People in the movement are pursuing a strategy that that calls for recognizing the 1972 Amendment as valid because Congress has the right to withdraw the deadline that they imposed back in the ’70s.\n\nAt some point, the fight might move to what they call the fresh start strategy – in other words, introduce the Equal Rights Amendment again, and fight for it. It has huge popular support. Most Americans think that the Constitution does explicitly protect women’s equality and they’re surprised to learn that it doesn’t.\n\n(The ERA) would be opposed by the same forces who oppose it last time – the religious right – but at a time when women are rightly concerned about their rights, when they’ve seen what has happened to reproductive freedoms. If they see a Supreme Court that is talking about only recognizing rights rooted in history, If you go back in 1868, women had no rights. They couldn’t vote. They didn’t participate in the writing or adoption of that amendment. So that there may be a very receptive audience to insisting, number one that the word ‘woman’ appear in the Constitution.\n\nTop 5 amendments to pass right now\n\nWhat Matters: Give me your top five amendments. (Note: I’ve added the bolded words to the bullet points below)\n\nKOWAL: Electoral College – I think my No. 1 choice would be eliminating the Electoral College and making clear that the people choose our President. The Founders, the Framers, were unwilling to do that in 1787 and many of them thought it was an absurd idea. But the truth is Americans believe that the people should choose. If anything, the attempted coup in January of 2021 shows that the Electoral College is ripe for potential misuse and that our democracy might be hanging by a thread if we don’t get rid of it.\n\nEqual Rights – Second, I would say the Equal Rights Amendment because next year will be the 100th anniversary of when it was first promulgated or put out there by Alice Paul and others. And I think it would be a fitting way to celebrate the anniversary by a strong push to get it in the Constitution.\n\nSupreme Court – Third, I think would be rationalizing our system for selecting Supreme Court justices. The framers talked about judiciary as the weakest branch. They had no idea that it would be as powerful as it is, and they had no idea that people would live so long and stay on the court for 30, 40 years. I think the political wars over judicial selection could be tempered if we had a fairer system, where every president gets a chance to put their stamp on the court.\n\nVoting – Fourth, I would say is a voting amendment. The framers made a fateful choice: instead of deciding the question of who is eligible to vote, they left it to each state to determine and they use a kind of a rule that sounds outmoded today. … What they should have done was to enshrine a universal right to vote as the foundation of a democratic society. It was the road not taken at various points in our history where what we’ve done is we’ve amended the Constitution to ban certain kinds of discrimination. But we never really went to the original sin of why we allow states to decide who gets to vote.\n\nCongressional succession – The fifth one, I think, is a technical one, but it’s one where we’ve not done the smart thing for a long time. It would be an amendment to deal with a flaw in the way we replace members of the House of Representatives. … When a member of the House dies or leaves office, every state using its own system calls a special election that takes months. … As we think about what would happen if there was a catastrophic attack on Congress, and it’s not unthinkable. If a third of the House dies and some catastrophe, the House would not function. … I think it’s totally irresponsible to not plan for a terrible contingency like that.\n\nWhy the optimism?\n\nWHAT MATTERS: Your book identifies a lot of problems with the Constitution and you’ve talked about some tweaks that could improve it but it’s an optimistic book. Why are you optimistic?\n\nKOWAL: I’m optimistic because the story of the Constitution is a story of progressive change and improvement. It comes in fits and starts. It can be too cumbersome. It can be too slow. But we have made tremendous changes in the Constitution. The 19th Amendment was the largest enfranchisement in history where women were able to vote. The income tax amendment had a profound effect on laying the foundation for a modern American, with a government strong enough to solve our problems. If we just focus on the story of the framers, who were both remarkably progressive, but also created a document that was fundamentally flawed, and they were they were just products of their time. If we only think of the Constitution that way, then it’s dispiriting. But if you focus on the tremendous story of movement, and gadflies, and unlikely politicians and others who said we can have a better Constitution, I draw a lot of inspiration from that.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Most recently, Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a law last year allowing Iowans to purchase and carry handguns without first getting a permit.\n\nHere's what to know about the proposed amendment.\n\nWhat does the amendment say?\n\nThe language of the proposed amendment states: \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. The sovereign state of Iowa affirms and recognizes this right to be a fundamental individual right. Any and all restrictions of this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny.\"\n\nHow does the Iowa amendment differ from the Second Amendment?\n\nThe language Iowans will vote on is not the same as the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. The Iowa amendment describes the right to keep and bear arms as \"a fundamental individual right\" and requires any restrictions on gun rights to survive \"strict scrutiny.\"\n\nStrict scrutiny is the highest legal hurdle for legislation to clear. It requires any restrictions on gun rights to be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.\n\n\"That's a very heavy burden and it's very hard for a law to satisfy that,\" said Mark Kende, director of the Drake Constitutional Law Center. \"And so what that means is attempts to regulate guns will have a large hurdle to jump over in order to be OK.\"\n\nWhat do opponents say the amendment would mean?\n\nOpponents of the amendment say it would make it harder to pass new gun laws as well as put existing gun laws at risk of being overturned.\n\n\"We believe that the way that the gun amendment is worded is reckless,\" said Connie Ryan, executive director of Interfaith Alliance of Iowa. \"It is irresponsible. It will put common sense gun safety laws in harm's way, which then will have a direct impact on Iowans and our own safety.\"\n\nWhat do supporters say the amendment would mean?\n\nRichard Rogers, a board member of the Iowa Firearms Coalition, a gun rights advocacy group, said courts in Second Amendment cases have not been protective enough of the right to keep and bear arms over the years, which is why his group supports the different wording in Iowa's amendment.\n\n\"Those who oppose the free exercise of the right to keep and bear arms have been trying for over 100 years to get around — we view it as they’re trying to get around the language of the Second Amendment,\" he said. \"And frankly they’ve been pretty successful.\"\n\n\"We wanted to protect the right,\" he said. \"So that’s why the strict scrutiny is in there.\"\n\nHow does a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision change the landscape?\n\nIf the amendment passes, Iowa would be the fourth state with \"strict scrutiny\" language to protect gun rights in its state constitution.\n\nRogers said he believes a U.S. Supreme Court decision this summer has made the strict scrutiny language almost moot. That's because Justice Clarence Thomas' majority opinion in that case requires any restrictions on guns to demonstrate some connection to the nation's \"historical tradition of firearm regulation.\" That effectively creates a standard even higher than strict scrutiny, he said, although he still believes it is important to approve the Iowa amendment.\n\nKende said the U.S. Supreme Court decision sets a baseline for how far states can go when regulating guns, but the new standard is still untested so there's uncertainty in how it will be applied.\n\nMore:Supreme Court's Second Amendment decision demands courts look to history, tradition\n\nWhat kinds of gun regulations would be at risk if the amendment passes?\n\nThere are several kinds of gun regulations that could be vulnerable if the amendment is passed, Kende said.\n\nThose could include measures like stronger background checks and restrictions on certain people owning firearms and on certain kinds of weapons, he said. If any of those laws were to be challenged in court, he said, those defending them will have to show that they would make a significant difference in reducing shootings and deaths.\n\n\"I think it means that those several kinds of things will be much harder to justify for the gun control advocates,\" he said.\n\nPeople convicted of felonies are currently banned from owning firearms in Iowa, as are those convicted of certain misdemeanor domestic violence offenses and people with certain mental health concerns.\n\nRyan said she's worried approving the amendment could mean future lawmakers would be unsuccessful in passing gun regulations like strengthened background checks or extreme risk protection orders, which are often known as \"red flag\" laws.\n\n\"Our concern is both for what’s left of the gun safety common-sense gun laws in our state but also future laws that could be passed by the Legislature,\" she said.\n\nRogers, of the Iowa Firearms Coalition, said passing the amendment would make it more difficult to pass laws banning firearms or that are in common use, like AR-15s, and accessories like high-capacity magazines.\n\nHow is the Iowa Constitution amended?\n\nThis fall's vote on the proposed amendment is the final step in the process before the language can be added to the Iowa Constitution.\n\nIn Iowa, the process of amending the state constitution typically begins with the Iowa Legislature. Proposed constitutional amendments must pass in two consecutive two-year sessions of the Legislature before they can be placed on the ballot for a statewide up-or-down vote.\n\nMore:Iowa Legislature approves putting pro-gun constitutional amendment in front of voters\n\nRepublican lawmakers originally began the process before the 2018 election, but had to start over after Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate failed to publish notice of the amendment in Iowa newspapers as required by law. Lawmakers passed the language again in 2019 and 2021, allowing it to appear on the ballot this year.\n\nThe language needs approval by a simple majority of voters in order to be added to the Iowa Constitution.\n\nFrom 2021:Iowa Poll: Two-thirds oppose permitless handgun carry law; most support pro-gun constitutional amendment action\n\nStephen Gruber-Miller covers the Iowa Statehouse and politics for the Register.

In only a few cases do at least half say they will vote no, including 76% of Democrats, 52% of those with no religious affiliation and 50% of those with a college degree or more.\n\nPoll respondent Peter Morlock, a 55-year-old pastor from Emmetsburg, said he’s still deciding how he will cast his vote. But he said he’s leaning toward voting for the amendment.\n\nMore:How to vote in Iowa's 2022 elections for governor, US Senate, state Legislature\n\n“I'm generally in favor of that type of language, but I’m not sure why it needs to be enshrined in the Iowa Constitution if it’s already in the federal constitution,” said Morlock, an independent.\n\nIowa is among six states without protections in their constitutions for the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nThe language Iowans will vote on is not the same as the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. The Iowa amendment describes the right to keep and bear arms as \"a fundamental individual right\" and requires any restrictions on gun rights to survive \"strict scrutiny.\"\n\nStrict scrutiny is the highest legal hurdle for legislation to clear. It requires any restrictions on gun rights to be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest. If the amendment passes, Iowa would be the fourth state with \"strict scrutiny\" language to protect gun rights in its state constitution.\n\nIowa Poll:Iowa Poll: Chuck Grassley narrowly leads Mike Franken in US Senate race\n\nPoll respondent Heather Bridge, a 35-year-old stay-at-home mother from Marion, said she plans to vote \"yes.” She said she’s concerned about gun crime and believes that increasing gun ownership among responsible Iowans would help deter criminals.\n\n“If more people were allowed to bear arms here in Iowa, if it was more legal, more people wouldn’t be getting in trouble for it,” she said.\n\nBut poll respondent Bob Schroeder, a 73-year-old retired auto technician and former city council member from Postville, said he believes Iowans' Second Amendment rights are already well-covered by the federal Constitution.\n\nIowa Poll:Most Iowans disapprove of President Joe Biden, say US is on the wrong track\n\nHe said he’s concerned about the potential of opening the door for looser regulation.\n\n“I don't have anything against people owning a gun, but I do have something against these guns that shoot 100 rounds,” he said.\n\nMore:'Voting is important to me': Iowans begin casting ballots in the 2022 midterm election\n\nMorlock, who owns guns, said he’s interested in how the strict scrutiny language would be interpreted. Overall, he said, he believes more conversations need to be had about what reasonable restrictions on gun ownership would look like.\n\n“Why can’t we have a conversation about what would be seen as reasonable without people frothing at the mouth?” he asked.\n\nIan Richardson covers the Iowa Statehouse for the Des Moines Register.

Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cell phone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex, and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent American Community Survey estimates.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 804 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Questions based on the subsample of 620 likely voters in the 2022 general election have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.5 percentage points or 3.9 percentage points, respectively. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to the Des Moines Register and Mediacom is prohibited.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2023/05/30/what-is-ohio-issue-1-on-the-august-8-ballot-voter-suppression-special-election-voter-editorial/70250086007/", "title": "Editorial: What is the danger of Ohio Issue 1 on the August 8 ballot?", "text": "Dispatch Editorial Board\n\nIssue 1's misleading title conceals its real intent: silencing citizen voices.\n\nSpecial election is scheduled to catch voters' off-guard during dog days of summer.\n\nGOP lawmakers have already shown they cannot be trusted unchecked.\n\nIssue 1 must be defeated for good of all Ohioans.\n\nThe title of Issue 1 on the Aug. 8 special election ballot will read \"elevating the standards to qualify for and to pass any constitutional amendment.\"\n\nDon't be fooled.\n\nUpholding our state's most sacred document is far from what's at stake.\n\nWhen the misleading title is cut away like fat, Issue 1 is about driving a dagger into Ohio — The Heart of All — by killing a 111-year-old right Ohio voters have had to control our destinies at the ballot box even when unscrupulous or insincere lawmakers try to stand in the way or ignore our will.\n\nOhio's General Assembly seeks to silence the people\n\nOhio lawmakers should be working to amplify voters' voices. Instead, they want to silence them.\n\nThe date picked proves that recently convicted former House Speaker Larry Householder was not the only elected official with a thirst for power.\n\nDishonest lawmakers say Issue 1 is for the good of Ohioans, but they know full well that far fewer Ohioans will show up to vote in August than they would for an election held in May or November.\n\nThey want to catch voters while their guards are down — during the dog days of summer — to seize ultimate control. If the issue is so important, why are they putting it on the ballot in August when turnout will be low?\n\nIt is not lost on our board that approval of this \"special\" election came months after the hypocrites in our General Assembly voted to limit most August special elections because they cost too much and turnout is low.\n\nThey were right then; they are wrong now.\n\nWhat will Issue 1 actually do?\n\nIf approved by voters, majority rule would be chucked when it comes to citizen-led constitutional amendments. Sixty percent of voter approval would be required instead of a simple majority of 50% plus one.\n\nThose seeking to get proposed amendments on the ballot would have the yeoman's task of collecting signatures from at least 5% of voters from the last gubernatorial election in all 88 counties.\n\nRight now, the signatures must only be collected from 44 counties, which is not an easy task. The 10-day cure period to secure a citizen-initiated amendment on the ballot would also be dropped.\n\nCitizens can now use that time to collect more signatures if they did not have enough valid one's the first time.\n\nWhy are lawmakers pushing the issue now?\n\nIn one breath, lawmakers will say Issue 1 is about preventing outside special interest groups from campaigning to change Ohio's constitution, but the truth seeps like venom out of their power-hungry mouths.\n\nState Rep. Brian Stewart - one of the issue's chief proponents - and others have made it abundantly clear that the true goal is to snuff out efforts create fairer statehouse and congressional districts — and to defeat an ongoing effort to pass an abortion access amendment possibly on the November ballot.\n\nThose aren't the only reasons.\n\nIssue 1 is also about beating back any citizen attempt to get amendments for recreational marijuana, gun control, workers' rights, increased minimum wage, term limits and a host of other things the majority of people of the great state of Ohio may or may not want.\n\nYou may never have a fair chance to decide any of these issues if the disingenuous lawmakers who run this state get their ruthless way.\n\nLawmakers cannot be trusted.\n\nApproval of Issue 1 would take Ohio back in time.\n\nThe state had a supermajority requirement for amendments proposed by the General Assembly between 1851 to 1912. Back then, lawmakers ignored voter demands and Ohio's statehouse was among the most corrupt in the United States.\n\nReform stemmed from the 1912 Ohio Constitutional Convention where voter-initiated constitutional amendments were added, and the supermajority requirement was chucked. Voters approved the amendment by 57.5%.\n\nVoter approval of Issue 1 would give legislators who have already proven they are not trustworthy nearly ultimate power to dictate your life with little impunity.\n\nOne only has to look at Ohio's most recent redistricting fiasco for evidence of how untrustworthy and dishonest lawmakers can be when there are no real checks.\n\nSeventy one percent of Ohioans voted for a fairer process for drawing legislative districts in 2015. The GOP-control Ohio Redistricting Commission did not care and stomped on the will of the people.\n\nGerrymandering continues to guarantee the Statehouse will remain not only controlled but dominated by Republicans.\n\nThe shameful redistricting process led to two costly primaries — one in May for U.S. Senate, Congress and statewide offices and one in August for the state lawmakers. About 21% of Ohioans voted in May compared to less than 7% who voted in August.\n\nThe upcoming August election is expected to cost at least $20 million of taxpayer money.\n\nMore:In 'historic abuse of power,' Ohio lawmakers seek to steal your voice| Mike Curtin\n\nIn a guest column published by the Dispatch in April, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose pointed to former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder's disgraceful — and unrealized — scheme to weaken term limits as evidence of the \"vulnerability of Ohio’s founding document.\"\n\nHe implied that voters are unqualified to decide for themselves and need a supermajority vote for our own good. That is clearly not the case. The vast majority of citizen-initiated amendments are rejected.\n\nOnly about one-fourth of such amendments proposed since 1913 have been approved.\n\nRecent examples include legalizing casino gambling in 2009, banning indoor smoking at workplaces in 2006 and defining marriage as between one man and one woman in 2004.\n\nLaRose has one thing right. Our founding document is vulnerable, but because he and others want to twist it to their own will. They are willing to lie to and cheat voters to win.\n\nFar too many Ohio elected officials have forgotten there is a difference between serving Ohioans and ruling us. We do not need dictators in the Statehouse.\n\nRemind them that you and your voice matter and that Ohioans cannot be rolled over on their way to victory.\n\nReject Issue 1.\n\nThe defeat of this issue is the only way to elevate Ohio.\n\nThis piece was written by the Dispatch Opinion Editor Amelia Robinson on behalf of The Dispatch Editorial Board.

The \"no\" votes to reject the amendment accounted for 35%.\n\nThe language of the amendment states: \"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. The sovereign state of Iowa affirms and recognizes this right to be a fundamental individual right.

Some advocates said courts reviewing Second Amendment cases have not been protective enough of gun rights over the years.\n\nThe Iowa Firearms Coalition President Dave Funk praised the approval of the ballot measure Tuesday evening, calling it a \"historic day for freedom, civil rights and the Hawkeye state.\"\n\nAt the Republican Party's election night event in Des Moines, the crowd cheered as a television screen flashed news.\n\nAdam Bentz, 44, of Ankeny, supported the measure. He said he is not a “gun nut.” He started hunting about a decade ago and owns “very few” guns. He also supports background checks for prospective owners.\n\n“The constitution’s pretty clear,” he said. “We have it spelled out. We have the right to bear arms. It just makes sense at the state level that we would have the right to bear arms as well.”\n\nOpponents said the amendment would make it easier to strike down existing gun laws and make it harder to pass new regulations.\n\nThe Iowans for Responsible Gun Laws called the amendment \"reckless,\" saying it would \"only serve to put Iowans in harms' way.\"\n\n\"The potential consequences of this amendment’s passage, from expensive lawsuits in the Iowa courts to impacting current law and the safety of Iowans, will be far reaching and dire for our state,\" the coalition wrote in a statement Tuesday evening.\n\nTuesday's vote was the final step in Republican lawmakers' effort to amend the state's constitution to create higher standards for future gun control proposals.

Amending the Constitution requires either two-thirds of state legislatures to call for a convention, also called an Article V Convention or amendatory convention, or a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress, Thomas Donnelly, chief content officer at the National Constitution Center, previously told USA TODAY. None of the 27 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed by a convention and the last time the Constitution was amended was in 1992, he said.\n\nIf an amendment is proposed, three-fourths of the states must ratify it, Donnelly said.\n\nThe resolution calls for \"a limited constitutional convention\" that would be used only to consider an amendment related to gun control. However, some California Democrats have expressed concern that it's not possible to limit a convention to just one issue.\n\nRepublicans control more than half of state legislatures, and State Sen. Scott Wiener told the San Francisco Chronicle he worries a convention could lead to other amendments, such as measures that would restrict abortion access or LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n“It’s unclear whether there can be a convention limited to one topic,\" he told the outlet. “We need to make sure that we’re not going to inadvertently trigger a general constitutional convention because that could go real bad real fast.\"\n\nNewsom has acknowledged how challenging the process would be but pledged to work with \"grassroots supporters, elected and civic leaders, and broad and diverse coalitions across the nation\" to get similar resolutions passed in the 33 other states required to convene the convention.\n\n\"California will be the first but that's just the beginning,\" Newsom said in a statement in June.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/28/how-many-amendments-are-there/10562556002/", "title": "How many amendments does the US Constitution have?

Roberts.\n\nJustice Roberts has served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court since 2005, when he was nominated by then-President George W. Bush.\n\nHow long do Supreme Court justices serve for?\n\nSupreme Court justices are appointed to serve a lifetime term, though it is not required that they serve until their end of life.\n\nIn the history of the court, justices have served for an average of 16 years, according to the court's official site, and a new court is added to the bench roughly every two years.\n\nHow many U.S. Senators are there?\n\nThere are 100 senators. As outlined in Section 3 of Article I of the U.S. Constitution, two senators are sent to the congress from each state.\n\nThe 100 figure is therefore not specifically designated — should there ever be more states added to the union, that number would increase, with two new senators added for each new state.\n\nWhich state has the most signers to the Constitution?\n\nPennsylvania.\n\nThere were 34 delegates to the Continental and Confederation Congress who signed the United States Constitution, eight of whom hailed from Pennsylvania.\n\nDelegates from these remaining states also signed the founding document:\n\nConnecticut\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgia\n\nMaryland\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew York\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nVirginia\n\nWho has the power to declare war?\n\nThe Constitution of the United States grants Congress, and only Congress the power to declare war.\n\nHowever, the President serves as Commander-in-Chief of the United States armed forces and can use military force without congressional approval prior.\n\nMany of the military conflicts of recent memory have not been initiated by a formal declaration of war.\n\nMeet the candidates:Here's who is running for president in 2024\n\nJust Curious for more?

Currently they have to go to 44 counties.\n\nAn attempt to catch you sleeping\n\nIt is shameful that the $20 million, single-issue August election is taking place.\n\nThe Republican legislators who put Issue 1 on the ballot know all too well that August elections are wasteful and hit voters while they are not paying attention during the dog days of summer, so turnout is low.\n\nJust months ago, these power-hungry hypocrites voted to limit most August special elections for those very reasons. They were right then, they are wrong now.\n\nOhio voters will be asked to annihilate the simple principle of \"one person, one vote\" and replace it with minority control when it comes to citizen-led constitutional amendments.\n\nForty percent of voters will call the shots for the majority. How is that fair?\n\nA \"yes\" vote on Issue 1 would be a blow against one of the best-known notions Abraham Lincoln expressed in the Gettysburg Address: the government should be of the people and for the people.\n\nOhio's elected officials have sadly already proven that they want to be above the people and not of the people.\n\nRecent divisive proposed and approved legislation on issues ranging from whom can use which bathrooms to barring facts from college discussions shows they do not care about \"the people's will\" if the people's will differs from their own.\n\nBoth sides of their mouths\n\nIf those in support of Issue 1 truly believed this was good for democracy and Ohio, they would have the vote in November when Ohioans expect to vote.\n\nMoreover, they would not be speaking out of both sides of their mouths about the reason the changes to our constitution are \"needed.\"\n\nProponents have said publicly that it is about good government. They tell the truth when they think only some Ohioans are paying attention.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose for instance penned two guest columns published by the Dispatch in which he claimed the amendment was about protecting Ohio's constitution from outside special interest groups and from corrupt players like former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder.\n\nFrank LaRose:There's no 'knife to the neck' of voters on constitutional changes\n\nLaRose admitted recently that it is about keeping voters from deciding if abortion access should be enshrined in Ohio's constitution this November.\n\n“Some people say this is all about abortion,\" LaRose said during a Lincoln Day dinner in northwest Ohio. \"Well, you know what, I’m pro-life. I think many of you are as well. This is 100% about keeping a radical pro-abortion amendment out of our constitution. The left wants to jam it in there this coming November.\"\n\nMore than 700,000 signatures were filed Wednesday to put an abortion amendment on the November ballot.\n\nState Rep. Brian Stewart — one of the issue's chief architects with LaRose — and others have made it abundantly clear that another goal is blocking efforts to create fairer statehouse and congressional voting districts.\n\nSilencing Ohioans\n\nDespite what LaRose says, Issue 1 is not 100% about abortion or redistricting for that matter.\n\nIt would most likely mean certain defeat for a list of potential citizen-led constitutional amendments not limited to gun control, workers' rights, increased minimum wage and term limits.\n\nCitizen-led constitutional amendments may be the only way for those issues to come before voters here. Ohio's gerrymandered General Assembly has proven it can't be trusted to execute the will of the people no matter how hard the people petition lawmakers.\n\nOne of the most egregious examples of ignoring voters' will came when the Republican-dominated Ohio Redistricting Commission chose dominance over delivering the fair voting districts 71% of Ohioans said they wanted during a 2015 anti-gerrymandering initiative.\n\nWithout citizen-led constitutional amendments there will be few things voters can do to enact change when lawmakers refuse to listen.\n\nIn fact, voter-initiated constitutional amendments were added at the 1912 Ohio Constitutional Convention because lawmakers did not listen to the demands of the people.\n\nThis election is special in ways that go beyond the date ballots will be counted. It speaks to Ohio's heart and whether or not undemocratic forces will be successful in corrupting it with very big lies.\n\nOhioans deserve \"a government of the people, by the people, for the people.\"\n\nVoters should have a real shot at deciding whether or not abortion and other issues are enshrined in the state's constitution.\n\nVoters should not be asked to surrender their ballot right because elected officials are afraid of not getting their own way.\n\nVoters surely should not be asked such an important question during the dog days of summer.\n\nWe should not be here as a state, but the August 8 special election will happen, nevertheless.\n\nLawmakers do not think you are paying attention, that your vote should count or that you will exercise your long-fought right to vote.\n\nProve them wrong by voting \"no\" on Issue 1.\n\nVoting information\n\nMonday, July 10, is the voter registration deadline for the August 8 election.

Vock\n\nPew/Stateline Staff Writer\n\nThe 27th Amendment%2C the most recent addition to the Constitution%2C protects congressional salaries\n\nAmendment took effect in 1992%2C but it was proposed along with the rest of the Bill of Rights in 1789\n\nAt least 138 members of Congress are either refusing pay or donating it to charities\n\nMembers of Congress deadlocked over the budget are taking heat for receiving paychecks during the federal government shutdown. Given recent experience at the state level, it is no surprise.\n\nThe 27th Amendment, the most recent addition to the U.S. Constitution, protects congressional salaries. It says that Congress cannot make immediate changes to its own salaries; any changes must wait to be implemented after the next election.\n\nThe amendment took effect in 1992, but it was proposed along with the rest of the Bill of Rights in 1789. The idea has been around a long time, and states have included similar language in their own constitutions.\n\nIllinois is one of those states, and a trial court ruled last month that Gov. Pat Quinn could not veto legislators' salaries. Quinn, a Democrat, wanted to dock lawmakers' pay until they passed a bill to reduce the state's pension costs. The Democratic leaders of the state House and Senate filed a lawsuit to block Quinn's move.\n\nThe governor said debates during the state's 1970 constitutional convention showed delegates were mainly concerned about legislative salaries being increased, not decreased.\n\n\"I understand where his heart is, but that's politics. That's not the law,\" Cook County Circuit Judge Neil Cohen said in his ruling, according to CBS 2 in Chicago. \"The governor violated the constitution. He had no right to do that, despite benevolent intent.\"\n\nThe state comptroller immediately began processing legislators' paychecks. The governor is appealing the decision.\n\nMinnesota is another state that protects legislative pay in its constitution, so lawmakers continued collecting checks when state government shut down for three weeks in July 2011.\n\nThe standoff between Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton and Republicans who then controlled the legislature temporarily put 22,000 state employees out of work.\n\nRoughly a third of Minnesota legislators voluntarily gave up their pay, as did the governor, although several collected back pay once the shutdown was over.\n\nVoters in California tried in 2010 to link legislators' pay to their ability to pass a budget on time, after years of frustration in Sacramento over blown deadlines and deficits. Their efforts were initially successful, but the legal fallout puts the law's effectiveness in question.\n\nThe 2010 constitutional amendment, known as Proposition 25, tried to hit legislators in the pocketbook for not finishing a budget by June 15.\n\nThe next year, it was put to the test.\n\nThe official in charge of writing state checks, Controller John Chiang, a Democrat, relied on the new law when he docked legislators' pay in 2011. Legislators passed a budget on time, but Chiang said the budget plan had a $2 billion hole.\n\nCalifornia's constitution requires budgets passed by the legislature to be balanced, so Chiang decided lawmakers had not met the requirements to get paid. He docked $583,000 in legislative pay, and 12 days later, lawmakers passed a new budget.\n\nAfter the showdown, though, the Democratic leaders of both the House and Senate sued Chiang for overstepping his role. A trial judge agreed with them. \"Wise or unwise,\" the judge ruled, the controller's decision to dock legislators' pay was \"an unwarranted intrusion into the legislature's budget deliberations.\"\n\nChiang appealed the decision, and the appeal is still pending. In each of the last two years, California legislators have passed a budget on time.\n\nMaine legislators considered a measure this year that would dock their pay in case of a government shutdown, but the proposal stalled.\n\nBack in Washington, at least 138 members of Congress are currently working without a paycheck, either by refusing the money or donating it to charities, according to The Washington Post. Rank-and-file members earn $174,000 a year, while leaders make more. The U.S. House passed a bill Saturday to ensure federal workers would receive back pay when the shutdown is over.\n\nStateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/03/black-voting-rights-15th-amendment-still-challenged-after-150-years/4587160002/", "title": "Black voting rights, 15th Amendment still challenged after 150 years", "text": "The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down an Arizona law last week that would have criminalized the delivery of other people's early ballots. In its decision, the 11-judge panel mentioned the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution 19 times, reaching back 150 years to halt what's perceived as modern-day voter suppression.\n\nThe lasting power of the 15th Amendment, which awarded African Americans the right to vote, resonates today in courtrooms across America. But Civil War scholars and voting rights advocates warn that the amendment should serve as a cautionary tale: Challenges to voting rights today, from photo ID requirements to registration restrictions in some states, echo those that have plagued the 15th Amendment for more than a century.\n\nOn Monday, America celebrates the 150th anniversary of the 15th Amendment. This year also marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, that won women the right to vote, and the 55th anniversary of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which cemented voting rights for Black citizens – all in a presidential election year.\n\n“It’s a remarkable accomplishment given that slavery was such a dominant institution before the Civil War,” Columbia University history professor and author Eric Foner said of the 15th Amendment. “But the history of the 15th Amendment also shows rights can never be taken for granted: Things can be achieved and things can be taken away.”\n\nThe 15th Amendment was the last of three Constitutional amendments passed in the wake of the Civil War. The 13th Amendment abolished slavery and the 14th Amendment granted African Americans citizenship and equal treatment under the law.\n\nAbraham Lincoln’s Republican Party knew they needed to enshrine voting rights in law and, after much debate in Congress, drafted the 15th Amendment, declaring that the “right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”\n\nIts passage touched off widespread celebrations. According to Foner’s book, \"The Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution,\" African Americans called the amendment the nation’s “second birth” and a “greater revolution than that of 1776.” Seven thousand Blacks squeezed down Broadway in New York City for a celebratory march and in Baltimore, some 10,000 people took part in a massive parade of Black army regiments, militia companies, trade unions and other groups, according to the book.\n\nAfrican Americans – many of them newly freed slaves – put their newfound freedom to use, voting in scores of Black candidates. During Reconstruction, 16 Black men served in Congress and 2,000 Black men served in elected local, state and federal positions, Foner said.\n\n“There was tremendous optimism and hope and there was voting,” said historian Yohuru Williams of St. Thomas University in Minneapolis. “Clearly, the amendment has impact. But it’s short-lived.”\n\nThe amendment’s main flaw was that it didn’t guarantee citizens the right to vote – it only said that states couldn’t bar voting on the basis of race or color, Williams said. Starting around 1900, states found workarounds to the law, enacting poll tax laws and literacy tests as means of restricting the Black vote. Also, intimidation and violence from groups like the Ku Klux Klan greatly diminished Black voting. From 1901 to 1928, no Black members served in Congress.\n\nWomen's rights advocates Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony also attacked the measure, complaining that the 15th Amendment didn't include women's rights. It wouldn't be until 1920 and the 19th Amendment that those rights would be ratified.\n\nIt would take the blood and effort of the Civil Rights Era of the 1950s and '60s to affix voting rights for Blacks via the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Williams said. That act more definitively prohibited racial discrimination in voting and gave teeth to the 15th Amendment.\n\n“The fatal defect of the 15th Amendment was enforcement,” he said. “You needed a second Civil War Reconstruction – the Civil Rights Era – to make those amendments real.”\n\nThe lack of a national voting right continues plaguing Americans today, said Allan Lichtman, an American University history professor and author of \"The Embattled Vote in America: From the Founding to the Present.\"\n\nRecent voting initiatives, such as stricter photo ID requirements, poll closures and early voting cutbacks have disproportionately impacted minority communities, Lichtman said. Backers of the laws say they're created to prevent voter fraud and other irregularities.\n\nSince 2010, 24 states have put in place new voting restrictions, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law.\n\n\"The debates over the 15th Amendment are incredibly relevant today in the new wave of these restrictive measures,\" Lichtman said. \"We need a constitutional right to vote. We need to join virtually every other democracy and do that.\"\n\nAli Lozano, voting rights outreach coordinator at the Texas Civil Rights Project, said she's continually fighting against intrusion into the 15th Amendment and 1965 Voting Rights Act in Texas, from voter purge lists to racial gerrymandering to voter intimidation at the polls. The voter suppression initiatives she encounters are usually aimed at minority communities, she said.\n\n\"I consider it an aspirational law,\" Lozano said of the 15th Amendment. \"People need to be aware there's a difference between passage and implementation. There's a question about how these policies are implemented and are they doing what they're intended to do?\"\n\nJill Savitt, president and chief executive of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta, said the 15th Amendment's significance is \"enormous,\" given all the blood that was shed to adopt that amendment. But it should be remembered in the context of all the recent challenges to voting rights.\n\n\"The spirit of the 15th Amendment, on its 150th anniversary, is choking,\" she said. \"It's not being lived up to in law or in spirit.\"\n\nThe 15th Amendment's legacy is one of remarkable accomplishment, Foner said. Just five years after the end of slavery, America allowed former slaves to participate in its democracy – a singular feat among countries that abolished slavery, he said.\n\nBut voting rights have been assailed ever since, Foner said.\n\n\"It's a very checkered history,\" he said. \"American history is not just greater and greater freedom for everyone. Sometimes, it goes backward.\"\n\nJervis is the Austin-based national correspondent for USA TODAY. Follow him on Twitter: @MrRJervis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/03"}]}

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nYou’ve heard how US democracy can be undemocratic; the candidate who gets fewer votes is routinely elected president because of the Electoral College.\n\nBut the inequality of American democracy goes much deeper. While US citizens 18 years and older get a vote, one person’s vote goes much further than another’s. And a person from Wyoming has the most powerful vote of all.\n\nOne major reason is the size of the House of Representatives, which is frozen at 435.\n\nCongress used to grow with the population\n\nHouse seats are split up among the states — a process called apportionment — every 10 years after the census.\n\nIn the early 20th century, a skyrocketing population driven by immigration fueled fear among many rural lawmakers of the growing power of cities.\n\nA dispute after the 1920 census ultimately led Congress to cap the size of the House at 435 seats.\n\nIt temporarily grew after the addition of Hawaii and Alaska as states, but has basically stayed the same for more than 100 years.\n\nThe number of representatives is frozen, but the US population has exploded\n\nIn 1910, just before the House reached 435 members, there were 46 states and the official census population was 92,228,496 people in the US.\n\nIn 2020, that same number — 435 members of the House — represented 50 states, and the official census population was 331,449,281.\n\nWhere the average House member used to represent around 200,000 people in 1910, today it is approaching 800,000.\n\nNot only does this put lawmakers further from the individual people they represent, but it also means different members of the House might represent a very different number of people.\n\nCompare two similarly sized states:\n\nDelaware had a population of 989,948 in 2020.\n\nMontana had a population of 1,084,225 in 2020.\n\nThat’s a difference of 94,277 people.\n\nBut Delaware gets the minimum one representative in the House.\n\nMontana, based on those 94,277 additional people, will get a second representative for the first time in the 2022 election.\n\nDelaware’s House member will represent nearly 1 million people.\n\nMontana’s two House members will represent about 500,000 people each.\n\n26 people can make a huge difference\n\nThe above are the most extreme examples. Each member of the House represents somewhere between about a million people and a little more than 500,000, a large range.\n\nThe difference between losing a seat and keeping it can be incredibly thin. After the 2020 census, Minnesota maintained its eighth congressional seat by a margin of 26 people over New York.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nCounting 26 people determined a full decade of congressional representation.\n\nMillions of Americans get no say in Congress\n\nWashington, DC, has a larger population than Wyoming, but it gets no federal lawmakers who can vote, compared with Wyoming’s House member and two senators. The same is true for more than 3 million Puerto Ricans, who have even less power because they can only take part in presidential elections if they leave their home to live in a state or Washington, DC.\n\nMost countries have a lot more representatives per person. The United Kingdom has 650 members of Parliament, or a little less than one member per about 100,000 people. Each member represents a fraction of the people a US House member represents.\n\nThe size of the House could be unwieldy if Congress was to grow. As the founders envisioned it, the House could have more than 11,000 members today. Something in between could be better.\n\nJust try reading all the mail\n\nThere are real-world consequences to having so few representatives for so many people.\n\nA sample congressional office that received 9,300 messages in 2001 got 123,000 in 2017, according to an analysis by the Congressional Management Foundation.\n\nMore constituents means more work for each lawmaker, but the number of congressional staffers has fallen dramatically. So has the number of bills enacted. Congress is getting more diluted and less efficient as the same number of people represent a vastly larger country.\n\nThe growing distance between lawmakers and the people has changed the power of states\n\nNew York once had more than 40 representatives. Today it has 26.\n\nPennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois have also lost power. California, for the first time, lost a House member after the 2020 census.\n\nTexas, Florida and other Sun Belt states are growing. Texas, in particular, has used partisan gerrymandering to keep the state reliably controlled by conservatives in the House, even though its growth is driven by cities and minority populations.\n\nHow to make the US more democratic\n\nCongress could vote to uncap the size of the House, and there are plenty of good-government groups pushing this type of reform, although it is not top of mind in Washington. The arguments and options are included in a review by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Here are a few:\n\nIdea 1: Apply the Wyoming Rule, where every district is approximately the same size as the least populous state: Wyoming.\n\nUnder that model, California would grow to nearly 70 seats. Texas would have more than 50. Montana and Delaware would probably be about equal based on their similar population size of around 1 million people.\n\nIdea 2: Use the Cube Root Rule, where the cube root of the US population is used.\n\n∛331 million people, as of the 2020 census, would be 692 members of the House, according to the American Academy’s math.\n\nEither method would make for a more equal and a much larger Congress.\n\nIdea 3: Add 150 lawmakers. The authors of the American Academy study ultimately recommend simply expanding the size of the House by 150 members and periodically adding more members as the population grows.\n\nNone of these proposals would address the other major problem affecting democracy in the House, which is gerrymandering.\n\nParties in states have become sophisticated in their ability to draw congressional maps. Some states have created nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions to remove some of the political gamesmanship, but another idea put forward is to have lawmakers represent multiple districts, giving more people a voice.\n\nThe Constitution actually gives great latitude to how Congress should be made up. At periods, some large states like New York have had at-large districts in addition to their mapped districts.\n\nThen there’s the Senate, where equality for states equals inequality for Americans\n\nThere is an even greater imbalance in the Senate, where each state, by the design of the framers of the Constitution and regardless of a state’s size, gets two senators.\n\nBut states, most of which did not exist when the Constitution was written, have grown unevenly. Some populations have exploded while others have stayed relatively static.\n\nCalifornia is one of the largest economies in the world, but in the Senate, its two senators are on par with Rhode Island and Wyoming, which have comparatively minuscule economies.\n\nRepublicans of the late 1800s actually pushed to quickly expand the number of states, thinking it would help them consolidate power. They added six states — 12 senators — in two years, in 1889 and 1890, creating a wildly different balance of power on Capitol Hill. Generations later, that imbalance is still helping Republicans, although the two parties of today bear almost no resemblance to their former selves.\n\nAnd finally, the Electoral College\n\nHouse and Senate representation converge in the Electoral College, where states have electors equal to their senators plus their House members. Using 2010 census data, as I wrote in 2018, California has about 12% of the population, but its 55 electors equal a smaller share of the Electoral College.\n\nWhich means each Californian voter has the least individual say at the presidential level. Because it has the smallest population and two senators, Wyomingites have the most say. There’s one presidential elector for every 192,000 or so of them, which makes for a very lopsided say in their government.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Both Huffman and Stephens supported a failed effort in August to make it harder to change the constitution, which aimed to thwart the abortion amendment.\n\nStephens said Tuesday's vote isn't the end of the conversation: \"The legislature has multiple paths that we will explore to continue to protect innocent life.\"\n\nHuffman echoed that sentiment, suggesting voters could see abortion issues on the ballot again in the future.\n\n\"Life is worth fighting for. As a grandparent of eight, the life of a baby is always worth the fight,\" Huffman said. \"The national abortion industry funded by wealthy out-of-state special interests spent millions to pass this radical language that goes far past abortion on demand.

In Texas, homeowner regulations say you can only take the exemption on your “principal residence.”\n\nWalker took the tax break in 2021 and 2022 for his Texas home even after launching a bid for Senate in Georgia, an official in the Tarrant County tax assessor office told CNN’s KFile. The Walker campaign did not respond to CNN’s repeated requests for comment. Walker is set to face Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in a runoff election in December after neither candidate earned more than 50% of the vote in November’s midterm election.\n\nPoliticians in the past in Texas have landed in hot water over improperly taking the exemption, including then-Gov. Rick Perry, and have typically agreed to pay back taxes.\n\nQuestions have swirled around Walker’s residency since he actively began exploring the possibility of a Senate run in Georgia last year, and Democrats and Republicans alike hit Walker over the issue.\n\nTo run for office and vote in Georgia, 15 rules, not all of which need to be met, are considered for establishing residency, which include where the resident takes their homestead tax exemption and where they intend to live permanently. The US Constitution only requires a potential senator to be an inhabitant of their state when elected.\n\nAnthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University, said Georgia’s state law about establishing residence to be eligible to run for office is flexible and ultimately, Walker’s biggest problem could be political.\n\n“At the end of the day, this is more of a political problem than a legal one in all likelihood, … where Walker can be painted as a carpetbagger. It does call into question whether Walker’s change of residency was made in good faith,” said Kreis.\n\nHe noted that in 2008, Jim Powell, a Democratic candidate for a local Public Service Commission seat, was initially disqualified from running for office by Karen Handel, a Republican who was Georgia’s secretary of state, for taking a homestead tax exemption outside of his district.\n\nBut ultimately, the Georgia Supreme Court decided the candidate could remain on the ballot, saying 7 of the 15 rules showed he had ties to the district.\n\n“The state Supreme Court said that a homestead exemption alone was not dispositive evidence that could disqualify a candidate,” Kreis told CNN, but said Walker, unlike Powell, lacks a longstanding voting history and had only recently moved back to Georgia.\n\n11Alive News, a local Georgia station, first reported that Walker took the homestead exemption on his Texas home in 2020.\n\nWalker, despite now voting twice in Georgia and running for Senate in the state, has maintained the exemption, according to public records. The county tax office in Texas where Walker maintains his home confirmed the exemption.\n\nHomeowners in many states are able to apply for a tax exemption by declaring their home to be their primary residence and the exemption lowers their tax bill by removing part of their home’s value on paper. Under Texas law, if a homeowner moves out of the state, the resident can still receive the exemption only if they don’t establish “principal residence” elsewhere and plan to return to Texas within two years.", "authors": ["Andrew Kaczynski Em Steck", "Andrew Kaczynski", "Em Steck"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/2022-midterm-election-day-takeaways/index.html", "title": "Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections: Battle for control of the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe battle for control of Congress is still up in the air, with the Senate coming down to three key races while Democrats and Republicans are still hanging onto hopes of winning a narrow majority in the House.\n\nRepublicans began Tuesday night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.\n\nBut in the hours that have followed, Democrats reclaimed ground. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN analyst: Here's what DeSantis' projected victory could mean for the GOP 02:18 - Source: CNN\n\nHere are takeaways as votes are still being counted in key races:\n\nQuestions over control remain\n\nElection Day is over but the fundamental questions of this election cycle remain unanswered.\n\nTo start, control of the Senate remains up for grabs. Fetterman’s victory in Pennsylvania, flipping a GOP seat, gave Democrats some breathing room as they await results from Arizona, Nevada and Georgia. Republicans now need to win two of those three to claim a majority, but the Georgia Senate race will go to a runoff in December after no candidate won more than 50% of the vote.\n\nThe shape of the House, too, remains uncertain. Republicans appear poised to take control but there are scant signs of the big night they were hoping for. As the votes continue to be counted, the coming days will likely reveal the strength of a new GOP House majority – and whether a potentially underwhelming performance undermines Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s standing within a rancorous GOP conference. The GOP is now in a race-by-race fight that will ultimately determine McCarthy’s ability to govern.\n\nKey states are still counting ballots\n\nVotes are still being counted in several key states – including Arizona and Nevada, where a sweep of the Senate races by either party would result in control of the chamber.\n\nArizona and Nevada also have competitive races for governor, secretary of state and more to be decided in the coming days.\n\nIn Arizona, as of late Wednesday night, about 600,000 votes remained to be counted – the bulk of them in Maricopa County, the home of Phoenix and the state’s most populous. Those votes could decide the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican nominee Blake Masters, as well as the gubernatorial contest between Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and Republican former television journalist Kari Lake, an election denier.\n\nIn Nevada, CNN estimates that as of Wednesday night, about 160,000 known ballots remain to be counted. Mail-in ballots can be accepted through Saturday so more could be en route to elections offices. The state is the home of a crucial Senate contest between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican challenger Adam Laxalt.\n\nThe final House landscape also depends on races that have not yet been decided as a handful of states, including California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona, continue to count ballots.\n\nIn Alaska, a Republican will win the Senate race – but it’s not clear whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski or her Donald Trump-backed challenger Kelly Tshibaka will cross the 50% threshold to avoid the race being decided by ranked choice voting. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola leads the House race there, but it’s also not clear whether that race’s outcome will be decided by ranked choice voting.\n\nDemocrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority\n\nRepublicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country.\n\nFetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats. While the race long represented the best chance for the party to pick up a Senate seat in 2022, Fetterman’s near fatal stroke in May – and the lengthy recovery he endured in public – injected uncertainty into the race. But on Wednesday morning, the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor gave Democrats the pick-up they needed to have a better chance to hold the United States Senate next year.\n\n“Fetterman’s win makes it next to impossible for the GOP to get a majority. Pennsylvania was the fire wall,” said Mike Mikus, a Democratic operative based in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nAlthough a number of key Senate races remain uncalled – including contests in Nevada and Arizona and in Georgia which will go to a runoff – earlier on Tuesday, CNN projected one Democratic incumbent: Sen. Maggie Hassan, a first-term Democrat who faced Republican retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, won her race.\n\nA Hassan loss would have effectively ended Democrats’ hopes of retaining their majority. And CNN projected Wednesday that Republican Ron Johnson will keep his Senate seat in Wisconsin. The Democrats are still defending seats in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – so it will take time to settle Senate control.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN political director breaks down top issue for most voters 03:40 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump’s no good, very bad night\n\nFew Republicans were more involved in these midterms than Trump and the former president had a particularly bad night.\n\nIt appears that Trump knows it, too: He is “livid” and “screaming at everyone,” a Trump adviser who has been in contact with Trump’s inner circle told CNN on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe most striking loss for Trump came in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate, Oz, fell to Fetterman in what was the most expensive Senate race in the country. Trump endorsed Oz during the contentious Republican primary, effectively pulling through a brutal primary and narrowly into the general election. But where the former president’s backing was decisive in the primary, it was an albatross in the general election for a Republican Senate candidate who was attempting to make inroads in the suburbs by touting his own moderation.\n\nWhile Trump did score some Senate wins – Trump-backed Republican JD Vance defeated a stronger-than-expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan in the Ohio Senate race, while Republican Ted Budd defeated Democrat Cheri Beasley in North Carolina – those wins have so far been limited to Republican states.\n\nIn the House, too, some Trump acolytes lost in what were seen as competitive contests that Republicans needed to win if they were going to build a significant majority in the legislative body.\n\nIn New Hampshire, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt lost to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in what was seen as a highly competitive contest. In North Carolina, Trump-backed Republican Bo Hines lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel in a race that was widely seen as a test of the former president’s influence. And in Ohio, Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert who bullishly touted her ties to Trump.\n\nTrump’s evening was particularly bad when viewed through the lens of DeSantis’ romp of a night.\n\nDeSantis, Trump’s clearest rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, overwhelmingly won reelection on Tuesday, crushing Democrat Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points, continuing to consolidate Latino support in Florida and even by winning populous counties like Miami-Dade.\n\nThe headline in Trump’s one-time hometown paper, the New York Post, said it all: “DeFUTURE,” the headline blared, showing the Florida Republican on stage with his family.\n\nDemocrats hold their own in the suburbs\n\nIn 2018, the suburbs delivered Democrats the House majority. In 2020, they vaulted Joe Biden to the presidency.\n\nAnd in 2022, suburbs across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave.\n\nRepublicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet.\n\nIn a district made up of the Kansas City suburbs, CNN projected Democrat Sharice Davids would win reelection. In Ohio, CNN projected two suburban wins: Democrat Greg Landsman defeated Republican Rep. Steve Chabot in a district that included Cincinnati and some of the surrounding suburbs and Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert in a district that includes areas around Cleveland and all of Akron. In Illinois, CNN projected that Democratic incumbent Lauren Underwood would win reelection against Republican Scott Gryder in the Chicago suburbs. And in Virginia, CNN projected Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger would win reelection, largely because of the votes she picked up from the suburbs of Washington, DC.\n\nRepublicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.\n\nAnother January 6 committee member loses\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elaine Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected.\n\nLuria’s loss to Kiggans, Republican Navy veteran, was the latest demonstration that the lasting focus on the insurrection – even as it sheds light on a dark chapter in the nation’s capitol – is a political anchor for those involved.\n\nLuria had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.\n\nAnd Luria provided the latest evidence that voters are not rewarding those involved in the committee probing the insurrection. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was routed in a primary by Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman, while Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Florida Democrat, both retired rather than seeking reelection.\n\nDeSantis’ big win could be a 2024 launchpad\n\nDeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination.\n\nThe easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.\n\nThe most eye-popping outcome – and one that demonstrates the breadth of DeSantis’ appeal in the eyes of Sunshine State voters – came in Miami-Dade County, which is heavily Hispanic and historically a huge source of Democratic votes.\n\nRepublicans had made gains there in recent years: Hillary Clinton defeated former President Trump there by 29 percentage points in 2016. DeSantis did slightly better in the 2018 governor’s race, losing the county by 21 points. Trump made inroads there in 2020, losing by just 8 points. But a GOP candidate for governor hadn’t actually won Miami-Dade County since Jeb Bush in 2002.\n\nThe political reality is straightforward: Democrats have no realistic path to victory in statewide races in Florida without big wins in Miami-Dade County. That reality makes county’s outcome into an exclamation point on a dominant GOP performance.\n\nDeSantis’ win comes as a battle over the future of the Republican Party takes shape, with Trump signaling a potential 2024 announcement next week. Exit polls in Florida showed that 45% of the state’s voters would like to see DeSantis run for president, compared to 33% who want Trump to run in 2024.\n\nIn a victory speech Tuesday night, DeSantis offered a glimpse at how he might describe his governorship to a national audience. Touting his refusal to impose lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said that Florida “was a refuge of sanity when the world went mad.” He also described the state as “where woke goes to die” and “a ray of hope that better days still lie ahead.”\n\nGOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida\n\nRepublicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues.\n\nThe strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population.\n\nBut Latinos are not a monolith, and there were more important signs in Florida, too: Another traditional Democratic stronghold won by DeSantis was Osceola County, a majority Latino county south of Orlando with a heavily Puerto Rican population.\n\nHowever, it’s not clear if those GOP gains are materializing outside Florida.\n\nOne key gauge was the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where three House races in heavily Latino districts were up for grabs. Democrats have won two of those races, CNN projected. Rep. Henry Cuellar, the only House Democrat who votes against abortion rights, won reelection in his Laredo-based 28th District, while Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez defeated Republican Rep. Mayra Flores – the two were drawn into the same district – in the McAllen-based 34th District. The 15th District race, which was widely seen as the GOP’s best chance, is still too early to call.\n\n“The RED WAVE did not happen. Republicans and Independents stayed home,” Flores tweeted just after midnight.\n\nArizona and Nevada, both competitive states with significant Latino populations, are also important to watch. So are a spate of House races in California, where it could take days or weeks for winners to become clear.\n\nDemocrats had a good night in governor’s races\n\nCNN projected Wes Moore the winner in Maryland and Maura Healey the victor in Massachusetts, two seats that are currently in Republican control. Democratic governors in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico and others are projected to hold their seats, while Democrat Josh Shapiro defeated Republican Doug Mastriano in a seat where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf was term limited.\n\nBut as Tuesday turned into Wednesday, Democrats have a shot at strengthening their grip of governor’s offices across the country.\n\nCNN projected Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly the winner in her bid for reelection on Wednesday morning, while Democrats are competitive in Oregon and Nevada, two states that would represent Democratic holds, and Arizona, a state that would represent a Democratic flip.\n\nThe night is far from an unmitigated victory for Democrats – and how the three outstanding key races tip could shift the way Democrats see their gubernatorial successes. And some of the most famous Democratic gubernatorial candidates did lose: CNN projected Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams failed to unseat Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp in a rematch of their 2018 race, and Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke was unable to defeat Republican incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nBut few Democratic operatives would have said weeks ago that they would be in line to have this kind of night in governors races.\n\nAbortion rights, and its defenders, triumph\n\nIn referendums and races where the Supreme Court’s June decision to reverse Roe v. Wade was a central issue, voters sided overwhelmingly with Democrats and in favor of abortion rights.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles.\n\nMichigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights.\n\nVoters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers had made abortion a central focus of his campaign. Republicans there have rejected Evers’ efforts to amend the state’s 1849 abortion ban to include exceptions for rape and incest. He highlighted that split by calling the GOP-led legislature into a special session in October and urging them to act on the issue – and then used lawmakers’ decision to adjourn in less than 30 seconds without taking action as a campaign cudgel.\n\nIt’ll take time to sort out which issues were decisive, particularly in suburban House battles. But according to CNN exit polls, 27% of voters in House races said abortion was the most important issue – second only to inflation at 31%. Among those who cited abortion as the most important issue, 76% voted Democratic.\n\nA night of firsts\n\nUp and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Healey is poised to become the state’s first elected female governor and the nation’s first out lesbian state executive. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, has been elected the first female governor of Arkansas. And Moore will be the Maryland’s first Black governor.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Massachusetts elected its first female governor.

With all House districts in the commonwealth projected by CNN, the results hint at a night where Democrats could lose the House – but would not face a 2014-style wave.\n\nDemocrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020.\n\nCNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. Republicans were hoping Wexton could fall on Tuesday if the night was particularly bad for Democrats.\n\nIn an even more competitive race, CNN projected Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. Spanberger was widely seen as a vulnerable incumbent, especially after Republican Glenn Youngkin carried the district in his successful gubernatorial campaign in 2021.\n\nBut Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Luria.\n\n“I was in the White House in 2010 when the big wave rolled in. I know what it feels like. It doesn’t feel like this,” said David Axelrod, the top political adviser to former President Barack Obama.\n\nScott Jennings, a Republican operative and CNN contributor, said whether the results are a wave or just a slight shift in the House, the impact will be the same on President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\n“Whether it is a wave, a ripple, or whatever you want to call it, the oversight is going to feel all the same,” Jennings said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Dan Merica Gregory Krieg", "Eric Bradner", "Dan Merica", "Gregory Krieg"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/politics/utah-senate-debate-takeaways-evan-mcmullin-mike-lee/index.html", "title": "4 takeaways from Utah's only Senate debate | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nEvan McMullin, the independent challenging Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee, said in their only debate Monday night that Lee’s actions around the 2020 election and the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol were “a betrayal of the American republic.”\n\nLee, meanwhile, said he accepted that President Joe Biden in 2020 had won the presidency in the “only election that matters – the election held by the Electoral College.” The senator defended his actions that day, pointing to his votes to certify states’ Electoral College results.\n\nTheir clash came on the day elections officials in Utah began mailing ballots to voters.\n\nMore on key Senate races Pennsylvania women motivated by abortion rights rally behind Fetterman Republican attack ads against Warnock and Kelly mislead about Medicare North Carolina Democrats hope former judge can halt Senate losing streak in pro-GOP environment Republicans attack Mandela Barnes on crime, offering glimpse at shifting midterm message More CNN coverage on the 2022 midterm elections\n\nMcMullin describes himself as conservative but has said he would caucus with neither party if he defeats Lee. He is attempting to unite a coalition of Democrats, independents and anti-Donald Trump Republicans – and he got an assist this spring when Utah Democrats opted to endorse him rather than field their own candidate. But in Utah, even that coalition might not be enough. Trump won 58% of the vote there in 2020.\n\nMcMullin’s entrance into politics came in an effort to serve as an antidote to Trump. He ran for president as an independent against Trump in 2016. He drew 22% of the vote in Utah, well behind Trump’s 46% and Hillary Clinton’s 27%. Among those who voted for McMullin in 2016 was Lee, who said at the time that it “was a protest vote.”\n\nHere are four takeaways from their Monday night debate:\n\nHeated clash over January 6\n\nMcMullin’s sharpest attacks on Lee came after a moderator raised the topic of the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“You were there to stand up for our Constitution. But when the barbarians were at the gate, you were happy to let them in,” McMullin said.\n\nLee pointed out that ultimately, he accepted the Electoral College vote.\n\n“Yes, there were people who behaved very badly on that day. I was not one of them. I was one of the people who tried to dismantle that situation,” Lee said.\n\nMcMullin, meanwhile, said Lee only voted to accept states’ electoral votes after no other plan to keep Trump in office materialized.\n\n“You voted to certify the election in the last moment,” McMullin said. “In the same way that someone knows that a plot that’s not quite working out ought to abandon it, that’s what you did.”\n\nMeadows texts and pocket Constitutions\n\nMcMullin repeatedly cited text messages reported by CNN in April between Lee and Trump’s then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in which the two communicated about efforts to overturn Biden’s victory for weeks.\n\nIn early December 2020, Lee began texting Meadows about the idea that states could submit alternate slates of pro-Trump electors to Congress on January 6. Lee ultimately voted to certify states’ electoral votes.\n\nMcMullin said Lee was working “to keep a president who had been voted out of office, according to the will of the people, in power despite the will of the people.”\n\nHe pointed to Lee’s November 7, 2020, texts to Meadows asking him to help Sidney Powell – one of the most prominent attorneys fronting lawsuits that supported Trump and made accusations of widespread election fraud – get access to Trump.\n\nHe mocked the pocket Constitution that Lee carries, telling the senator that it is “not a prop for you to wave about and then when it’s convenient for your pursuit of power, to abandon without a thought. That’s what you’ve done with that.”\n\nLee shot back: “I disagree with everything my opponent just said, including the words ‘but,’ ‘and’ and ‘the.’ An information-free, truth-free statement – that’s something of a record.”\n\n“There is absolutely nothing to the idea that I ever would have supported or ever did support a fake electors plot,” Lee said. “Nothing. Not a scintilla of evidence suggesting that. Yet you continue to suggest that with a cavalier, reckless disregard for the truth.”\n\nRomney looms large\n\nIn an effort to cast Lee as extreme, McMullin invoked Utah’s other GOP senator: Mitt Romney.\n\nCriticizing Lee’s approach to fiscal measures, McMullin said he “routinely votes against bills that would improve water infrastructure.”\n\n“Meanwhile, Senator Romney has worked hard and consistently over the last three years,” McMullin said. “He works with Republicans and Democrats, Senator Lee, to deliver for Utah. And he voted in favor of the bipartisan infrastructure bill that you voted against. And now tens of millions of dollars have already been directed to Utah to improve our water infrastructure.”\n\nLee responded: “Yeah, I voted against that bill – a bill that spent well over a trillion dollars more than we have on all sorts of things that weren’t appropriately federal.”\n\nRomney has stayed out of the race.\n\nLee, in an appearance last week on Fox, made a plea directed at Romney: “Please get on board. Help me win reelection,” he said. The move seemed designed less to win over Romney than to rile up Lee’s conservative base.\n\nTrump followed Lee’s pleas to Romney with a statement in which he called McMullin “McMuffin” and said that Lee was being “abused, in an unprecedented way” by Romney.\n\nContrast on abortion\n\nLee said he was “thrilled” with the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had made abortion legal nationwide. He said he believes states should decide how to regulate abortion.\n\n“This is where it should remain, because it’s within the states that we can achieve the most consensus and protect the most babies,” Lee said.\n\nMcMullin, meanwhile, sought to find a middle ground on abortion rights, saying that he opposes “abortion on demand” but also opposes state legislation to force young rape victims to carry their pregnancies to term.\n\n“Some of these bills that I see being passed around the country are extreme,” McMullin said.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/politics/abortion-rights-2022-midterms/index.html", "title": "Abortion rights were on the ballot in these states. Here's what voters ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nVoters in key states on Tuesday made their support for abortion rights clear, affirming a months-long push by Democrats to act on a number of ballot measures in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nSeveral states moved to enshrine abortion protections in their constitutions and others rejected proposals to limit abortion access or criminalize doctors in some cases. Democratic lawmakers and organizers cast the midterm elections as a referendum on Republican efforts to limit women’s choices, and the notable electoral reaction could serve as a warning sign for future GOP efforts to restrict the procedure at the state-level.\n\nAbout 27% of voters cited abortion as the issue most important to them, according to the preliminary results of the national and state exit polls conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. The results also showed that when it comes to the issue, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than 4 in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates.\n\n“This fall, Roe is on the ballot,” President Joe Biden declared in a defiant speech from the White House just hours after the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year.\n\nWhile CNN projected some anti-abortion Republicans will win their races, voters in five states moved to affirm abortion rights.\n\nHere’s a running list of what voters decided on Election Day.\n\nMontana rejects abortion measure that would allow criminal penalties on health care providers\n\nVoters in Montana rejected on Tuesday proposed legislation that would have imposed criminal penalties on health care providers who do not act to preserve the life of infants born during the course of an abortion, CNN projects.\n\nLR-131, if adopted, would have provided that an infant “born alive” – defined as an infant “at any stage of development” who breathes, has a beating heart or definite movement of voluntary muscles after expulsion or extraction – be treated as a legal person entitled to medical treatment.\n\nA health care provider who violated the proposed law would have been guilty of a felony and could have faced up to 20 years in state prison and/or a fine of up to $50,000. It would have also mandated that health care providers and clinics report “a failure to comply with the requirements” to law enforcement.\n\nMontana currently prohibits abortions past viability – “the ability of a fetus to live outside the mother’s womb” – except to save the life or health of the woman.\n\nLast year, the state’s Republican-led legislature passed the bill that put the referendum on the ballot.\n\nBackers of the measure said such a law was necessary to protect infants born during an abortion attempt, while opponents said the bill wasn’t needed because there are laws in place that require care to be given.\n\nHillary-Anne Crosby, the campaign coordinator and communications lead for Compassion for Montana Families, previously said LR-131 “zeroes in on families that are having complications in the labor and delivery room, such as lethal fetal abnormalities.”\n\n“It’s not uncommon for families to make the decision to induce labor so that they can hold their infant for a few minutes, maybe have family come in and be able to meet their new family member for the few moments that they are alive, and LR-131 throws a wrench in that being a viable option to them without the health care workers facing a felony,” she previously told CNN.\n\nKentucky rejects proposal that would have further restricted abortion rights\n\nKentucky voters on Tuesday rejected a proposal to amend the state’s constitution to say that it does not “secure or protect a right” to abortion or the funding of abortion, CNN projects.\n\nThe ballot question voters faced read: “Are you in favor of amending the Constitution of Kentucky by creating a new Section of the Constitution to be numbered Section 26A to state as follows: To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion?”\n\nKentucky’s “trigger law,” which bans most abortions at all stages of pregnancy, and a law banning abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy have been allowed to be enforced temporarily while a lawsuit challenging the laws continues.\n\nKentucky Right to Life executive director Addia Wuchner, who chairs the Yes for Life Alliance, which supported Amendment 2, previously said voting “yes” would “ensure there’s no false interpretation of the constitution.”\n\nWithout the amendment, “instead of the lawmakers who duly reflect the people’s will, we would end up with the abortion industry taking each law back into court,” Wuchner said.\n\nTamarra Wieder, the Kentucky state director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, had said passing the amendment would “open the door to more attacks on abortion access,” but rejecting it would allow abortion rights advocates to “continue to fight back” against the six-week ban and the trigger ban.\n\nIf adopted, the measure would have gone into effect immediately once the results of the election are certified by the State Board of Elections.\n\nMichigan enshrines abortion rights\n\nMichigan voters on Tuesday voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution, a move that will help block a decades-old abortion ban from taking effect, CNN projects.\n\nThe passage of ballot Proposal 3 amends the Michigan constitution to establish an “individual right to reproductive freedom, including right to make and carry out all decisions about pregnancy.”\n\nMichigan has a 1931 law that essentially bans abortion in the state, but that law is being blocked by the courts. The passage of the ballot proposal helps prevent the ban from taking effect.\n\nThe amendment allows the state to regulate abortion after fetal viability, except if needed to protect a patient’s life or physical or mental health. It also bars the state from prosecuting an individual for having an abortion or miscarriage or from prosecuting someone who assists a pregnant person in “exercising rights established by this amendment.”\n\nThe proposal had to overcome legal challenges to be included on the ballot, with the Michigan Supreme Court ordering officials in September to include the question on ballots in a 5-2 ruling.\n\n“We are energized and motivated now more than ever to restore the protections that were lost under Roe,” Darci McConnell, a spokesperson for Reproductive Freedom for All, a group backing the effort, said in a statement after the ruling.\n\nMichigan Republicans had blasted the court’s decision, along with another on a voting rights ballot proposal. “Despite the court ruling, these measures remain too extreme for Michigan, and we are certain they will be handily defeated at the ballot box in November,” Elizabeth Giannone, deputy communications director for the state party, predicted in a statement earlier this year.\n\nCalifornia voters put abortion rights in state constitution\n\nThe California Constitution will protect the right to an abortion after residents on Tuesday passed a ballot initiative to enshrine the right in the state’s governing document, CNN projects.\n\nCurrently, the state constitution guarantees a right to privacy, which the California Supreme Court has ruled includes the right to have an abortion.\n\nIn May, following the leak of the US Supreme Court’s draft opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade, California Democratic leaders Gov. Gavin Newsom, state Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins and state Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said in a statement that they would propose an amendment “so that there is no doubt as to the right to abortion in this state.”\n\nThe Democratic-controlled state legislature in June approved putting the amendment on the November ballot.\n\n“Proposition 1 ensures that no matter what the future legislature looks like, what the future governor looks like, that people in California have a constitutional protection that explicitly ensures the state won’t interfere with their right to reproductive freedom,” Jodi Hicks, the head of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California and co-chair of the Yes on Prop 1 campaign, previously told CNN.\n\nThe California Family Council had said the proposed amendment is an “extreme and costly proposal that does nothing to advance women’s health.” And the California Catholic Conference, which opposes Proposition 1, called it a “misleading ballot measure that allows unlimited late-term abortions – for any reason, at any time, even moments before birth, paid for by tax dollars.”\n\nThe Yes on Prop 1 campaign previously said the proposal would not change “existing state constitutional protections and law, which provide for the right to choose an abortion prior to viability or to protect the pregnant person’s life or health.”\n\nThe measure goes into effect the fifth day after the vote is certified.\n\nVermont voters back abortion rights\n\nVoters in Vermont on Tuesday approved an amendment to the state’s constitution that abortion rights supporters say will protect “every person’s right to make their own reproductive decisions,” including about pregnancies, abortion and birth control, CNN projects.\n\nThe Vermont Constitution will now be amended to read: “That an individual’s right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one’s own life course and shall not be denied or infringed unless justified by a compelling State interest achieved by the least restrictive means.”\n\nAbortion is currently legal at all stages of pregnancy in Vermont. The proposed amendment was first brought by the Vermont Legislature in 2019.\n\nVermont for Reproductive Liberty Ballot Committee, the coalition that backed Article 22, had previously said state-level protections “are vital to safeguarding access” now that the US Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n“It would mean that abortion access has been codified in the state constitution, and really the most important part of that is that it’s protected long-term, and it means that access is going to be there, no matter what our politicians do,” Sam Donnelly, the campaign manager for the coalition, previously told CNN.\n\nBoth supporters and opponents of Article 22 have said its adoption means that Vermont lawmakers will be unable to pass any limitations or regulations on abortion in the future because it would then be deemed unconstitutional.\n\nMary Beerworth, the executive director of the Vermont Right to Life Committee, which opposes the amendment, had said the proposal goes “way, way further” than codifying abortion rights into the state constitution.\n\n“It will be about a vast range of anything that pertains to your personal reproductive autonomy, from surrogacy, three-parent embryo, designer babies, minors possibly accessing the hormone blockers for transgender surgery without their parents’ knowledge or consent,” she previously told CNN. “It’s opening a whole new world here if it passes.”\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi Devan Cole Paul Leblanc", "Veronica Stracqualursi", "Devan Cole", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/politics/georgia-senate-runoff-warnock-walker-explainer/index.html", "title": "How the Georgia Senate runoff will work | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nDemocrats have clinched 50 seats in the Senate, but the stakes remain high for Georgia’s December 6 runoff between Democratic Sen.

And what would a win or a loss mean for each party?\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is a runoff and how does it work?\n\nA runoff is an additional election used to determine the winner of a certain race when neither candidate earns the required threshold for victory – in this case, 50%.\n\nIn Georgia, runoffs are more straightforward than general elections in that the candidate with the most votes wins.\n\nGeorgia’s top elections official, Brad Raffensperger, said counties are already preparing for the December 6 election, and voters can request absentee ballots starting Wednesday through November 28 via the state’s online portal.\n\nEarly voting must begin by November 28 in all counties, but Raffensperger said his office anticipates some counties could have early voting on Saturday, November 26 or Sunday, November 27. “We are working with the counties to find out what their plans are on this front,” he said.\n\nNotably, the logistics of the 2022 runoff will be different than in years passed. The 2021 Georgia law that cut the length of runoffs from nine weeks to four means that the deadline for a new voter to register for the runoff election has already passed.\n\nGabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for Georgia’s Secretary of State Office, told CNN’s Paula Reid Sunday evening the cutoff is in place because, “Historically, the state constitution of Georgia lays out that the runoff is supposed to be a continuation of the original election.”\n\n“There’s some responsibility on voters in this thing. The reality is if you’re a registered voter in this state, and we have 7.9 million of them, you’re able to vote in this state whether you vote in the election or not,” Sterling said.\n\nWhat is at stake?\n\nPut simply, a lot.\n\nWith Democrats projected to hold 50 Senate seats, voters in Georgia will determine whether the chamber remains split 50-50 – and runs based on a power-sharing agreement that depends on Vice President Kamala Harris breaking tie votes – or whether Democrats gain the 51 seats needed for a true majority.\n\nTop officials from the Democratic and Republican parties told CNN they intend to double down on their significant investments in Georgia, with an increasing assumption that meaningful control of the Senate could hinge on the outcome of the runoff.\n\nIn brief remarks on Tuesday night, Walker asked supporters gathered in a hotel ballroom to “hang in there a little bit longer.”\n\n“I’m telling you right now – I didn’t come to lose,” Walker said.\n\nWarnock, meanwhile, told supporters early Wednesday morning, “We’re not sure if this journey is over today, or if there’s still a little work yet to do, but here’s what we do know: We know that when they’re finished counting the votes from today’s election, that we’re going to have received more votes than my opponent.”\n\nBoth candidates are expected to speak later Wednesday, aides said, with specific plans still in flux.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/03/2020-nevada-election-results-senate-district-15-reno-city-council/6057821002/", "title": "Nevada Election 2020: See live results for Reno, national races", "text": "November 3rd has arrived and Nevadans who haven't cast their ballot by mail or voted early are heading to the polls to cast their votes.\n\nAlongside the presidential election, Reno voters will decide who will represent the 2nd Congressional District, who will be elected for the District 15 seat, Reno City Council members and on five ballot measures.\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m. in Nevada.\n\nAs Nevada tallies up the votes, this is where where you can find live results and real-time data on the statewide races.

Now, North Carolina Republican lawmakers are asking the justices to adopt the long-dormant legal theory in a fight over redistricting maps, saying it allows state legislatures to set rules in federal elections without any constraints by state courts or other state authorities.\n\nVoting rights groups say the lawmakers’ position would lead to state legislatures having absolute authority without judicial oversight, even perhaps choosing their desired election winners. They fear that if the court were to adopt the theory it would abolish necessary checks and balances, upend states’ time-tested election systems, spawn litigation and require states to conduct separate state and federal elections.\n\nThe dispute comes amid the recent explosion of litigation surrounding voting rules and a renewed effort by Trump to allege massive fraud at the polling place – a baseless claim rejected by Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nAs recently as last week, Trump called for the “termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution” in a social media post.\n\nAs things stand, Republicans currently control the majority of state legislatures and have seen multiple proposed congressional legislative maps struck down by state courts.\n\n“There’s a lot that could be implicated in this decision if the court were to say basically that the legislature of a state has free, unchecked rein to decide federal elections,” said Abha Khanna, a lawyer for Democratic voters in the case. “That would be just a complete, fundamental shift in the way we have always done business.” She stressed that it could impact not just claims of partisan gerrymandering but other rules on issues such as voter id and absentee voting regulations.\n\nFour conservative justices interested in the issue\n\nOn the surface, the case before the justices presents a redistricting dispute out of North Carolina involving a lower court decision that invalidated the state’s congressional map. The state Supreme Court struck the map as an illegal partisan gerrymander and replaced it with a temporary court-drawn map more favorable to Democrats.\n\nRepublican legislators raced to the US Supreme Court in March 2022 asking the justices to freeze the decision by the state Supreme Court.\n\nThey relied upon the Elections Clause of the Constitution that provides that rules governing the “manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives” must be prescribed in “each state by the legislature thereof.”\n\nUnder the independent state legislature theory, the lawmakers argue, state legislatures should be able to set rules with no interference from the state courts.\n\nA 5-4 US Supreme Court declined to block the court-ordered map on an emergency basis.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, writing for Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, said that he thought the lawmakers in the case will ultimately prevail.\n\n“If the language of the Elections Clause is taken seriously, there must be some limit on the authority of state courts to countermand actions taken by state legislatures when they are prescribing rules for the conduct of federal elections,” he wrote.\n\nCritically, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that he agreed with Alito that the underlying Elections Clause questions were important.\n\n“The issue is almost certain to keep arising until this Court definitively resolves it,” Kavanaugh wrote. Yet he ultimately voted against the lawmakers cautioning that it was too close to the impending midterms to change the map.\n\nAll eyes will be on Justice Amy Coney Barrett during arguments. She has not previously opined on the issue and did not join Alito’s dissent back in March. While it only takes four justices to agree to hear a case, five votes are necessary to decide it.\n\nInside the case\n\nOn Wednesday, the justices will review the opinion by the North Carolina Supreme Court that went against the lawmakers, saying that legislators do not have “unlimited power” to draw electoral maps.\n\nThe state court acknowledged that redistricting is primarily delegated to the legislature but said it must be performed in conformity with the state constitution. The court said the maps violated the North Carolina’s free elections, equal process, free speech and free assembly clauses.\n\nTraditionally, legislatures have set ground rules for conducting an election, but have not acted alone or with the final word. Processes set in place have been subject to intervention by elections administrators and state courts.\n\nBut the strictest reading of the independent state legislature theory says that state courts, when it comes to federal elections, must stay out completely.\n\nThe Republican lawmakers argued in court papers that the “text of the Constitution directly answers the question presented in this case.” The Elections Clause provides “unambiguous language” concerning the manner of federal elections and makes clear that the rules will be drawn by the legislatures.\n\n“The North Carolina Supreme Court decreed that the 2022 election and all upcoming congressional elections in North Carolina were not to be held in the ‘manner’ prescribed by the Legislature,” David H. Thompson argued on behalf of the lawmakers.\n\nHe argued that the lower court did not point to a distinct state constitutional provision when it struck down the congressional map but instead seized on “vague and abstract state constitutional language.”\n\n“The Constitution’s drafting history confirms that the allocation of authority to regulate elections specifically to each State’s legislature was a deliberate choice,” Thompson said.\n\nJohn Eastman, the lawyer who served as a key architect of the push to overturn election results for Trump, has filed a sweeping amicus brief in favor of the lawmakers. Lawyers for the Republican National Committee scaled back on some of Eastman’s arguments, but they, too, want the justices to adopt a version of the theory.\n\nDemocratic solicitors general oppose the lawsuit\n\nTwo former solicitors general of Democratic administrations will argue in favor of voting rights groups and the state supporting the state Supreme Court ruling. They are supported by the current solicitor general of the Biden administration, Elizabeth Prelogar.\n\nDon Verrilli, who served as solicitor general during the Obama administration, argued on behalf of the state in court papers, pointing out that in North Carolina, the General Assembly passed a law authorizing judicial review of congressional redistricting to ensure that it complies with state constitutional requirements.\n\nHe told the court they could resolve the case on that factor alone, never wading into the independent state legislative doctrine.\n\n“It is inconceivable that the founding generation would have understood the Elections Clause to forbid state legislatures from authorizing state courts to enforce the state constitution and remedy proven violations,” Verrilli argued.\n\nHe urged the court not to entertain the independent state legislature doctrine warning it could create serious election administration problems, upend time-tested systems, spawn protected litigation and possibly require states to conduct separate state and federal elections.\n\nNeal Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general for the Obama administration, will argue on behalf of voting rights groups as well as individual Democratic voters. Notably, J. Michael Luttig, a conservative legal luminary who played a critical role in the run up to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack advising then-Vice President Mike Pence’s legal team, is serving as Katyal’s co-counsel.\n\n“The independent state legislature doctrine was the centerpiece to Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election,” Luttig said in an interview with CNN. “I have believed since January 6th that I had a responsibility to the country to explain why I rejected the theory in advising the vice president,” he said.\n\nPrelogar also critiques the theory, leaning on historical tradition in an attempt to attract the more conservative members of the court.\n\n“More than two centuries of practice confirms that state legislatures are subject to state constitutional constraints” when they exercise their authority under the Constitution, she told the justices in court papers.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/08/iowa-election-results-2022-live-voting-ballot-governor-senate-midterm/69616515007/", "title": "Iowa election results: Updates for 2022 midterms, US Senate ...", "text": "Des Moines Register staff\n\nIowans have made their choices for governor, senator, Congress, the Iowa Legislature, county offices and more.

Jennifer Konfrst, the House minority leader, told the gathered to “settle in for a blue wave.”\n\nKonfrst, who hopes to be elected in House District 32, said her fellow Democratic candidates — Deidre DeJear running for Iowa governor; Cindy Axne running in the third district; and Adm. Michael Franken running for U.S. Senate — “put people over politics.”\n\n“We know Iowans are with us on the issues,” Konfrst said. “We can't control everything that happens tonight. We're going to have some successes. We're going to have some sadness. But the thing we have to do is continue to fight because there are women out there who will die if they can't make their own healthcare decisions, and we’ve got to have their backs.”\n\nWhile reproductive rights were on the minds of many of the gathered at the Iowa Democrats official victory party, most were also excited by the party’s field of candidates of color.\n\nA self-proclaimed “political nerd,” William Sims, 42, of Des Moines, said he’s thrilled to be part of what could be a historic night for Deidre DeJear, who is first Black nominee for Iowa governor.\n\nSimilarly, Nataly Espinoza, 36, of Des Moines, who runs a community program that works with immigrants to attain their U.S. citizenship, said her phone hasn’t stopped ringing with calls from those she’s helped gain their citizenship who are now eligible to vote.\n\nEspinoza said immigrants often feel “they don’t deserve to be here, or they don’t deserve a lot of things,” but the ability to vote serves as a reminder that they do have a say and that they belong.\n\nBrenda Schumann and her husband, Carl, came to the Democratic watch party to support Senate candidate Mike Franken. The couple, who are both in their 80s, volunteered for Franken’s political campaign, knocking on doors and talking with residents.\n\n“(Franken) is just so knowledgeable, so experienced. He has over 38 years in the navy. He’s been in D.C. He has fresh ideas,” said Brenda, 81, who donned in a dark blue T-shirt with one of Franken’s campaign slogan: “Underestimate me. That’ll be fun.”\n\nFor Franken, Tuesday wasn’t just Election Day, it was also his birthday, an occasion celebrated by the party with a big cake decorated in Navy yellow and blue.\n\nSpirit in the room didn’t seem to dimmish with the early call of Gov. Kim Reynolds projected win. Most wanted to wait and see how the rest of the night played out.\n\n“In 12 hours, we're gonna wake up and I don't care what happens tonight, we're gonna keep fighting,” Konfrst said.\n\n— F. Amanda Tugade and Courtney Crowder\n\n5:38 Johnson County Auditor says Election Day turnout is exceeding 2018 midterm numbers as Iowa City voting heads into final hours\n\nJohnson County Auditor Travis Weipert told the Press-Citizen that Election Day voting this year is outpacing Election Day voting in 2018, the last midterm election. While early voting turnout was down this year by several thousand voters, 3,000 more people voted at the polls as of 3 p.m. compared to the same time four years ago.\n\n“I’m starting to wonder that in the next 20 minutes or 30 minutes everybody will be leaving work, we’re really going to find out how many. If the numbers continue how they are, I can see that at least getting within range of 2018 easily,” he said. “It is crazy to see 3,000 more people vote at the sites, which puts a lot of pressure on us.”\n\nWeipert said he thinks a lot of people waited until the last minute to vote and multiple factors may have impacted people’s decision not to vote early, like recent changes to Iowa’s voting laws. He said, while knocking on wood, that Johnson County’s elections have had little to no problems this year.\n\n“I have the most amazing staff. I have a 7-day-old (child) at home and I have been reliant on grandmas, grandpas, aunts and uncles helping out and it’s awesome that the staff here hasn’t missed a beat,” Weipert said.\n\nJesse Vega is a senior at the University of Iowa studying sport and recreation management and voted at the Iowa City precinct at Terry Trueblood Recreation Center in the south part of town. Vega said he's from the Washington D.C. area, but his dad is from the Mason City area, which was a big draw for him to come to UI.\n\nVega said his voting experience Tuesday was straightforward and efficient and it wasn’t overcrowded when he voted around 4:00 p.m. He said he was motivated to vote mostly because voting is a civic responsibility and his duty as a U.S. citizen.\n\n“I was able to vote in the 2020 election as well and this is kind of my second opportunity now. It is a right given to each citizen to be able to have some sort of a say in all the levels of government,” Vega said.\n\nSummer Gadola brought her child Grayson to the same polling place and also said voting went quickly Tuesday. She picked up two extra voting stickers for her son and his brother.\n\nGadola said having children and voting for issues that impact children is what brought her to the polls.\n\n“Pro-life and things like that,” she said.\n\nGadola said Republican Jacob Onken who is running for Iowa House District 89 knocked on her door to ask for her support and is interested to see how that race turns out. Onken is running against Democrat Elinor Levin in one of Iowa City’s two house seats.\n\nGeorge Shillcock, Iowa City Press-Citizen\n\n5:25 p.m. Names of two candidates left off ballot in Linn County supervisor race in Putnam Township\n\nThe names of two candidates vying against each other for an open Linn County supervisor seat were left off ballots in Putnam Township on Tuesday, a mistake that Secretary of State Paul Pate said was \"very serious\" and prevented voters there from making their voices heard.\n\nThe District 1 supervisors' race was between longtime state Rep. Kirsten Running-Marquardt, a Democrat, and Republican Mark Banowetz, a Christmas tree farmer. They both hoped to fill a seat held by Stacey Walker, who opted not to seek reelection.\n\n\"The Secretary of State's Office is closely monitoring this situation, and has been in touch with the Linn County Attorney, Iowa Attorney General and representatives from both the Republican and Democratic parties,\" a release from Pate's office said. \"No other races on the ballot were impacted.\"\n\nVoters in the district were encouraged to continue to vote until 8 p.m. Tuesday night.\n\nLee Rood, Des Moines Register\n\n3:45 p.m. Johnson County Election Day voter turnout exceeding 2018 numbers, early voting lags far behind that year\n\nEarly voting turnout in Johnson County, which is typically strong among Democrats, lagged far behind totals from 2020 and 2018.\n\nAs of Monday, the day before Election Day, 25,411 ballots were returned to the county auditor for mail-in and other forms of absentee voting. In 2018, over 34,000 total voters voted early while in 2020, a year of abnormally high absentee voting rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a presidential election, over 60,000 total voters in Johnson County cast ballots early.\n\nHowever, so far on Election Day this year, 20,305 voters have cast their ballot or 22.33% of all registered voters in the county. Auditor Travis Weipert said on Twitter that Election Day turnout earlier in the day at 11 a.m. was exceeding 2018 when the last midterm election was held.\n\nJohnson County has 90,948 registered voters.\n\nThe precincts with the highest turnout are in Johnson County’s rural areas, in Cedar Township and in and around the cities of Swisher and Shueyville in the northern part of the county. The precincts with the lowest turnout are mostly in Iowa City’s precincts.\n\nGeorge Shillcock, Iowa City Press-Citizen\n\n2:45 p.m. Reproductive rights, economic issues drive voters to polls at Roosevelt High School\n\nBrooklyn Powers, 24, was one of two people who voted at Des Moines Roosevelt High School Tuesday morning that said the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade and leave abortion rights up to the state to decide drove them to come out and vote.\n\nPowers, who works in the hospitality industry, said she considers herself 'pro-choice.'\n\n“I think that everybody should have the right to choose,” Powers said. “Anybody who is being put in a position to have to choose, they deserve to have that choice and not someone who it will never affect.”\n\nChris LoRang, who works for a Des Moines chiropractic clinic, said that, like Powers, gun violence and access to reproductive rights drove him to the polls.\n\nLoRang said he voted for Democrats to prevent Iowa from enacting further restrictions on abortion access, but considers himself both “pro-choice” and “pro-life,” he said.\n\nArguments on all sides of the abortion rights debate have gotten too partisan and too simplified, LoRang said.\n\n“As a physician, if abortions are not available in a clinical setting, they’re going to happen in unsafe areas,” LoRang said. “I’m pro-educated decisions.”\n\nLoRang is worried about access to abortions for women with troubled pregnancies. His own mom had health problems caused by her pregnancy with LoRang and had him against the advice of her doctor, he said.\n\n“Her decision to have me was against her physician’s advice, but that’s her decision to have it or not have it,” LoRang said. “She was able to make an educated decision about what she wanted to do.”\n\nOther Des Moines Residents said they came out for several reasons.\n\nChris Wion, 70, said she's concerned about various issues, including Russia’s war in Ukraine. Society seems to be fraying and, “We’ve fell apart, lost our way,” Wion said.\n\n“I can’t complain if I don’t vote,” Wion said.\n\nTom Swedberg, 70, is retired from a career working at Hy-Vee stores. Swedberg came to vote for Zach Nunn.\n\n“I wanted Axne out of here,” Swedberg said.\n\nSwedberg liked Nunn’s history, serving in the U.S. Air Force and Iowa Air National Guard.\n\nSwedberg worried that politics is getting less civil. He likes Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and approved of the job done by former president Donald Trump.\n\n“We need to get back to a solid party system, and get everybody pretty much on the same page, instead of everybody at each other’s throats,” Swedberg said.\n\nEconomic issues were also important to Swedberg. As a retired person, higher grocery prices are harder because stores offer fewer discounts, he said.\n\nNone of the four people interviewed by a Des Moines Register reporter outside Roosevelt High School had any trouble voting. Most were in and out in about 20 minutes.\n\nPhilip Joens, Des Moines Register\n\n1:40 p.m. Turnout in Iowa's fastest-growing city increases as afternoon wears on\n\nTiffin, a small but rapidly growing suburb of Iowa City, has its precinct next to the Clear Creek Amana Middle School. As of 11:42 a.m., more than 300 people had voted there. Tiffin a city of 4,512, was Iowa's fastest-growing city, according to the 2020 U.S. Census.\n\nErnestine Dedrick, like many of those residing in Tiffin, hasn’t been in town for long. She moved to town from Long Beach, California two years ago and voted Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“I’m a Democrat in a very Republican area. (Voting) was really easy to do,” she said.\n\nDedrick said she's concerned about homelessness and social security. She said while she's not happy with Democrats in office right now, she feels Republicans would handle issues in the U.S. worse if they are put in power.\n\nBrad Buser also voted at the Tiffin precinct Tuesday. He said voting was “quick and easy” and took less than 20 minutes, but was surprised that the voting precinct wasn’t very busy during the lunch hour.\n\nBuser said the economy has been a big issue for him. His grocery bills and gas costs have been high and it impacts him a lot since he commutes to Cedar Rapids for work. He said he is a Democrat and a gun owner and did vote in favor of the gun rights amendment to the Iowa Constitution, saying he believes it is a right for people to own firearms.\n\n“Basic politics and the economy the way it is, and the COVID thing that has happened over the last couple years are the big driving thing for me voting,” Buser said.\n\nHe said he is most interested in the race for Iowa Governor and U.S. Senate. He said he thinks U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley has been in office long enough and likes Democrat Mike Franken enough to vote for him. He said he doesn’t think Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has done enough to warrant a second term in office.\n\n“And I don’t think (Reynolds) handled the pandemic quite as well as what could have been,” he said.\n\nGeorge Shillcock, Iowa City Press-Citizen\n\n1:30 p.m. Fewer early, absentee votes cast, secretary of state says\n\nFewer Iowans voted early or by absentee ballot this year compared to some recent election years, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said Tuesday morning.\n\nAbout 368,000 Iowans voted early or absentee, which is down about 60,000 to 70,000 votes compared to most general elections, Pate said. In 2017, the Iowa State Legislature shortened the early voting period from 40 days to about 30 and shortened the early voting period again last year to 20 days. The bill also moved up the cutoff to request a mail-in ballot.\n\nPate hesitated to blame the lower early turnout on those changes. Both Republican and Democratic parties have not encouraged absentee voting as much this year as in past years, Pate said.\n\n\"We really didn't see a dramatic difference when we shifted the first time,\" Pate said. \"I'm not sure that we're ready to put the assumption that a change in the number of days reduces the number of people voting that way.\"\n\nPate, a Republican, is up for reelection this year. His Democratic opponent, Linn County Auditor Joel Miller, said last week that the new deadlines are \"problematic.\"\n\n\"Most people weren’t paying attention to early voting until we actually started early voting,\" Miller said last week. \"And then very quickly, the deadline to request an absentee ballot was five days later, and they got caught by that, surprised by that.\"\n\nPast coverage:Iowa early voting is lower than in past midterm elections; impact on final turnout unclear\n\nOverall, out of 381,451 absentee ballots requested, 96.49% of them have already been returned, Pate said Tuesday. He considered that a \"pretty high percentage.\"\n\nOverall 76% of Iowa voters voted in the 2020 general election, which was a presidential election year. During the 2018 midterm election, 39.6% of people voted, according to Pate's office. Pate said he expected strong turnout Tuesday, around 60%.\n\n\"I'm not sure we're going to be able to hold on to the huge numbers we've seen during COVID,\" Pate said. \"It's always driven by candidates and messaging.\"\n\nPhilip Joens, Des Moines Register\n\n1:30 p.m. Quiet, quick voting in Polk County precincts\n\nPate visited precincts at the Saylor Township Fire Department, a Lutheran church in Ankeny, the Ankeny Public Library and Merrill Middle School in Des Moines. Overall the precincts had brisk traffic and few problems.\n\n\"Poll workers were processing people through very quickly,\" Pate said.\n\nPrecincts in Polk County reported few problems Tuesday morning, according to Pate. Elsewhere there were a few complaints about political signs too close to a polling site or other small things that didn't impede voting, but can be improved upon, he said. Later on Tuesday, Pate will head to Camp Dodge in Johnston where he will monitor cybersecurity threats and election results.\n\n\"It's been pretty quiet, which is where you want to be,\" Pate said.\n\nPhilip Joens, Des Moines Register\n\n11:40 a.m. Absentee voting strong in Polk County\n\nPolk County Auditor Jamie Fitzgerald said early Tuesday that absentee voting was strong heading into the midterm elections. Of more than 56,000 ballots requested, including those who did early voting, roughly 53,000 ballots had been returned, he said.\n\nBy about 11 a.m. Tuesday, about 41,000 of 286,820 active voters in Polk County also had voted at the polls.\n\nHe said while redistricting led to some voters being confused about their polling sites, workers were redirecting them to the right polling place. All the information needed to vote remains on the auditor’s website, he said.\n\nFitzgerald said workers also are going to audit voting in one Polk County precinct chosen by the state as an added form of checks and balances.\n\n“It’s been really quiet to tell you the truth,” he said.\n\nLee Rood, Des Moines Register\n\n11:04 a.m. Economy, abortion and inflation on minds of voters in Williamsburg\n\nIn Williamsburg, at the community recreation center just to the south of town, over 300 people had voted by 10 a.m. where two precincts were set up in the same building. One upstairs for the city and another downstairs for Pilot, Troy and York townships in Iowa County.\n\nWilliam Fetzer is a retired U.S. Air Force veteran from Williamsburg and voted just after 9:30 a.m. He's lived in Williamsburg all his life, not counting the six years he spent in England while serving. He said he has never voted straight ticket before Tuesday, when he voted for only Republicans, but has been a registered Republican “forever.”\n\nFetzer, like many other voters in the country, is motivated to vote by inflation and the economy. He said prices are “astronomical in some respects” and it hurts those on a fixed income, like him.\n\nLinda and Donald Hiner from Troy Township described themselves as “more liberal” but said they voted split ticket because they are disappointed in the job President Joe Biden has done while in office. Donald Hiner said he’d like to see control of Congress split evenly between Republicans and Democrats to force the two parties to compromise.\n\nLinda Hiner said she's motivated by the economy and inflation too and is concerned about spending. She said she is also worried that Biden isn't strong enough on the international stage.\n\n“A kindergartner knows that inflation is caused by the spending of money and Biden just keeps wanting to make it and keep spending it,” she said.\n\nStephanie Timm, an OB-GYN from Williamsburg said her experience went well Tuesday and said she wanted to cast her ballot in support of access to abortion.\n\n“The right to be in control of your own body is important to me and I respect the federal decision of wanting the states to be in charge, but I’m not sure the state needs to be in charge of a woman’s body. It’s her body for a reason or anybody’s body to do what they want with,” she said.\n\nTimm, who was recently engaged, said education and community matter to people like her living in Williamsburg. She said she thinks Williamsburg will go for Republicans, like in recent history, but says people having that choice is important to democracy.\n\nGeorge Shillcock, Iowa City Press-Citizen\n\n8:34 a.m. Democratic voters say democracy, abortion and gun rights amendment motivates them\n\nStella Hart and Addison Benzshawel arrived together and voted just after 8 a.m. at the Iowa City Community School District Administration building, their assigned voting precinct. Both said abortion, the judicial retention elections and the proposed amendment to the Iowa Constitution to protect gun rights are what was top of their mind as they cast their ballots.\n\nHart, a Democrat, said she voted on Election Day because recent changes to Iowa law for early voting have been hard to keep up with. She said voting is the minimum that people should do.\n\n“I always vote on Election Day now... honestly, it’s kind of fun also to come to the polling station and vote with our neighbors,” she said.\n\nMore:2022 Iowa local election results\n\nBenzshawel, who's also a Democrat, said he doesn’t want to “give up the fight” and said to him, it seems that with rules around elections changing and other states gerrymandering, it's becoming more difficult to vote everywhere in the country.\n\n“I wanted to support (Democratic candidate for Governor Deidre) DeJear, as well and support the Democratic Party across the board,” Benzshawel said.,\n\nJack Fain, a 22-year-old who recently moved to Iowa City for work, said he is concerned about people who are denying the legitimacy of elections and the results of the 2020 election. He said it's getting on his nerves and feels strongly about electing people who will respect the transition of power.\n\n“This is one of those times where I’ve been motivated a lot more on issues than individual person, if that makes sense,” Fain said.\n\nGeorge Shillcock, Iowa City Press-Citizen\n\n7:30 a.m. Iowa City voters, including congressional candidate Christina Bohannan, begin casting ballots\n\nIt’s Election Day in Iowa City. At 1725 N. Dodge St., Iowa City’s 23rd precinct, 31 voters cast ballots in the first 30 minutes of voting, including Democratic state Rep. Christina Bohannan, who is running for Congress against U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks in Iowa’s 1st Congressional District.\n\nJean Willard of Iowa City was among the voters and said she came out to vote because she views the 2022 midterms as a very important election. Bohannan cast her ballot just as Willard, who said she leans towards voting for Democrats, was entering to cast her own ballot.\n\n“Right now for me it’s an approach to deciding how we want to be governed,” Willard said.\n\nBohannan said she feels really good on the last day of voting after months of running her first congressional campaign.\n\n“We’ve run a really strong campaign and I think we’ve made the contrast between me and my opponent very clear,” Bohannan said. “I am focused on what is best for the people of Iowa.”\n\nBohannan and many other local candidates in Johnson County plan to gather at Big Grove Brewery in Iowa City for a watch party later today as results roll in.\n\nGeorge Shillcock, Iowa City Press-Citizen\n\nMore than a subscription:Unlock these benefits by subscribing to the Register\n\nVoting problems?

Now, the nomination process enters a new phase.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThere will be hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin. Activist groups and senators will pore over Jackson’s record. Usually the candidate is a judge – and Jackson sits on the federal appellate court in Washington, DC – but there’s no requirement in the Constitution that the person be a judge or even a lawyer. That’s just the recent custom.\n\nRead more about Jackson’s personal history and legal record from CNN’s Ariane de Vogue.\n\nHow long does it take to confirm a Supreme Court justice?\n\nThe confirmation process timeline varies. For instance, with the 2020 election bearing down and the likelihood they would lose control of the Senate, Republicans pushed through Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination in lightning speed – less than a month. Before that, the last nomination to proceed to confirmation in less than two months was Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s back in 1993. These things usually take months.\n\nBut Democrats may well lose control of the Senate in the November midterm elections, so they’ll work to move this process along. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is looking to the Barrett timeline as a model, according to CNN’s reporting.\n\nHow many votes does it take to confirm a new Supreme Court justice?\n\nIt takes 51 votes in the Senate – a simple majority.\n\nWhy not 60 votes?\n\nRepublicans are adamant about maintaining a 60-vote threshold for legislation. But they actually nuked the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees during the Trump administration, so confirmation takes only a simple majority.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris can break a 50-50 tie, which is a real possibility in these partisan times. There are 50 Republicans, 48 Democrats and two independents who usually vote with Democrats. It’s a split chamber.\n\nWill any Republicans vote for Biden’s nominee?\n\nOverwhelming support for nominees, regardless of their political views, used to be routine. Breyer is seen as a liberal justice but he was confirmed 87-9. That kind of bipartisanship has not been seen in recent years.\n\nNone of President Donald Trump’s nominees received more than 54 votes. Keep an eye on the more moderate Republicans, like Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\n\nWill all Democrats vote for Biden’s nominee?\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin has shown himself to be perfectly willing to buck the party line. Democrats will also need to consider other potential wild cards in the Senate.\n\nWhat will the top issues be?\n\nVoting rights is sure to be a key issue as Democrats make that one of their top priorities heading into the 2022 midterm elections and after a raft of decisions by the current court.\n\nAbortion has previously been a key issue during nomination battles. The current court seems poised to either overturn or drastically scale back Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nHow long is a Supreme Court justice’s term?\n\nA Supreme Court justice’s term is for life! Or until he or she retires. That’s been interpreted as giving the justices life tenure.\n\nBreyer was 56 when President Bill Clinton picked him in 1994.\n\nMost justices are in their late 40s or early 50s when they’re nominated.\n\nJackson is 51.\n\nNeil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who were appointed by Trump, are both in their early to mid-50s. Barrett is 49. If she serves until she’s 87 like Ginsburg, she would be on the court for almost 40 years.\n\nBut do most Supreme Court justices serve that long?\n\nThe average length of a Supreme Court tenure has grown a lot. Harvard Business Review did an actuarial analysis in 2018 and argued the average tenure over the next 100 years will grow to 35 years. It was 17 over the previous 100 years.\n\nThat also means there will be fewer and fewer of these nominees, which is why Democrats had been itching for Breyer to retire while they control the White House and the Senate.\n\nHow do Supreme Court justices decide to retire?\n\nStrategically. Justices have increasingly tried to time their retirements. Republican-appointed justices tend to wait for Republican presidents – like Anthony Kennedy, who retired in 2018, allowing Trump to pick his successor.\n\nBreyer had been under intense pressure from Democrats to retire now, when Democrats hold the White House and the Senate.\n\nGinsburg tried to pick her moment, and it backfired horribly for her political allies.\n\nShe wanted the first female President to pick her replacement, so she declined to retire during the Obama administration, hoping that Hillary Clinton would get to name a successor. Instead, Ginsburg died on the bench with just enough time for Trump to appoint a successor. Now, a woman’s right to an abortion is likely to be curtailed by the more conservative court she left behind.\n\nThe same thing could have happened with Antonin Scalia, the Republican-appointed justice who died at the end of Obama’s term. But because then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to even allow a hearing on Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia, the court’s conservative majority was protected.\n\nWhat about the idea that the American people should have a say in their court?\n\nWe live in a republic, where the Electoral College picks the President and senators confirm Supreme Court justices. And we are, increasingly, governed by people who represent a minority of Americans. That will continue on the court for a long time. In 2020, CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein wrote a very thoughtful piece on this undemocratic element of US democracy.\n\nCould and should the Supreme Court be changed?\n\nA lot of Democrats think it should. They would like to either expand the size to dilute the influence of the conservative majority or impose term limits to create more turnover.\n\nA commission appointed by Biden found near consensus for imposing term limits on justices, and suggested adding justices to the nine-member Supreme Court would be more controversial. The White House has not endorsed any specific reform plan.\n\nWhat does the Constitution say?\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress the ability to set the makeup of the court. And its words have been interpreted to give justices life terms. But the actual words are different, saying justices shall serve during times of “good behavior.”\n\nIt doesn’t list a term or an end date, so one has never been applied. That doesn’t necessarily mean it couldn’t. But how this would be accomplished would be up for debate.\n\nHere’s the relevant language from Article III:\n\nThe judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.\n\nWhat about changing the size of the Supreme Court?\n\nThis could more easily be accomplished. The size of the court went up and down pretty regularly during the first 100 years of the US. But it’s been set at nine since the 1860s. Franklin D. Roosevelt tried and failed to expand the court to 15 justices in the 1930s.\n\nSeveral Democrats, notably Pete Buttigieg, were pushing a similar idea during the last presidential primary. The most important Democrat right now, Biden, has said he opposes it.\n\nHow do most Americans feel?\n\nSupreme Court vacancies are usually more of a motivator for Republican voters than for Democratic ones. That may not be the case now that Republican-appointed justices have such a strong majority.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

No other justices made an objection public.\n\nThe Biden White House supports releasing the records to the committee, after determining the disclosure is in the nation’s best interest and declining to assert executive privilege.\n\n“The Supreme Court’s action tonight is a victory for the rule of law and American democracy,” Reps. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican – who are chair and vice chair of the panel – said in a joint statement Wednesday. “The Select Committee has already begun to receive records that the former President had hoped to keep hidden and we look forward to additional productions regarding this important information.”\n\nThe select committee is seeking more than 700 pages of disputed documents as it explores Trump’s role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election. That includes his appearance at a January 6 rally in which he directed followers to go to the US Capitol where lawmakers were set to certify the election results and “fight” for their county.\n\nThe documents include activity logs, schedules, speech notes and three pages of handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows – paperwork that could reveal goings-on inside the West Wing as Trump supporters gathered in Washington and then overran the Capitol, disrupting the certification of the 2020 vote.\n\nTrump is also seeking to keep secret a draft proclamation honoring two police officers who died in the siege and memos and other documents about supposed election fraud and efforts to overturn Trump’s loss of the presidency, the National Archives has said in court documents.\n\nWhite House spokesman Mike Gwin said in a statement after the ruling that Trump’s “actions represented a unique and existential threat to our democracy, and President Biden has been clear that these events require a full investigation to ensure that what we saw on January 6th can never happen again. Today’s ruling by the Supreme Court is an important step forward in that process, and in ensuring accountability for an unprecedented assault on our democracy and the rule of law.”\n\nThe National Archives and lawyers for Trump have not responded to CNN inquiries about the Supreme Court’s order.\n\nThe move effectively moots former Trump’s pending appeal in the case that centered on keeping the documents secret. Lawyers for Trump say the documents are sensitive and privileged records.\n\n“The disagreement between an incumbent President and his predecessor from a rival political party is both novel and highlights the importance of executive privilege and the ability of Presidents and their advisers to reliably make and receive full and frank advice, without concern that communications will be publicly released to meet a political objective,” Trump’s lawyer, Jesse R. Binnall told the justices.\n\nHe stressed that Congress had no valid legislative purpose for requesting the documents. “Congress may not rifle through the confidential presidential papers of a former President to meet political objections,” Binnall added.\n\nBut the Biden administration argued that withholding the records based on executive privilege is not in the interest of the United States. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said that in light of the “extraordinary events” of January 6, President Joe Biden had decided that that an assertion of executive privilege is “not justified.”\n\nA federal appeals court ruled against Trump, holding that he “has provided no basis for this court to override President Biden’s judgment and the agreement and accommodations worked out between the Political Branches over these documents.”\n\nThe court noted that the events “marked the most significant assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812,” but agreed to freeze its ruling until the Supreme Court acted.\n\n“Under any of the tests advocated by former President Trump, the profound interests in disclosure advanced by President Biden and the January 6th Committee far exceed his generalized concerns for Executive Branch confidentiality,” the panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit wrote.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court cited part of that sentence. “Because the Court of Appeals concluded that President Trump’s claims would have failed even if he were the incumbent, his status as a former President necessarily made no difference to the court’s decision,” the Supreme Court said.\n\n“Tonight’s ruling is a major setback for former President Trump in his efforts to block the National Archives from turning over documents to the January 6 Committee,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “Although the justices did not rule on whether the court of appeals correctly rejected his suit, by not blocking the handing over now, the justices have allowed that ruling to be the final word.”\n\nImplications for the House investigation\n\nThe Supreme Court’s order is a major blow to Trump, at a moment when the select committee is gaining steam as it gathers information from hundreds of witnesses and communications providers.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the panel, said Wednesday that she expects the committee will get the records from the Trump White House “very promptly” and called the ruling “a very big deal for getting the truth out.”\n\n“I was glad to see the court respected the decision made by the appellate court,” she told CNN’s Erin Burnett on “Out Front.” Asked about the four pages of Trump documents that were set to be released from the National Archives on Wednesday, Lofgren said the panel has “not yet had a chance to look at it, but yes, the material is starting to flow in.”\n\nWednesday’s order could also send a signal to other witnesses that they have very little ability to challenge January 6-related subpoenas on executive privilege grounds, potentially opening the possibility for more former White House officials to testify.\n\nThe Supreme Court left unresolved key questions about an ex-President’s ability to claim executive privilege – claims that top advisers of Trump have used to refuse or to hold off on testifying to the House.\n\nCurrently, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is challenging subpoenas from the January 6 committee, in part because he said the questions about Trump’s ability to assert privilege in the investigation as a former President remain unsettled. He also faces a five-week-old criminal contempt referral from the House to the Justice Department, though the DOJ has not filed any criminal charges.\n\nThe DC Circuit’s opinion in the Trump case last month undermined some of Meadows’ arguments, but now the Supreme Court has scaled back the reach of that appellate opinion, saying that the DC Circuit’s discussion of his status as a former president is not binding precedent.\n\nKavanaugh statement\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, writing alone, said that he agreed with the court’s decision to reject Trump’s request, noting that the order was not based on Trump’s status as a former President.\n\nBut in a statement accompanying the court’s ruling, the Trump nominee said he didn’t agree with a suggestion by the appeals court that a former President may not invoke privilege over documents that occurred during his presidency.\n\n“I respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeals on that point,” Kavanaugh said. “A former president must be able to successfully invoke the Presidential communications privilege for communications that occurred during his Presidency even if the current President does not support the privilege claim,” he said.\n\nKavanaugh added, however, that to say that a former President can invoke privilege over such communications “does not mean that the privilege is absolute or cannot be overcome.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Katelyn Polantz Tierney Sneed", "Ariane De Vogue", "Katelyn Polantz", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/politics/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson/index.html", "title": "Ketanji Brown Jackson nominated as first Black woman to sit on ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court on Friday, setting in motion a historic confirmation process for the first Black woman to sit on the highest court in the nation.\n\n“Today, as we watch freedom and liberty under attack abroad, I’m here to fulfill my responsibilities under the Constitution, to preserve freedom and liberty here in the United States of America,” Biden said at the White House as he introduced Jackson.\n\n“For too long, our government, our courts haven’t looked like America,” Biden said. “I believe it’s time that we have a court that reflects the full talents and greatness of our nation with a nominee of extraordinary qualifications, and that we inspire all young people to believe that they can one day serve their country at the highest level.”\n\nSenate Democratic leaders hope to have a vote confirming Jackson to the court by mid-April.\n\nJackson, 51, currently sits on DC’s federal appellate court and had been considered the front-runner for the vacancy since Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement.\n\n“I must begin these very brief remarks by thanking God for delivering me to this point in my professional journey.

My mother and father, who have been married for 54 years, are at their home in Florida right now and I know that they could not be more proud.”\n\nRELATED: Republicans attack Biden Supreme Court pick as pawn of ‘radical Left’\n\nThough historic, the choice of Jackson will not change the ideological makeup of the court. The court currently has six conservative justices and three liberal justices – and the retiring Breyer comes from the liberal camp. The court is already poised to continue its turn toward the right with high-profile cases and rulings expected from the court in the coming months on abortion, gun control and religious liberty issues.\n\nBiden met with Jackson for her Supreme Court interview earlier this month, a senior administration official said, in a meeting that the White House managed to keep secret. Jackson received and accepted Biden’s offer in a call Thursday night, a source familiar with the decision told CNN, yet was present for DC Circuit Court hearings Friday morning.\n\nThe White House considered delaying the announcement, given the Russian invasion in Ukraine, but believed it was critical to get the second phase of the confirmation process moving, the official said.\n\nChance to excite Democrats\n\nBiden’s pick is a chance for him to fire up a Democratic base that is less excited to vote in this year’s midterm elections than it has been over the past several election cycles. The selection gives Biden a chance to deliver on one of his top campaign promises, and he’ll hope that the Black voters who were crucial to his election win will see this as a return on their investment.\n\nWhile Jackson was the leading contender, the official said the President gave “considerable weight” to other finalists, including Judge J. Michelle Childs and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger.\n\nFor more than a year, the President had familiarized himself with her work, reading many of her opinions and other writings, along with those of other contenders.\n\nBut Biden was also was impressed by her life story, including her rise from federal public defender to federal appellate judge – and her upbringing as the daughter of two public school teachers and administrators.\n\n“Her parents grew up with segregation, but never gave up hope that their children would enjoy the true promise of America,” the President said Friday.\n\n“Her opinions are always carefully reasoned, tethered to precedent and demonstrate respect for how the law impacts everyday people,” Biden said. “It doesn’t mean she puts her thumb on the scale of justice one way or the other. But she understands the broader impacts of her decisions, whether it’s cases addressing the rights of workers or government service. She cares about making sure that our democracy works for the American people. She listens. She looks people in the eye – lawyers, defendants victims and families – and she strives ensure that everyone understands why she made a decision, what the law is, and what it means to them. She strives to be fair, to get it right, to do justice. That’s something all of us should remember. And it’s something I’ve thought about throughout this process.”\n\nNomination process\n\nEyes will now turn to the Senate, where Biden’s Democratic Party holds the thinnest possible majority. The President will hope that Jackson can garner bipartisan support, but Democrats will need all their members in Washington to ensure her confirmation.\n\nUnlike for most major pieces of legislation, Democrats do not need Republican help to confirm a Supreme Court justice and can do it with their 50 votes and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking a deadlock. When Jackson was confirmed to the appellate bench, she had the support of three Republican senators. Harris, whom the White House said played an active role in the selection process, was working the phones Friday morning, calling senators as the news was reported.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has indicated that he wants to push a nominee through the process quickly, using Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s Senate proceedings as a model for Jackson’s confirmation timeline. And Sen. Dick Durbin, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN recently that he expects to have a hearing within a few weeks of the selection.\n\nThe goal of the leadership is to have the nominee confirmed by the April 11 recess.\n\nJackson is expected to have her courtesy meetings with senators next week, according to a person familiar with the plans. It’s common for Supreme Court nominees to meet with the leadership on both sides, then members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nBiden first committed to nominating a Black female US Supreme Court justice when he was running for president in 2020. On a debate stage in South Carolina, Biden argued that his push to make “sure there’s a Black woman on the Supreme Court” was rooted in an effort to “get everyone represented.”\n\nThough there are currently no Black women serving in the United States Senate in a position to vote for the nominee, Black female House members, all Democrats, applauded Biden for “fulfilling his campaign promise.”\n\nCongressional Black Caucus chair Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio said the nomination is “something that I will remember forever.” Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey said Jackson will “bring a new, necessary perspective” to the court and “will also be an inspiration to Black women and girls everywhere.” Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida said she “never dreamed that, in my lifetime, I would see a Black woman nominated” to the Supreme Court.\n\nPersonal history\n\nJackson was born in the nation’s capital but grew up in the Miami area. She was a member of the debate team at Miami Palmetto Senior High School before earning both her undergraduate degree and law degree at Harvard.\n\nShe also previously clerked for Breyer and served as a federal public defender in Washington – an experience that her backers say is fitting, given Biden’s commitment to putting more public defenders on the federal bench. She was also a commissioner on the US Sentencing Commission and served on the federal district court in DC, as an appointee of President Barack Obama, before Biden elevated her to the DC Circuit last year.\n\nJackson thanked Breyer in her speech.\n\n“Justice Breyer, in particular, not only gave me the greatest job that any young lawyer could ever hope to have, but he also exemplified every day, in every way, that a Supreme Court justice can perform at the highest level of skill and integrity, while also being guided by civility, grace, pragmatism and generosity of spirit,” Jackson said. “Justice Breyer, the members of the Senate will decide if I fill your seat, but please know that I could never fill your shoes.”\n\nAt her 2021 confirmation hearing for the appellate court, she connected her family’s professions – her parents worked in public schools – to her decision to work as a public defender.\n\n“I come from a background of public service. My parents were in public service, my brother was a police officer and (was) in the military,” she said at the time, “and being in the public defenders’ office felt very much like the opportunity to help with my skills and talents.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, is a relative by marriage and introduced her at the 2013 hearing for her district court nomination.\n\nRyan also congratulated Jackson Friday.\n\n“Janna and I are incredibly happy for Ketanji and her entire family. Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji’s intellect, for her character, and for her integrity, is unequivocal,” Ryan said.\n\nAt the White House Friday, Jackson noted that an uncle was previously given a life sentence on drug charges, an issue of which she hasn’t previously spoken about publicly.\n\n“You may have read that I have one uncle who got caught up in the drug trade and received a life sentence,” Jackson said. “That is true, but law enforcement also runs in my family. In addition to my brother, I had two uncles who served decades as police officers, one of whom became the police chief in my hometown of Miami, Florida.”\n\nIn 2008, when Jackson was in private practice and well before she became a judge, Jackson referred her uncle’s file to WilmerHale, a law firm that handles numerous clemency petitions, according to a spokesperson for the firm.\n\nThe firm submitted the petition on Brown’s behalf on October 7, 2014, and Obama commuted his sentence on November 22, 2016. According to the firm, Jackson had “no further involvement in the matter” after making the referral. Jackson’s chambers said she would decline comment on the issue.\n\n“I am standing here today by the grace of God as testament to the love and support that I’ve received from my family,” Jackson added Friday.\n\nRepublicans signal potential opposition\n\nAs a judge in DC – where some of the most politically charged cases are filed – Jackson’s issued notable rulings touching on Congress’ ability to investigate the White House. As a district court judge, she wrote a 2019 opinion siding with House lawmakers who sought the testimony of then-White House Counsel Don McGahn. Last year, she was on the unanimous circuit panel that ordered disclosure of certain Trump White House documents to the House January 6 committee.\n\nAs a judge, some other notable cases she has in her record are a 2018 case brought federal employee unions where she blocked parts of executive orders issued by Trump, and a case where she ruled against Trump policies that expand the categories of non-citizens who could be subject to expedited removal procedures without being able to appear before a judge.\n\nJackson penned more than 500 opinions in the eight years she spent on the district court.\n\nThough Biden has said that he’d pick a nominee with bipartisan appeal who is “worthy of Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence and decency,” his decision to name the first Black woman to the court is already facing Republican opposition. Several Senate Republicans have told CNN they disagreed with the President’s decision to name a Black woman to the court rather than judging a nominee squarely on their credentials, even though Ronald Reagan and Trump both said they’d name a female justice to the Supreme Court when they were on the campaign trail.\n\nEven before Biden nominated Jackson, GOP senators and Senate candidates were already concluding that she’d be far left, throwing cold water on the names floated as being on Biden’s potential short list and calling for a slow confirmation process. Still, Republicans are limited in their ability to block a Supreme Court nominee, and Jackson may win the support of some GOP senators.\n\nSens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine all voted for Jackson last summer when she was confirmed as a circuit court judge on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the second most important court in the country.\n\nCollins touted Jackson’s “impressive academic and legal credentials” following the announcement. But Graham, who had expressed support for Childs, suggested Jackson does not have his approval, saying in a tweet that the choice of Jackson “means the radical Left has won President Biden over yet again.” Graham added that he expects a “respectful but interesting hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called for a “rigorous, exhaustive” review of Jackson in a statement.\n\n“I also understand Judge Jackson was “impressive academic and legal credentials the favored choice of far-left dark-money groups that have spent years attacking the legitimacy and structure of the Court itself,” McConnell said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments, reaction and background information.", "authors": ["Jake Tapper Ariane De Vogue Jeff Zeleny Betsy Klein Maegan Vazquez", "Jake Tapper", "Ariane De Vogue", "Jeff Zeleny", "Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/07/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-senate-vote-latest/index.html", "title": "Senate confirms Ketanji Brown Jackson to be first Black woman to sit ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Senate confirmed President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson on Thursday in a historic vote that paves the way for her to become the first Black woman to serve on the highest court in the nation.\n\nThe tally was 53-47, with Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joining Democrats to vote in favor.\n\nThe confirmation represents a significant victory for Democrats, which they can tout as bipartisan, and a way for the President to deliver on a campaign promise at a time when the US faces a number of challenges at home and abroad, including soaring inflation and the crisis in Ukraine. Democrats broke out into loud applause and cheers when the vote was gaveled.\n\nThe vote also marks a major milestone for the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary, although Jackson’s confirmation won’t change the ideological balance of the court.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman to serve as vice president, presided over the chamber during the historic vote in her capacity as president of the Senate.\n\nJackson will be sworn in after Justice Stephen Breyer retires sometime this summer.\n\nUntil then, she will remain in her current position on the US Court of Appeals, a White House official told CNN. “Judge Jackson will continue to recuse from all cases on the DC Circuit as she has since the President nominated her,” the official said.\n\nSenate Democrats and the White House have continually highlighted the historic nature of the nomination.\n\nAhead of the final vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the moment a “joyous, momentous, groundbreaking day.”\n\nSchumer went on to say, “In the 233-year history of the Supreme Court, never, never has a Black woman held the title of Justice. Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the first and I believe the first of more to come.”\n\nBiden had said during his 2020 presidential campaign that he was committed to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court if elected.\n\nAt one point during her Senate confirmation hearings, Jackson became visibly emotional and could be seen wiping away tears as Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is one of only three Black senators, talked about her path to the nomination and the obstacles she has had to overcome.\n\n“My parents grew up in a time in this country in which Black children and White children were not allowed to go to school together,” Jackson told Booker after the senator asked what values her parents had impressed upon her. “They taught me hard work. They taught me perseverance. They taught me that anything is possible in this great country.”\n\nScenes from the confirmation vote\n\nThe Senate chamber was packed for the vote, with most senators seated at their desks for the historic occasion.\n\nThe vote initially proceeded quickly as a result, but was later held open for some time when it became clear that GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the only senator who had not voted. The chamber waited for him to arrive and vote before it was gaveled closed.\n\nWhile the chamber waited for Paul, lawmakers and people in the gallery grew restless. Several Democratic senators began chatting with a group of Congressional Black Caucus members who had come over from the House to watch the vote.\n\nGOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma voted from the GOP cloakroom because they weren’t wearing ties as is required by Senate rules on the floor. Graham was in a quarter zip and a blazer. He stuck his thumb down and receded into the cloakroom to cast a no vote.\n\nConfirmation process\n\nThe nomination cleared a key hurdle earlier Thursday when the Senate took a procedural vote to limit debate and break a filibuster, setting up the final confirmation vote.\n\nThroughout the Senate vetting process, Senate Democrats have praised Jackson as an exceptionally qualified, trail-blazing nominee whose depth and breadth of experience, including as a federal public defender, would add a valuable and unique perspective to the bench.\n\nJackson was also a commissioner on the US Sentencing Commission and served on the federal district court in DC, as an appointee of former President Barack Obama, before Biden elevated her to the DC Circuit last year.\n\nConfirmation hearings featured sharp and critical questioning from Republicans as many attempted to portray Jackson as weak on crime and, in a highly-charged line of attack, too lenient in sentencing child pornography cases. Jackson and Democrats forcefully pushed back on the accusations.\n\nJackson stressed her concern for public safety and the rule of law, as a judge and an American. And she argued that she approaches her work in an impartial way and that personal opinions do not play a role.\n\nRepublicans called for civility and respect during the confirmation hearings, arguing that Democrats did not extend that to Brett Kavanaugh during his vetting process before the Senate. Kavanaugh faced a sexual assault allegation, which he vehemently denied.\n\nDemocrats, however, argued that Republicans crossed a line by distorting Jackson’s record, particularly with respect to sentencing in child pornography-related cases.\n\nA CNN review of the material in question shows that Jackson mostly followed common judicial sentencing practices in these kinds of cases.\n\nJackson wins GOP support\n\nIn announcing that they would support the nomination, Murkowski and Collins both expressed concern over what they described as the politicization of the Supreme Court confirmation process.\n\nMurkowski said that she rejects “the corrosive politicization of the review process for Supreme Court nominees, which, on both sides of the aisle, is growing worse and more detached from reality by the year” in her statement.\n\nCollins said in her statement, “No matter where you fall on the ideological spectrum, anyone who has watched several of the last Supreme Court confirmation hearings would reach the conclusion that the process is broken.”\n\n“It used to be common for Senators to give the President, regardless of political party, considerable deference in the choice of a nominee,” Collins said.\n\nThe Maine Republican said that approach “instilled confidence in the independence and the integrity of the judiciary and helped keep the Court above the political fray,” adding, “this is the approach that I plan to continue to use for Supreme Court nominations because it runs counter to the disturbing trend of politicizing the judicial nomination process.”\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Clare Foran Ted Barrett Ali Zaslav", "Clare Foran", "Ted Barrett", "Ali Zaslav"], "publish_date": "2022/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/politics/gallery/white-house-weddings-history/index.html", "title": "A history of White House weddings | CNN Politics", "text": "1.

The Biden administration has said it was prepared for the authority to end and had put in place precautions to guard against confusion at the border and any potential surge of migrants.\n\nIn its order, the court also agreed to take up the states’ appeal this term. The court said it would hear arguments on the case during its argument session that begins in February 2023.\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan said they’d deny the application, but they did not explain their thinking. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch also dissented and explained his thinking in an order joined by liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nGorsuch said he does “not discount the States’ concerns” about border security. But Gorsuch noted that Title 42 was put in place to combat Covid-19, and “the current border crisis is not a Covid crisis.”\n\n“Courts should not be in the business of perpetuating administrative edicts designed for one emergency only because elected officials have failed to address a different emergency,” Gorsuch wrote.\n\nSince March 2020, Title 42 has allowed US border agents to immediately turn away migrants who have crossed the southern border in the name of Covid-19 prevention.\n\nImmigrant advocates and public health experts have long denounced use of the public health authority along the US southern border, arguing it was an inappropriate pretext for barring migrants from entering the United States. In nearly three years, the authority has been used over 2 million times to turn migrants away, according to US Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAt the border, migrants have been waiting in encampments in Mexico for months, anticipating the end of the authority so they can make their claim of asylum in the US. Immigrant advocates have tried to disseminate updates and information to migrants, but desperation has grown, especially as temperatures drop.\n\nEl Paso, Texas, has been at the center of the crisis as thousands of migrants have crossed that region of the border. The city opened government-run shelters at its convention center, hotels and several unused schools to care for migrants, though some have still had to sleep on the streets in cold temperatures.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been putting in place a plan for the end of the authority that includes surging resources to the border, targeting smugglers and working with international partners.\n\n“We will continue to manage the border, but we do so within the constraints of a decades-old immigration system that everyone agrees is broken. We need Congress to pass the comprehensive immigration reform legislation President Biden proposed the day he took office,” the department said in a statement.\n\nThe White House said it would comply with the order.\n\n“Today’s order gives Republicans in Congress plenty of time to move past political finger-pointing and join their Democratic colleagues in solving the challenge at our border by passing the comprehensive reform measures and delivering the additional funds for border security that President Biden has requested,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\nAsked to respond to the ruling, President Joe Biden told reporters his administration will enforce the Trump-era immigration restriction, even if he thinks it’s past time to revoke it.\n\n“The court is not going to decide until June apparently, and in the meantime we have to enforce it – but I think it’s overdue,” Biden told reporters on the White House South Lawn.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar acknowledged to the Supreme Court last week that returning to traditional protocols along the border will pose a challenge, but said there’s no longer a basis to keep the Covid-era rules in place.\n\n“The government in no way seeks to minimize the seriousness of that problem. But the solution to that immigration problem cannot be to extend indefinitely a public-health measure that all now acknowledge has outlived its public-health justification,” Prelogar wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.\n\nLawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union, who are representing families subject to Title 42, had in arguments underscored the dangers faced by asylum seekers subject to the authority and sent back to Mexico.\n\nLee Gelernt, the lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the case, told CNN in a statement that they are “deeply disappointed” by the ruling, but will continue to fight to end the policy.\n\n“We are deeply disappointed for all the desperate asylum seekers who will continue to suffer because of Title 42, but we will continue fighting to eventually end the policy,” Gelernt said.\n\nSteve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, called the order “procedurally bizarre.”\n\n“This order is procedurally bizarre, in that it agrees to a request to freeze a district court ruling by states that weren’t even parties to that decision solely to decide whether they should have been allowed to intervene and defend that ruling on appeal,” Vladeck said. “Title 42 aside, that has enormous potential consequences for the ability of states going forward to fight to keep the current president from rescinding policies of her predecessors.”\n\nThe GOP-led states had argued that they’d be harmed by the lifting of the authority because of the influx of migrants entering the United States.\n\n“The border crisis that Respondents bizarrely and eagerly seek to cause would also inflict enormous harms to the States,” a filing, submitted last Wednesday, reads.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Priscilla Alvarez", "Ariane De Vogue", "Priscilla Alvarez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/politics/white-house-border-title-42/index.html", "title": "Biden administration finalizing its plans as it braces for end of Title ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration is finalizing its response to Wednesday’s anticipated end of a Trump-era border restriction known as Title 42, according to officials familiar with the planning.\n\nOfficials said the plans, which may include the revival of a controversial asylum policy, could be announced within the coming days. But it appears the administration may end up with some more time to consider its plans after Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday issued a temporary hold on the order lifting the policy.\n\nA surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border in recent days has already raised alarm among Democrats and Republicans, some of whom have called on the White House to find a way to extend the restrictions, and has placed immigration – a politically precarious issue – back at the forefront. The White House has said the administration is bound by a court order.\n\nBut Roberts paused that order in response to an emergency appeal by the leaders of several GOP-led states. In a brief order, signaling that the court wants to act quickly, Roberts asked the Biden administration to respond by 5 p.m. ET Tuesday to the appeal.\n\nThe brief order from Roberts does not necessarily reflect the final outcome of the case, but it means the policy that allows officials to swiftly expel migrants at US borders will stay in effect at least until the justices decide the emergency application.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement following Roberts’ order that “as required by the Supreme Court’s administrative stay order, the Title 42 public health order will remain in effect at this time and individuals who attempt to enter the United States unlawfully will continue to be expelled to Mexico,” adding: “While this stage of the litigation proceeds, we will continue our preparations to manage the border in a safe, orderly, and humane way when the Title 42 public health order lifts.”\n\nFor weeks, the administration has been bracing for the end of Title 42 that was invoked at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and allowed officials to turn away migrants encountered at the US southern border. The lifting of the authority means a return to traditional protocols at a time of mass migration in the Western Hemisphere, stressing already-overwhelmed resources.\n\nOfficials have been weighing policies to try to stem the flow of migrants heading to the US southern border. Among them is a proposal that would bar migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border if they could have received refuge in another country they passed through, mirroring Trump-era asylum limits. The proposal is being finalized and is expected to be announced this week prior to the lifting of Title 42.\n\nThe new rules are likely to generate outcry and legal challenges from immigration advocates, who have pushed for an end to Title 42. Enacting a version of a Trump-era asylum rule could also pose political challenges for Biden, who vowed to enact a more humane immigration policy than his predecessor.\n\nThe Biden administration tried to wind down the Title 42 program earlier this year, but a coalition of mostly GOP-led states – in a separate case filed in Louisiana – successfully sued to block the Department of Homeland Security from ending enforcement.\n\nTitle 42 becomes a top White House concern\n\nInside the White House, the pause on the termination of Title 42 will not have any effect on what have been intensive behind-the-scenes preparations for the end of the authority, according to a White House official.\n\nWhile the Department of Homeland Security serves as the lead agency on the issue and has said their preparations continue, the looming end of the pandemic-era public health authority has been a central focus for the last several weeks inside the West Wing, with senior White House officials playing a significant role in the internal debates over policy options to address an expected surge of migrants at the border.\n\nThere are no plans to slow the ongoing effort, the official said, given the possibility any delay is only brief in nature. “We’ve always been aware of the role the courts have in this process, but it’s not something that changes the approach,” the official said.\n\nOfficials will also continue to press Congress to approve the inclusion of more than $3 billion in additional funding to assist their preparations at the border as part of the omnibus funding bill.\n\nThe looming end of Title 42 has been a source of heightened concern, particularly as numbers of migrants attempting to cross the border increased in the days ahead of the order’s expiration. Biden has come under fire from border-state lawmakers for his handling of the matter. His advisers have convened meetings almost daily to weigh their options.\n\nIn formulating their plans, officials have sought ways to bring order to the situation at the border, where images of long lines and crowded holding facilities have generated outcry. Their goal has been to deter migrants from crossing illegally while still preserving their ability to legally apply for asylum.\n\nWhether the new asylum policies can deter migrants from attempting to enter the US remains unclear. Large numbers of migrants have already arrived at the Mexico side of the border awaiting Title 42’s expiration. Administration officials have said many of them are being exploited by smugglers offering false promises related to the end of Title 42, and officials are doubtful those practices would be altered by new rules.\n\nAnd economic and safety conditions in the countries the migrants are leaving remain unstable and have worsened since the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is actively monitoring intelligence to try to determine how many migrants are moving toward the US southern border and where they’re heading, though human smuggling organizations often influence pathways.\n\n“It’s a cat and mouse game,” one senior Homeland Security official said.\n\nAn intelligence memo, from the Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis, circulated last week underscored the concern within the administration over an increase in arrivals, citing human smuggling organizations adjusting their methods and how migrants may shift their calculus.\n\nOn the US side of the border, officials have been striking contracts to move migrants to other border stations for processing to avoid overcrowded facilities, the senior DHS official said. The administration has also identified cities within the United States to move migrants for processing – an idea that’s long been considered among officials – but no decision has been made yet.\n\nIn a document outlining border security preparedness, DHS broke down its six-pillar plan, which was released in the spring and has since been updated. It includes scaling up ground and air transportation capabilities to transport migrants for processing and remove them, leaning on a CBP One mobile application to process asylum seekers, and increasing referrals for prosecutions for repeat border crossers, the document said.\n\nWhite House pushes back against criticism\n\nThe White House has pushed back on calls for the administration to find a way to extend the controversial public health authority, saying it is bound by court orders.\n\nImages from the border have raised alarm among elected officials, some of whom have publicly questioned the Biden administration’s readiness and preparations to handle the expected influx of people trying to enter the United States.\n\nOver the weekend, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia called on Biden to “use every bit of power he has as an executive to find a way or ask for an extension.”\n\nThe White House official declined to elaborate when asked whether Biden has the authority to secure such an extension.\n\nThe White House has insisted that the end of Title 42 does not mean that the US border will suddenly be open to all – and that there are existing processes in place to process the claims of asylum-seekers. The administration has also pointed to monthslong work that the Department of Homeland Security has been doing to prepare for the increase in migrants arriving at the border, while also calling on Congress to approve extra funding that the administration has requested to manage the situation.\n\nOver the weekend, a federal law enforcement source familiar with daily operations in South Texas told CNN that border authorities in the Rio Grande Valley have encountered between 900 and 1,200 migrants daily during the past two weeks.\n\nBiden to discuss migration with Ecuadorian president\n\nMigration in the Western Hemisphere will be discussed between Biden and Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso on Monday, according to a White House official, who stressed that Ecuador has been “setting an important example” on the issue.\n\nThe two leaders will also follow up on several issues discussed during this year’s Summit of the Americas, including an agreement to increase security cooperation to tackle drug-related gang violence, the official said.\n\nOver the summer, against the backdrop of the Summit of the Americas, Biden announced a regional partnership to address mass migration in the Western Hemisphere. The agreement, dubbed the Los Angeles declaration, was signed onto by multiple Western Hemisphere nations.\n\nUnder the declaration, governments are expected to commit to expanding temporary worker programs, bolstering legal pathways like refugee resettlement and family reunification, providing support to countries hosting large migrant populations, and cracking down on human smuggling networks.\n\nBiden and Lasso will revisit those efforts Monday, the official said.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated when the Biden administration announced its intention to end Title 42.

I will select a nominee worthy of Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence and decency. While I’ve been studying candidates’ backgrounds and writings, I’ve made no decision except one: the person I will nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity. And that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court,” Biden said.\n\nA short list of potential nominees had been circulating Washington well before Breyer’s retirement plans became public, and officials in the White House Counsel’s office built files on various candidates in anticipation of a potential vacancy. Biden said he will make his choice by the end of February.\n\nThe White House is stacked with officials deeply familiar with the confirmation process, starting with Biden himself – who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee – as well as White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has experience both at the White House counsel’s office and working for the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nWith Democrats holding the narrowest of majorities in the upper chamber, Biden will have to choose someone who can safely get 50 votes in the Senate (Vice President Kamala Harris could provide the tie-breaking vote if the Senate is split on the nomination). In addition to the vote count, Biden also has to keep an eye on the calendar. Senate Republicans are likely to retake the chamber in this year’s midterms and have already signaled they would block a Biden nominee to the Supreme Court. It typically takes two to three months for a president to see his nominee confirmed by the Senate once he or she is named. The most recent justice, however, was confirmed in just a month and a half, as Senate Republicans rushed to get Justice Amy Coney Barrett approved before the 2020 election.\n\nGiven the disappointments that have been recently dealt to the progressives under the Biden administration – between the congressional demise of the President’s Build Back Better proposal and his failure to find a way forward on voting rights legislation – Biden’s choice for the Supreme Court gives him the opportunity to reinvigorate the democratic base. If his nominee is confirmed, Biden will secure a much-needed victory for his administration.\n\nHere are potential nominees who have been on observers’ short list.\n\nDC Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nKetanji Brown Jackson, nominee to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit, testifies during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. Tom Williams/Pool/Getty Images\n\nBiden has already elevated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson once, appointing her last year to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is considered the second-most powerful federal court in the country. Previously, the 51-year-old judge served on the federal district court in DC. Because of that appellate appointment, she’s already been through a vetting process that included an interview with the President himself. Fittingly, she clerked for Breyer and holds degrees from Harvard and Harvard Law School. She also served as an assistant federal public defender, making her a prime example of the Biden’s White House focus on appointing judges with backgrounds that are outside the typical prosecutor and Big Law box.\n\nAs a judge, Jackson has ruled on high profile cases including the Don McGahn congressional subpoena lawsuit (where, as a district court, she ordered the former Trump White House counsel to comply with the House’s subpoena). As an appellate judge, she signed on to the recent opinion ordering the disclosure of Trump White House documents being sought by the House January 6 committee. The Supreme Court declined Trump’s request that it reverse the decision in an order this month allowing the documents to be released.\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger\n\nIn this Dec. 22, 2014, photo, Leondra Kruger addresses the Commission of Judicial Appointments during her confirmation hearing to the California Supreme Court in San Francisco. S. Todd Rogers/Pool/AP\n\nKruger, now 45, was the youngest person to be appointed to the California Supreme Court when then-Gov. Jerry Brown nominated her in 2014.\n\nKruger is intimately familiar with the Supreme Court having worked as a clerk for the late Justice John Paul Stevens and served as acting deputy solicitor general in the Obama administration. While in the Solicitor General’s office, she argued 12 cases in front of the Supreme Court representing the government. At the Justice Department, she also earned the Attorney General’s Award for Exceptional Service, the department’s highest award for employee performance, in 2013 and 2014.\n\nAt the California Supreme Court, she has authored notable opinions on the 4th Amendment – holding that law enforcement could not search a woman’s purse without a warrant after she declined to provide a driver’s license – and upholding a California law that requires law enforcement to collect DNA samples as well as fingerprints from all persons arrested for or convicted of felony offenses.\n\nThough she is said to be well-liked among the alumni of the Solicitor General’s office, she has not yet received the thorough vetting that other potential nominees have gone through.\n\nSouth Carolina US District Court Judge J.

Michael Luttig and Thomas B. Griffith, Republican appointees, who both sat on federal appeals courts. Their messages run contrary to some heated comments made by Republicans on the hill after President Joe Biden announced his pick last Friday and could serve to lower the temperature on the hearings that are expected this spring.\n\nThe White House is in the midst of a carefully orchestrated rollout of the President’s nominee and will welcome the endorsement. While every White House tries to present their nominees in the best possible light – this White House composed of veterans of the confirmation process – has been particularly comprehensive. Biden served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Vice President Kamala Harris also sat on the committee more recently during confirmation battles. Ron Klain – a veteran of confirmation fights – serves as Biden’s chief of staff and White House counsel Dana Remus is a former clerk to Justice Samuel Alito.\n\nEven before the President made his choice, White House surrogates reached out to outside groups urging them to be ready to support the nomination. Remus, who usually stays behind the scenes, conducted a video call with supporters hours after the nomination was announced. She also warned them there would be attacks and some would be “disheartening,” but she urged them to support Jackson.\n\nBurck, in his statement, stressed that Jackson should receive bipartisan support and her nomination should not trigger an angry confirmation fight.\n\n“As a Republican, I hope Judge Jackson will garner substantial bipartisan support because she deserves to be judged on her personal merits which overwhelmingly weigh in favor of confirmation,” Burck said.\n\n“Too often over the past several decades, Supreme Court nominations have descended into bitter partisan conflict and we lose sight of the most important qualities in a jurist,” he added. “Judge Jackson presents an opportunity to refocus on what matters – the nominee’s integrity, qualifications and commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law.” He called Jackson “as good as they come” and said she was “far from an ideologue.”\n\nBurck, now Co-Managing partner of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, met Jackson when they clerked together during the 1999- 2000 Supreme Court term. He clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy while she worked for Justice Stephen Breyer. He also worked as special counsel and deputy counsel to then-President George W. Bush, working for Brett Kavanaugh who was also serving in the administration.\n\nIn 2018, when Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court, Bush hired Burck, in his capacity as a private attorney, to review Kavanaugh’s White House records that were housed in the Bush library. During the Mueller investigation, Burck represented McGahn, as well as former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and former White House strategist Stephen Bannon.\n\nWhen the Trump White House sought to block McGahn’s testimony to the House of Representatives in its impeachment probe it was Jackson, then sitting on the US District Court for the District of Columbia, who ruled against the Department of Justice in the case. In that dispute, McGahn was represented by the Justice Department, not by his private attorney Burck.\n\nBurck has supported Jackson previously. Last April, Burck signed a letter with other Supreme Court clerks who served in the 1999 term supporting Jackson’s nomination to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The clerks noted that while “our positions and judicial philosophy vary widely” they wrote to support Jackson because of her “intellect, character and experience.”\n\nAppeals court judges back Jackson\n\nMonday, two former appellate court judges endorsed Jackson’s nomination.\n\nFormer federal Judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee to the Court of Appeals for DC Circuit who served alongside Jackson, offered his full-throated endorsement of her nomination to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a Saturday letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin and top Republican member, Sen. Chuck Grassley, Griffith said Jackson was “immensely qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.”\n\n“Presidents should be entitled to their nominees provided certain levels of competence and qualifications are met,” Griffith wrote. “Judge Jackson clearly exceeds that bar.”\n\nHe added: “Judge Jackson and I occasionally differed on the best outcome of a given case. And in one important case involving the former President, I was one of two judges on a three-judge panel who voted to overturn her decision. However, I have always respected her careful approach, extraordinary judicial understanding, and collegial manner, three indispensable traits for success as a Justice on the Supreme Court.”\n\nGriffith, the former general counsel of Brigham Young University, is an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah is among the Senate Republicans the White House is reaching out to in hopes of winning his support for her confirmation.\n\nThe Deseret News and Axios were first to report the letter.\n\nAnd in a statement first obtained by CNN, Luttig, a retired federal judge who is considered a luminary in conservative legal circles, enthusiastically endorsed Jackson, describing her as a candidate who is “eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.”\n\nLuttig played a critical role in the heated fight over the certification of the 2020 presidential election. In a series of tweets, he provided legal ammunition to help former Vice President Mike Pence defy then-President Trump’s attempt to overturn the election.\n\nNoting the court’s 6-3 conservative majority, Luttig called on Republicans “to confirm Judge Jackson out of political calculation, even if they cannot bring themselves to confirm her out of political magnanimity, and then proudly take the deserved credit for their part in elevating the first black female jurist to the Supreme Court of the United States.”", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump announces a White House bid for 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign. Brad Parscale will not be involved in the 2024 operation. It has also been updated to correctly characterize former President Donald Trump’s position on paper ballots, fix the spelling of Justin Caporale and reflect additional developments.", "authors": ["Gaborr Kristen Holmes Veronica Stracqualursi", "Kristen Holmes", "Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}]}
