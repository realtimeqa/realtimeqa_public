(Another state, Nebraska, banned TikTok from state devices in 2020.) Last week, the state of Indiana announced two lawsuits against TikTok accusing the Chinese-owned platform of misrepresenting its approach to age-appropriate content and data security.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of 15 attorneys general wrote to Apple and Google calling on the app store owners to stop listing TikTok as being appropriate for teens, over claims about the prevalence of mature content on the app.\n\nThe mounting pressure on TikTok has come from states led by Republican governors who have highlighted fears that TikTok users’ personal information could wind up in the hands of the Chinese government, thanks to that country’s national security laws.\n\n“South Dakota will have no part in the intelligence gathering operations of nations who hate us,” said Gov. Kristi Noem in announcing the new state policy.\n\nThe flurry of announcements has drawn sharp contrasts with activity at the federal level. Since 2020, when the Trump administration threatened a ban over national security concerns, TikTok and the US government have been negotiating a deal that may allow the short-form video app to keep serving US users.\n\nThere have been years of closed-door negotiations between TikTok and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an opaque multi-agency panel charged with reviewing foreign investment deals for national security risks. One US official has suggested that CFIUS ban TikTok from the United States outright.\n\nWhatever outcome the negotiations produce is still expected to have big implications for TikTok and its users. But the federal government’s continued inaction on that front, as well as recent reports of delays in the negotiations, has left the door open for states to step in as the app has gained immense popularity among US users.\n\nIn taking these steps, the states are unlikely to disrupt how everyday users access the app. But these recent announcements could nonetheless add to political pressure for tougher action at the federal level, which could in turn be more disruptive to users.\n\n“It feels like the states are stepping into the DC vacuum on TikTok,” said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at the investment research firm Cowen Inc. “I don’t see those new restrictions disrupting TikTok that much, but it probably adds a bit of pressure for Washington to ‘do something’ on TikTok one way or another.”\n\nThe Treasury Department, CFIUS’s chair agency, said in a statement that the panel is “committed to taking all necessary actions within its authority to safeguard US national security” and declined to comment on TikTok specifically. The White House also declined to comment.\n\n“We’re disappointed that so many states are jumping on the bandwagon to enact policies based on unfounded, politically charged falsehoods about TikTok,” Hilary McQuaide, a spokesperson for TikTok, said in a statement provided to CNN. “It’s unfortunate that the many state agencies, offices, and universities on TikTok in those states will no longer be able to use it to build communities and connect with constituents.”\n\nA long wait for federal action\n\nUS lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China’s national security laws could force TikTok — or its parent, ByteDance — to hand over the personal data of its US users. Security experts have said that the data could allow China to identify intelligence opportunities or to seek to influence US users through disinformation campaigns.\n\nTikTok has said it is working with the US government to address all reasonable national security concerns. It has also taken independent steps to isolate US user data from other parts of its business. Last week, amid the pushback from the states, the company said it would restructure its US-focused content moderation, policy and legal teams under US Data Security, a special group within the company that’s led by US-based officials and walled off organizationally from other teams focused on the rest of the world.\n\nUnder the change, content policies TikTok develops for its global audience must be “reviewed and approved” for US audiences by TikTok’s US Data Security group, to ensure the policies meet the standards of any deal approved by CFIUS, the company said. Content moderation involving US users’ data, TikTok said, will be handled by a US-specific trust and safety team within the US Digital Security group, and not by its global trust and safety team.\n\nTikTok has previously acknowledged that employees based in China can currently access user data, and has also declined to commit to stop sending US user information to China.\n\nHarry Broadman, who leads the CFIUS practice at Berkeley Research Group, a consulting firm, said he isn’t privy to the details of the negotiation between TikTok and the US government but called the continued lack of resolution “a mystery.”\n\n“I’m a little bit mystified why it’s taking so long for CFIUS to deal with this problem,” he said. “There must be some issue that’s going on.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and a bipartisan pair of congressmen in the House, introduced new legislation that aims to ban TikTok from operating in the United States. In a statement, Rubio expressed frustration with the lack of action at the federal level.\n\n“The federal government has yet to take a single meaningful action to protect American users from the threat of TikTok,” Rubio said. “There is no more time to waste on meaningless negotiations with a CCP-puppet company. It is time to ban Beijing-controlled TikTok for good.”\n\nAn opening for Republican governors\n\nWith no deal yet between CFIUS and TikTok, the states led by Republican officials appear to have capitalized on the moment from a “tactical, political, winning-points perspective,” Broadman said.\n\n“I don’t think it reflects a deeper suspicion on the part of the Republicans versus Democrats,” he said. “I think it’s more of a tactical question.”\n\nSince government agencies have clear authority to manage their own devices in ways they see fit, barring public employees from using the app represents low-hanging fruit (and easy headlines), Broadman said.\n\nIn some ways, the states that have restricted TikTok are following the federal government’s lead. Already, the US military, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security have prohibited their own employees from using TikTok.\n\nStates such as Maryland also enacted their TikTok bans on government devices as part of a wider crackdown on Chinese-linked products and services, making the announcement more about China than about TikTok individually. Maryland’s directive also applies to Huawei and ZTE, which the US government has also taken steps to block from US markets.\n\nAt least one state is going even further. Last week, Indiana sued TikTok in two separate cases. One claimed that TikTok lures children onto the platform by falsely claiming it is appropriate for users between 13 and 17 years old; the other claims TikTok has “deceived” consumers about whether user data is sufficiently protected from Chinese government access. TikTok has declined to comment on the litigation but has said “the safety, privacy and security of our community is our top priority.”\n\nSome states could also choose to begin advancing meaningful legislation that effectively limits TikTok on private devices, Broadman said, in a move that would more directly impact TikTok’s American user base. But such a move would likely introduce other issues about the regulation of commerce, and potentially result in legal challenges.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/tech/tiktok-ban-users/index.html", "title": "TikTok might be too big to ban, no matter what lawmakers say | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn July 2020, the same month former President Donald Trump said he would ban TikTok in the United States, Callie Goodwin of Columbia, South Carolina, posted her first video on the app to promote the small business she had started out of her garage during the pandemic.\n\nInspired by a neighbor dropping off some brownies and a handwritten note for her while she was in quarantine, Goodwin decided to launch a pre-stamped greeting cards company called Sparks of Joy Co. A few months later, a TikTok influencer with some two million followers shared one of Goodwin’s cards on her account and Goodwin saw her business take off.\n\nGoodwin, now 28, told CNN that more than 90% of her orders currently come from people who discover her business through TikTok. “If it were to get banned, I would see business plummeting,” Goodwin told CNN. “I would lose most of my sales.”\n\nFor much of the past two years, talk of an outright TikTok ban seemed to recede. TikTok outlasted the Trump administration and only saw its popularity continue to grow. It was the top downloaded app in the United States last year, and remains the top downloaded app year-to-date in 2022, according to data from analytics firm Sensor Tower. In the process, TikTok, which said it had 100 million US users as of 2020, became even more central to American culture and to livelihoods of influencers and business owners like Goodwin.\n\nBut suddenly, the future of TikTok in the United States appears more uncertain than at any point since July 2020. A growing number of Republican governors have recently announced bans on TikTok for state employees on government devices, including from multiple states on Thursday alone. State attorneys general and a Republican commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission have each pressured Apple and Google to take tougher measures with the app. And a trio of US lawmakers led by Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, introduced a bill earlier this week that once again seeks to block TikTok in the US due to the parent company’s base in China.\n\nCallie Goodwin launched a small business shortly before Trump first said he would ban the app. Two years later, she said a TikTok ban would cause her to \"lose most of my sales.\" Courtesy Callie Goodwin\n\nThe renewed political scrutiny comes amid a broader, ongoing reckoning over the impact that TikTok and other social media platforms have on their youngest users. There have been recent debates over whether TikTok’s content is age-appropriate for teens as well as fears that its algorithms may lead users to potentially harmful subject matter, including posts related to suicide and eating disorders.\n\nAt the same time, TikTok has come under fire in Washington for its ties to China through its parent company. The criticism ramped up earlier this year after a Buzzfeed News report said some US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China, and cited one employee who allegedly said, “Everything is seen in China.” TikTok, for its part, has confirmed US user data can be accessed by some employees in China.\n\nTikTok has been negotiating for years with the US government and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) on a potential deal that addresses the lingering national security concerns and allows the app to continue operating in the United States. Recently, there have been reports of delays in those negotiations.\n\nThe tremendous reach of TikTok may only make it harder to ban the service outright, some national security experts say. Even some TikTok critics have hedged on whether a ban is the right approach. Sen. Josh Hawley, who authored a bill to ban TikTok from US government devices, said this week he would be “fine” if the US government and TikTok reached a deal to safeguard US users’ data. “But if they don’t do that,” Hawley said, “then I think we’re going to have to look at more stringent measures.”\n\nAs lawmakers have renewed calls for tougher action to be taken with the app, some of its users who have built their livelihoods and found a sense of community on the app say they can’t imagine an America without it.\n\nTikTok now drives culinary habits (including a 200% jump in Feta sales at one grocery store after a baked pasta dish went viral); countless fashion and beauty crazes (from “skin cycling” to “glazed donut nails”), and propels new and old music (including the 1980s song “Break My Stride”) to the top of streaming charts. A significant percentage of US politicians campaigned on the app ahead of the midterm elections. And legacy news organizations like the 176-year-old Associated Press have recently joined TikTok to reach new audiences.\n\nKahlil Greene. Laurie Gomez\n\n“So many people, myself included, are always on TikTok,” Kahlil Greene, 22, of New Haven, Connecticut, told CNN. “That’s where we get our entertainment from, our news from, our musical taste from, our social inside jokes we make with friends come from memes that started on TikTok.”\n\nGreene, who is known as the “Gen Z historian” across social media, has amassed more than 580,000 followers on TikTok by documenting social and cultural issues. Greene’s following on TikTok even garnered the attention of the Biden administration. Greene was among the handful of TikTokers who were recently invited to a White House press briefing on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“So much of our culture and lives are driven by TikTok now that it’s not just something you can rip away easily,” he said.\n\n“Too big to fail”\n\nTikTok has simultaneously tried to ease concerns about its impact on Americans and their data while also working to expand its footprint in the country.\n\nThe company, which is owned by Beijing-based Bytedance, has committed to moving its US user data to Oracle’s cloud platform and to taking other steps to isolate US user data from other parts of its business. TikTok said last week that it would restructure its US-focused content moderation, policy and legal teams under a special group within the company led by US-based officials and walled off organizationally from other teams focused on the rest of the world.\n\nIn response to the bill calling for a ban, a TikTok spokesperson said: “It’s troubling that rather than encouraging the Administration to conclude its national security review of TikTok, some members of Congress have decided to push for a politically-motivated ban that will do nothing to advance the national security of the United States.”\n\nA growing number of state and federal lawmakers are attempting to crack down on TikTok, including some who are calling for an outright ban. Tom Brenner/Reuters\n\n“We will continue to brief members of Congress on the plans that have been developed under the oversight of our country’s top national security agencies—plans that we are well underway in implementing—to further secure our platform in the United States,” the statement added.\n\nThe company is also stressing its broad popularity. “TikTok is loved by millions of Americans who use the platform to learn, grow their businesses, and connect with creative content that brings them joy,” the spokesperson said.\n\nNow, the company is taking steps to keep growing its reach. At a time when major tech giants including Meta and Twitter are slashing staff, TikTok is still hiring American engineers. TikTok also appears be to taking aim at a chunk of Amazon’s e-commerce empire by seeking to build out its own warehousing network in the United States, a flurry of recent job postings indicates.\n\nThe challenge for the federal government “is it’s almost like TikTok is too big to fail,” said Rick Sofield, a partner at Vinson & Elkins L.L.P., who focuses on national security reviews, export controls and economic sanctions. “I think their minds are made up that ByteDance owning TikTok is a national security concern – the reason that we’ve been hung up is it’s too big to fail, and they’re trying to figure out a soft landing.”\n\n“There’s a whole lot of things I think that would have to happen first, before there’s a ban,” he added.\n\nA livelihood and a lifeline\n\nFor Adrianna Wise, 30, TikTok hasn’t just been “essential” for building her bakery in Columbus, Ohio, it’s also been a critical tool that lets her reach young Black and brown people in her community and share knowledge and tips on how to build a business.\n\n“I see the impact that I’m having when I go out into the community and people are like, ‘Oh my gosh, I follow you TikTok,’” Wise, who is co-founder of Coco’s Confectionary Kitchen, told CNN. “I had a little girl a few weeks ago tell me, ‘It was just so cool because you have hair like me, and you’re on TikTok and you have so many views!’”\n\nAdrianna Wise says TikTok allows her to reach young Black and brown people in her community. \"A lot of them are learning the skills and the tools they need to be able to create and cultivate their own businesses on platforms like TikTok, if not exclusively on TikTok,\" she said. Courtesy Adrianna Wise\n\n“A lot of them are learning the skills and the tools they need to be able to create and cultivate their own businesses on platforms like TikTok, if not exclusively on TikTok,” she said.\n\nGoodwin, the Sparks of Joy Co. founder, similarly says a TikTok ban would not only be devastating for her business, but also for her sense of community. She candidly documents her mental health journey via TikTok and has built a support system via the platform. “My best friend in the world right now, I met on TikTok,” she said. “We’re practically family at this point.”\n\n“TikTok is way more than just dancing videos or lip-syncing videos. It really has so many different niches, and you can find community in any of them,” Goodwin told CNN. “So if it were to go away, it would be it would be a great loss.”\n\nDespite the hullaballoo, Greene, the Gen Z historian, says he is not particularly worried about a potential TikTok ban – even though he acknowledges it could cause a hit to his income and sponsorship deals. If anything, he says the folks in government calling for a ban don’t seem to be aware of how central it is to the lives of people in his generation.\n\nHootie Hurley, 23, a Los Angeles-based full-time creator with more than 1.3 million followers on TikTok, told CNN that he now makes most of his income through his TikTok following. Courtesy Hootie Hurley\n\n“Generally speaking, the side of the argument that’s like super against TikTok, super alarmist about what it means, hasn’t done a great job communicating that message,” he said. Greene views “data privacy concerns” as “more of a buzzword than a tangible fear.”\n\n“We grew up in a generation where our data was always public,” he said, “and we always put our lives on social media.”\n\nHootie Hurley, 23, a Los Angeles-based full-time creator with more than 1.3 million followers on TikTok, told CNN that he now makes most of his income through his TikTok following. While a ban would be “very scary” for him and his livelihood,” Hurley said he and other TikTok creators are more focused on entertaining their audience than stressing about it – especially after weathering the first ban threats back in 2020.\n\n“If the government ever did ban it,” he said, “everybody would actually be very, very surprised.”", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/tech/tiktok-universities/index.html", "title": "Some universities are now restricting TikTok access on campus ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA small but growing number of universities are now blocking access to TikTok on school-owned devices or WiFi networks, in the latest sign of a widening crackdown on the popular short-form video app.\n\nThe University of Oklahoma and Auburn University in Alabama have each said they will restrict student and faculty access to TikTok, in order to comply with recent moves from the governors in their respective states to ban TikTok on government-issued devices.

FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress in November that he is “extremely concerned” China could weaponize data collected through the app.\n\nHigher education institutions are being cautious because they could lose public funding or be sued if there's a majority security breach, said Vanessa Dennen, professor of instructional systems and learning technologies at Florida State University, which has no ban.\n\n\"Personnel data, student data, our research data – the protection of data is something that we're highly concerned with,\" Dennen said. \"There seems to be sufficient reasonable concern from a data security issue or standpoint and it's not unusual for universities to have this kind of a concern.\"\n\nDo TikTok bans work?\n\nThe restrictions do not erase TikTok from campus, Dennen said: Users can still access the app on personal devices using cellular data.\n\nUniversity of Texas at Austin professors Natalie Stroud and Samuel Woolley questioned whether the ban will have the intended security effect given staff are able to access university systems on their personal devices as well.\n\n\"It's unclear to me what the specific threat is of potential data gathered by the Chinese government,\" Woolley added.\n\nHow will the bans affect students and faculty?\n\nFor Stroud and Woolley, part of the university's Center for Media Engagement, the ban means they'll no longer be able to share information with students through the center's TikTok channel or share videos in classes. They said the ban will keep them from being able to effectively teach and research disinformation, misinformation and other forms of propaganda spreading on TikTok.\n\n\"If you're not able to relate to them with a communication medium that many of them use frequently, that's a significant handicap,\" Stroud said.\n\nUniversity faculty and staff also use the app to recruit students and engage with the school community and athletic fans.\n\n\"It isn't just the research,\" Dennen said. \"It is the marketing of the universities, of the institutions that would be affected.\"\n\nSixty-seven percent of U.S. teenagers say they use TikTok, according to the Pew Research Center. But Dennen said she doesn't believe the bans will have a major impact on most students.\n\n\"People will have their workarounds, and their workarounds are not going to be tremendously difficult or cumbersome,\" Dennen said.\n\nUT Austin professors:Why the TikTok ban needs university exemptions\n\nHow has TikTok responded to the bans?\n\nThe company is \"disappointed\" by the recent state-level bans, Jamal Brown, a spokesperson for TikTok, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"We're disappointed that so many states are jumping on the political bandwagon to enact policies that will do nothing to advance cybersecurity in their states and are based on unfounded falsehoods about TikTok,\" Brown said. \"We're especially sorry to see the unintended consequences of these rushed policies beginning to impact universities' ability to share information, recruit students, and build communities around athletic teams, student groups, campus publications, and more.\"\n\nDig deeper\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nContact Breaking News Reporter N'dea Yancey-Bragg at nyanceybra@gannett.com or follow her on Twitter @NdeaYanceyBragg", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/28/tiktok-ban-federal-devices-biden/11363733002/", "title": "TikTok ban on federal devices: Biden admin gives 30 days for ...", "text": "The White House has announced it's giving federal agencies 30 days to remove TikTok from all government-issued devices.\n\nMonday's move comes as the popular Chinese-owned social media app faces increased scrutiny in Washington and in states across the country over security concerns – with critics claiming that the Chinese government could use TikTok to gain access to private user data or spread misinformation.\n\nTikTok is already not allowed on White House devices. Other federal agencies, including the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, have similar restrictions in place.\n\nNow, remaining federal agencies will follow.

Mike McCaul, R-Texas. McCaul has been a vocal critic of TikTok, saying the app is being used by the Chinese Communist Party to \"manipulate and monitor its users while it gobbles up Americans’ data to be used for their malign activities.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union is among those that oppose the bill. In a press release Monday, the ACLU said such a ban would violate First Amendment rights and noted the U.S. government \"can’t ban a social media platform simply because the app is from a Chinese company.\"\n\nIn addition to the federal restrictions on TikTok, more than half of U.S. states have issued full or partial bans for state-issued devices.\n\nMore:South Dakota Gov.

Kay Ivey announced Monday. Citing concerns over the app's data collection and Chinese ownership, Ivey said keeping state employees off the app will protect Alabama's IT infrastructure from potential cyber security threats.\n\nPressure against the app and its owner, Bytedance, a Chinese technology company, has been mounting in 2022. Federal lawmakers on Tuesday introduced bipartisan legislation to ban the app for all users nationwide over fears that the app is being used to spy on U.S. residents or is censoring their content.\n\nAlabama is at least the ninth state to restrict government employees from accessing the site, joining other Republican-led states Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Texas, Nebraska and, on Tuesday, Iowa.\n\nThe string of bans was prompted by warnings from federal officials last month. Calling the app a national security threat, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he was \"extremely concerned\" that data collected through the app could be weaponized by Chinese officials.\n\nAccording to Wray, application programming interfaces, or APIs, on the app could be used to control data collection or the site's recommendation algorithm, possibly allowing the Chinese government to compromise Americans' personal devices.\n\n\"Disturbingly, TikTok harvests vast amounts of data from its users, much of which has no legitimate connection to the app's supposed purpose of video sharing,\" Ivey said in a memorandum posted to Twitter Monday night. \"Use of TikTok involving state IT infrastructure thus creates an unacceptable vulnerability to Chinese infiltration operations.\"\n\nLeaders from Alabama and other states celebrated the decision and thanked Ivey.\n\n\"This is how we fight back against Beijing — great work, @GovernorKayIvey,\" South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said in reply to Ivey's announcement. Noem, a Republican, issued an executive order on Nov. 29 blocking the download of TikTok from state devices used by South Dakota government employees, contractors and agencies.\n\n\"Thank you, @GovernorKayIvey!\" wrote Republican Sen.-elect Katie Britt. Britt called TikTok a \"Trojan horse that steals data to give to the Chinese Communist Party\" in a September Tweet.\n\nTikTok has pushed back against its growing reputation as a security threat, including recently creating a \"Trust & Safety Team\" to oversee compliance, safety strategies and moderation for content with U.S. users' data. In a statement shared with the Montgomery Advertiser on Wednesday, TikTok spokesperson Jamal Brown said the decision will keep state agencies and universities from connecting with their constituents.\n\n\"We're disappointed that so many states are jumping on the bandwagon to enact policies based on unfounded, politically charged falsehoods about TikTok. It is unfortunate that the many state agencies, offices, and universities on TikTok in those states will no longer be able to use it to build communities and connect with constituents,\" Brown said.\n\nThe decision will also affect educational institutions throughout the state, keeping students from accessing TikTok on school Wi-Fi networks. While many educators view the app as a nuisance to classroom instruction, others see it as an engaging way to teach students in a format they're comfortable with, according to reporting from Education Week.\n\nSome state entities also currently maintain TikTok accounts, including two of the state's flagship universities, Auburn University and the University of Alabama. It's unclear if the decision will prohibit state entities from operating a TikTok account. In South Dakota, Noem's ban prompted the state's tourism department to delete its account. A message was sent to Ivey's office for clarification Wednesday morning.\n\nThe ban provides exceptions for law enforcement and other \"essential governmental uses of the app.\"\n\nEvan Mealins is the justice reporter for the Montgomery Advertiser.

This spurred more recalls of inclined sleepers, including approximately 700,000 Kids II rocking sleepers and about 24,000 sleepers made by Dorel Juvenile Group.\n\nGarber, who is a consumer watchdog for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG) in Philadelphia, used his personal story to launch an investigation into the continued use of recalled sleepers at daycares.\n\nU.S. PIRG and Kids in Danger found through a survey of 376 day cares that one in 10 indicated they were using at least one of the recalled inclined sleepers.\n\nBabies should always sleep on a flat surface, alone on their backs and in a crib that is free of blankets, bedding and toys. This is the \"safe sleep\" practice recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nBut for sleep-deprived and desperate caregivers, products that look like they could induce sleep are tempting, even if they don't meet the \"safe sleep\" recommendations.\n\n'I was shocked'\n\nGarber said his wife Sara Landis alerted him when she saw a Rock ‘n Play sleeper in the infant room at their son's child care facility in south Philadelphia.\n\nBecause of Garber's watchdog background, he immediately took action.\n\n\"I was shocked. So I went in the next day to talk to the teacher and when I mentioned it was recalled, she was confused,\" Garber told USA TODAY.\n\nWhile the teacher knew of a warning the company had issued urging proper use of the Rock 'n Play sleepers, she was unaware of the recall, Garber said.\n\nWithin a few hours, the day care removed the product, but the dad wondered if he had just been \"unlucky or if there was a larger problem here.\"\n\nHe turned to his work.\n\n'There was just this information gap'\n\nU.S. PIRG and Kids in Danger sent the survey to more than 600 child care facilities in Georgia, Texas and Wisconsin between June 20 and July 10, asking if they were using any of the recalled inclined sleepers in their day cares.\n\nThey did not tell the day cares the sleepers were recalled, but identified themselves as a product research group.\n\nGarber said they followed up with the day cares still using the sleepers and the majority of them said they were unaware of the recall.\n\n\"There was just this information gap,\" Garber said, noting that the U.S. recall system relies on media distribution and product registration cards to notify consumers.\n\n\"So most people don’t hear about recalls, even when they are as big and as well-publicized as this one (the Rock 'n Play recall),\" he said.\n\nA call for action\n\nU.S. PIRG and Kids and Danger are pushing for states, the CPSC and the makers of recalled products to do a better job.\n\nThe two safety groups are calling for states to pass laws prohibiting day cares from using recalled products. They're asking the CPSC to ensure day cares are automatically notified of recalled children's products and they want manufacturers like Mattel and Kids II to \"double down\" on their efforts to reach consumers who purchased the recalled products.\n\nGarber said companies should be using all the information they are gathering about consumers such as their past purchases and shopping history to warn them of recalled products.\n\n\"The ads I get for my son are pretty accurate about what I'm looking for and what I might need or want. Why can't they use that same ability to tell people you might have a dangerous product?\" Garber said.\n\nFisher-Price, CPSC respond\n\nFisher-Price, the maker of Rock 'n Play, said the company has taken several steps to make sure the sleepers are no longer being used.\n\n\"One of the best ways for consumers to ensure they receive notice of a product recall is to register their products when they are purchased or at any time after that, which takes only a few minutes,\" Fisher-Price general manager Chuck Scothon said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY.\n\n\"When we announce a product recall, we immediately notify everyone who has registered their product, and provide comprehensive information regarding the recall process, including call center telephone numbers.\"\n\nFor the Rock 'n Play recall, Scothon said the company also issued a joint press release with the CPSC; created a website translated into nine languages to centralize information for consumers; published recall information on Fisher-Price websites, Facebook and Twitter pages, and on the business' online customer service center; and reached out to online marketplaces notifying them of the recall, urging them to take action to prevent unlawful resales.\n\nThe CPSC, the U.S. government agency that regulates the safety of consumer products, also suggests consumers register products and encourages day cares and parents to sign up to receive recall announcements.\n\n\"Child care centers should never use recalled children's products,\" Patty Davis, Deputy Director of Communications and Press Secretary for the CPSC, said an emailed statement to USA TODAY.\n\nDavis said that thousands of child care providers already receive recall notifications and some states require day cares to sign up for them. The CPSC also sends recall announcements to state agencies that license day cares and asks recalling companies to contact all known purchasers, including child care providers.\n\n\"Parents should also raise the issue of recalled products and these recalled inclined sleepers with their day care providers,\" Davis said.\n\nDespite these efforts made by Fisher-Price and the CPSC, some parents said they still planned to use the Rock n' Play sleepers.\n\nWhat parents can do\n\nParents should remember that babies are safest with a flat, bare sleeping surface. Parents should not expect babies to sleep through the night immediately.\n\n\"We all have these hopes that our infants are going to sleep long periods of time right from the get-go, but that is not how babies are programmed to work. So waking up every two hours is a normal newborn thing that we shouldn't be trying to overcome,\" pediatrician Dr. Elizabeth Murray previously told USA Today in response to the recalls.\n\nShe recommends other sleep-saving strategies like making sure one partner is sleeping when the baby sleeps and getting babies into a bedtime routine. Before purchasing baby sleep products, Murray said to check with reliable sources like pediatricians for recommendations.\n\nGarber said parents should sign up for product recall alerts on the CPSC website and should talk with their day care operators about how the facility stays up-to-date on recalled products and what their process is for removing them.\n\n\"Sparking that conversation can help them put systems into place,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2022/03/22/pfizer-blood-pressure-drug-recall/7136489001/", "title": "Pfizer recall 2022: Blood pressure drugs recalled for nitrosamine", "text": "Pfizer is recalling multiple blood pressure medications due to elevated levels of nitrosamine, which can increase the risk of cancer.\n\nThe company said it is voluntarily recalling six lots of Accuretic tablets that it distributed, one lot of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and four lots of quinapril HCl/ hydrochlorothiazide tablets, because the level of nitrosamine was above the acceptable daily intake.\n\nNitrosamines are common in water and foods, including cured and grilled meats, dairy products and vegetables, Pfizer said in its recall notice.\n\n\"Everyone is exposed to some level of nitrosamines.

The recall includes all units available for sale online and in stores, she said.\n\n“We’re committed to the safety and quality of our products so we contacted the Consumer Product Safety Commission and voluntarily recalled the product and stopped sales when we discovered the issue,\" Cornell said.\n\nAn additional 8,800 ceiling fans were sold in Canada, according to the recall.\n\nPredicted pandemic exodus:Homeowners aren't fleeing cities in droves despite COVID-19\n\nWant to retire comfortably?

Yet, as recently as Dec. 8, several of the toys were still being sold by a range of retailers, including Facebook Marketplace and eBay.\n\nIt is illegal to sell recalled products, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, an independent government agency.\n\n\"Any banned or recalled product offered for sale represents a hazard for consumers, which we take very seriously,'' Pamela Springs, spokesperson for the CPSC, said in an email. \"While we can’t quantify the breadth of the problem, suffice it to say even one banned or recalled toy for sale is one too many.\"\n\nToy recalls: Which toys have been recalled?

In a letter sent to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in July, CPSC Chairman Alex Hoehn-Saric noted that roughly 75% of the agency's requests this fiscal year for online sellers to remove banned or recalled products were made to Facebook Marketplace.\n\nThough Hoehn-Saric added that Facebook's parent company, Meta, \"worked well'' with the agency to address those requests, his letter asked the company to provide more detail on how it deals with such listings.\n\nMeta responded to Hoehn-Saric's questions, but \"unfortunately, we continue to see recalled and banned products being sold on Facebook Marketplace and other e-commerce platforms,'' Springs said. \"Large platforms have the resources to better protect the safety of their customers and stop the listing of violative products. They can and should do more.\"\n\nMeta says it is making an effort.\n\n“We are heavily invested in our approach to safety and have over 40,000 people across Meta working on safety and security, which includes teams proactively enforcing our commerce policies that prohibit the sale of recalled goods,'' the company said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"Like other platforms where people can buy and sell goods, there are instances of people knowingly or unknowingly selling recalled goods on Marketplace. We take this issue seriously and when we find listings that violate our rules, we remove them.”\n\nRecalled toys on eBay\n\nFacebook Marketplace is not the only third-party website selling recalled toys weeks or months after they were found to be potentially dangerous.\n\nOn June 2, 2022, Communicorp recalled 600,000 units of Aflac 6-inch plush promotional ducks because of their risk of exposing users to phthalates – chemicals used to make plastics more durable – and lead, both of which are toxic if ingested by children and can cause health problems.\n\nAt least four types of those recalled duck toys were being sold by users on eBay in early December, USA TODAY found.\n\nGary Fullmer, senior director of marketplace policies at eBay, says the company is \"working to improve our processes'' and make sure its technology can pick up items that should not be listed. But he adds that it is easier to ferret out products with a UPC code or part number than a more generic item like a promotional plush toy such as the Aflac duck.\n\nThere are 1.7 billion listings on eBay, according to statistics provided by the company. Last year, the company was able to block more than 7 million dangerous items before they were listed, and through their follow-up reviews, they removed another 375 million products either because they were unsafe or violated their policies.\n\n“The protection of our customers and stopping unsafe products is a top priority for us,” Fullmer said. “We take this really seriously, and we're using the latest AI, we are deploying multiple hundreds of expert investigators and spending significant resources.”\n\nRecalled toy on-site is not for sale\n\nSome other sellers said that while recalled toys might have been listed on their sites, the items have been flagged and would be unavailable for purchase.\n\nEpoch Everlasting Play recalled 8,200 units of My First Activity Desk on Aug. 25 because of “entanglement and entrapment hazards.”\n\nDanny Givens, owner of the Lynchburg, Va.-based toy and book store Givens Books & Little Dickens, says that though the activity desk was on his store's site and he had one in stock, he was aware of the recall notice and it would not be sold to a customer either online or in person.\n\n“If we were to process the order, it would say ... it’s not sellable due to this recall,'' said Givens, adding that he also puts a note in his store's system so he doesn't make future purchases of recalled products.\n\nGivens added that the store typically might have only two or three toys in stock that have been recalled in a year.\n\n“We would be getting in trouble if we were selling recalled items,’’ says Givens, whose business has been operating for 45 years. “We’re pretty careful about it.’’\n\nAn estimated 206,400 toy-related injuries were treated in U.S. hospital emergency departments in 2021, according to a CPSC report published last month. More than 7 out of 10 of those victims were children 14 years old or younger, and the head region was the part of the body associated with the largest number of injuries.\n\nWhat should consumers do?\n\nThe CPSC advises consumers shopping online to visit its website, CPSC.gov, to find out whether a product has been recalled and to sign up for notifications.\n\nMeta, meanwhile, says that if you have a question about whether a product you're purchasing or selling has been pulled off the market, check the manufacturer's website or the site of the agency that regulates such items.\n\nAlso, shoppers who believe a listed product violates Meta's rules should click on the three dots in the listing's upper right-hand corner to make a report.\n\nSearch our recalled toys database by type of toy and brand\n\nIf you cannot see a data search tool below, click here.\n\nYour life in data: See crucial databases that can help you make everyday decisions", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2022/03/10/abbott-baby-formula-recall-columbus-ohio-parents/9379841002/", "title": "Parents struggle to find infant formula following Abbott product recall", "text": "Shelves of formula in the baby aisle at grocery stores are looking a little bare these days.\n\nJust ask Franklinton mom Malerie Wood, who has struggled to find Enfamil for her 1-month-old daughter.\n\n“There's a shortage,” said Wood, 22. “Like, there's no stores that have them.

More than 10 of them have been hospitalized.\n\nIn the chia outbreak, the illnesses have been tracedto two products: a powder made from sprouted, ground chia seeds and a separate product made from sprouted chia and flax seeds, sold by Health Matters America.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reports of 21 people in 12 states falling ill from the chia products. An additional 34 infections have been reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n\nThe ground chia powder was also distributed to and sold by Navitas Naturals, in Novato, Calif., which expanded an existing recall of goods containing the sprouted chia powder on June 6.\n\nBoth Health Matters and Navitas issued recall notices via the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nOne of its customers was Williams-Sonoma, which sold an Omega 3 Smoothie Mixer that contained the chia powder.\n\nThe sprouted chia powder is used as a gluten-free flour and is also sprinkled on breakfast cereal and other foods.\n\nGluten-free products have become a health craze in the past few years, with one in three American adults saying they've tried to cut down on grains such as wheat, barley and rye, according to the consumer marketing research group NPD.\n\nThose grains contain a protein called gluten. About one in 133 Americas has an autoimmune disorder called celiac disease, which means they cannot digest gluten, according to the University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center.\n\nThree different strains of salmonella have been linked to the sprouted seed powder.\n\nIt's one of two ongoing \"sproutbreaks\" in the nation.\n\nA second, linked to sprouted clover, has sickened 17 people with E. coli O121 in five states. Almost half of those sickened have been hospitalized.\n\nThe clover sprout outbreak was traced to contaminated raw clover sprouts produced by Evergreen Fresh Sprouts of Moyie Springs, Idaho.\n\nSome of the problems FDA inspectors found at the Idaho sprout plant included:\n\n• Two employees using tennis rackets with scratches, chips, frayed plastic and sponge-type handles to scoop mung bean sprouts from a harvester. The same rackets were used the following day during alfalfa sprout harvesting.\n\n• An employee using a pitchfork with visible corroded metal and rough welds to transfer mung bean sprouts into plastic tubs.\n\nE. coli O121 can cause bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Most people recover within a week, but in some cases it can result in kidney failure and death.\n\nSalmonella symptoms can include fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. It can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, elderly people and others with weakened immune systems.\n\nThe recalled chia powder was used in products that were available for purchase in many retail stores nationwide and online, according to the CDC.\n\nMost Americas know chia seeds as the tiny brown seeds that can be made into a paste and applied to ceramic figures so they grow a green coat of sprouts.\n\nThose same seeds are now being sprouted, dried and ground into a powder that is added to gluten-free products.\n\nThe seeds were imported into Canada where they were sprouted and milled into powder. The powder was then packaged in California.\n\nSprouts are considered high-risk products because the moisture and warmth of the sprouting process allows any microbes that might be on the seeds to grow.\n\nIn the case of the chia powder, when the spouts were dried and ground, the salmonella microbes remained.\n\nChia powder is a popular addition to foods because it is high in proteins and antioxidants.\n\nThe CDC in Atlanta is recommending that consumers do not eat any of the recalled products containing chia.\n\nThere is concern that these products have a long shelf life and could still be in people's homes despite the recall.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/04/03/anti-allergy-epipen-recall-expands-us/99975666/", "title": "Anti-allergy EpiPen recall expands to US", "text": "Associated Press\n\nA recall of the emergency anti-allergy medicine EpiPen is expanding to the U.S. and other markets in North America, Europe, Asia and South America because the allergy shots may not work.\n\nThe notice issued Friday by Mylan N.V. expands upon warnings made earlier this month after two reports of the device failing.\n\nMylan didn't immediately respond to a question about how many devices are affected by the recall.

Earlier, the storm passed over Bangladesh’s Saint Martin’s Island, causing damage and injuring people, but turned away from the country’s shores before landfall.\n\nMyanmar’s military information office said the storm had damaged houses, electrical transformers, cellphone towers, boats and lampposts in Sittwe, Kyaukpyu, and Gwa townships. It said the storm also tore roofs off of sport buildings on the Coco Islands, about 264 miles southwest of the country’s largest city, Yangon.\n\nMore than 300,000 residents in Sittwe evacuated\n\nRakhine-based media reported that streets and basements of the houses in Sittwe’s low-lying areas were flooded, and that people were trapped in their houses and unable to communicate. Much of the area is cut off from telephone and internet service after high winds crumpled cellphone towers.\n\nMore than 4,000 of Sittwe’s 300,000 residents were evacuated to other cities and more than 20,000 people were sheltering in sturdy buildings such as monasteries, pagodas and schools located on the city’s highlands, said Tin Nyein Oo, who is volunteering in shelters in Sittwe.\n\nLin Lin, the chairman of a local charitable foundation, said earlier there was not enough food in the shelters in Sittwe after more people arrived than expected.\n\nTiton Mitra, the U.N. Development Program representative in Myanmar, tweeted: “Mocha has made landfall. 2m people at risk. Damage and losses are expected to be extensive. We are ready to respond and will need unhindered access to all affected communities.”\n\nHomes destroyed, dozens injured, several deaths reported in Myanmar\n\nOn Sunday morning, several deaths caused by wind and rain were reported in Myanmar. A rescue team from the country’s eastern Shan state announced on its Facebook social media page that they had recovered the bodies of a couple who were buried when a landslide caused by heavy rain hit their house in Tachileik township. Local media reported that a man was crushed to death when a banyan tree fell on him in Pyin Oo Lwin township in the central Mandalay Region.\n\nAuthorities in the Bangladeshi city of Cox’s Bazar, which was in the storm’s predicted path, said earlier that they had evacuated hundreds of thousands of people, but by early afternoon it appeared that the storm would mostly miss the country as it veered east, said Azizur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department in Dhaka.\n\n“The level of risk has reduced to a great extent in our Bangladesh,” he said.\n\nStrong winds accompanied by rains continued in the Saint Martin’s Island in the Bay of Bengal in the afternoon, but feared tidal surges did not take place because the cyclone started crossing Bangladesh coast at low tide, Dhaka-based Jamuna TV station reported.\n\nAbout a dozen islanders were injured, while about 300 homes were either destroyed or damaged, leading Bengali-language Prothom Alo daily reported.

Scientists say powerful ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nResidents on the small resort island of Polillo are accustomed to severe weather – their island sits in the northeastern Philippines, on the edge of the Pacific Ocean where storms typically gather strength and turn into typhoons.\n\nBut even they were stunned by the intensity of Typhoon Noru, known locally as Typhoon Karding, that turned from a typhoon into a super typhoon in just six hours before hitting the region earlier this week.\n\n“We’re used to typhoons because we’re located where storms usually land,” said Armiel Azas Azul, 36, who owns the Sugod Beach and Food Park on the island, a bistro under palm trees where guests drink coconut juice in tiny thatched huts.\n\n“But everything is very unpredictable,” he said. “And (Noru) came very fast.”\n\nThe Philippines sees an average of 20 tropical storms each year, and while Noru didn’t inflict as much damage or loss of life as other typhoons in recent years, it stood out because it gained strength so quickly.\n\nExperts say rapidly developing typhoons are set to become much more common as the climate crisis fuels extreme weather events, and at the same time it will become harder to predict which storms will intensify and where they will track.\n\n“The challenge is accurately forecasting the intensity and how fast the categories may change, for example from just a low-pressure area intensifying into a tropical cyclone,” said Lourdes Tibig, a meteorologist and climatologist with the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities.\n\nThe same happened in the United States last week when Hurricane Ian turned from a Category 1 storm into a powerful Category 4 hurricane before making landfall along the southwestern coast of Florida on Wednesday.\n\nSuch rapid intensification, as it’s known in meteorological terms, creates challenges for residents, authorities and local emergency workers, including those in the Philippines, who increasingly have no choice but to prepare for the worst.\n\nTyphoon Noru made landfall in the Philippines in the evening on September 25 as the equivalent of a Category 4 storm. earth observatory/NASA\n\nFrom storm to super typhoon\n\nWhen Azul received warning that Typhoon Noru was approaching the Philippines last Saturday, he began his usual preparations of setting up his generator and tying down loose items.\n\nAt that stage, Noru was predicted to make landfall on Sunday as the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nBut as the storm grew closer, it strengthened into a super typhoon, the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane, making landfall Sunday evening with ferocious winds that lifted waves and lashed properties on the shoreline.\n\nTyphoon Noru toppled beach huts and coconut trees at Sugod Beach and Food Park on Polillo Island, Quezon province, in the Philippines. Courtesy Armiel\n\nAzul said his community was fortunate to have TV signal in the resort, and as soon as they found out that the typhoon was much stronger than forecast, his staff brought in all the bistro’s outdoor furniture and tied down the roofs of their guesthouses, while local government units evacuated people living near the shore.\n\n“But other parts of the island which don’t have internet connectivity and only rely on radio signals might not have got the message in time,” he said.\n\nThe typhoon damaged the resort town, as strong winds toppled beach huts and damaged nearby fishing cages.\n\nAzul added that coconut trees planted across the island about a decade ago after Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) battered the area had just started to bear fruit but were now completely wiped out.\n\n“We have to pick up the pieces, and rebuild again,” he said.\n\nTyphoon Noru lashed through Sugod Beach and Food Park on Polillo Island, Quezon province, in the Philippines. Courtesy Armiel\n\nOn the main island of Luzon, Noru left a trail of destruction in the province of Nueva Ecija, known as the “rice granary” of the country.\n\nRuel Ladrido, 46, a farmer owner in Laur, Nueva Ecija, said his rice fields were not flooded but strong winds damaged his crops.\n\n“It didn’t rain hard near me, but the winds uprooted some of my fields. It will affect our harvest this season, but what can we do? I don’t know the extent of the damage yet, but we’ll have to plant again,” he told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nHigh winds brought by Typhoon Noru flattened rice fields at the Ladrido Farm in Laur, Nueva Ecija ,in the Philippines. Courtesy Ruel B Ladrido\n\nAs of Friday, 12 people had died in the aftermath of Noru, including five rescue workers in Bulacan province, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).\n\nThe estimated damage to agriculture ballooned to some 3 billion Philippine pesos (about $51 million), affected 104,500 farmers and fisher folk, and damaged over 166,630 thousand hectares of crop land, according to the NDRRMC.\n\nHarder to predict\n\nThe Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, is already vulnerable to typhoons, but as sea levels rise and ocean temperatures warm, the storms expected to become more powerful, according to research published in 2018.\n\nThe study found that the stronger typhoons carry more moisture and track differently. They are also “aggravated by sea level rise, one of the most certain consequences of climate change.”\n\nA separate study published last year, by researchers at the Shenzhen Institute of Meteorological Innovation and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, found that typhoons in east and southeast Asia now last between two and nine hours longer and travel an average of 100 kilometers (62 miles) further inland than they did four decades ago. By the end of the century, they could have double the destructive power.\n\nAs such, it’ll become more difficult to forecast their track and predict ones that will quickly gain strength, or undergo rapid intensification – defined as when wind speeds increase by at least 35 miles per hour (56 kilometers per hour) in 24 hours or less.\n\nAlthough rare, the Philippines is no stranger to this phenomenon as 28% of all tropical cyclones that made landfall in the country dating back to 1951 underwent rapid intensification based on official data, according to Gerry Bagtasa, a professor with the University of the Philippines’ Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology.\n\nBagtasa said factors such as high moisture, warm ocean surface temperatures and low wind shear determine the scale of rapid intensification, but those weather readings “don’t have to be extraordinary in their values” to create rapid intensification.\n\nHe remarked that Typhoon Noru’s track across the Philippine Sea before making landfall was “just average for this season” and the wind shear – or the change of wind speed and strength with height in the atmosphere – was not extraordinarily low.\n\nBagtasa also said forecasters find it difficult to predict rapid intensification in the Pacific, because even though satellite monitoring has improved, there isn’t enough data to forecast worsening weather events.\n\n“There are also many unprecedented events happening recently worldwide, and since forecasters typically rely on their past experiences, new events can ‘throw off’ forecasts, so to speak,” he said.\n\nAlways bracing for the worst\n\nMirian Abadilla, a doctor and municipal health officer in Cabangan, Zambales province, on the Philippine island of Luzon, has been involved in her community’s disaster management response since 1991.\n\nShe says in that time, typhoons have become harder to forecast, and her community has no choice but to prepare for the worst.\n\n“The typhoons are definitely getting stronger because of climate change, and getting harder to predict,” she said. “But each time we get hit with a typhoon, we try to keep improving our disaster response – that’s the only way for us to stay alert.”\n\nShe said local governments held meetings as Typhoon Noru approached the coast to go over relief and rescue plans.\n\n“Filipinos are getting better at disaster preparedness … because we have to be,” she said.\n\nEvery province, city, municipality and barangay in the Philippines is required to follow national disaster risk reduction and management system under an act imposed in 2010 to address the island nation’s climate vulnerability.\n\nLocal governments must conduct preemptive evacuation based on the projected warnings from the national weather department, and it’s recommended they hold regular disaster rescue drills with responders and host briefing seminars for communities.\n\nResidents wade through waist-deep flood waters after Super Typhoon Noru, in San Miguel, Bulacan province, Philippines, September 26, 2022. Adrian Portugal/Reuters\n\nIn a press briefing on Monday, Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. praised local government units for “doing a good job” in explaining the situation to the local population as Noru approached, and for carrying out evacuations that may have prevented mass casualties.\n\nBut he also seemed to acknowledge the unpredictability of the storms that regularly threaten the Philippine coast, and the need to always be prepared.\n\n“I think we may have gotten lucky at least this time, a little bit,” Marcos Jr. said.", "authors": ["Kathleen Magramo Jan Camenzind Broomby", "Kathleen Magramo", "Jan Camenzind Broomby"], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/03/25/are-slaves-catching-the-fish-you-buy/70417482/", "title": "Are slaves catching the fish you buy? | 13newsnow.com"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/02/us/hurricane-ian-south-carolina-florida-repairs-sunday/index.html", "title": "Death toll soars to 76 in Florida after Hurricane Ian demolished ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nNewly homeless Floridians are struggling to restart their lives while rescuers scramble to find any remaining signs of life among the wreckage of Hurricane Ian.\n\nIn some cases, emergency workers are juggling both unimaginable tasks.\n\n“Some of the guys on Pine Island, they lost everything, but they’re doing what they can,” said emergency physician Dr. Ben Abo, who was preparing to join first responders on a rescue mission Sunday near decimated Sanibel Island and Pine Island.\n\n“It brings tears to my eye to see how hard they’re working.”\n\nBut because Hurricane Ian washed out Sanibel Island’s lone road to mainland Florida, “we’re helicoptering in and doing our grid search,” Abo said.\n\nMore than 1,100 people have been rescued from inundated parts of southwest and central Florida since Ian crashed into the state last week, Gov.

Andrew West/USA Today Network In pictures: Hurricane Ian slams the Southeast Prev Next\n\n‘Anybody who lives near water’ should get flood insurance, FEMA chief says\n\nHurricane Ian could be the most expensive storm in Florida’s history, devastating communities from the state’s western coast to inland cities like Orlando.\n\nWhile Florida has more flood insurance policies than any other state, only about 13% of homes there have flood insurance, and only 18% who live in the counties that had mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders in place ahead of Ian, according to an analysis by actuarial firm Milliman.\n\nOn Sunday, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Americans don’t have to live in a flood zone to benefit from flood insurance.\n\n“I think anybody who lives near water should certainly purchase flood insurance because it’s your No. 1 tool to help protect your family and your home after the storm,” FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said.\n\n“If you live near water or where it rains, it can certainly flood, and we have seen that (with) multiple storms this year.”\n\nShe said FEMA is in the process of updating its flood zone maps. “While in certain areas we require flood insurance, everybody has the ability to purchase flood insurance,” Criswell said\n\n“It is certainly in your best defense to help protect your property in the aftermath of any of these storms.”\n\nParts of Florida are now ‘unrecognizable’\n\nBut the most severe lashing took place in southwestern coastal cities like Fort Myers and Naples, where some neighborhoods were annihilated.\n\n“We’re flying and we’re operating in areas that are unrecognizable,” US Coast Guard Rear Adm. Brendan McPherson said.\n\n“There’s no street signs. They don’t look like they used to look like. Buildings that were once benchmarks in the community are no longer there.”\n\nMany of the Ian-related deaths have been reported in southwestern Florida’s Lee County, which includes Fort Myers and Sanibel Island, where at least 42 people died.\n\n‘Unfortunately, people did get complacent’\n\nLocal officials are facing criticism about whether mandatory evacuations in Lee County should have been issued sooner.\n\nOfficials there did not order evacuations until less than 24 hours before the storm made landfall, and a day after several neighboring counties issued their orders.\n\nDeSantis defended the timing of Lee County’s orders, saying they were given as soon as the storm’s projected path shifted south, putting the area in Ian’s crosshairs.\n\n“As soon as we saw the model shift northeast, we did exactly what we could to encourage people to” evacuate, Lee County Commissioner Kevin Ruane said Sunday.\n\n“I’m just disappointed that so many people didn’t go to shelters, because they’re open.”\n\nRuane called the reporting about a possible delay in issuing a mandatory evacuation “inaccurate.” He said the county did what it was supposed to do, without providing any evidence that the reporting was inaccurate.\n\n“I think the most important thing that most people need to understand is we opened up 15 shelters. During Irma there were 60,000 people in our shelters. There’s 4,000 people in the shelters right now,” Ruane said Sunday.\n\n“Unfortunately, people did get complacent … As far as I’m concerned, the shelters were open, they had the ability, they had all day Tuesday, they had a good part of Wednesday as the storm was coming down – they had the ability to (go to a shelter).”\n\nThe US Coast Guard made plans to evacuate people from Lee County’s Pine Island on Sunday, according to the Lee County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nIn addition to the 42 deaths in Lee County, Hurricane Ian also contributed to the deaths of 12 people in Charlotte County, eight in Collier County, five in Volusia County, three in Sarasota County, two in Manatee County, and one each in Polk, Lake, Hendry and Hillsborough counties, officials said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden continued to pledge federal support for Florida, saying Hurricane Ian is “likely to rank among the worst … in the nation’s history.”\n\nThe President and first lady Jill Biden are set to travel to Puerto Rico Monday to survey damage from Hurricane Fiona, then head to Florida on Wednesday.\n\n‘The houses … are all gone’\n\nMembers of mediccorps.org help evacuate Tom Acerbo on Pine Island, Florida, on Saturday. Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nAfter Hurricane Ian finished its devastating crawl over Florida, residents tried to venture back to their damaged or destroyed homes and sifted through debris.\n\nResidents from Sanibel and Captiva islands were cut off from mainland Florida after parts of a causeway were destroyed by the storm, leaving boats and helicopters as their only exit options.\n\nCivilian volunteers rushed to help residents on Sanibel, where some homes were obliterated.\n\nAndy Boyle was on Sanibel Island when the hurricane hit. He said he lost his home and two cars, but feels lucky to be alive.\n\n“A lot of people have very expensive, well-built homes on Sanibel, and they felt with their multi-million dollar homes built like fortresses, they would be fine,” he said.\n\nBoyle was riding out the storm at home when the dining room roof collapsed. “That’s when we started to get concerned,” he said.\n\nHe described waving down National Guard aircraft the next day outside his house, and seeing the scenes of devastation around the island.\n\n“When you go to the east end of the island, there’s just a lot of destruction. The houses surrounding the lighthouse are all gone. When you go to the west end of the island, the old restaurants up there, they’re all gone. The street going to Captiva is now a beach,” Boyle said.\n\nIn Naples, Hank DeWolf’s 4,000-pound boat dock was carried through a condo complex and is now in his neighbor’s yard. And the water brought someone’s car into his own backyard.

Our medical analyst ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWelcome to this year’s flu season.\n\nThis year’s flu strain has already begun spreading across the United States, according to new data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been at least 880,000 cases of influenza, nearly 7,000 hospitalizations and, tragically, 360 deaths from the flu this fall, including one pediatric death. Not since 2009, during the height of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic, have there been this many cases of influenza so early in the season.\n\nDespite these numbers, many people wonder if the flu is really that serious of an illness. What’s the benefit of the vaccine, especially if some people may still get the flu despite being vaccinated? Could you get the flu from the vaccine? If you get the Covid vaccine, do you still need the flu vaccine?\n\nTo guide us through these questions and more, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician, public health expert and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also the author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.”\n\nThe flu vaccine reduces your chance of severe illness and can reduce the likelihood of contracting the flu at all, Dr. Leana Wen said. SDI Productions/Getty Images\n\nCNN: Is the flu a serious illness? What symptoms do people experience?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: It certainly can be serious. The CDC estimates that flu resulted between 9 million and 41 million illnesses, 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 to 52,000 deaths annually across the US between 2010 and 2020.\n\nSymptoms of the flu include fever, muscle aches, headaches, fatigue, coughing and a runny nose. A lot of people recover within several days, but some may still be feeling unwell as long as 10 days to two weeks after the onset of their symptoms. Some will develop complications, including sinus and ear infections, pneumonia, and inflammation of the brain. The flu can also exacerbate underlying medical conditions — for example, people with chronic lung and heart diseases can see their conditions worsen due to the flu.\n\nEven generally healthy people can become very ill due to the flu. However, those particularly susceptible to severe outcomes include those 65 and older, young children under 2, pregnant people and people with underlying medical conditions.\n\nCNN: What’s the benefit of the vaccine, especially if some people may get the flu despite being vaccinated?\n\nWen: The flu vaccine does two things. First and most importantly, it reduces your chance of severe illness — that is, of being hospitalized or dying. Second, it can also reduce your likelihood of getting sick from the flu at all.\n\nIn a sense, this is not too different from the Covid-19 vaccine. The most important reason to get vaccinated against both the flu and the coronavirus is to prevent severe illness. New data released in the CDC’s latest morbidity and mortality report shows this year’s flu vaccine reduces the risk of hospitalization by about 50%. A 2018 study found that people vaccinated against the flu were 59% less likely to be admitted to the ICU due to influenza when compared with those who were unvaccinated.\n\nThe vaccine’s effectiveness can vary depending on how well matched the vaccine is to circulating influenza strains. The CDC cites vaccine effectiveness against “medically attended illness” anywhere from 23% to 61% depending on the year and vaccine-to-strain match. It’s true, then, that you could get the flu vaccine and still contract the flu. But the vaccine does reduce your chance thereof — and, crucially, it reduces the likelihood that you could end up very ill.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that there are a lot of other viruses that can cause flu-like symptoms. The flu vaccine helps protect against viral infections caused by influenza, but there are a lot of other causes of viral syndromes, including adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza and others. These other viruses spread easily, too, and there aren’t vaccines against them. I often hear patients say they once got the flu the same year they had a flu vaccine, and that’s why they don’t want to get vaccinated again. But when I ask them whether they were actually diagnosed with the flu or just had flu-like symptoms, they would say the latter.\n\nCNN: Should children and pregnant people also get the flu vaccine?\n\nWen: Absolutely. These are groups particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes, so it’s very important they receive the flu vaccine.\n\nOne study found the flu vaccine reduces children’s risk of severe life-threatening influenza by 75%. Another found it reduced flu-related emergency department visits in children by half.\n\nSimilar results are found in people who are pregnant. Not only does the flu vaccine protect the pregnant person, if the vaccine is given during pregnancy it also helps protect their baby from the flu for the first few months of its life. That’s important, because the flu vaccine is not available to babies until they are 6 months or older.\n\nCNN: Could you get the flu from the vaccine?\n\nWen: No. The flu vaccine is an inactivated vaccine, which means it does not contain the live virus and therefore cannot cause the flu. It is also a very well-tolerated vaccine, with the most common side effect being discomfort at the injection site that is gone after a day.\n\nCNN: If you got the Covid-19 vaccine, do you still need the flu vaccine?\n\nWen: Yes. Different vaccines target different viruses. The Covid vaccine helps to protect against Covid, but does not protect against the flu, and vice versa. You can receive the Covid vaccine (or bivalent booster) at the same time as you receive the flu vaccine, just in a different injection site.\n\nCNN: Some people have been waiting until later in the flu season to get the flu vaccine. Is this a good idea?\n\nWen: At this point, no, because it’s now clear this flu season is starting earlier than usual. Cases are already high, and it takes about two weeks to reach optimal immune protection after vaccination. I’d encourage people who have not yet received the flu vaccine to get it now.\n\nCNN: What should people know about treatments for the flu?\n\nWen: Most cases of the flu can be treated symptomatically, meaning patients get rest, hydration and treatment for symptoms that come up — such as fever-reducing medicines like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. There are also antiviral treatments available. These are really important for people at high risk for severe influenza complications and/or who are very ill. The earlier such treatments are started, the better. An oral medication, oseltamivir (Tamiflu), can also be given to non-high-risk patients, too, within 48 hours of the start of their illness.\n\nI’d encourage everyone to have an influenza plan, the same way they should have a Covid plan. Ask your doctor in advance if you should receive Tamiflu or another antiviral treatment. Know how you can get testing and where you can access treatment, including after hours and on weekends.\n\nCNN: How can people prevent catching the flu?\n\nWen: The flu is primarily spread through droplets — if an infected person coughs or sneezes, these droplets can land on someone else nearby. It’s also possible that the droplets land on a surface, from which someone gets infected after touching it and then touching their nose, mouth or eyes.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWe can help to reduce flu transmission by staying away from others while symptomatic. We should all cough or sneeze into our elbow or a tissue, and wash our hands frequently, including after touching high-contact surfaces. Individuals particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes should consider wearing a mask to reduce their chance of contracting viral illnesses like the flu.

Power went out across the state, leaving many vulnerable people in extremely cold conditions.

But what was widely reported as a sandstorm in China was, in fact, a dust storm - “and that’s much worse”, said The Conversation. The miniscule particles can travel “much, much further” than sand, and can cause health risks if they are “drawn deep into the lungs”. In Beijing, the sky became orange as dust and pollution caused hazardous air quality.\n\nFlooding, New South Wales In March, Sydney and New South Wales (NSW) residents felt the effects of extreme flooding. The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) urged residents to take care of both their physical and mental health as heavy downpours lead to rivers and dams overflowing, with thousands evacuated from their homes.\n\nCyclone Seroja In April 160 people died in Indonesia after a tropical cyclone “hit a remote cluster of islands”, Climate Home News reported. Landslides and flash floods displaced at least 22,000 people, the news site adds.

The townships, Buthidaung and Maundaw, are about 95% Muslim.\n\nThe measure was enacted a week ago after a government-appointed commission investigating the violence issued proposals to ease tensions, which included family planning programs to stem population growth among minority Muslims, said Rakhine state spokesman Win Myaing. The commission also recommended doubling the number of security forces in the volatile region.\n\n\"The population growth of Rohingya Muslims is 10 times higher than that of the Rakhine (Buddhists),\" Win Myaing said. \"Overpopulation is one of the causes of tension.\"\n\nSectarian violence in Myanmar first flared nearly a year ago in Rakhine state between the region's Rakhine Buddhists and Muslim Rohingya. Mobs of Buddhists armed with machetes razed thousands of Muslim homes, leaving hundreds of people dead and forcing 125,000 to flee, mostly Muslims.\n\nSince the violence, religious unrest has morphed into a campaign against the country's Muslim communities in other regions.\n\nContaining the strife has posed a serious challenge to President Thein Sein's reformist government as it attempts to institute political and economic liberalization after nearly half a century of harsh military rule. It has also tarnished the image of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been criticized for failing to speak out strongly in defense of the country's embattled Muslim community.\n\nWin Myaing said authorities had not yet determined how the measures will be enforced, but the two-child policy will be mandatory in Buthidaung and Maundaw. The policy will not apply yet to other parts of Rakhine state, which have smaller Muslim populations.\n\n\"One factor that has fueled tensions between the Rakhine public and (Rohingya) populations relates to the sense of insecurity among many Rakhines stemming from the rapid population growth of the (Rohingya), which they view as a serious threat,\" the government-appointed commission said in a report issued last month.\n\nPredominantly Buddhist Myanmar does not include the Rohingya as one of its 135 recognized ethnicities.

But we want to show that we are alive, Ukrainian culture is alive, it is unique, diverse, and beautiful,” Oleg Psyuk, the band’s front man, told CNN.\n\nKalush Orchestra performing during rehearsals.

One member is so submerged by patterned embroidery that only his mouth is visible, while the group’s double bassist comes dressed as a ball of yarn.\n\nBut getting Kalush Orchestra to the Eurovision stage took some doing, and their journey is deeply interwoven with the war at home.\n\nThe band initially finished second in Ukraine’s national selection competition, but they were elevated after it emerged the winner had previously traveled to Russian-annexed Crimea. They were unveiled as the country’s entry on February 22, two days before Russian troops invaded Ukraine.\n\n“All members of the group are somehow involved in the defense of the country,” Psyuk told CNN via email.\n\nA member of the team’s media team joined the territorial defense and is fighting on the front line, leaving the group shorthanded in Turin.

The group were forced to rehearse virtually until they were finally able to meet in Lviv after weeks of war.\n\nAnd their song has taken on new meaning. “Stefania,” sung in Ukrainian, is a tribute to Psyuk’s mother, who still lives in the western city of Kalush from which the band takes its name. “On some days there are rockets flying over people’s houses and it is like a lottery – no one knows where it will hit,” Psyuk told CNN.\n\nOrganizers banned Russia from the contest in February, 24 hours after an initial, widely criticized decision to allow it to take part. The European Broadcasting Union concluded that the country’s presence “would bring the competition into disrepute.”\n\nBelarus, which aided Moscow’s invasion, had already been suspended due to the suppression of media freedom in the country.\n\nKalush, meanwhile, sailed through Tuesday’s semifinal and elicited wild cheers from the crowd when they came onstage. Eurovision is notoriously difficult to predict, given its point system relies both on jury verdicts and public voting from dozens of countries, but Kalush seem a safe bet to take this year’s crown.\n\nA Ukrainian victory would mean the country had the right to host next year’s contest – but it is far from certain that such an event would be possible in Ukraine next May.\n\nPsyuk, though, is optimistic. “We believe in our song … it has become a song about the motherland,” he said.\n\n“If it turns out that we will win, Eurovision 2023 will be held in Ukraine.

Stefano Guidi/Getty Images\n\nSerbia’s Konstrakta begins her entry, “In Corpore Sano,” with the question keeping us all up at night: “What could be the secret of Meghan Markle’s healthy hair?” Then she sort of just … keeps going with that theme. “What could it be?” Konstrakta sings in her native tongue. “I think it’s all about the deep hydration.”\n\nLast year, the landlocked micronation of San Marino inexplicably included Flo Rida in their song, and then forced the bemused rapper to sit and watch as the people of Europe successively shrugged at his waning star power, dumping the country to a fourth-from-bottom finish.\n\nThis year, Achille Lauro – a man who takes his stage name from a famously hijacked cruise ship – picks up the mantle for the smallest country in the competition. With a tattooed, androgynous aesthetic and lyrics that liken his heart to a sex toy, Lauro is probably the bad boy of Eurovision 2022. (Though he’s still got a way to go to beat last year’s winners, who were ultimately cleared of taking cocaine on air following a viral video that sparked an investigation by organizers.)\n\nOther long shots worth your time include Stefan, Estonia’s answer to Johnny Cash. He’s played up the Western theme in his music video, and though his Eastwoodian credentials extend about as far as being able to wear a poncho and stare somberly into the middle distance, his throaty vocals and catchy chorus could trouble the frontrunners.\n\nAlbanian entrant Ronela Hajati arrives for the contest's opening ceremony.

Initially invited in 2015 to mark the show’s 60th anniversary, Australia continue to rock up each year, boxed wine in hand, awkwardly laughing along at Europe’s inside jokes and hoping to clinch a victory for the hardcore fans who wake up in the early hours to watch the show back home.\n\nTo be fair to Australia, they give it their all – and this year’s competitor Sheldon Riley’s aptly named track “Not the Same” is expected to turn in a respectable finish.\n\nAnd the popularity of Eurovision in the southern hemisphere is testament to its growing strength, even in its seventh decade.\n\nA US knock-off – something called the “American Song Contest,” which Europeans look at with the same suspicious scowl they wear when handling own-brand mayonnaise in a discount store – recently concluded stateside, and a 2020 Netflix film starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams introduced new demographics to the feverishly followed competition.\n\nEurovision, for all its oddities, maintains a special place in the cultural calendar. But winning would be uniquely significant for Kalush Orchestra, and it’s hard to imagine a more popular victor in the tournament’s history.\n\n“For us, the victory would mean appreciation of Ukrainian music, its uniqueness and beauty,” Psyuk told CNN. “The victory would also lift the spirit of Ukrainian people, who (have) not had any break (for) joy for more than two months.”\n\nEurovision airs at 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET) on Saturday, and it’s available on Peacock for US viewers.\n\nCNN’s Xiaofei Xu contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/17/entertainment/united-kingdom-host-eurovision-2023-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "title": "Eurovision organizers ask UK to host next year's song contest in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThis year’s Eurovision Song Contest winner, Ukraine, will not host the competition in 2023; instead, the chance will be offered to the United Kingdom, organizers the European Broadcast Union (EBU) said in a statement Friday.\n\nUkrainian folk-rap group Kalush Orchestra triumphed last month with their track “Stefania,” surfing a wave of goodwill from European nations to clinch the country’s third win at the annual event.\n\nMembers of the band Kalush Orchestra pose onstage after winning the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 on May 14.

The votes coming in live from the capitals of participating countries delivered a tense finale, with Israel gripped in a tight, five-way race with Cyprus, Austria, Sweden and Germany.\n\nBarzilai eventually racked up 529 points, compared with 436 for runner-up Cyprus with Fuego by Eleni Foureira, and 342 for third-place Austria with Cesar Sampson's Nobody But You.\n\nThe contest largely shed its traditional hallmarks of glitz and glitter in favor of a more restrained and tasteful tone in Lisbon, which was hosting the event because it won last year with Salvador Sobral's sober and subdued ballad Amar pelos Dois.\n\nSobral last week criticized Toy as \"horrible music,\" insisting the focus should be on the music and not the spectacle.\n\nBut Barzilai, with her Asian-themed show in red and yellow and her dancers doing funky chicken moves, was unrepentant.\n\n\"I'm happy people chose something different.

Traffic lights at a pedestrian walkway outside the venue have been transformed so that a green figure dances to Abba’s iconic 1974 winning song “Waterloo” when it’s safe to cross.\n\nThe immensely popular event mixes high camp — at rehearsals, Norway’s Andreas Haukeland, known as TIX, performed his song “Fallen Angel” in huge white wings — with lyrics encouraging inclusion and positivity while avoiding political messages.\n\nBelarus was booted out before the contest even started because organizers the European Broadcasting Union said the country’s original song “puts the nonpolitical nature of the Contest in question.” A replacement song also was rejected.\n\nThe theme for this year’s Eurovision Song Contest is “Open up.” It was actually chosen before the pandemic derailed public life around the globe, but is now very apt as Europe begins to tentatively emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“We decided to keep the theme because, especially in these times, it’s important that we are open towards each other and that we feel the possibility to open up to one another, to show our true feelings, emotions and thoughts,” Bakker said.\n\nThe 2019 Dutch winner, Duncan Laurence, says on the event’s website that he sees music as a way of forging links. “That’s why we need the Eurovision Song Contest.

You’re strong enough to bounce against the wall.”\n\nThe singer, whose family fled to Russia from Tajikistan, said the message is for women all over the world “because we need to be, we have to be brave. We need to be happier. And I’m happy that I can inspire them on that stage because, you know, Eurovision stage is the one of the hugest stages in the world.”\n\nMaltese singer Destiny also has a message of body positivity and is tipped to take it to the final.

Milton was acquitted on another count of securities fraud. Milton potentially faces years in prison.\n\nProsecutors had alleged that Milton made false and misleading statements about “nearly all aspects of the business,” including that Nikola had a fully functioning prototype despite Milton knowing it was inoperable. Milton had also claimed that Nikola had built an electric and hydrogen powered pickup from the ground up with Nikola parts and technology, despite not doing so, according to prosecutors.\n\n“Trevor Milton lied to Nikola’s investors — over and over and over again. That’s fraud, plain and simple,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement after the verdict was released. “Let this case serve as a warning to anyone who plays fast and loose with the truth to get investors to part with their money. It won’t end well.”\n\nBusiness partners who worked with Milton prior to Nikola described him to CNN Business in 2020 as hard to trust, with a tendency to exaggerate and not follow through on promises. Some had questions about his character and integrity.\n\nNikola went public in 2020, and briefly surpassed Ford in value that year despite never having delivered a vehicle. General Motors announced in 2020 that it planned to invest in Nikola and work together on an electric truck. GM had also planned to supply the startup with equipment for its hydrogen fuel cell trucks.\n\nMilton’s statements about Nikola came as the company joined the mounting number of tech and EV companies going public through special purpose acquisition vehicles, or SPACs. He also was accused of defrauding the seller of a Utah ranch, who accepted Nikola stock options as part of the purchase price based on Milton’s claims about the company.\n\nBut Nikola’s stock fell sharply after a scathing report alleged the company was an “intricate fraud.” The report was published by Hindenburg Research, a short-seller that profits by betting against companies.\n\nMilton, of Oakley, Utah, was indicted in July 2021.\n\nGM later gave up its ownership stake in Nikola and ended plans to produce its pickup truck, the Badger.\n\nMilton, who called the report criticizing Nikola a “hit job,” and “lies,” resigned from his position as Nikola chairman in Sept. 2020.\n\nNikola’s stock has fallen roughly 95% since reaching a high in June 2020. The company acknowledged in 2021 seven “inaccurate” statements from Milton about the company’s progress made from July 2016 to July 2020.\n\nLast year Nikola agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $125 million to settle charges that it defrauded investors.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland Reuters", "Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/09/24/coronavirus-travel-refund-battles-expose-deposit-shell-game/5866489002/", "title": "Coronavirus has exposed a secret underbelly of the travel business ...", "text": "The Grand Palladium resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, was a swank respite in March for Leigh Anne Belcher and her daughter until they got a call to stop by the front desk about a billing question.\n\nTheir travel agency, swamped with coronavirus cancellations, had abruptly closed its doors and disconnected its phone lines – and refused to pay the hotel for the room even though Belcher had paid the agency in full for the trip.\n\nOn the spot, Belcher had to come up with thousands of dollars to pay the upscale hotel, which threatened to call authorities and advised the front-gate attendants to make sure no one escaped without paying. When she and her daughter tried to head home to Lexington, Kentucky, they had to shell out more money; their flight had been canceled, and the airline wouldn’t allow them to change it since it, too, was booked by Florida’s BookIt.com.\n\nThe coronavirus has exposed a secret underbelly of the travel business. Many travel agencies operate Ponzi-style schemes in which one traveler's deposit pays for a previous traveler's tickets and accommodations, and so on.\n\nEverything ran smoothly as long as bookings continued to roll in.\n\nThe pandemic blurred the muddy line between business ethics and fraud and has led to not just fried nerves but official complaints and legal action.\n\nThrough public records requests, USA TODAY obtained consumer complaints related to COVID-19 filed with attorneys generals and other agencies in 20 states. Those documents include more than 5,300 travelers, from New Jersey to Texas and Washington state, who struggled to secure refunds for trips interrupted by the coronavirus – among the most common complaints lodged.\n\nMore than 24,000 more have complained to the Federal Trade Commission about travel-related scams, reporting more than $43.5 million in losses – far above any other category of coronavirus-related fraud complaints on file with the FTC.\n\nSome complaints accuse agencies of exaggerating their own costs, not actively seeking refunds from providers such as airlines and hotels – or even receiving refunds that they did not pass on. BookIt and two educational tour companies – NAWAS and EF Tours – were among the most frequent targets of consumer ire.\n\n“How could it happen that I paid for a vacation and the travel agent just decided not to pay the hotel? How was this my problem?” Belcher said. “I think I went through all the stages of grief in about an hour. It wasn’t until we were wheels-up in Santo Domingo that I felt like I could take a breath. And then, the anger set in.”\n\nBelcher channeled some of that anger into managing a Facebook group, Scammed by BookIt, for people seeking refunds from the company, which has grown to nearly 3,000 members. While the company’s website and phone lines are still dead, the group shares tips on how to get credit card companies to cover the charges.\n\nMore on refunds: I snagged an airline refund amid the pandemic; here's how to get one if you're eligible\n\nRepresentatives from BookIt did not respond to requests for comment. In a written statement provided to a Florida television station in July, the company's interim chief financial officer, Ryan Tennyson, said the company had refunded 70% of its customers.\n\nDeposit shell game part of modern travel\n\nTravel agents, either online or traditional, often bundle together flights, accommodations and transportation and make money either through commissions or bulk discounts – or both.\n\nCustomer deposits are supposed to be passed on to vendors, hotels and tour operators to hold the reservations. Increasingly, travel experts say companies have lengthened the time between receiving and releasing those funds. The practice can be buried in the fine-print terms of deposit agreements. State laws offer little recourse.\n\nScott Keyes, who runs the website Scott’s Cheap Flights, said online travel agencies “make their money by making commissions of 20 or 30 percent for those activities and car rentals. They save money by having less customer service, which can be a problem if you’re caught in limbo like this.”\n\n“If a catastrophic event happens like a worldwide pandemic,” Keyes said, “they’re really up a creek.”\n\nExperts noted that the practice of stockpiling customer deposits, then holding onto them if things go wrong, is the business model for various kinds of travel companies – and most airlines.\n\nThis month, online booking site Expedia was sued by travelers whose class-action lawsuit blames the company for not more aggressively pursuing refunds. After consumer backlash, airline executives followed federal policy and began issuing cash refunds instead of only offering vouchers for travel.\n\nDiscount brokers that operate as middlemen, which lack the financial backing of major companies, play a particularly precarious role. Some, such as educational tour companies, pay upfront fees for group reservations and say they struggle to get the money back themselves.\n\nCharlottesville, Virginia-based WorldStrides, which offered educational travel and group tours, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July. The student travel company said it was negotiating with lenders to reduce more than $750 million in debt.\n\n“These agencies were operating on the edge of solvency,” said John Breyault of the National Consumer League, a nonprofit advocacy group. “Suddenly when everything went to hell, everyone goes back to these middlemen, and they don’t have the money to cover refunds.”\n\nJeff Gayduk, publisher of Leisure Group Travel magazine, said middlemen and tour companies alike are always at the mercy of the end suppliers – the airlines, hotels and so on – when it comes to issuing refunds.\n\n“The industry was roaring and had a 10-year run where demand exceeded supply, and people got greedy,” Gayduk said. “Now suddenly a crowbar has been stuck in the flywheel, and everyone is wrongly holding onto customer deposits.”\n\nGayduk said a travel industry colleague had packaged Kentucky Derby experiences before officials reversed course and barred fans from the race Sept. 5. That tour operator can’t get back the $300,000 his company spent on ticket deposits, Gayduk said, leaving him to face angry customers who want their money.\n\nCruise companies have a slightly different business model, typically selling trips up to 18 months in advance, with perks such as drink packages and free Internet for those plunking down early deposits. Final payments usually are due 90 to 120 days in advance of sail dates.\n\nThat cash flow helps keep earlier cruises afloat financially. In the pandemic, maritime attorney Jim Walker, said the companies continue to sell cruises to finance refunds of other recently canceled cruises – despite scant evidence most will sail in the near-term.\n\n“Carnival is essentially running a quasi-Ponzi scheme,” Walker said. “It is collecting money for new cruises, which will probably not take place, to be used to eventually refund fares which Carnival owes to its customers for the past several months.”\n\nCarnival spokesman Roger Frizzell called that accusation “a ridiculous assertion that could not be further from the truth.”\n\nIn a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission, Carnival executives said about 45% of its customers opted for cruise credits instead of cash refunds. At the end of August, the company reported it held more than $2.4 billion in customer deposits.\n\n“We have an extremely loyal customer base,” Frizzell said, “who is anxiously ready to cruise again with our brands, when ready.”\n\nCruise refunds elusive:Some cruise customers waited months for refunds\n\nScuttled faith-based trips cause grief\n\nOnce every 10 years, the villagers of Oberammergau, Germany, perform a Passion play depicting the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. It’s part of a centuries-old pact with God to protect the town from the bubonic plague.\n\nIn 2020, a different pandemic forced the production to be postponed – and thousands of religious travelers from Wisconsin to Florida were out thousands of dollars. NAWAS, the tour company partnering with their churches, would not release all of their money.\n\nMany customers were particularly upset because trusted leaders at their churches and schools had recruited them for the trips.\n\n“They’re supposed to be a Christian organization,” said one man who has taken nearly a dozen trips with NAWAS over the years. “That’s anything but Christian to do that to these people. Most of these people have scraped together their money for years for these tours.”\n\nMore than 400 consumers complained about NAWAS to the attorney general in Connecticut, where the Christian tour operator is based. The company works through churches to recruit customers for pilgrimages to the Holy Land and Europe and to see the Oberammergau Passion play.\n\nWhen COVID-19 forced the play to pause until 2022, these travelers – many elderly and on fixed incomes – wanted refunds. They were stunned when the company initially refused.\n\nUSA TODAY interviewed several of those who filed formal complaints, who agreed to speak only if they could remain anonymous because they settled with the company and signed nondisclosure agreements.\n\nCustomers told USA TODAY they had spent up to $10,000 on their canceled trips and NAWAS sought to withhold $1,150 per person or to keep their deposits as credits for travel through 2022. Some senior citizens said they were not even sure they would live that long.\n\nNAWAS justified keeping their money through a technicality, they said, maintaining that they had violated the original terms of their contracts by canceling the trip themselves. Customers argued that canceled flights and worldwide shutdowns made it impossible to go on vacation as planned, even if they had been willing to forgo the performance.\n\n“They said we canceled the trip,” said Mary Manning of Rockaway, New Jersey. “My argument was the whole world was shut down.”\n\nIn relatively good health at 69, Manning opted to roll all of the money over for a future trip to see the Passion play, but she said she would prefer a full refund of her $4,000 in deposits.\n\nJeff Ment, an attorney who represents NAWAS, said unlike cruises or airlines, the tour operator could not provide full refunds because companies further down the supply chain already had been paid. NAWAS, he said, did not have the cash on hand.\n\nHe cited government red tape in Germany and Italy that made it more difficult to recover refunds from overseas suppliers. Ment said NAWAS ended up giving customers refunds they “usually weren’t entitled to.”\n\nAll told, the company rescheduled, rebooked or partially refunded about 16,000 customers, Ment said.\n\n“There are no winners in this; NAWAS is not a winner for losing its entire year,” he said. “NAWAS did the best it could under extremely difficult circumstances.”\n\nAlthough it costs tour companies money to coordinate and reserve trips, that didn’t justify the amount of funds NAWAS wanted to withhold, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong told USA TODAY.\n\n“People were not getting their money back, and we were very concerned they were not being treated well,” Tong said. “We are talking about a lot of seniors and people on fixed incomes, and this is a big expense for them.”\n\nThe company reached an agreement with the attorney general to refund all but $500 per person, an amount negotiated based on an analysis of consumer deposits and business costs.\n\nThere was one catch: Consumers had to contact NAWAS before Aug. 20 to obtain a refund. Some, who told USA TODAY they were unaware of the settlements, missed the deadline. After reporters questioned the state and company about the situation, they received their refunds.\n\nFive-figure student trips only partially refunded\n\nEF Educational Tours has partnered with school districts across the nation to organize group tours. When the virus took hold, the company attempted to deny full refunds to parents – until attorneys general got involved.\n\nLona Lamar and her partner had planned to head to Spain in June as chaperones for her son’s class trip. She spent more than $12,000 on the trip, booked through her son’s high school in Missouri.\n\nAt first, the company offered a voucher for future travel, Lamar said, which she thought made little sense for a school trip. The company then agreed to refund some of her deposit but wanted to keep about $1,000 per traveler – $3,000 in all in her case.\n\nLamar filed a complaint with the attorney general in Missouri in April. Because the tour company was based out of Cambridge, the Massachusetts attorney general negotiated a settlement in May that secured more than $1.4 million in partial refunds for nearly 4,200 consumers in the state.\n\nEF Tours agreed to roll out those policies for all customers, including Lamar. The company kept $565 per person. That leaves Lamar’s trio still out more than $1,500 for a trip they never took.\n\n“I thought it was very predatorial of the company, considering it was a pandemic,” she said. “From a parent’s standpoint, you put your trust in them. It’s just really disappointing.”\n\nCompany spokesman Adam Bickelman said policies evolved as the extent of the pandemic became clearer. He pointed to global staff overhead and supplier costs to explain why the company could not offer full cash refunds.\n\nBickelman noted that the customer disputes mostly related to EF Educational Tours. The domestic division, EF Explore America, offered different cash refund options because those programs cost less than the overseas excursions.\n\nThe majority of 2020 tour groups opted to accept vouchers for travel redeemable for another trip through Sept. 30, 2022, Bickelman said.\n\n“The health and safety of our travelers and staff have been our top priority for more than 55 years,” he said. “Our singular focus during this time has been to provide our customers with the best and most flexible rebooking and refund options.”\n\nBy the time Carol Petrini reached out to EF Tours in late March to explore her options, trips around the world were being canceled, countries were banning visitors and cruise ships were getting stuck at sea. She had been paying for her tour to France through an installment plan, then up to $3,000 in all.\n\nThe company wanted to withhold $1,000 for the cancellation, Petrini said. After the settlement with the attorney general in Massachusetts, she got all but about $500 back. She questions the company’s justification for keeping any of her money.\n\nThe company “just kept saying over and over that they had already expended money on these trips,” Petrini said, “but there was no evidence that there were reservations for the airlines or hotels or anything.”\n\nInvestigations, lawsuits and charges pending\n\nBookIt was attractive to blue-collar travelers who could slowly fund their dream vacations through a “pay delay” system. Their angst and anger is palpable on the Facebook group started by Leigh Anne Belcher and in official consumer complaints.\n\n“I feel so stupid even booking with them. I don’t care about my trip getting canceled. I just want my money back,” one member of the Facebook group wrote about his monthslong battle with his bank, USAA, to refund his canceled $3,000 trip to Montego Bay, Jamaica.\n\n“From what I understand, the BookIt business model was to not pay the resorts or airlines until the last moment of the actual trip beginning, even though I paid in full nearly four months in advance,” a Wisconsin customer complained to the state’s attorney general.\n\n“American Airlines says I should be talking with the travel agency I booked with, not American,” Douglas Callies wrote to Wisconsin’s attorney general about his canceled trip to Cancun, Mexico. “(BookIt) never used the money for the stated purpose, but merely pocketed it to (their) personal advantage.”\n\nAndrea Koos, a spokeswoman for American Airlines, confirmed that the company issued refunds to BookIt.com but halted them once it received a notice from a travel billing clearing house that the agency had shut down.\n\nFlorida’s attorney general says more than 800 people lodged complaints about BookIt, which is based in Panama City Beach. The U.S. Attorney's Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation and police department, which fielded hundreds of complaints from consumers and vendors, collect cases in an online portal to potentially pursue fraud charges.\n\n“I’m not in the travel business, but I just assume when I pay for my vacation, it’s paid for when I make my purchase,” Panama City police Lt. J.R. Talamantez said. “We’re trying to wrap our head around this business concept and whether it falls into fraud. It’s a sad and unfortunate situation.”\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey filed a civil suit against BookIt in June, alleging unfair and deceptive business practices. BookIt has not responded to the complaint.\n\nWisconsin’s Mikayla Schmidt and her fiancé Jordan Stiefel should have been on their honeymoon in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, this month, all planned through BookIt.\n\nThey were paying for the $4,100 trip in installments, and their last payment was due in March. Their first clue came when they noticed the last payment had not been debited from their bank account.\n\n“We had it on a pay delay schedule and … we went to check, and the website said everything was canceled,” Schmidt said.\n\nSchmidt and her fiance joined Belcher’s Facebook group and filed complaints with state agencies. They disputed the earlier payments with their bank but are short about $900, Schmidt said.\n\nWhen the couple got married, they instead honeymooned in California.\n\n'Tip of the iceberg': Airbnb, VRBO guests fight for refunds after coronavirus cancellations\n\nDocuments provided by customers to USA TODAY show BookIt contacted partner hotels in March to say it wouldn’t make payments for guests, even as some of them arrived. It warned customers then that they’d probably end up paying twice and told them to fight it out with their credit card companies.\n\n“The resort may be asking to collect the money for your stay directly from you at this time, despite that you have paid in full directly with us,” a letter from BookIt.com reads. “To get reimbursement, you need to work with your bank directly.”\n\nA front page of the website instructs customers to contact credit agencies for refunds.\n\nBelcher said she developed a guide for disputing charges directly with credit agencies, but members of the Facebook group who booked with debit cards or funds through their credit unions have had more trouble.\n\nIn a statement to WMBB-TV in Panama City Beach, Tennyson – the BookIt executive – said the company continues to operate and its 35 remaining staff members, down from 300, were working to refund customers.\n\nFederal records show the company took a $1 million to $2 million Payroll Protection Program loan through the Small Business Administration, claiming to have saved 168 jobs.\n\nTennyson's statement said BookIt “hopes to resume its activities as a full service travel agency once some semblance of order returns to the international travel industry.”\n\nContributing: Mary Claire Molloy and Taylor Killough\n\nNick Penzenstadler and Josh Salman are reporters on the USA TODAY investigations team.

That may be the least of the company’s problems in a crucial market.\n\nThe decision to ground the Boeing model 737-800 was made by China Eastern Airlines, which operated the jet that crashed March 21, killing all 132 on board. The cause of the crash has yet to be determined, and the grounding could be lifted soon if it turns out the cause was not mechanical.\n\nBut Boeing has plenty of other troubles in China, the world’s largest aviation market. It is on the verge of being virtually shut out of the region as trade tensions between the United States and China have basically halted Boeing sales in the country for the last four years. The company has not announced any sales to a Chinese passenger airline since November 2017. Only six months ago, Boeing projected the Chinese market would be worth $1.5 trillion in commercial aircraft purchases over the next 20 years.\n\nIt takes a long time to build and deliver planes after they’re ordered, and Boeing continued to deliver jets to China’s airlines and leasing companies in 2018 and early 2019. But only 40 of them have been delivered since March 2019. That’s when aviation authorities around the globe grounded Boeing’s bestselling jet, the 737 Max, after two fatal crashes were found to have been caused by a design flaw. That grounding stretched on for 20 months.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration cleared the plane to carry passengers again in November 2020, with most other countries’ aviation authorities following close behind. Airlines that owned the 737 Max were soon flying the plane again.\n\nBut not in China, where the aviation regulator — one of the first to ground the Max after the second accident — waited another year to clear the plane to fly. Chinese airlines that own the planes still have not returned them to service.\n\n“We would now expect further delays to Chinese reinstatement of the 737 Max while this accident is investigated, at least until a likely cause is identified,” said a note this week from Melius Research.\n\nKey market\n\nLosing a market as important as China would be a devastating blow to Boeing (BA), which has been hit by one problem after another over the last three years, starting with the 737 Max crashes and then the pandemic, which all but obliterated demand for flying and devastated the finances of its airline customers. More recently, there have been issues with its latest model, the 787 Dreamliner, halting deliveries.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018 China accounted for more than 20% of Boeing’s global deliveries, but since the start of 2020 the percentage has dropped to below 5%. (Boeing gets most of its revenue when a plane is delivered.)\n\nSome experts believe Boeing has reached agreements to sell some planes to Chinese airlines in the last four years, either through a leasing company or via sales in which the name of the buyer is not made public. But no aircraft orders are official without approval from the Chinese government, which views plane sales as leverage in its negotiations with the United States on overall trade issues, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with AeroDynamic Advisory.\n\nBoeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors in October, “We remain in active discussions with our Chinese customers on their fleet planning needs and continue to urge leaders in both countries to resolve trade differences.”\n\nThe longer the current grounding drags on, the more Boeing is at serious risk of losing out on the Chinese market, analysts say.\n\nTypically, an airline is reluctant to switch between aircraft manufacturers because such a pivotal change increases the cost of pilot training and makes spare parts more costly. If Chinese customers with Boeing planes in their fleets were to start buying jets from rival Airbus (EADSF), it would be a long-term shift not easily reversed, and one made by the Chinese government rather than the airlines.\n\n“Boeing has its fans over there. But a political mandate in China is a political mandate,” Aboulafia said.\n\nHe and other experts expect Boeing will eventually get back some sales and deliveries in China, but at a much lower number than it was counting on just a few years ago.\n\nChina “can get some planes they need from Airbus, but they can’t get all their planes from Airbus,” said Ronald Epstein, aerospace analyst with Bank of America. Aboulafia describes the relationship between China and Boeing as a “bad marriage with no possibility of divorce.”\n\nThe only good news for Boeing is China’s aviation sector is not as important as it appeared it would be a decade ago, when experts were projecting the market would account for 30% of all global commercial jet purchases. China’s aviation industry was slowing even before the pandemic, Aboulafia said, from a 12.2% growth rate in 2018’s fourth quarter to 5.3% a year later, just before the outbreak of Covid came to light.\n\nIf Boeing loses much of the Chinese market long-term, it will be relegated to being a permanent No. 2 behind Airbus. Global commercial jet sales are essentially a duopoly between the two companies. Being a permanent No. 2 would put Boeing at a long-term competitive disadvantage, Epstein said.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/tech/alice-eviation-test-flight/index.html", "title": "Alice, the first all-electric passenger airplane, prepares to fly | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe world’s first all-electric passenger aircraft is preparing to take flight.\n\nThe Alice, a plane developed by Israeli company Eviation, went through engine testing last week at Arlington Municipal Airport north of Seattle. According to Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay, the Alice is just weeks away from its first flight.\n\nWith battery technology similar to that of an electric car or a cell phone and 30 minutes of charging, the nine-passenger Alice will be able to fly for one hour, and about 440 nautical miles. The plane has a max cruise speed of 250 kts, or 287 miles per hour. For reference, a Boeing 737 has a max cruise speed of 588 miles per hour. The company, focused exclusively on electric air travel, hopes that electric planes that can fit 20 to 40 passengers will be a reality in seven to 10 years.\n\nA prototype of the aircraft, which debuted in 2019, has been going through low-speed taxi tests since December and will attempt a high-speed taxi test in the next few weeks. In these tests, the aircraft is sent down the runway at different speeds to test its own power and allow ground teams to monitor systems like steering, braking and anti-skid. Though the company initially aimed for the Alice to take flight before 2022, poor weather conditions in the Pacific Northwest at the end of the year hindered testing.\n\nEviation has developed three versions of the prototype: a “commuter” variant, an executive version, and one specialized for cargo. The commuter configuration in testing holds nine passengers and two pilots, as well as 850 pounds of cargo. The executive design has six passenger seats for a more spacious flight, and the cargo plane holds 450 cubic feet of volume.\n\nAll of this is possible while reducing maintenance and operating costs of commercial jets by up to 70%, according to the company.\n\nThe electric aviation space is already growing more crowded with both startups and established aviation companies. NASA gave $253 million in September 2021 to GE Aviation and magniX to bring the technology to US fleets by 2035. Boeing is investing $450 million in Wisk Aero, a company building an all-electric, autonomous, passenger aircraft, and Airbus has been working on its own electric aviation endeavors since 2010.\n\nAccording to industry experts, the largest obstacle for electric aviation becoming the norm in passenger jets is the battery.\n\n“The stumbling block is the battery technology just like with cars, but more so in airplanes. This is because with airplanes, the concern is the weight,” said Ross Aimer, CEO of Aero Consulting Experts. “As soon as we have better battery technology, which I suspect will be in two or three years, that’s when all these electric airplanes will eventually come.”\n\nTwelve Alices are on order by international shipping company DHL, anticipated to be delivered in 2024. These planes, out of DHL Express’s global fleet of more than 280 aircraft, are set to be used as cargo carriers making shorter distance trips. “Our aspiration is to make a substantial contribution in reducing our carbon footprint, and these advancements in fleet and technology will go a long way in achieving further carbon reductions,” said Mike Parra, CEO of DHL Express America, in an interview with CNN Business.\n\nEviation has announced purchases of its proposed fleet by DHL and commuter airline CapeAir and says there are several more to be announced once Alice’s first flight occurs. CapeAir’s proposed fleet of Alices are expected to enter service in 2023 on routes connecting Boston, Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket and Hyannis.\n\nWhile we seem to be getting closer to battery-powered air travel for some functions, not everything is nearly ready to go. Cross-ocean flights and jumbo jets are still years beyond the current science, for one. But the most pressing concern for electric aviation is regulation. The FAA has yet to put forward any clear guidelines or regulatory framework for electric airplanes, which fall under the category of Advanced Air Mobility, though Eviation says its is actively working with the FAA to achieve certification for production by 2024. “Some certifications could require the FAA to issue special conditions or additional airworthiness criteria, depending on the type of project. Determining qualifications for these aircraft is an ongoing process,” according to an FAA spokesperson.\n\nElectric aviation proponents predict Alice and electric planes like it becoming as commonplace as any other means of transportation. “It really integrates aviation into the fabric of transportation, of our commuter life. It does so while being sustainable, and through being economically viable,” said Bar-Yohay. “Once we start seeing planes like this, the entire way we look at where we live, how we commute, how we go on vacation, will change. It will be a high-speed train without the rail.”\n\nBut electric aircraft big enough to rival large passenger jets may still be a ways off.\n\n“The first step would be to try these in a commuter market or charter market,” said Aimer. “Then eventually, if that works well, you’re going to have passenger jets. For that we need Boeing or Airbus to come out with a actual electric airplane. I would see that in about 10 years.”", "authors": ["Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/europe/ukraine-drone-russia-air-base-attacks-intl/index.html", "title": "Attacks on Saratov and Ryazan air bases put spotlight on new ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMultiple attacks targeting Russian military infrastructure this week have focused attention on Ukraine’s efforts to develop longer-range combat drones.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry says the strikes on two air bases Monday – followed by an attack on an air field Tuesday – were carried out by Ukrainian drones, which it claims were brought down by Russian air defenses.

A kind of crash test.”\n\nA photo showed the words “az vozdam” inscribed on what was purported to be the drone – meaning “I will repay.”\n\nAnd on Saturday, company spokeswoman Natalia Sad was reported by news agency Ukrinform to have told Ukrainian television that “a number of stages of successful tests have been completed.”\n\n“In accordance with the instructions of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, we are moving to the stage of tests involving an e-warfare jamming environment,” she added.\n\nHowever, there is no public indication that the drone in question has been readied for deployment or was involved in explosions inside Russia.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, a drone strike occurred at an air field in Russia’s Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, according to the regional governor.\n\n“As a result of a drone attack, an oil tanker caught fire near Kursk airfield. There were no casualties. The fire is being localized. Emergency services are working at the site,” the region’s governor Roman Starovoit said on Telegram.\n\nThe Kursk Region official Telegram channel said that Moscow Railways was helping put the “fire out at the airport.”\n\nStarovoit also said on Telegram that he had held a meeting of the “anti-terrorist commission” and decided to “extend the yellow level of terrorist danger” for another 15 days.\n\nA subsequent message added that classes at two schools were canceled following the incident.\n\nThe strike came one day after Russia blamed Ukraine for drone strikes on two Russian military air bases.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that Ukraine used drones to attack two Russian military airfields on Monday morning, adding that its air defenses intercepted the attacks “in the Saratov and Ryazan regions,” according to a statement carried on the official Russian news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nThe two bases, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, are hundreds of miles inside Russian territory and beyond the reach of Ukraine’s declared arsenal of drones.

Here's what we ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia has launched a series of “kamikaze” drone attacks across Ukraine in recent weeks, striking civilian infrastructure and sowing terror in Ukrainian cities far from the frontlines of the war.\n\nThe Ukrainian government says Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and other cities have suffered a barrage of drone attacks, and pleaded with Western countries to step up their assistance in the face of the new challenge.\n\nDrones have played a significant role in the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February, but their use has increased since Moscow acquired the new drones from Iran over the summer.\n\nThe Ukrainians themselves have been using kamikaze drones to strike against Russian targets – and asked their allies to supply them with more of these deadly weapons.\n\nHere’s what we know about these drones.\n\nWhat are kamikaze drones?\n\nKamikaze drones, or suicide drones, are a type of aerial weapon system. They are known as a loitering munition because they are capable of waiting for some time in an area identified as a potential target and only strike once an enemy asset is identified.\n\nThey are small, portable and can be easily launched, but their main advantage is that they are hard to detect and can be fired from a distance.\n\nThe name “kamikaze” refers to the fact the drones are disposable. Unlike more traditional, larger and faster military drones that return to base after dropping missiles, kamikaze drones are designed to crash into a target and explode, detonating their warhead and destroying the drones in the process. They are smaller and more easily controlled than cruise missiles.\n\nParts of what Ukrainian authorities say is an Iranian Shahed-136 drone are seen in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on October 6, 2022. Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/Reuters\n\nA Ukrainian police officer inspects a part of a shot-down drone in Kharkiv, on October 6, 2022. Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/Reuters\n\nWhich drones is Russia using in Ukraine?\n\nThe Ukrainian military and US intelligence say Russia is using Iranian-made attack drones. US officials told CNN in July that Iran had begun showcasing Shahed series drones to Russia at Kashan Airfield south of Tehran the previous month. The drones are capable of carrying precision-guided missiles and have a payload of approximately 50 kilograms (110 pounds).\n\nIn August, US officials said Russia had bought these drones and was training its forces how to use them. According to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia has ordered 2,400 Shahed-136 drones from Iran.\n\nIran has denied supplying weapons to Russia despite evidence to the contrary. Iranian Foreign Minister Spokesman Nasser Kanaani was quoted by the state news agency IRNA on Monday as saying “Iran has repeatedly declared that it is not a party in the war between Russia and Ukraine and has not sent any weapons to either side.”\n\nUkraine claimed its forces had shot down one of these drones for the first time last month near the city of Kupyansk in Kharkiv. There have been more reported attacks since then. Kyiv’s military said Wednesday it had downed 17 Shahed-136 drones that day alone. According to photos released by Ukrainian authorities, Russia has rebranded the Shaheds and is using them under the name of “Geran.”\n\nUS officials say there has been “some evidence already” that the Iranian drones “have already experienced numerous failures” on the battlefield.\n\nUS Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Sasha Baker told reporters late last month that “the idea that they represent some technological leap ahead, frankly we’re just not seeing borne out in the data.”\n\nMoscow also has its own kamikaze drones, made by the Russian weapons manufacturer Kalashnikov Concern. Ukraine claimed on Wednesday it had shot down two of these ZALA Lancet drones that day.\n\nHow much damage can the drones cause?\n\nWhile relatively small, the Shahed drones are capable of carrying missiles and have a payload of approximately 50 kilograms (110 pounds). That means they can inflicted significant damage.\n\nRetired Australian Army Major General Mick Ryan told CNN the drones are “generally of limited utility against military targets that require precision.”\n\n“So the Russians are using these fairly unsophisticated drones against large targets like cities. As you mention there is no military utility to these attacks, this is about Putin satisfying hardliners in Russia they were in ecstasy last week after the missile attacks and probably will be after these ones,” he said.\n\nDrone attacks can have major impact on the civilian population. Zelensky accused Moscow of using them to spread terror among civilians.\n\n“All night and all morning, the enemy terrorizes the civilian population. Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine,” he said Monday.\n\nAs air raid sirens rang through the capital city, many people spent hours hiding in basements, underground stations and bomb shelters, while schools returned to online education.\n\nIn a statement last week, the International Red Cross denounced the use of the drones, saying the use of explosive weapons in populated areas causes mental and psychological harm as well as life-threatening injuries.\n\nHow can Ukraine defend itself against these drones?\n\nUkraine has been asking its allies for air defense systems since the beginning of the war in February, but the need has become more urgent since Russia started using the Iranian-made drones.\n\nAir defense systems were one of the top three priorities on a Ukrainian weapons wish list presented during a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, according to a handout provided to defense ministers participating in the gathering.\n\nGen. Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters after the meeting on Wednesday that the US and its allies needed to provide Ukraine with air defense systems in order for Ukraine to help defend its airspace against incoming attacks from Russian forces.\n\n“Many countries have Patriot, many countries have other systems, there’s a whole series of Israeli systems that are quite capable, the Germans have systems as we mentioned, so a lot of the countries that were here today have a wide variety of systems,” Milley said.\n\n“The task will be to bring those together, get them deployed, get them trained, because each of these systems is different, make sure they can link together with a command and control and communication systems and make sure they have radars that can talk to each other so they can acquire targets on the inbound flights.”\n\nThe air defenses Ukraine needs to combat kamikaze drones are different from the systems that are used against cruise missiles and similar weapons. The Patriot air defense missile system – which stands for “Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target” – is designed to counter and destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, as well as advanced aircraft and cruise missiles, and could be used against drones.\n\nUkrainian officials said that Ukrainian air defense forces were already taking down the “bulk” of the Shahed drones. Ukraine’s senior military commander, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, tweeted Tuesday his thanks to Poland as “brothers in arms” for training an air defense battalion that he said had destroyed nine of 11 Shaheds. He said Poland had given Ukraine “systems” to help destroy the drones.\n\nLast month there were reports that the Polish government had bought advanced Israeli equipment (Israel has a policy of not selling “advanced defensive technology” to Kyiv) and was then transferring it to Ukraine.\n\nZelensky made another plea for more air defense capacities on Thursday, saying Kyiv has only about 10% of what it needs to combat Moscow’s attacks.\n\nDoes Ukraine have kamikaze drones too?\n\nThe Ukrainian military has been using RAM II kamikaze drones, which were developed by a consortium of Ukrainian companies and bought with money crowdfunded by ordinary Ukrainians. These precision-guided loitering munitions can carry 3 kilogram (6.6 pound) warheads and have a flight range of up to 30 kilometers (18.6 miles), according to the manufacturers.\n\nBut Kyiv has also been relying on its allies for drone supplies. The US has sent several types of aerial weapon systems to Ukraine. These include Switchblade drones – small, portable kamikaze drones that can carry a warhead and detonate on impact. The Switchblade 300 and the larger Switchblade 600 are produced by American defense company AeroVironment.\n\nThe smaller Switchblade 300 can hit a target up to 6 miles away (9.6 kilometers), according to specifications provided by the company, while the larger Switchblade 600 can strike more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Both systems can be set up and launched within minutes.\n\nIn May, the US sent the Ukrainian military “phoenix ghost” drones, which are believed to be similar to Switchblade, although little is known about their capabilities.\n\nThe UK has also provided Ukraine with loitering munitions, including 850 hand-launched Black Hornet micro-drones.\n\nUkraine has also been using Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones. These have become something of a symbol of the Ukrainian resistance. However, these are larger and designed to return home after dropping laser-guided bombs or missiles.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/02/03/controversial-bill-proposes-privatize-air-traffic-control/79745638/", "title": "Controversial bill aims to privatize air-traffic control", "text": "Bart Jansen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — A controversial proposal that puts the nation's air traffic controls into private hands burst on to the legislative scene Wednesday, pitting pilots against many airlines and the people who manage the skies.\n\nThe legislation, opposed by powerful lawmakers in both parties, drew unusual support from the air traffic controllers' union, which says the growing inefficiencies, dated equipment and unstable funding call for a drastic response.\n\nRep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the Transportation Committee, who proposed the change said it would insulate the air traffic control system from the funding whims of Congress, which, during a 2013 budget fight, shut down the government and furloughed air traffic controllers.\n\nShuster says the air traffic control system under the FAA is safe, but \"incredibly inefficient.\"\n\nThe problems, he said, \"will only get worse as passenger levels grow and as the FAA falls further behind in modernizing the system.\"\n\nLawmakers and various air traffic controller organization have proposed privatization at least eight times over the past 40 years. Dozens of other countries have privatized their air-traffic systems, but skeptics question whether private systems, such as the one adopted in Canada, would work in the larger, more complex U.S. airspace.\n\nThis time, National Air Traffic Controllers Association backed the proposal, and Airlines for America, a trade group for most major carriers, airline say that a private corporation governed by representatives of the aviation industry could move faster than FAA to upgrade equipment and adopt more efficient flight paths.\n\nThe opposition, however, lined up even before Schuster introduced the legislation. House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., and the top Democrat, Nita Lowey of New York, said in a letter Monday to House Speaker Paul Ryan that such a move give the public less leverage to influence how the system operations.\n\nSenate Appropriations Chairman Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and the top Democrat, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, in a Jan. 27 letter said privatization would mean \"less oversight and less accountability.\"\n\nThe top Democrat on the Transportation Committee, Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, said the proposal gives the airlines too much power.\n\n\"The same people who today determine your baggage costs would determine what you would pay to use the air-traffic control system,\" DeFazio said. \"I don't think that gives consumers a lot of confidence.\"\n\nThe Air Line Pilots Association, a union representing 52,000 pilots, fears airlines would shoulder the entire cost of air-traffic control rather than spreading the costs among all aircraft.\n\nDelta Air Lines also parted ways with its industry brethren. Delta’s senior vice president for flight operations, Capt. Steve Dickson, said privatizing air-traffic control won’t reduce heavy traffic in the Northeast and could distract from current efforts to ease congestion. Delta CEO Richard Anderson called the proposal \"unnecessary and unwise\" in a Tuesday letter to Shuster.\n\nTransportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and FAA Administrator Michael Huerta have remained neutral on the proposal.\n\nUnder Schuster's proposal, the private, non-profit corporation would governed by an 11-member board that includes representatives appointed by government, airlines, general aviation and both the pilots' and controllers' unions.\n\nThe group Airlines for America suggests airline taxes and fees, amounting to $13 billion a year, would easily cover the $10 billion of operating the privatized air-traffic control system.\n\nHouse transportation chairman: Privatize air-traffic control\n\nShuster’s proposal kicks off the debate on broader legislation to renew FAA policy that expires in March. Pilot training, airport fees and drone regulations will also be up for discussion.\n\nThe 273-page bill includes provisions that:\n\n• Require airlines to refund baggage fees for bags delayed more than 24 hours on domestic flights.\n\n• Ban the use of cell phones for in-flight voice calls on scheduled passenger flights.\n\n• Authorize the Transportation Department to establish a smartphone application for consumer complaints.\n\n• Require large and medium airports to provide private rooms in every terminal for nursing mothers.\n\n• Require airlines to notify families before tickets are booked if family members will be assigned seats that\n\naren't together.\n\nAir-traffic control union chief: Privatization possible, but funding crucial\n\nShuster's committee votes on the bill Feb. 11.\n\nAirline executives urge privatization of air-traffic control", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/ukraine-russia-poland-fighter-jets/index.html", "title": "Why the US rejected Poland's plan to send fighter jets to Ukraine ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Pentagon said Wednesday that it is bluntly opposed to a Polish plan to provide fighter jets to Ukraine.\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told the Polish minister of defense that the US does not support the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets to the Ukrainian air force “at this time,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said, either by Poland transferring them to Ukraine with the US backfilling Poland’s fleet or by Poland transferring the MiG-29s to the US to then give to Ukraine.\n\nAustin “stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian air force at this time, and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody either,” Kirby said.\n\nHis comments come a day after the US rejected a proposal from Poland to send Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine by way of a US-NATO air base in Germany.\n\nThe US and NATO want to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian troops invading the country, but also avoid being drawn into an outright conflict with Russia.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been asking the West for MiG-29 fighter jets, which were used during the Cold War and that Ukrainian pilots were trained to use, to maintain control of the skies in his country as it remains under attack by Russia.\n\nZelensky’s other request for help establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine has been rejected by the US and the alliance, who view it as a move that would pit them directly against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also warned that he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone “as participants in a military conflict.”\n\nWith a no-fly zone off the table, the US has weighed the option of providing support to the Ukrainian military by helping facilitate the delivery of Polish fighter jets to Ukraine. But it has proven to be a thorny political issue and logistically complicated objective.\n\nOver the weekend, the US said it was in discussions with Poland about a potential deal in which Poland would supply Ukraine with MiG-29 fighter jets that Ukraine has requested, and the US would then provide Poland with American F-16s.\n\nPoland, however, on Tuesday took the US by surprise and offered to deploy all its MiG-29 fighter jets to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia – but by first sending the jets to US Ramstein Air Base in Germany, also a NATO nation.\n\nThe US Defense Department rejected the proposal as not “tenable” and deemed it too risky.\n\n“The prospect of fighter jets ‘at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America’ departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,” Kirby had said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nUS officials described the issue to CNN as twofold: a logistics problem of getting the jets to Ukraine, and a political problem of avoiding escalation with Russia. US officials described the Polish plan as failing to adequately address both.\n\nNATO members have expressed concerns that providing fighter jets to Ukraine – even if done bilaterally – could be perceived by Russia as the alliance becoming directly involved in the war, NATO diplomats told CNN.\n\nPoland, a NATO member and neighbor of Ukraine, has also been worried about the risks of sharing the fighter jets with Ukraine, as they don’t want to become a party to the conflict and escalate the situation along their border, Polish officials told CNN.\n\nPolish Ambassador to the US Marek Magierowski said Wednesday evening that Poland was “acutely aware” of the consequences involved with its proposal.\n\n“We were under immense pressure on the part of our allies, and public opinion also here in the United States. And we were acutely aware of all technical, legal and diplomatic consequences of such a move, which was risky, of course,” Magierowski told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room.”\n\n“That is why we came up with a logical, conscionable solution. Our American partners rejected this proposal, because they have come to the conclusion that it was too escalatory. Well, we understand this, and I believe that we can continue coordinating our joint efforts with our American partners and with other NATO members in order to help the Ukrainians defend themselves as effectively as possible.”\n\nIf a Russian attack extends into one of the bordering NATO countries, it could trigger Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty, which is the principle that an attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all members.\n\nIf Article 5 is invoked, the US and other NATO members would then be obligated to provide resources to protect a fellow NATO member and could find themselves directly involved in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.\n\nDiscussions continuing\n\nPrior to Kirby stating the Pentagon is strongly opposed to Poland’s proposal on Wednesday afternoon, senior administration officials told CNN the US is continuing to consult with Poland and other NATO allies about the possibility of providing fighter jets to Ukraine.\n\nAmerican and Polish officials have held a “number of conversations” since the White House was caught off guard by Warsaw’s statement, a US administration official told CNN, adding that the relationship between the two countries remains strong despite the disagreement.\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris is also traveling to Poland this week and is expected to discuss the issue.\n\nUS officials also told CNN that they do not believe the episode precludes reaching some type of agreement that would allow the jets to get to Ukraine.\n\nAs of now, though, there are no immediate apparent solutions for the US to facilitate the delivery of jets to Ukraine since rejecting Poland’s offer.\n\n“I think what we’re seeing is that Poland’s proposal shows that there are some complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security systems. We have to make sure that we’re doing it the right way,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Wednesday at the State Department headquarters.\n\nLogistical challenges\n\nThe US has made clear that sending jets to Ukraine is a “sovereign decision” for Poland to make, but has been willing to help sort through the challenges.\n\nBesides the political quagmire, there are logistical challenges with sending fighter jets to Ukraine for the US and NATO allies to still work out.\n\n“Secretary Austin, Chairman Milley and members of our Defense Department are in touch with Ukrainian counterparts, NATO counterparts, discussing what are clearly logistical challenges here,” White House press secretary Psaki said on Wednesday.\n\nPsaki cited some of the logistical and operational challenges: getting planes into Ukraine in a way that is not escalatory, potentially having to take the planes apart and putting them back together, and ensuring the planes’ safe movement amid a war.\n\nShe later called it a “serious logistical bottleneck,” saying that discussions on the matter are ongoing.\n\nOpen-ended questions include how the aircraft would actually be moved from Poland to Ukraine and the number of Ukrainian pilots available, US Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Monday.\n\nOne idea floated initially was that Ukrainians would travel to Poland to retrieve the fighter jets and fly them back into Ukraine’s dangerous air space, which US officials say remains contested.\n\nUkraine late last month made a request for MiG-29s to Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria, and Zelensky on Saturday in a call with US lawmakers pleaded for US help in getting the fighter aircraft to his country.\n\nSome of the countries appeared to have a willingness to consider this move before Poland offered to send their MiG-19s. As of Wednesday, US officials are not ruling out talks with those three other European nations as they seek a way to get the fighter jets to Ukraine.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/28/business/memorial-day-flight-cancellations/index.html", "title": "Hundreds more flights canceled Monday, disrupting the holiday ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This is an updated version of a story that originally ran Sunday.\n\nNew York CNN —\n\nIt’s another chaotic holiday weekend for those traveling by air this Memorial Day.\n\nUpwards of 6,000 global flights have been canceled since Friday with hundreds more fights delayed, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.\n\nSome 1,640 flights were canceled on Sunday alone, FlightAware data indicates, with more than 500 of those flying within, into or out of the US.

But its threats are driving the group ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nWhen the United States, Japan, Australia and India first resuscitated their informal dialogue from a decade-long hiatus in late 2017, China was confident it would soon fail.\n\n“It seems there is never a shortage of headline-grabbing ideas,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said dismissively of the grouping in early 2018, months after it convened its first working-level meeting in Manila.\n\n“They are like the sea foam in the Pacific or Indian Ocean: they may get some attention, but soon will dissipate,” Wang concluded.\n\nMore than four years on, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue – better known as “the Quad” – is far from dissipating. Instead, it has only grown in momentum, profile and clout.\n\nConvened around the mantra of promoting a “free and open Indo-Pacific,” the four countries have held two naval exercises since 2020. Their leaders have assembled three times since last year – including an in-person summit at the White House.\n\nOn Tuesday, the four leaders will meet face to face again in Tokyo. Their summit will be a highlight of Joe Biden’s first trip to Asia as the US President, as he seeks to strengthen alliances and partnerships to counter China’s growing influence in the region.\n\nThe renewed activity has seen China’s initial scorn turn into alarm, with Beijing viewing the grouping as part of Washington’s attempt to encircle the country with strategic and military allies. Wang, the foreign minister, has decried the grouping as an “Indo-Pacific NATO,” accusing it of “trumpeting the Cold War mentality” and “stoking geopolitical rivalry.”\n\nLeaders from the Quad nations shown during their first in-person summit at the White House in September 2021.

Beijing’s backing of Moscow has further damaged its global image, leaving it more isolated on the world stage. And that is not helped by China’s insistence on a zero-Covid policy, in which stringent border restrictions are cutting the country off from a world that has largely moved on from the pandemic.\n\nWhile Biden travels the world to reinforce ties, his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping hasn’t left China in 25 months. Biden’s latest flurry of diplomacy, with stops in South Korea and Japan, has particularly irked Beijing.\n\n“The Indo-Pacific strategy cooked up by the United States, in the name of ‘freedom and openness,’ is actually keen on forming cliques,” Wang said Sunday as Biden wrapped up his trip to Seoul and headed to Tokyo.\n\n“It claims that it intends to ‘change China’s surrounding environment,’ but its purpose is to contain China and make Asia-Pacific countries serve as ‘pawns’ of US hegemony,” Wang added.\n\nBut experts stress that the Quad is not an Asian NATO and neither does it aspire to become one. Instead, they say its flexibility as an informal forum allows it to build more partnerships and expand areas for cooperation – including on the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework that Biden is expected to launch in Tokyo.\n\n“The Quad is trying to emphasize that it has a positive agenda, which is much more about delivering what the Indo-Pacific region needs – versus becoming an anti-China, NATO-like entity, which is a reputation that it’s been trying very hard to combat in the region,” said Kristi Govella, deputy director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund.\n\nThe driving force behind the Quad\n\nChina’s initial dismissal of the Quad was partly based on precedent.\n\nA previous iteration of the Quad – proposed in 2007 by Japan’s then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe – lasted barely a year due to a divergence of interests and pressure from Beijing. It crumbled in January 2008, when Australia announced its withdrawal from the grouping to pursue closer trade ties with China.\n\nBut the geopolitical and strategic calculus in the region has shifted drastically over the past decade. Under Xi, China has abandoned former leader Deng Xiaoping’s decades-old mantra of “hide your strength, bide your time.” Instead, it has pursued a more assertive foreign policy, readily flexing its economic muscle and military might.\n\nA year after Xi took office, China started building – and increasingly militarizing – artificial islands throughout the contested waters of the South China Sea. It has increased its military posturing toward Japan, sending Chinese coastguard vessels into waters around the contested Senkaku Islands (known as the Diaoyu Islands in China) and flying warplanes into the airspace above.\n\nA Chinese air strip is clearly visible beside structures and buildings on the contested Mischief Reef in the Spratly group of islands in the South China Sea, March 20, 2022. Aaron Favila/AP\n\nEarly in the pandemic, China imposed a flurry of trade sanctions on Australia after Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19. And along its disputed Himalayan border with India, Chinese and Indian soldiers clashed in their deadliest conflict in four decades.\n\nThe tensions have driven these countries closer into the orbit of Washington, which under Biden has made the strategic rivalry with China a centerpiece of its foreign policy.\n\n“The biggest driver of the Quad’s revival is the growing assertiveness and aggressiveness of China,” said Yuki Tatsumi, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center.\n\n“Its behavior not only in the East and South China Seas but also in the Indian Ocean all the way down around the Pacific island area resulted in bringing Quad countries’ perception of China closer together.”\n\nAs Beijing grows more distant from the West and its allies, it has moved ever closer to Moscow – but their “no limits” partnership has become more of a liability for China as Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine draws global outrage.\n\n“Beijing’s backing of Moscow reconfirmed the image of China as the disrupter of the existing international order that the countries in this region all have benefited – and continue to benefit – from,” Tatsumi said.\n\nWhile the Quad has never explicitly mentioned China in public, it is hard to miss the thinly veiled references. Last September, when the four leaders met in person in Washington, they committed to “promoting the free, open, rules-based order, rooted in international law and undaunted by coercion” – a clear rebuke to China’s increasingly aggressive behavior in the region.\n\nIn response, Chinese diplomats have repeatedly lashed out at the Quad for “disrupting regional peace and stability.”\n\nBuilding “closed and exclusive small circles or groups is as dangerous as the NATO strategy of eastward expansion in Europe,” Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said in March.\n\n“If allowed to go on unchecked, it would bring unimaginable consequences, and ultimately push the Asia-Pacific over the edge of an abyss,” he said.\n\nNot ‘Asia’s NATO’\n\nNATO’s swift and coordinated response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has likely alarmed Beijing, say experts, who suggest its leaders are watching Western reaction to Ukraine with Taiwan in mind.\n\nChina views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve unification. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei are at the highest they’ve been in recent decades, with the Chinese military sending record numbers of war planes near the island – a show of force that is not lost on other countries in the region.\n\nWhen the Quad leaders convened in March to talk about the Ukraine crisis, they agreed that “unilateral changes to the status quo with force like this should not be allowed in the Indo-Pacific region.”\n\nJapanese, Indian and Australian ships sail in formation during Malabar exercises in August 2021. Justin Stack/DVIDS U.S. Navy/AP\n\nBut Jean-Pierre Cabestan, an expert on Chinese politics at Hong Kong Baptist University, stressed that the Quad is not a formal alliance like NATO.\n\n“It can’t be Asia’s NATO. What structures the region’s security is a set of bilateral alliances concluded by the US after World War II – with Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Philippines. So there’s not such a thing as NATO in east Asia,” he said.\n\nAnd unlike Japan and Australia, India is not a US ally – following a foreign policy tradition of non-alignment the country has adopted since independence.\n\nThere are structural differences too. Experts say in recent years the Quad has pivoted away from an overt focus on security issues to include more areas of cooperation, in an attempt to better address regional needs.\n\nAt their first virtual summit in March last year, the Quad leaders pledged to supply a billion Covid-19 vaccines across Asia by the end of 2022. The Quad has also formed working groups on climate change, technological innovation and supply-chain resilience.\n\nDuring his trip to Tokyo, Biden is expected to unveil the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework – a long-sought plan to step up US economic engagement with the region. Experts say the framework could provide momentum for closer economic cooperation among the Quad countries – such as in infrastructure and supply-chain resilience.\n\nIn the eyes of Beijing, these efforts will likely be seen as a direct challenge. On Sunday, Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, said while China is always happy to see proposals conducive to regional cooperation, it is opposed to attempts to create division and conflict.\n\n“Anyone attempting to isolate China with some framework will only isolate themselves. Rules made up to exclude China are bound to be abandoned by developments of our time,” he said.\n\nBut the Quad will need to demonstrate that it can deliver on its promises. Previous US attempts to boost economic ties with the region, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, have floundered, and the US will need to persuade potential allies and partners that it will stay committed to the region beyond Biden’s term.\n\nSusannah Patton, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, said the Quad had already exceeded many analysts’ expectations. “The Quad is a vehicle for (its members) to present a different vision of how the region should work, and to signal to Beijing that it won’t have things its own way all the time,” she said.\n\n“As for the future, how it evolves will in large part depend on China’s behavior. If China continues to undermine regional norms and coerce other countries, the Quad will respond.”", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/joe-biden-counter-terrorism/index.html", "title": "Afghanistan: US kills al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in drone ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a drone strike, President Joe Biden said Monday in a speech from the White House.\n\n“I authorized a precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield, once and for all,” Biden said.\n\nZawahiri, who just turned 71 years old, had remained a visible international symbol of the group, 11 years after the US killed Osama bin Laden. At one point, he acted as bin Laden’s personal physician.\n\nZawahiri was sheltering in downtown Kabul to reunite with his family, Biden said, and was killed in what a senior administration official described as “a precise tailored airstrike” using two Hellfire missiles. The drone strike was conducted at 9:48 p.m. ET on Saturday was authorized by Biden following weeks of meetings with his Cabinet and key advisers, the official said on Monday, adding that no American personnel were on the ground in Kabul at the time of the strike.\n\nSenior Haqqani Taliban figures were aware of Zawahiri’s presence in the area, the official said, in “clear violation of the Doha agreement,” and even took steps to conceal his presence after Saturday’s successful strike, restricting access to the safe house and rapidly relocating members of his family, including his daughter and her children, who were intentionally not targeted during the strike and remained unharmed. The US did not alert Taliban officials ahead of Saturday’s strike.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said, “An air strike was carried out on a residential house in Sherpur area of Kabul city on July 31.”\n\nHe said, “The nature of the incident was not apparent at first” but the security and intelligence services of the Islamic Emirate investigated the incident and “initial findings determined that the strike was carried out by an American drone.”\n\nThe tweets by Mujahid came out prior to CNN reporting Zawahiri’s death. Mujahid said the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan “strongly condemns this attack on any pretext and calls it a clear violation of international principles and the Doha Agreement.”\n\n‘Justice has been delivered’\n\nBiden, who was kept abreast of the strike against Zawahiri as he isolated with a rebound case of Covid-19, spoke outdoors Monday from the Blue Room Balcony at the White House.\n\nZawahiri, Biden said, “was deeply involved in the planning of 9/11, one of the most responsible for the attacks that murdered 2,977 people on American soil. For decades, he was the mastermind of attacks against Americans.”\n\n“Now, justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more. People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer,” he continued. “The United States continues to demonstrate our resolve and our capacity to defend the American people against those who seek to do us harm. We make it clear again tonight, that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.”\n\nThe President said the precision strike targeting was the result of the “extraordinary persistence and skill” of the nation’s intelligence community.\n\n“Our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year – he moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family,” Biden said.\n\nThe strike comes one year after Biden ordered the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, prompting Taliban forces to rapidly seize control of the nation.\n\nBiden said on Monday that when he withdrew US troops from the country, he “made the decision that after 20 years of war, the United States no longer needed thousands of boots on the ground in Afghanistan to protect America from terrorists who seek to do us harm, and I made a promise to the American people, that we continue to conduct effective counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan and beyond. We’ve done just that.”\n\nBiden pledged that Zawahiri “will never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven, because he is gone and we’re going to make sure that nothing else happens.”\n\nThe President concluded by expressing gratitude to US intelligence and counterterrorism communities, saying that he hopes Zawahiri’s death will bring some measure of closure to the friends and families of 9/11 victims.\n\n“To those who continue to seek to harm the United States, hear me now: We will always remain vigilant and we will act – and we will always do what is necessary to ensure the safety and security of Americans at home and around the globe,” he concluded.\n\nEmbarrassment for Taliban\n\nA senior counterterrorism analyst told CNN that it would have been impossible for Zawahiri to be in Kabul without the invitation and acquiescence of at least a small number of Taliban, whether from the Haqqani network or another part of the group.\n\nThe analyst said that this strike was embarrassing for the Taliban as they had claimed there were no foreign fighters in Afghanistan and no al Qaeda.\n\nHe added that recent statements from Zawahiri had suggested the al Qaeda leader was feeling more relaxed. The statements had referred to more recent events, the analyst said, adding this potentially revealed a complacency that may have led to the successful strike.\n\nThe issue now arises as to who will be Zawahiri’s successor.\n\nThe current al Qaeda No. 2, Saif al Adel, is thought to have been in Iran, according to United Nations reports.\n\nThe analyst said that this raised an urgent issue for the Iranians who now have to choose between expelling the new al Qaeda leader or harboring him.\n\nA former official in the Afghan government with an intimate grasp of counterterrorism said that he had heard al Adel had already left Iran for Afghanistan.\n\nClose ally of bin Laden\n\nZawahiri comes from a distinguished Egyptian family, according to the New York Times. His grandfather, Rabia’a al-Zawahiri, was an imam at al-Azhar University in Cairo. His great-uncle, Abdel Rahman Azzam, was the first secretary of the Arab League.\n\nHe eventually helped to mastermind the deadliest terror attack on American soil, when hijackers turned US airliners into missiles.\n\n“Those 19 brothers who went out and gave their souls to Allah almighty, God almighty has granted them this victory we are enjoying now,” al-Zawahiri said in a videotaped message released in April 2002.\n\nIt was the first of many taunting messages the terrorist – who became al Qaeda’s leader after US forces killed bin Laden in 2011 – would send out over the years, urging militants to continue the fight against America and chiding US leaders.\n\nZawahiri was constantly on the move once the US-led invasion of Afghanistan began after the September 11, 2001, attacks. At one point, he narrowly escaped a US onslaught in the rugged, mountainous Tora Bora region of Afghanistan, an attack that left his wife and children dead.\n\nHe made his public debut as a Muslim militant when he was in prison for his involvement in the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.\n\n“We want to speak to the whole world. Who are we? Who are we?” he said in a jailhouse interview.\n\nBy that time, al-Zawahiri, a young doctor, was already a committed terrorist who conspired to overthrow the Egyptian government for years and sought to replace it with fundamentalist Islamic rule. He proudly endorsed Sadat’s assassination after the Egyptian leader made peace with Israel.\n\nHe spent three years in prison after Sadat’s assassination and claimed he was tortured while in detention. After his release, he made his way to Pakistan, where he treated wounded mujahadeen fighters who fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.\n\nThat was when he met bin Laden and found a common cause.\n\n“We are working with brother bin Laden,” he said in announcing the merger of his terror group, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, with al Qaeda in May 1998. “We know him since more than 10 years now. We fought with him here in Afghanistan.”\n\nTogether, the two terror leaders signed a fatwa, or declaration: “The judgment to kill and fight Americans and their allies, whether civilians or military, is an obligation for every Muslim.”\n\nMastermind of 9/11\n\nThe attacks against the US and its facilities began weeks later, with the suicide bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed more than 200 people and wounded more than 5,000 others. Zawahiri and bin Laden gloated after they escaped a US cruise missile attack in Afghanistan that had been launched in retaliation.\n\nThen, there was the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000, when suicide bombers on a dinghy detonated their boat, killing 17 American sailors and wounding 39 others.\n\nThe culmination of Zawahiri’s terror plotting came on September 11, 2001, when nearly 3,000 people were killed in the attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center and Pentagon. A fourth hijacked airliner, headed for Washington, crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers fought back.\n\nSince then, al-Zawahiri raised his public profile, appearing on numerous video and audiotapes to urge Muslims to join the jihad against the United States and its allies. Some of his tapes were followed closely by terrorist attacks.\n\nIn May 2003, for instance, almost simultaneous suicide bombings in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, killed 23 people, including nine Americans, days after a tape thought to contain Zawahiri’s voice was released.\n\nThe US State Department had offered a reward of up to $25 million for information leading directly to his capture. A June 2021 United Nations report suggested he was located somewhere in the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan, and that he may have been too frail to be featured in propaganda.\n\n9/11 families group expresses gratitude but calls on Biden to hold Saudis accountable\n\nTerry Strada, the chair of 9/11 Families United – a coalition of survivors and families of victims of the September, 11, 2001, terrorist attacks – expressed gratitude for the strike, but called on the President to hold the Saudi Arabian government accountable for alleged government complicity in the attacks.\n\nThe group has criticized the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour, which began its third competition at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster at the end of July – some 50 miles from Ground Zero in Manhattan.\n\n“I am deeply grateful for the commitment of intelligence agencies and our brave military’s dedication and sacrifices made in removing such evil from our lives. But, in order to achieve full accountability for the murder of thousands on Sept. 11, 2001, President Biden must also hold responsible the Saudi paymasters who bankrolled the Attacks,” Strada said in a statement.\n\n“The financiers are not being targeted by drones, they are being met with fist pumps and hosted at golf clubs. If we’re going to be serious about accountability, we must hold EVERYONE accountable,” Strada added – appearing to reference the President’s controversial gesture with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Monday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Kylie Atwood Natasha Bertrand Maegan Vazquez Donald Judd Nick Paton Walsh", "Kevin Liptak", "Kylie Atwood", "Natasha Bertrand", "Maegan Vazquez", "Donald Judd", "Nick Paton Walsh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}]}

Brown had a high approval rating among voters but lost to Curry by less than a 3-point margin.\n\nCurry won re-election in 2019 and could not run again because of term limits. He became one of Davis’ Florida republican endorsements, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, Senator Rick Scott and Rep. John Rutherford.\n\nDavis’ high-profile campaign, fueled with more money than any campaign for local office in Jacksonville history, brought criticism and praise from Republicans.\n\nDeegan received support from Florida Democratic Chair Nikki Fried but relied primarily on local bipartisan endorsements, including current Republican council members Matt Carlucci and Randy DeFoor and local activists and pastors.\n\nDavis told his supporters the result wasn’t what he had been expecting 24 hours ago, but he pledged to help Deegan and urged his supporters to also come together to back her. He also turned during the concession speech to thank his wife Rebekah for her support during the grueling campaign.\n\n“From the bottom of my heart, I love each of you in this city,” he said in his final comments from the stage and his mayoral campaign. “I love each of you in this room. Rebekah Davis, I love you and I cannot thank you enough for what you did for me during this campaign. Don’t be discouraged. Don’t be disappointed. We have to all come together now and move our city forward.\"\n\nHis campaign managed to rally Republicans to the polls with an election day surge that ended with nearly 7,200 more registered Republicans than Democrats casting ballots in the race.

Though candidates didn't run officially on party labels, Barry capitalized on a traditional Democratic coalition to handily win the race.\n\nThursday's outcome, however, will perhaps be most remembered for the historical moment — a moment that was not lost on Barry as she addressed an elated room of supporters at the Nashville Farmers' Market.\n\n\"Tonight we start a new chapter of Nashville — The Nashville Story,\" Barry said as she kicked off her victory speech. \"And that story is the saga that is written every day by the people in this room and the people who are watching at home.\n\n\"And then there's the chapter that we're writing today — you the Nashville voters,\" she later added. \"This one is going to go down in the history books. Today, you went to the polls and you elected the first woman mayor.\"\n\nThose words ignited a chant of \"Megan, Megan, Megan!\" from her loyalists.\n\nBarry delivered her remarks after Fox had conceded minutes earlier before a more somber crowd at Nelson's Green Brier Distillery at Marathon Village. The 54-year-old Fox, former chairman of the Metro school board and a hedge-fund executive, congratulated Barry for a \"tremendous campaign and a tremendous victory.\"\n\n\"We have run a very serious hard-fought campaign — both sides,\" Fox said in his concession speech, calling for reconciliation as Nashville has done after past elections. \"We always have hard-fought campaigns, and we as a city always come together. That is the Nashville Way. And certainly we want to wish Megan all the success in the world to lead this fabulous city.\"\n\nBarry's win Thursday ends one of the most divisive and bitter races in recent Nashville memory, one fueled by the injection of partisanship and dominated by debates over negative advertising, city finances and the intersection of God, religion and family with politics.\n\nStory continues after video\n\nIn her speech Thursday, Barry sought to appeal to the working class. She said Nashville's next story is about police officers, firefighters and teachers who need \"a mayor who will make sure that promises made are promises kept.\"\n\n\"This is really a story about our working families, and those families are the backbone of our economy who need access to transportation, excellent public education and affordable places to live,\" Barry said. \"Our working families need a mayor who is going to create prosperity for everyone.\"\n\nMayor's mission: Help Nashville's at-risk youths\n\nMayor's mission: Help Nashville's at-risk youths\n\nBarry thanked some of her top supporters, early campaign staffers and friends who endorsed her, including former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen and former mayoral candidates Charles Robert Bone and Howard Gentry, both of whom lost in last month's general election.\n\n\"Tomorrow, our real work begins, but this is a job that I've been preparing for the last eight years,\" Barry said.\n\nBarry, a two-term at-large Metro councilwoman, was forced to play defense early on in the runoff after Fox set out to define her as a liberal far outside Nashville's mainstream driven foremost by national social issues.\n\nShe would end up confronting issues of faith and religion, holding a prayer breakfast at a historic black church to reject what she characterized as a whisper campaign that she's atheist. A week later, she denounced a Fox radio ad that singled out blog writings from her husband, Bruce Barry, a longtime contributor to the Nashville Scene, to cast the Barry family as hostile to people of Christian faith.\n\nFor her part in negative advertising, Barry labeled Fox​ a \"Wall Street hedge-fund manager\" who made millions while many Nashvillians suffered during the Great Recession. A controversial mail ad paid for the Tennessee Democratic Party characterized Fox as a segregationist over a vote he took as a Metro school board member.\n\nAt times over the past few weeks, Barry's campaign felt like a bid for a third term of Dean as the candidate routinely referred to \"Karl and I\" as she discussed the actions of the city over the past eight years. Though Dean himself did not endorse in the race, several Dean allies, including his finance director, Rich Riebeling, publicly supported Barry.\n\nFox countered with a different message. He called for a \"new pro-growth agenda,\" one focused on infrastructure and fiscal conservatism to build on Dean's legacy and Nashville's rise in national prominence. Fox went after Barry for her votes on the Metro Council to increase property taxes in 2012, the use of $73 million in rainy-day funds to pay for this year's budget and $1 billion in debt that accumulated during the past eight years.\n\nTalking to reporters about his defeat, Fox said there's nothing he would do differently and that he was surprised it wasn't a closer election. After such a tough race, he called the size of her win \"probably a good thing for the city.\" He said he's not sure why he lost but acknowledged that running in Democrat-heavy Davidson County didn't help.\n\n\"We always knew it was a challenge because I'm not a registered Democrat,\" Fox said. \"In round one, that didn't seem to hurt us. Maybe that was an issue for us in round two.\"\n\nIn a prepared statement, Dean congratulated Barry on her win and thanked Fox for campaigning for the chance to serve.\n\n\"This is a great city and a great job, and Megan is more than capable of leading Nashville to its next plateau,\" Dean said. \"I always say that Nashville's best days are still ahead of it, and I have no doubts about that.\"\n\nBarry will be working with a new council, led by newly elected Vice Mayor David Briley, that features several members who endorsed her candidacy.\n\n\"Mayor Barry knows the Metro Council better than any mayor before her,\" Briley said. \"And tonight Nashville made a clear choice electing a mayor and council committed to extending the successes of our city. On behalf of the council, we look forward to working together to that end.\"\n\nBarry's win concludes a race that began two years ago and attracted seven candidates and became the most expensive in city history.\n\nReporters Jill Cowan and Adam Tamburin contributed to this report.\n\nReach Joey Garrison at 615-259-8236 and on Twitter @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/politics/karen-bass-mayor-los-angeles/index.html", "title": "Democrat Karen Bass makes history as first female mayor of Los ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRep. Karen Bass has made history as Los Angeles’ first female mayor, CNN projects, overcoming more than $104 million in spending by her rival Rick Caruso to win the race.\n\nThe six-term congresswoman, who represents south and west Los Angeles, was able to put together a strong coalition of Black voters in South Los Angeles and White progressives on the city’s west side to prevail over the shopping mall magnate.\n\n“This is my home, and with my whole heart, I’m ready to serve, and my pledge to you is that we will hit the ground running on Day One,” Bass said in a statement Wednesday night, noting that she had “received a gracious call” from Caruso and hoped that he “continues his civic participation in the city that we both love.”\n\nIn her campaign, Bass emphasized the depth of her policy experience and her reputation as collaborative listener and legislator. She also highlighted her early work as a physician assistant in the emergency room and her experience bringing together Black and Latino community organizers in South LA in the early 1990s to address the root causes of crime and the crack epidemic – work she did through the nonprofit she founded, Community Coalition.\n\nJoe Biden had vetted Bass, the then-chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, to be his running mate in 2020 as she helped lead the negotiations on legislation to create greater police accountability following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nShe had won the respect of her Democratic colleagues and her constituents with her decades of experience shaping public policy in areas like child welfare, foster care and prison reform.\n\nBass argued that her experience would give her a unique perspective and understanding of the problems with homelessness in Los Angeles. She said her experience in the emergency room had given her a depth of understanding of the problem that her primary rivals, including Caruso, did not have.\n\n“I have a background in the medical field. I’ve worked with these patients,” she told CNN in an interview earlier this year. “I spent several years in the emergency room at (LA) county. My patients were homeless. My patients were mentally ill. They had substance abuse. I know these systems.”\n\nShe said she would declare a state of emergency on homelessness that would set a new tone on addressing the issue citywide: “It should be dealt with like a natural disaster,” she told CNN. “I’m really hoping that we begin to build a new spirit in this city, where people understand that this problem is everyone’s problem.”\n\nShe cast Caruso as a political opportunist who had registered as a Democrat merely to improve his chances of winning the office. Noting his past donations to conservative Republicans, she and her allies tried to raise questions about his support for abortion rights – criticism Caruso said was unfair, unfounded and an attack on his Catholic faith.\n\nCaruso had toyed with the idea of running for mayor for years after serving in other civic roles, including as a city police commissioner and the former head of the USC Board of Trustees. One of his biggest hurdles was his history as a former Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat vying for the top job in an overwhelmingly Democratic city.\n\nBut he seized on the frustration that many of the city’s voters are feeling about homelessness, crime and corruption at City Hall – spending tens of millions of dollars of his own money on ads that portrayed him as a fixer with the executive credentials to address those problems and improve the city’s efficiency and responsiveness.\n\nWhile Bass accused Caruso of trying to buy the mayor’s office as they vied to replace term-limited Mayor Eric Garcetti, Caruso suggested that she and other “career politicians” had been ineffective and that it would take an outsider to clean up the city’s streets and speed up efforts to shelter the homeless.\n\nDuring the campaign, Bass also highlighted her role as a dealmaker when she led the California State Assembly after the 2008 financial crisis – making budget decisions that earned her a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2010. She also made history in that role – becoming the first Black woman to serve as speaker of a state legislature in 2008.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/us/black-mayors-large-cities-karen-bass-reaj/index.html", "title": "4 largest cities in America will be led by Black mayors | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Rep. Karen Bass is sworn in as Los Angeles mayor next month, Black people will be leading the four largest cities in America.\n\n“As Black mayors continue to win elections this cycle, we are excited that, for the first time, the four largest cities – New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago & Houston – are each led by an African American mayor,” the African American Mayors Association said on Thursday.\n\nBass, a six-term congresswoman who represents south and west Los Angeles, will be Los Angeles’ first female mayor. She will be sworn in on December 12.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams, a retired New York Police Department captain, took his oath earlier this year. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot was elected in 2019 and is currently running for reelection. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner has been in office since 2016 and his current term concludes at the end of next year.\n\nThe four of them are members of the Democratic party.\n\nPhyllis Dickerson, CEO of the African American Mayors Association, said Black mayors bring a different perspective to public office and can identify not only problems they have experienced, like the need for public housing and food insecurities, but solutions to those issues. She believes having the four cities led by Black people will have a positive impact locally and nationally.\n\n“When you have the top four cities at the table, with the administration, I think that the conversation is definitely going to land where it needs to be,” Dickerson said.\n\nThere are seven Black women serving as mayors of the nation’s largest 100 cities, according to the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) at Rutgers University, which tracks the progress of Black and other women of color in elected office.\n\nThey are Lightfoot in Chicago, Vi Alexander Lyles in Charlotte, North Carolina, London Breed in San Francisco, Muriel Bowser in Washington, DC, LaToya Cantrell in New Orleans, Tishaura Jones in St. Louis, Missouri, and Elaine O’Neal in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBut that number will reach nine with Bass and Pamela Goynes-Brown, who was elected mayor of North Las Vegas.\n\nThere has been a wave of Black women running for office in all levels of government in recent years. There were 145 Black women who filed or indicated that they were running for Congress in the midterm election, CAWP told CNN – a record after 130 Black women filed to run in the 2020 election.\n\nHigher Heights for America, a political action committee that works to elect Black progressive women nationwide, applauded Bass’ win, saying it signaled a win for representation.\n\n“Today’s long-awaited election results reaffirm the notion that when given the opportunity, Black women have the ability and power to lead,” Glynda Carr, president of the group, said in a statement.\n\nCarr said Bass’ win was among many wins to be celebrated but more are needed. A Black woman has never been elected as governor, and it’s a role that holds incredible power, she said.\n\n“If Americans truly want to see advancements in progressive policy and diverse representation in our government, we have to invest in Black women running in gubernatorial races, but investing doesn’t just mean money. We have to invest our time, energy and talents if we want to get Black women candidates across the finish line,” she told CNN.", "authors": ["Nicole Chavez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/2022-midterm-election-historic-firsts/index.html", "title": "Meet the history-makers of the 2022 midterm elections", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs midterm results continue to roll in days after Election Day, Democratic and Republican candidates have already been celebrating historic victories.\n\nHeading into Election Day, both parties were looking to diversify their ranks of elected officials, both in Congress and beyond, and they appear on track to do so.\n\nHouse Republicans will add new members of color to their conference, including John James, who will be the first Black Republican congressman from Michigan, and Juan Ciscomani, who will be the first Latino Republican to represent Arizona in Congress.\n\nDemocrats will make a breakthrough for LGBTQ representation in governor’s offices.

Touching on her own roots as a coalition builder, she sent a warning shot to wealthier neighborhoods that have resisted plans to build affordable housing in their areas: “You’re not going to be able to house 40,000 people in only the low-income areas – that is just not the case.”\n\n“The crisis we face affects us all and all of us must be part of the solution,” Bass said. “Being a coalition builder is not coming together to sing Kumbaya. … Being a coalition builder is about marshalling all of the resources, all of the skills, the knowledge, the talent of this city.”\n\n“The people of Los Angeles have sent a clear message. It’s time for change, and it’s time for urgency,” Bass continued. “Many Angelenos do not feel safe in their neighborhoods, and families are being priced out of their communities. This must change. … To the people of Los Angeles, my message is we are going to solve homelessness. We are going to prevent and respond urgently to crime, and Los Angeles will no longer be unaffordable for working families.”\n\nBass is embarking on those enormous tasks after defeating real estate magnate Rick Caruso, CNN projects, in a race in which he spent more than $104 million – outspending his opponent by more than 11-to-1.\n\nShe put together a winning coalition of voters by building on the two constituencies that have powered her earlier wins in her Los Angeles-area congressional district – Black voters and White progressives from the city’s west side – and expanding on that base as she promised to bring together LA’s diverse communities, while dismissing Caruso’s broadsides against longtime politicians who he said had failed to solve the city’s most pressing problems.\n\nCaruso, a former Republican-turned-independent who became a Democrat before announcing his run in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, had hoped to increase turnout among independents, moderates and Latinos – putting more than $10 million into Spanish-language media to drive his message that an outsider would be best suited to tackle voters’ concerns about crime, homelessness and corruption at City Hall. Tens of thousands of ballots are still being counted in Los Angeles County, but Bass was able to build an insurmountable lead – in part by deploying an army of volunteers to knock on doors across the city.\n\nBass, who will succeed term-limited Mayor Eric Garcetti, will take charge of the city’s government at a moment of upheaval at City Hall. A recently leaked audio recording revealed several city councilmembers making openly racist remarks behind closed doors in a 2021 meeting in which they discussed their frustration with maps proposed by the city’s redistricting commission.\n\nThe leaked audio, which was posted anonymously on Reddit and obtained by the Los Angeles Times, burst into public view in early October after the newspaper detailed the racist remarks in an October 9 story – sparking widespread calls for the councilmembers involved to resign. The audio was from a year-old conversation between then-City Council President Nury Martinez, Councilmembers Gil Cedillo and Kevin de León and then-Los Angeles County Federation of Labor President Ron Herrera.\n\nIn an October 10 tweet, Bass said that Los Angeles “must move in a new direction and that is not possible unless the four individuals caught on that tape resign from their offices immediately.” (Bass, who had been endorsed by Martinez, was criticized for not calling for their resignations immediately after the details emerged in the October 9 LA Times story). Martinez at first stepped down as Council president. Ultimately, she and Herrera both resigned. Cedillo and de León apologized for their roles in the conversation but resisted calls to step down.\n\n“I will not accept corruption or cronyism,” Bass said on Thursday.\n\nBass will assume the new office on December 12 – a notably quick transition. When she takes office, the four largest cities in the US will all have Black mayors – that includes Eric Adams of New York City, Lori Lightfoot of Chicago and Sylvester Turner of Houston.\n\nBass noted Thursday that one of her first acts as mayor will be to declare a state of emergency on homelessness and to identify “very specific areas where we will get people housed.”\n\nBoth Bass and Caruso had said they would declare a state of emergency on homelessness – though critics have said it will largely be a symbolic move.\n\nSpeaking with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room” later Thursday, Bass said that “it’s absolutely not a symbolic gesture.”\n\n“We have a lot of bureaucratic red tape that needs to be eliminated, and that’s the basis of calling a state of emergency so I can have the power, not to eliminate all of the red tape, but specifically to address some burdens – some hurdles that people have to go through in order to build,” she said.\n\nBass said in her Thursday speech that she would outline her plans in more detail when she assumes office in December.\n\nThe six-term congresswoman had emphasized the depth of her policy experience in her campaign after winning accolades from colleagues on both sides of the aisle for her work on areas such as criminal justice and prison reform, foster care and child welfare. She began her career as a physician assistant in the emergency room in Los Angeles County, and later sought to bring together Black and Latino community organizers in South LA in the early 1990s to address the root causes of crime and the crack epidemic through the nonprofit she co-founded, Community Coalition.\n\nIn 2004, she was elected to the California state Assembly, where she made history some four years later as the first Black woman to serve as speaker of a state. Following the 2008 financial crisis, her work with other state legislative leaders to make tough budget decisions earned her a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2010.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Joe Biden vetted Bass, the then-chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, to be his running mate in 2020 while she was leading negotiations on legislation to create greater police accountability following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nOn Thursday, she said she welcomed Caruso voters “in every aspect of my administration” and said she hoped to be able to collaborate with her former opponent as she begins her new role.\n\nWhen asked whether she would still consider Caruso a friend after their fierce contest – given that he spent more than $100 million, much of it his own money, to defeat her – she said she viewed campaigns “like an athletic competition. You fight with everything that you have. But when the when the game is over, it’s over.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/11/06/election-2019-women-elected-des-moines-area-mayor-city-council-positions-seats/4169472002/", "title": "A seat at the council table: Women now hold elected positions in ...", "text": "Every city in the Des Moines metro will have at least one woman in an elected position after Tuesday's municipal election.\n\nVoters in Altoona and Urbandale — two cities without a woman in a leadership role — elected women to city council seats, and Waukee voters elected Courtney Clarke as the city's first woman mayor.\n\nThe number of women running in the metro's 10 largest cities this election cycle was up 45% from 2017.

Here's a look at some of the biggest cases on deck.\n\nAffirmative action over?\n\nBackground: Among the most closely watched cases at the Supreme Court this term involve race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard College and the University of North Carolina. Those schools consider race as one of many factors in deciding whether to accept prospective students, a policy that is consistent with current Supreme Court precedent. But an anti-affirmative action group has argued the policies discriminate against Asian American and white candidates in violation of federal law and the Constitution.\n\nArgument: During nearly five hours of arguments on Oct. 31, several of the court's conservative justices appeared skeptical of race-conscious admissions and potentially willing to overturn prior precedent on the issue. Many of the conservatives zeroed in on a section of the 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger decision in which the court included a potential timeline of 25 years for ending race-conscious admissions.\n\nThe court's liberal justices, meanwhile, defended the need for race-conscious policies. \"I thought that part of what it meant to be an American and to believe in American pluralism is that, actually, our institutions are reflective of who we are as a people in all our variety,\" Justice Elena Kagan said.\n\nDecision: Expected in June.\n\nTitle: Students for Fair Admissions v.

University of North Carolina.\n\nRead more:\n\n►Arguments:Supreme Court signals skepticism of race-conscious college admissions\n\n►Roberts:Supreme Court fight over admissions puts focus on John Roberts\n\n►Brown:Affirmative action cases spark debate over meaning of Brown v. Board\n\n►Spillover:Supreme Court's affirmative action cases could affect private e\n\nBiden's student loan plan under fire\n\nArgument: The court's conservative majority signaled deep skepticism about Biden's plan during arguments in February, suggesting a majority is leaning toward a conclusion that the president overstepped his power. During the course of more than three hours of arguments, the justices prodded Biden's attorneys for answers about why the student loan plan was different from other emergency policies the court has struck down.\n\nDecision: Timing unclear.\n\nTitle: Biden v. Nebraska and Department of Education v. Brown. Read more:\n\n►Granted:Supreme Court agrees to hear arguments on Biden's student loan plan\n\n►Power?: Biden's ability to bypass Congress faces 'major' legal hurdle\n\n►Extension:Biden offers extension on student loan repayments\n\nLGBTQ rights and speech\n\nBackground: Seven years after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in a watershed civil rights decision, religious business owners and LGBTQ individuals remain locked in a battle over whether businesses that sell goods and services to the public may reject LGBTQ couples as customers. This term, the high court must decide whether a graphic designer may decline to make websites for same-sex marriages. The designer claims that Colorado's anti-discrimination law forces her to create the websites – and to condone a message approving of same-sex marriages – against her will, which would violate the First Amendment's prohibition on compelled speech. The state counters that it is not attempting to regulate speech but rather commerce: The designer can say whatever she wants on her websites, but she can't deny selling them to same-sex couples.\n\nArgument: A majority of the Supreme Court appeared sympathetic to the web designer, embracing the idea that Colorado's anti-discrimination law cannot compel her to communicate messages that she objects to on religious grounds. The two-and-a-half-hour debate centered on whether same-sex couples would be denied wedding websites because of their status as LGBTQ individuals – a result that might favor the state – or whether the designer has a right to refuse to endorse a message of approval of same-sex marriage. \"This is not a hotel,\" Associate Justice Clarence Thomas said at one point, suggesting the state may have been defining the types of businesses covered under its anti-discrimination law too broadly. The court's three liberal justices appeared mostly aligned in favor of Colorado's law.\n\nDecision: To be determined.\n\nTitle: 303 Creative v. Aubrey Elenis\n\nRead more:\n\n►Arguments:Supreme Court signals support for website designer who wants to decline same-sex weddings\n\n►LGBTQ rights v. speech:Supreme Court to debate whether businesses may decline to provide services to same-sex weddings\n\n►Granted:Supreme Court to decide if designer may decline same-sex weddings\n\nVoting Rights Act could be weakened\n\nBackground: The Supreme Court is deciding a major case that may weaken the Voting Rights Act. At issue is an Alabama congressional redistricting map that includes only one majority Black district out of seven, even though African Americans make up more than a quarter of the state's population. The plaintiffs say the new map violates the Voting Rights Act by diluting the power of Black voters. Alabama counters that the Voting Rights Act prohibits states from approving discriminatory maps but that it does not act as a command compelling states to draw an additional minority-majority district at the expense of all other factors, such as keeping counties and other political subdivisions together.\n\nArgument: The court heard oral arguments in the Alabama redistricting case on Oct. 4. There appeared to be a majority for supporting Alabama but perhaps on narrower grounds than the state is seeking. Justice Samuel Alito was the most vocal of the conservative justices and he acknowledged that some of the state's arguments were \"quite far-reaching.\" Some of the conservatives, including Justice Brett Kavanaugh, appeared to be searching for a more limited way to decide the case. What was clear: The liberal wing of the court opposes Alabama. Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson pummeled Alabama with questions about its position as well as the court's commitment to the Voting Rights Act.\n\nDecision: Uncertain.\n\nTitle: The redistricting case is Merrill v. Milligan.\n\nRead more:\n\n►Alabama:Supreme Court delves into Alabama brawl over race, redistricting and Voting Rights Act\n\n►Elections clause:Supreme Court pressed to give state legislatures more power to oversee federal elections\n\n►2020:How the Supreme Court is already influencing the November midterm elections\n\nMaintaining the internet with Section 230\n\nBackground: Since more than a decade before the first iPhone was released, internet companies have been shielded from legal liability for the user-generated content on their platforms. That's important, the companies argue, because they might otherwise be forced to review every post on their sites. At issue in the case is whether companies may be held liable not for the content itself but rather the targeted recommendations of that content to specific users, a process that is often handled by an algorithm. The suit was filed by the family of a 23-year-old U.S. citizen who was killed in an Islamic State group attack in Paris in 2015. The family alleged the company was partly responsible because it promoted videos and other content that propagated the terrorist group’s message.\n\nA related case, Twitter v. Taamneh, raises the question of whether Twitter, Google and other platforms may be held liable for \"aiding and abetting\" the Islamic State group and other terrorist organizations under the Anti-Terrorism Act.\n\nArgument: The Supreme Court seemed hesitant to hand down a sweeping ruling that could change the way search engines and other websites recommend content to users during arguments on Feb. 21. But the justices struggled with how to address whether Big Tech can ever be held liable when those recommendations cause harm. In the related Twitter case a day later, there appeared to be skepticism aboutthe idea that the internet companies could be held liable for an attack just because they hosted content that may have inspired people to join terrorist groups.\n\nDecision: In a major win for Google and other Big Tech firms, the Supreme Court on May 18 kept the status quo in place, sidestepping the questions about Section 230. A unanimous court sided with Twitter, in an opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas, holding that the families could not bring their lawsuits against the social media companies because they had not actually aided and abetted in the terrorist attack carried about by the Islamic State group. Because the lawsuits failed there was no need to decide whether the companies could raise Section 230 as a defense.\n\nTitle: Gonzalez v. Google and Twitter v. Taamneh.\n\nRead more:\n\nDecision:In win for Google, Supreme Court sidesteps question some feared could break the internet\n\nArguments:Supreme Court eager to steer clear of sweeping changes to internet in Section 230 case\n\n►Granted:Supreme Court to hear challenge to law that shields internet c\n\n►Explainer:Everything you need to know about Section 230 and why everyone hates it\n\n►Thomas:Supreme Court dismisses case on Trump blocking of critics on Twitter\n\nImmigration\n\nBackground: Like other administrations, Biden's Department of Homeland Security wants to prioritize for deportation immigrants it believes pose a threat to national security or public safety. Other immigrants would be less of a priority. Texas and Louisiana sued. The states say that federal immigration law requires the administration to detain and deport specific categories of immigrants and that Biden is reading more leeway into the law than is permitted. The policy at issue is separate from the Title 42 program that expired in May.\n\nArgument: During more than two hours of at times intense oral argument, the justices appeared split in unconventional ways – particularly when it came to some of the procedural questions raised by the challenge from Texas and Louisiana. Chief Justice John Roberts pushed hard on the notion of reading the plain text of the law, which says the federal government \"shall\" detain certain immigrants (though he later noted that sometimes the high court doesn't read that word as a command). Justice Brett Kavanaugh questioned whether a win for Texas and Louisiana would change anything practically, since the administration doesn't have the resources to apprehend every immigrant in the country illegally. Justice Elena Kagan questioned whether a ruling for the states would open the door to more states suing to stop policies they don't like from presidents of either party. \"We're just going to be in a situation where every administration is confronted by suits by states that can bring a policy to a dead halt, to a dead stop by just showing a dollar's worth of costs?\" she said.\n\nDecision: Uncertain.\n\nTitle: U.S. v. Texas.\n\nRead more:\n\n►Arguments:Supreme Court grapples with challenge to Biden immigration policy\n\n►Preview:Supreme Court returns to immigration in test of Biden's power\n\n►Granted:Supreme Court blocks Biden from implementing immigration policy\n\nNative American adoptions\n\nBackground: Congress passed a law in 1978 to stop the forced removal of Native American children from their tribes – a practice that began in the 19th century and led to hundreds of thousands of removals. One of the law's provisions is a mandate that authorities give preference to Native American families when a Native American child is placed for adoption. Several states and non-Native families seeking to adopt sued, arguing the preferential treatment violates the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause.\n\nArgument: During more than three hours of oral argument on Nov. 9, several members of the court's conservative wing indicated that they were inclined to view the adoption preferences in the law as race-based, which suggests the court may be leaning toward finding the law unconstitutional – or at least some portions of it. Yet some of the justices appeared to be searching for a narrow outcome, focusing on specific provisions or debating if the correct parties are involved in the case. The high court's three-member liberal wing and Justice Neil Gorsuch, who has often broken with his conservative colleagues on tribal issues, signaled their support for the law.\n\nDecision: TBD.\n\nTitle: There are multiple consolidated cases, including Haaland v. Brackeen.\n\nRead more:\n\n►Arguments:Supreme Court grapples with battle over adoption of Native American children\n\n►Adoptions:For Native Americans, a 1978 adoption law protects children. Critics see a racial preference.\n\n►Granted:Supreme Court takes up battle over adoption of Native American children\n\nAndy Warhol, Prince and copyright\n\nBackground:Photographer Lynn Goldsmith took a portrait of the musician Prince in 1981. The artist Andy Warhol, who died in 1987, relied on the image to create a work of art. Goldsmith sued Warhol's foundation for copyright infringement. The Warhol foundation argued that the art was \"transformative,\" one of the standards courts use to decide such claims. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit said that a work of art is not transformative if it is \"both recognizably deriving from, and retaining the essential elements of, its source material.\" Otherwise, the appeals court reasoned, movie adaptations of books could, for instance, make subtle changes to get around copyright laws. The question for the high court is whether an artwork is \"transformative\" if it conveys a different meaning or message than the original work it is based on.\n\nArgument: Copyright litigation often blurs the traditional conservative-liberal divisions on the Supreme Court and it was not clear which way the justices are leaning. After nearly two hours of argument on Oct. 12, it seemed Justice Samuel Alito was concerned about the implications of the Warhol foundation's position. \"How is a court to determine the message or meaning of works of art?\" he asked. Justice Elena Kagan posed similar questions but also pressed the attorney for Goldsmith. \"Why do museums show Andy Warhol? They show Andy Warhol because he was a transformative artist, because he took a bunch of photographs and he made them mean something completely different,\" Kagan said. Though it was difficult to read which way the court is leaning, the argument was an entertaining tour through pop culture and art, with the justices in one moment debating the meaning of the color Leonardo da Vinci chose for Mona Lisa's dress and, in the next, discussing the audience for the ABC sitcom \"Mork & Mindy.\"\n\nDecision: In a 7-2 decision with potentially sweeping implications for artistic creation, the Supreme Court on May 18 sided against Andy Warhol's foundation. In an opinion written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court ruled that the Prince silkscreen was not a \"fair use\" of Goldsmith's photograph because the \"degree of difference is not enough\" given that both were being used for the same commercial purpose. In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan said the court's opinion would \"make our world poorer\" by making it harder for artists like Warhol to create art based on previous works.\n\nTitle: Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts v. Goldsmith.\n\nRead more:\n\nDecision:Supreme Court rules against Andy Warhol in copyright case with implications for artists\n\n►Argued:Supreme Court debates Warhol copyright case with implications for art\n\n►Impact:How a Supreme Court case could change the face of art\n\n►Copyright:Supreme Court to hear dispute over Andy Warhol artwork\n\nReligion in the workplace\n\nBackground: In a case with big implications for the workplace, the Supreme Court is being asked to decide how far employers must go to accommodate the religious beliefs of employees. The case involves a former mail carrier in Pennsylvania who sued the U.S. Postal Service for requiring him to work on Sunday, his Sabbath. Federal law requires companies to make accommodations for workers' religious beliefs as long as it doesn't present an \"undue hardship.\" In 1977, the Supreme Court defined \"undue hardship\" as anything having more than a \"de minimis,\" or trivial cost. That means employers have been able to avoid making accommodations in many situations, although the federal government has questioned how widespread the issue is.\n\nArgument: A majority signaled during arguments April 18 that the court may rethink the standard but many also appeared to be searching for a narrow outcome that might tinker with the standard rather than scrapping it entirely. Several of the court's conservatives are on record in other cases seeking to revisit the \"de minimis\" standard, including Justice Neil Gorsuch. During arguments, Gorsuch suggested there might be common ground in clarifying that standard set by the court in 1977 was always supposed to be higher than a trivial cost.\n\nDecision: Unclear\n\nTitle: Groff v.

The first couple months of 2020 had already started with a familiar drumbeat of bad news.\n\nTensions with Iran were growing. There were mass shootings at an apartment complex in Colorado, a high school in Texas and a brewery in Wisconsin. The U.S. Senate had been consumed in a witness-free impeachment trial of the president.\n\nMore:'I feel like a piece of me died with him': How COVID ravaged Palm Beach County\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle announced they were stepping down from their royal obligations. The Boy Scouts filed for bankruptcy due to sexual-abuse lawsuits. And Former NBA star Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven others were killed when their helicopter ran in a fog-shrouded mountain in Southern California.\n\nAlmost lost in this mix of events was a Jan. 9 announcement by the World Health Organization that a novel virus had been discovered in Wuhan, China.\n\nIn two months, that virus alert would reframe the whole world in a way that most Americans had never imagined, a world that would lead to more than 530,000 deaths in the U.S. in a year, matching the number of combined dead from World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.\n\nAnd not even the arrival of “murder hornets” to the U.S. or a hurricane season with a record 30 named storms in the Atlantic could compete.\n\nThe virus would turn out to be a kind of viral news story itself, one that constantly lingered and made its presence known. In a short-attention-span world, it was here for the long haul, consigning hundreds of thousands of people to die alone. Separating hug-deprived family members on the other side of glass walls. And leaving many a would-be bride lamenting her missed wedding day.\n\nPandemic stole in-person farewells from a whole class of students\n\nIt made the Class of 2020 say their farewells on a computer screen instead of an auditorium. It emptied bars, restaurants and movie theaters, and it made curbside pickup and home delivery the new normal.\n\nSupermarkets were suddenly populated by a new class of workers who were paid to shop for somebody else. Rush-hour traffic on Interstate 95 fell as work-from-home precautions and a dramatic increase in unemployment bloomed. And Burberry became the first luxury brand to offer designer face masks for sale, priced at $118.\n\nMore:COVID outbreak in Belle Glade: How its hospital, mayor and commissioner have led the city's response\n\nIt was a boon to Netflix shows like “Tiger King” while it spread its infection to a real-life tiger in the Bronx Zoo. It replaced handshakes with elbow bumps, and created runs on disinfectants, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer.\n\nIt has been with us for a year now, a year of ups and downs, of surges and ebbs, of new strains and old habits. A lot of that early dread has gone as an altered routine and rules of public interactions created recognition of a temporarily changed world.\n\n“Got your mask?”\n\nIt’s the new essential – along with phone, wallet, keys – for launching out into the world.\n\nNow, the things with feathers are the vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson that are finding their way into arms at a rate of nearly 3 million Americans a day. The race is on to inoculate people ahead of the virus’ ability to mutate.\n\nIt’s a good race to win.\n\nMarch 11: The day the coronavirus brought lives to a standstill\n\nIf you had to pick a date when the virus demonstrated itself to be a life-altering event in the U.S., it was March 11 of last year.\n\nThe stock market tumbled 1,450 points that day on the news that the World Health Organization had declared the virus a global pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, a government official unfamiliar to most Americans, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified before a U.S. House committee that day about the approaching pandemic.\n\n“We must be much more serious as a country about what we might expect,” Fauci told the lawmakers. “We cannot look at it and say, ‘Well, there are only a couple of cases here; that’s good.’ Because a couple of cases today are going to be many, many cases tomorrow.”\n\nThat night, then-President Donald Trump, who had been mostly dismissive in his comments on the virus, gave a 10-minute address from the Oval Office, talking about new efforts “to confront a foreign virus” and announcing new travel restrictions to Europe.\n\nBut the most dramatic event of the day came that night during an NBA game between the Utah Jazz and the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nWhile the teams were in the locker room for halftime, the league canceled the rest of the game and the rest of the season for the entire league.\n\nMore:Coronavirus stimulus in Palm Beach County: How much is your city getting?\n\n“We made this decision to safeguard the health and well-being of fans, players and everyone connected to our game and the general public … ” NBA commissioner Adam Silver wrote the next day in a letter to the fans. “This remains a complicated and rapidly evolving situation that reminds us that we all are part of a broader society with a responsibility to look out for one another.”\n\nIt was on that night that actor Tom Hanks, shooting a movie in Australia, announced that he and his wife Rita Wilson had both contracted the virus.\n\nThe dominos quickly started falling internationally, nationally and locally. The summer Olympic Games in Tokyo were called off.\n\nMajor League Baseball’s spring training in Florida and Arizona ended abruptly. The Houston Astros and Washington National’s facility in West Palm Beach, The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, was turned into a drive-up COVID-19 testing site.\n\nWalt Disney World closed its parks after that weekend, and left them empty for the next three months.\n\nThe Kravis Center, and the rest of local South Florida live theaters, canceled the rest of their season’s shows. And the Palm Beach International Boat Show, which had already been constructing the portable docks along the West Palm Beach waterfront for its March 25-28 show, called it off.\n\nSo did SunFest, which had just announced its lineup of musical talent for its annual May festival.\n\nThe cruise ship industry shut down. Schools, from kindergartens to colleges, started making the change from in-person classes to virtual online sessions. So did courts, government bodies and some doctor visits.\n\nThe word “Zoom” became a verb, as in, “We can’t meet in person, so we’ll have to Zoom this.” People started working from home.\n\nOr not at all. Shuttered businesses put many out of work. About 10 million Americans filed for unemployment. When unemployment in Florida surged to nearly 13 percent, the state’s online portal for claims crashed, frustrating those hoping for relief.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis acknowledged the problem.\n\n“This was a system that was designed to have 1,000 individual users on the website at a given time, and you could surge it to 5,000,” DeSantis said. “Well, when you’re in a situation like this, that’s the equivalent of throwing a jalopy in the Daytona 500. It’s just not going to cut it.”\n\nThe virus, particularly dangerous to older people, started taking its human toll.\n\nMark Greenberg, 88, who lived in the Polo Club of Boca Raton, died March 14 of last year – the first Palm Beach County resident to die from COVID-19.\n\nWithin a month, there would be more than 100 other county residents who would die from the virus, most of them 65 years old or older.\n\nAnd over the virus’ first 12 months, nearly 2 million Americans will have contracted it, resulting in more than half a million deaths, including more than 32,000 in Florida.\n\nMasks: The thin layer of fabric that became a social, political flashpoint\n\nIt turned out that 2020 was a bad year for one that required keeping people away from each other. That’s because it was also a presidential election year, a time when large crowds naturally gather at campaign events.\n\nAnd it also happened to be a year marked by large public street demonstrations over the deaths of three black Americans: Ahmaud Arbery, a jogger in Georgia; George Floyd, a Minnesota man who died from a police officer kneeling on his neck; and Breonna Taylor, a Kentucky woman who died during a botched police raid on her apartment.\n\nThe administration of then-President Donald Trump, which had been slow to acknowledge the pandemic’s arrival, was quick to declare an early end to it when it had just gotten started.\n\n“The virus that we’re talking about having to do, a lot of people think that goes away in April, with the heat, as the heat comes in, typically that will go away in April,” Trump said.\n\nTrump called for “packed churches” on Easter Sunday and a reopening of businesses in April, and a resumption of normal life.\n\n“We’re opening up this incredible country, because we have to do that,” Trump said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who chaired the Coronavirus Task Force, predicted the virus would be gone by Memorial Day.\n\nBut this was not the kind of virus that could be wished away, or fixed by too-good-to-be-true cures like hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to fight malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.\n\nWhile real cures in the form of vaccines were months away, many people were either encouraged to flaunt mask and distance safety protocols in public gatherings, or tolerated when they did so. To mimic normalcy when normalcy wasn’t a medically safe thing to do.\n\nSpring breakers still flocked to Florida.\n\n“If I get corona, I get corona,” Ohio spring breaker Brady Sluder said during a TV interview in Miami last year. “At the end of the day, it’s not going to stop me from partying.”\n\nFast forward to this year’s spring break, and the story’s the same. Spring breakers are back, and not wearing masks or practicing social distancing.\n\n“Granny shouldn’t be out here anyways; it’s too many people,” Ace Beck, an Alabama spring breaker in Miami Beach, told the Tampa Bay Times last week.\n\nIt was as if the country was on two tracks heading in opposite directions.\n\nWhile drug trials of lifesaving vaccines were being raced to completion in a federal government operation known as Operation Warp Speed, lifesaving safety protocols were being widely ignored and ridiculed by large segments of the population.\n\nTrump, trying to portray a minimum of concern, held large, maskless rallies, making the wearing of masks a political gesture.\n\nPeople disparaging masks called them “face diapers” and disregarded public health officials' advisories about the efficacy of masks in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nIn his testimony before a U.S. Senate committee, Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control, testified that masks were essential.\n\n\"I'm not going to comment directly about the president, but I am going to comment as the CDC director that face masks, these face masks, are the most important, powerful public health tool we have,\" Redfield said. \"And I will continue to appeal for all Americans, all individuals in our country, to embrace these face coverings.\"\n\nAnti-maskers sued Palm Beach County over its mask requirement\n\nIn Palm Beach County, four mask protesters sued the county over its mask requirement, claiming that covering their noses and mouths interfered with their “personal liberty, and constitutional rights, including but not limited to freedom of speech, right to privacy, in addition to the constitutionally protected right to enjoy and defend life and liberty.”\n\nMask protesters speaking at County Commission meetings even threatened local lawmakers with citizens’ arrests.\n\n“You literally cannot mandate somebody to wear a mask knowing that that mask is killing people,” one of the mask protesters told Palm Beach County commissioners at a June meeting. “ … Every single one of you that are obeying the devil’s laws are going to be arrested.”\n\nUnlike some other governors, DeSantis rejected statewide mask mandates, and instead ordered a million doses of hydroxychloroquine after Trump incorrectly touted the drug as a \"game changer\" in fighting COVID-19.\n\nEven when cases spiked in June, DeSantis rejected calls for statewide mask requirements.\n\n\"I do think that a lot of this is voluntary compliance,\" DeSantis said. \"You're just not going to be able to police every single group of people, every single time. And so I think as you get into this month after month, I think people do get a little tired, particularly in some of the age groups that may not be as at risk.\"\n\nTrump’s aversion to wearing masks and limiting crowd sizes ended in an outbreak of COVID-19 at the White House in early October, where it infected both Trump and his wife, Melania.\n\nTrump, whose oxygen levels were perilously low, was flown to Walter Reed Hospital, where he received experimental anti-viral treatments that kept him from needing a ventilator.\n\n\"One thing that's for certain: Don't let it dominate you. Don't be afraid of it. You're going to beat it,\" Trump said after he recovered. \"We have the best medical equipment. We have the best medicines.\"\n\nVaccines weren't an issue; Scheduling for a shot was\n\nThe November presidential election, in many ways, was a national referendum on the government’s response to COVID-19. Exit polls showed that those who viewed the pandemic as the most important issue voted for President Joe Biden, while those who considered the economy as the primary issue voted for Trump.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was cited as the most important issue, with most Trump voters considering it under control, while most Biden voters considered “not at all under control,” according to exit polling.\n\nIn December, with cases rising, and intensive care units at hospital reaching capacity, California began a monthlong stay-at-home order.\n\nThat same month, Florida followed California and Texas as the third state to report more than 1 million cases, with another spike in progress.\n\nBy Christmas, Johns Hopkins University would report that the United States had more than 18.8 million recorded COVID-19 cases, the largest number in the world.\n\nBut help was on the way: The newly approved vaccines were arriving. On Dec. 14, Sandra Lindsay, a critical-care nurse in New York, became the first American to be vaccinated.\n\nBy the end of the month, both the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines were approved for use, and the race was on.\n\nHealth-care workers and nursing-home patients were the first to get vaccinated, as governors each developed their own pecking order for vaccinations.\n\nIn Florida, people who were 65 years and older were approved, and a good bit of the vaccinations were handled through the pharmacies at Publix Super Markets around the state.\n\nUsing an early-morning online reservation system, retirees all over Florida were scrambling to make appointments for the in-demand shots.\n\nThe scarcity of the shots was exacerbated by what became known as “vaccine tourism,” as out-of-state residents flocked to Florida to reserve vaccination slots.\n\nEventually, this resulted in the state requiring that vaccinations only be given to those senior citizens who showed proof of their residency.\n\nBut even without the vaccine tourists, getting an appointment during those first two months wasn’t easy.\n\n“It took me five times,” said John Fuchs, 86, of West Palm Beach. “Each morning was a couple of hours on the computer.\n\n“One time, I got right to the end of signing up, and then it blocked me before I could submit it.”\n\nFuchs, desperate to get vaccinations for him and his wife, had a team of his adult children and friends getting on the computer each morning in hopes of securing an appointment. He had a son in New York, and another one in South Carolina, and a daughter in California. And he had friends in Boca Raton and Fort Lauderdale.\n\n“Eventually, my daughter in California was the one who got through,” he said. “She was the one who was able to get the appointments.”\n\nBiden promised 100M vaccinations during his first 100 days in office\n\nBiden, who promised 100 million vaccinations during his first 100 days in office, has made good on his promise. And with the introduction of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the U.S. is on a trajectory to have shots available to all by May, Biden said.\n\n“If we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school and we’ll have proven once again that this country can do anything,” Biden said.\n\nBut he also warned against complacency and relaxing safety protocols too soon.\n\n“Just as we were emerging from the dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer, (now) is not the time to not stick with the rules,” he said.\n\nBut that is what is happening in certain parts of the country.\n\nIn the beginning of March, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order calling for the end of mask mandates.\n\n\"With the medical advancements of vaccines and antibody therapeutic drugs, Texas now has the tools to protect Texans from the virus,” Abbott said. \"We must now do more to restore livelihoods and normalcy for Texans by opening Texas 100 percent.”\n\nIn Idaho, a group converged on the state capitol in Boise to burn their COVID-19 masks in protest of that city’s mask mandate.\n\nMore:Coronavirus: DeSantis lays groundwork to overturn local mask mandates, chides 'lockdown' states\n\nIn Florida, DeSantis sounded a similarly defiant note this month by issuing an executive order rescinding all COVID-19-related fines.\n\n“When you tell them you have to abide by all these restrictions — I think it’s odd to tell people to get the vaccine and nothing changes,” DeSantis said at a news conference. “But the whole reason to get the vaccine is to not have to worry.”\n\nMore:Coronavirus: DeSantis lays groundwork to overturn local mask mandates, chides 'lockdown' states\n\nDeSantis drank a beer and posed for selfies with mostly maskless revelers at Bike Week in Daytona Beach this month, where hundreds of thousands of motorcyclists from around the country had gathered.\n\nMeanwhile, the leaders of South Florida’s three counties, Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade, issued a joint-statement of caution.\n\n“While our positivity rate continues to trend in the right direction and vaccination efforts are accelerating, now is not the time to throw caution to the wind as we are so close to putting this pandemic behind us,” the statement reads.\n\nIt went to say that DeSantis “inadvertently sends a message to residents and the business community alike that common-sense measures to fight COVID-19 are no longer needed — when we know that they do in fact work to prevent the spread, and most importantly save lives.”\n\nThe stimulus checks are in the mail. So when do we return to normal?\n\nThis month, Congress passed along party lines a $1.9 trillion COVID-relief package called the American Rescue Plan.\n\nIt provides $1,400 checks to most individuals, extends unemployment benefits to Labor Day and issues child tax credits of $3,000 per year.\n\nIt also gives $350 billion to state, local and tribal governments to shore up their losses due to the pandemic, and another $28.6 billion to a Restaurant Revitalization Fund to help restaurants stricken by the pandemic.\n\nMore:Coronavirus stimulus in Palm Beach County: How much is your city getting?\n\nThe law spends $130 billion on K-12 schools to address things such as ventilation and class-size restrictions, and spends another $40 billion for grants to college students.\n\nWhile Republicans have characterized the new law as a grab bag of wasteful spending, public opinion polls have been more supportive.\n\n“About four-in-ten Americans (41%) say the proposed spending on the bill is about right, while a third say the proposed spending in the bill is too much and a quarter say the amount of allocated money is too little,” a Pew Research Center study found this month.\n\nIt’s been a long year, but there are signs that normalcy is making slow, measured, progress against the virus.\n\nFor example, the Palm Beach International Boat Show that was abruptly canceled last March is happening next week.\n\n“All show staff, exhibitors and attendees will be required to have their temperatures checked before entering the show,” the organizers announced, “and it will be mandatory to wear face masks.”\n\nfcerabino@pbpost.com\n\n@FranklyFlorida", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/22"}]}

And this combination, along with sheer grit, may very well explain how they've survived for so long\n\nOne notable omission in the list that follows is the landmark MacAlpine’s Diner and Soda Fountain, the cherished throwback diner, ice cream shop and antique store that Fred MacAlpine opened in 1929. MacAlpine’s is temporarily closed due to the death of one of founders and staff shortages, according to a statement on the website, though they plan to try to reopen in the spring of 2022. The restaurant is selling gift cards online to help fund the reopening.\n\nAll the restaurants on this list have all held their own for more than half a century, surviving natural disasters, the ups and downs of the economy, a global pandemic, rising food costs and labor shortages. So if you're in the mood for a meal with a side of history, check out one of these storied spots.\n\nNew classics:My favorite burgers in Phoenix, ranked from great to game changing\n\nLa Fonda Mexican Restaurant\n\nYear opened: 1967\n\nA Tempe mainstay for more than half a century, La Fonda moved into its current spot in Chandler earlier this year following the retirement of Ray and Janet Pedraza, the second generation to run this family-owned spot. The third generation keeps the tradition alive by using Eloise Franklin’s recipes. While the location has changed, signature dishes such as the pollo fundido burro, steak and chicken fajita combo and chile con carne simmered in homemade green or red sauce and served with tortillas, remain true to the original.\n\nDetails: 2051 W. Chandler Blvd., Chandler. 480-966-8001, lafondatempe.com.\n\nMrs. White’s Golden Rule Cafe\n\nYear opened: 1964\n\nThis cozy and welcoming downtown Phoenix southern comfort food haven has served its famous smothered pork chops, southern fried chicken, catfish, black-eyed peas and freshly made cobblers and pies to the likes of Jesse Jackson, James Brown, Devin Booker and John McCain, all of whom were regulars. While customers now represent all walks of life, when founder Elizabeth White first brought her recipes from Texas to Phoenix, parts of the city were still segregated. Yet, the single mom of four welcomed all. White retired in the ‘80s and now her son Larry Sr. is at the helm.\n\nDetails: 808 E. Jefferson St., Phoenix. 602-262-9256. facebook.com/mrswhites.goldenrulecafe.\n\n25 must-try Arizona burritos:Best burros in Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff, Yuma and beyond\n\nLa Placita Cafe\n\nYear opened: 1962\n\nLow-key, rustic and very homey, this Mexican eatery in the heart of downtown Buckeye continues to draw diners with family recipes that date back several generations. Founders Manuel and Nellie Amabisca opened their doors way before urban development moved west of 51st Avenue and I-10 was the only freeway that touched the West Valley. Many of the original recipes remain on the menu today, including enchiladas and the green chile crisp — called GCC by those in the know — which has become a legendary staple. The spin on the Arizona cheese crisp stuffs an ample dose of green chiles and loads of cheese into a folded flour tortilla that’s grilled to crispy-on-the-outside-goey-on-the-inside perfection.\n\nDetails: 424 E. Monroe Ave., Buckeye. 623-386-4632.\n\nSugar Bowl\n\nYear opened: 1958\n\nWalking into this third-generation run family business is like stepping back into the olden days of Old Town Scottsdale. The classic spot still features heart-shaped tables, pink booths and the original soda fountain, all encased in a building bathed in bubble gum pink. Ben Huntress took over the endearing spot from his father Carroll, who bought it from his uncle Jack, the original owner. The menu is a playful balance of old school ice cream parlor flavors and throwback options like sundaes, malts, ice cream sodas, and diner fare like tuna melts, jello and even a diet plate of sliced turkey, fruit and cottage cheese. The Sugar Bowl was immortalized in a number of the late Bill Keane’s Family Circus cartoons. It was also a regular stop of the late Bill Thompson, also known as Wallace of the iconic Arizona children’s show Wallace and Ladmo, which he created.\n\nDetails: 4005 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale. 480-946-0051, sugarbowlscottsdale.com.\n\nDurant’s\n\nYear opened: 1950\n\nThe speakeasy vibe at Durant's starts with the clandestine rear entrance through the kitchen and continues with tuxedo clad servers, dim lighting, plushy booths and red wallpaper. The feel of old school Vegas is no coincidence. In the ‘40s Jack Durant worked as a pit boss at the Flamingo Hotel for legendary gangster Bugsey Siegal. His biography was also adapted into a movie, “Durant’s Never Closes” starring Tom Sizemore as the larger than life namesake. Durant, the audacious and colorful original owner of the central Phoenix restaurant created a place that is still known for the vibe as much as for the martinis and steaks.\n\nDetails: 2611 N. Central Ave., Phoenix. 602-264-5967, durantsaz.com.\n\nAn essential:Why I take everyone to this old school Vietnamese restaurant\n\nLos Olivos Mexican Patio\n\nYear opened: 1946\n\nIn the ‘30s, original owner Tomas Corral built a structure that would be a chapel, bar, pool hall and bakery before it became the restaurant that it is today, still serving home-style Sonoran plates. Corral and his family left Mexico in 1919 because his mother did not want her sons working in the mines and sought a better life for them to the north. The restaurant survived condemnation during the 1970’s redevelopment of what was referred to as the Scottsdale “barrio,” thanks to former senator Barry Goldwater’s intervention. It was the only business to do so. Safely in the hands of a third generation, Los Olivos remains a historic draw for old and new patrons alike who flock for Corral specialties like steak, chicken or shrimp fajitas, machaca and the Mexican Flag combo of three enchiladas topped with red sauce, sour cream and green chile sauce.\n\nDetails: 7328 E. Second St., Scottsdale. 480-946-2256, losolivosrestaurants.com.\n\nMacayo’s Mexican Food\n\nYear opened: 1946\n\nWhen founders Woody and Victoria Johnson opened their little Mexican cuisine spot Woody’s El Nido in central Phoenix, they likely had no idea their family business would boom into a Valleywide chain with eight restaurants. They also probably didn’t predict how an accident would make Arizona culinary history. According to legend, Woody was playing around in the kitchen when he accidentally dropped a meat-filled burrito into a fryer. And voila — the chimichanga was born. Many others claim the chimichanga as their own inventions, but wherever it originated, Macayo's continues to turn out a classic version. Though it's no longer family owned, as it was sold in 2019, you can still order the old school Mexican comfort food it's offered for decades, along with newly added vegetarian and gluten-free versions of favorites like fajitas, tacos, enchiladas and nachos.\n\nDetails: 650 N. Scottsdale Road, Tempe. Other locations at macayo.com.\n\nPete’s Fish & Chips\n\nYear opened: 1947\n\nHow does a fish and chips joint find a home in the desert? Founder Peter McLane Grant Jr. contracted malaria and rheumatic fever in the jungles of the South Pacific while serving in the military in World War II. Doctors told the Indianapolis native to move to a hot, dry climate to recover. With $900 in his pocket, his pregnant wife Ruth in the passenger seat and everything they owned stuffed into a trailer towed behind their car Grant made the trek to Phoenix with the intention of teaching history at a Phoenix elementary school. Call it cold feet or a wild hair, but Grant chucked the teaching gig and instead poured his cash into a restaurant inspired by the fish and chips shops he saw in Europe during the war. He started with a 6-foot by 8-foot shack with no running water near 31st and Van Buren streets, offering a one-piece fish and chips meal for 35 cents, two burgers for 25 cents and soda for 5 cents. Today, eight locations span the Valley from Tolleson to Mesa. In addition to fish, the cash-only eatery has added shrimp, crabettes, scallops and even chicken nuggets to its “chips” duo offerings.\n\nDetails: Multiple locations at petesfishandchips.com.\n\nThe Stockyards\n\nYear opened: 1947\n\nThis Phoenix steakhouse has origins as a packing house that supported “Cattle Baron” Edward A. Tovrea’s growing beef operations in 1919. Fast forward three decades and The Stockyards restaurant and saloon officially opened and became a favorite gathering spot for cattlemen, bankers and politicians alike. While cattle fortunes faded by the late ‘50s, making way for urban growth, Arizona’s Original Steakhouse stood strong. It withstood a devastating fire and yearlong closure and underwent an extensive restoration in 2004.\n\nThe Stockyards’ role in the state’s cattle industry and architectural style earned it a spot on the Phoenix Historical Register. Today, the menu remains true to that heritage with aged steaks and prime rib. There’s also the calf fries, their version of rocky mountain oysters, which have graced the menu since it opened. Oh, and good authority has it this spot is also haunted. So if you see lights flickering or a chandelier shaking for no apparent reason, or a woman mysteriously appearing and disappearing in the restroom, you’re probably not imagining it.\n\nDetails: 5009 E. Washington St., Phoenix. 602-273-7378, stockyardssteakhouse.com.\n\nMore haunts:The ghost stories behind the 6 most spirited restaurants in Phoenix\n\nMiracle Mile\n\nYear opened: 1949\n\nJosh Garcia was 12 when he started working at the eatery his grandfather founded in central Phoenix. He needed a milk crate to stand on so he could see over the counter and serve coffee to customers on Saturday mornings. Today, Miracle Mile’s vice president represents a strong third generation that keeps Brooklyn native Jack Grodzinsky’s classic deli going strong.\n\nAfter years of serving sandwiches and burgers from various locations in malls or shopping centers, Miracle Mile now operates from a stand-alone structure a few blocks from the original spot. Over the years, it has not only kept pace with an unpredictable restaurant scene, but the substantial menu has evolved to accommodate contemporary tastes with health-conscious renditions of recipes, like the Turkey Straw, a leaner version of the beloved Straw’s hot pastrami, melted Swiss and sauerkraut sandwich. One of the classic orders is The Triple Decker made with two layers of pastrami, swiss and Miracle Mile dressing that’s stacked high on three pieces of rye.\n\nDetails: 4433 N. 16th St., Phoenix, 602-776-0992, miraclemiledeli.com.\n\nEl Chorro\n\nYear opened: 1937\n\nOriginally built as a girls school in 1934, new owners converted the structure into a restaurant and lodge three years later. The picturesque spot in the center of unspoiled, idyllic desert at the foot of Camelback Mountain quickly began drawing local and national celebrities. An intensive 2009 remodel resulted in a 2010 debut of a refreshed historic favorite. New indoor and outdoor dining areas and Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEED)-certified materials were among the contemporary touches. The renovation also made El Chorro the first Arizona restaurant to earn the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED Gold Certification. The menu touts “Arizona cuisine with a Southwestern flare” with items like flash fried lobster bites with spicy chipotle lime sauce and other traditional dishes like beef stroganoff and red wine braised beef short ribs. And per tradition, a basket of the signature sticky buns comes with entree orders.\n\nDetails: 5550 E. Lincoln Drive, Paradise Valley. 480-948-5170, elchorro.com.\n\nHarold’s Cave Creek Corral\n\nYear opened: 1935\n\nIts roots date back to 1935, when owner Johnny Walker opened a bar to serve the workers building Bartlett Dam. Fifteen years later, Harold Gavagan purchased it, gave it his name and began the evolution of the landmark bar and restaurant. Gavagan’s friends helped spark countless tales about lions and tigers caged in the back of the restaurant and legends about the owner firing gunshots into the air at closing time. Over the decades movie stars came to see for themselves, raising glasses as country singers played a set or two. It’s standing room only during football season as Harold’s is the official home of “Heinz Field West,” hosting one of the biggest Pittsburgh Steelers watch parties outside of Pennsylvania. The lengthy menu remains a something-for-everybody hodgepodge with legendary pleasers such as Arizona wings, Italian-style baked stuffed hot peppers and the 14-ounce ribeye, which should be ordered with sauteed mushrooms and scallions, just like the establishment’s namesake would have.\n\nDetails: 6895 E.

If we've missed any Valley iconic businesses that have closed, add them in the comments section of the story.\n\nMany Phoenix-area restaurants, stores and other iconic businesses have come and gone in the area's history. Whether they had to shut down due to circumstance, management issues, skyrocketing prices or if they just couldn't keep up with the changing times, some of these businesses left a mark in the Valley. Here's a look at a few of the most iconic metro Phoenix businesses that have closed down.\n\nTom's Tavern\n\nJust shy of its 90th birthday, Tom’s Tavern in downtown Phoenix closed in 2017.\n\nThe iconic restaurant, a favorite of Arizona’s movers and shakers, opened in 1929.\n\nJim Gallen, the current chef-owner, released a statement via The Knight Agency, its Scottsdale-based PR firm:\n\n\"After careful consideration, Tom’s Tavern was forced to close on May 5. Owner and Chef Jim Gallen expressed great disappointment with the closure and would like to thank the loyal customers who have been with Tom’s for the last 87 years. Tom’s Tavern has a rich history in Phoenix, and has enjoyed serving many of our city’s finest. At this time, no plans have been made for the location at 2 N. Central Ave. Chef Gallen will continue cooking in the Valley and updates on his career will be announced soon.\"\n\nLegend City\n\nThe memories of this amusement park are better than the reality. Legend City changed hands four times during its 20-year lifetime. Each new owner would subtly change the park’s operations, evolving it further away from it's original Western-theme vision and more into a permanent carnival.\n\nThe original owner, Louis Crandall was inspired by Disneyland and the sudden boom of amusement parks across the country. The economic reality was it was too hot for an amusement park during Phoenix summers and winter evenings didn’t generate enough business.\n\nLegend City closed for the final time in September 1983. The park was leveled, and the grounds now hold office buildings for a public utility.Since then, there has been no amusement park like it in the area.\n\nVideo Paradise\n\nVideo Paradise in Chandler is from a bygone era, when video stores were a hot weekend stop for people of all ages and the wait for a new release created some buzz.\n\nAfter 25 years operating as a locally owned, independent store that hung on long after national chains Blockbuster and Hollywood Video closed stores across the country, the owner, Marshall Hawkins, said a \"perfect storm'' of factors led to the closure in January 2016. New in-home streaming such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, along with the proliferation of Red Box rental kiosks were one factor. Another was a change in terms of his lease at the shopping center where the store is located.\n\nHawkins, who had owned the store for its last 10 years in business, credited a loyal customer base for helping keep the store in business for a quarter of a century.\n\nEd Debevic's\n\nEd Debevic's was another family favorite, near 20th Street and Highland Avenue. Sassy waitresses served burgers and meatloaf at the retro-style diner through the '80s and '90s. The jukebox, photos and snarky neon signs went to auction when the diner closed in the early 2000s.\n\nFarrell's Ice Cream Parlour\n\nRobert Farrell opened the first of these old-fashioned ice-cream parlors in Portland, Ore., in 1963.\n\nThe family-friendly franchise came to the Valley in 1968, brought by Robert Garland, a World War II veteran who founded the Garland Advertising Agency, known for creating the branding for Del Webb's Sun City.\n\nGarland was credited with coining the line, \"Farrell's features fabulous food and fantastic fountain fantasies for frolicking, fun-filled, festive families.\"\n\nThe ice-cream shop was a popular party destination, thanks to novelties such as the Zoo, a 10-pound ice-cream sundae that vest-wearing servers wheeled to your table while making oinking noises and blaring sirens.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1990 — from the presidencies of Lyndon B. Johnson to George H.W. Bush — Garland operated five Farrell's locations around Arizona. He closed shop around 1990, when the national chain, which had passed hands among several investment groups, foundered. Garland died in 2003.\n\nChocolates by Bernard Callebaut\n\nMaster chocolatier Bernard Callebaut first brought his exquisite confections to Arizona in 1996, when he opened Chocolaterie Bernard C in Scottsdale's Hilton Village.\n\nCallebaut's Belgian family had been in the chocolate business since 1911. When the business was sold in 1980, he moved to Alberta, Canada, and started his company.\n\nThe candies — more than 48 varieties — were made in Callebaut's factory in Canada using chocolate imported from Belgium, walnuts from France, and hazelnuts and almonds from Italy.\n\nThey had no artificial preservatives, vegetable oils or animal fats, and the whipping creams and butter were so fresh that the chocolates came with two-week expiration dates.\n\nThe stores, including one in Chandler and Phoenix, sold champagne truffles, boxed collections and seasonal specials such as chocolate yule logs, the traditional French chocolate-and-cream confection.\n\nIn a 2000 story about the best chocolate for Valentine's Day, Seftel wrote, \"In this town, if you want the best, it means a trip to Chocolates by Bernard Callebaut.\"\n\nThe Chandler store closed in 2004, and the rest of the chocolates began to disappear from Arizona, and most of the country, about four years later. The good news? The company is still around and you can buy the chocolate to be shipped to your home.\n\nBaker Nursery\n\nBaker Nursery was open for about 46 years until it finally closed down its doors in late 2014.During its time in business, employees helped landscape countless Phoenix-area homes, making the valley greener and full of life with yards and gardens of hibiscus and citrus trees.\n\nThe founder, Jim Baker, bought the location at 40th Street and Osborn Road in 1968, competing with large mega-stores like Walmart and Home Depot. In 2006, he signed the company over to three of his six daughters.\n\nA-1 Beer\n\nThere was a time when every city had its own breweries, and A-1 was the major player in Phoenix. It was later bought by a larger national brewery and the quality slipped a bit. If you remembered the brand from the 50s, when it was the “Western way to say welcome,” you thought of a crisp pilsner. Those who remember the canned beer from the 70s, have less fond memories.\n\nHarkins Camelview 5\n\nAfter a 42-year run as one of the Valley's preeminent movie theaters, Harkins Camelview 5 in Scottsdale closed in December 2015, replaced by a new 14-screen cinema next door at Scottsdale Fashion Square mall. Harkins announced plans in 2013 to close Camelview, which long ago carved a niche in the Phoenix area as a destination for independent, foreign and artistic films.\n\nDowntown Deli\n\nA longtime fixture in downtown Phoenix, the Downtown Deli shuttered its doors on May 22, 2015. The deli was known for its Skyscraper sandwich with corned beef piled high with pastrami and Swiss cheese. Glenn Schultz, who owned the deli with wife Trish, said the landlord raised the rent, forcing the business to close. But, there's hope. Schultz said they're hoping to relocate the business somewhere else downtown.\n\nMy Florist Café\n\nThis bakery, sandwich shop and wine bar was one of the first of the new wave of restaurants in the central Phoenix area when it opened in 1996. It offered a pricey, but delicious, peanut butter sandwich and offered a white wine with which to pair it. The piano performances by Nicole Pesce would delight crowds.\n\nBack in its 1990s heyday, My Florist Café attracted a cool crowd of bohemians and suits, folks who had almost no downtown Phoenix-area hangout alternatives. Here you could get decent grub and big-city vibes to go with it.\n\nIt closed suddenly in 2010. More eateries had filed into downtown by then. The iconic sign was left over from when the building did house a florist beginning in 1947. Below it now is a chain hamburger restaurant.\n\n12 Valley restaurants that stand the test of time\n\nKarsh's Bakery\n\nThis venerable kosher bakery, known for its handmade challah and rye breads, Kaiser rolls and Jewish pastries, fell victim to the times. It could not compete with high volume bakeries and increasing rents. It was one of the last old-school bakeries, where bakers made pastries, bagels and breads by hand each day.\n\nKarsh's Bakery closed in March 2014, ending nearly 50 years in business. On its last day, there were lines around the block with customers who started their wait before doors opened at 7 a.m. Owners said at the time that they hoped to find a smaller, more affordable location and re-open.\n\nCine Capri\n\nThis single screen theater was still viable. But the real estate it was on was eyed for redevelopment. Responding to an outcry from the community, developers tried to incorporate a Cine Capri-like theater into plans for high-rise office buildings. But negotiations soured. There was talk of putting the fate of the corner on the city ballot. The land owners announced plans to demolish the theater, effectively ending the arguments. Harkins Theaters has replicated the large screen curtained experience in two multiplex locations.\n\nBlakely's\n\nBlakely's was a string of service stations through the Phoenix area. Attendants in white uniforms would pump gas, fill up tires and check oil. Patrons were either given a free glass, or a receipt slip that could be saved and redeemed for dinnerware. The glasses, which were painted with cactuses, have become collectibles. The chain started in 1937. It was bought by Gulf Oil in 1963.\n\nScottsdale 6 Drive-in\n\nThis drive-in was demolished in 2014, years after it shut down. It was the latest in a string of drive-in movie theatres to close, the result of changing habits and tastes among movie-goers. Scottsdale 6 closed its doors in 2011. The Phoenix area used to be dotted with the outdoor screens. A partial list of names: Big Sky, Pioneer, Nu View and the Thunderbird.\n\nFollowing national trends , Arizona has lost almost 50 drive-ins in the past half-century. The Apache Drive-in, in Globe, closed in 2013, leaving only one drive-in theater still existing in the state: The WestWind Glendale 9 on 55th Avenue, south of Bethany Home Road.\n\nGuedo's Cantina Grille\n\nA popular taco shop that operated in downtown Chandler for 30 years closed in December 2015 after being acquired by a firm that plans to bring a new residential and retail development to the site.\n\nGuedo's Cantina Grille's longtime owner, William \"Guedo'' Samora III, confirmed the property had been acquired by COR Arizona Avenue Company LLC. The developer has been working for several years to bring the new mixed-use development to the corner, which is mostly vacant and includes a parcel of city-owned property that Chandler officials have sought to have developed.\n\nCookiez on Mill\n\nThis family-owned treat shop opened on Mill Avenue at Fifth Street in Tempe in 2003. Arizona State University students came in after class, football games or date nights to make their own ice-cream sandwiches, assembled with from-scratch cookies and more than 20 ice-cream flavors.\n\nChoices of cookies included peanut butter, oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip, and were used to sandwich rocky road, cookies and cream, mint chocolate and vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe shop, which also sold smoothies and other sweet treats, was housed in the historical Goodwin building, constructed in 1907 by Garfield A. Goodwin. The small space was added in 1912. Before housing Cookiez on Mill, it housed a Wells Fargo agency and the Tempe Daily News office.\n\nThe shop closed in November 2011.\n\nPinnacle Peak Patio\n\nPinnacle Peak Patio in Scottsdale, an iconic steakhouse, closed on June 28, 2015. Generations of visitors, hankering for an Old West experience, set foot in the dusty wooden establishment, known for its 2-pound porterhouse steaks and of neckties hanging from the ceiling.\n\nPinnacle Peak Patio started out in 1957 as a small store that sold beer and bait to fishermen traveling to nearby lakes. The original owner, wanting to increase sales, offered a simple steak dinner consisting of a 32-ounce Porterhouse steak cooked over mesquite wood. Its reputation grew as a place known for snipping off the necktie of anyone who dared enter its doors dressed so formal\n\nWhen the business closed, the owners expressed that they were looking for a new location to reopen some day.\n\nMonti's La Casa Vieja\n\nTempe's iconic Monti's La Casa Vieja, among the longest-lasting restaurants in Tempe and which was housed in the historic Hayden House on Mill Avenue, closed on Nov. 17, 2014, after nearly 60 years in business. The restaurant was opened in 1956 by the final owner's father, Leonard Monti, two years after he bought the Hayden House, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\n\nMicheal Monti, the last owner of the restaurant, said of the historical site that even though the business is closing, \"the tradition and history aren't going away.\"\n\nThe downtown restaurant, which had been the gathering place for countless groups through the years and known Valley-wide for its steak, Roman bread and historic memorabilia, was shut down mainly for the cost of production and the high cost of beef.\n\nBig Apple\n\nBill Johnson's Big Apple, a 59-year icon at 3757 E. Van Buren St., closed May 24, 2015. The Phoenix restaurant was the last remaining in a chain that once had seven locations. The eatery was known for its Western decor and sawdust on the floor. The waitresses wore cowboy hats on their heads and toy six-shooters on their hips.\n\nHanny's\n\nBack when Phoenix residents went downtown to buy clothes, this was one of the department stores of choice. Shopping districts moved to malls and power centers in farther-flung areas. Hanny’s sturdy concrete structure stood vacant for years. The fire department would set it on fire for structure practice. But it has been reinvented and occupied as a wine bar and restaurant since 2008. Patrons can stand over the old elevator shaft. Names of clothing brands still decorate the walls.\n\nGreasewood Flat\n\nGeorge \"Doc\" Cavalliere opened Greasewood Flat, the iconic Western watering hole in north Scottsdale, in 1975. With its picnic tables, laid-back ambiance and rustic wares, the bunkhouse-turned-saloon east of Pinnacle Peak became a popular hangout for bikers and tourists, cowboys and families to kick up their boots and relax.\n\nAfter 40 years in business, Cavalliere’s passing in 2010 forced the family to sell the property to pay estate taxes and other expenses, and the saloon shut soon after. Taylor Morrison Homes bought the 43-acre property in 2013 and planned to build 80 houses there.\n\nHenkel AG (formally the Dial Corp.)\n\nHenkel AG, parent company of the Dial Corp., announced in October 2016 that it was shuttering its Scottsdale, Arizona, offices. The company said it would combine the operation with Sun Products Corp., which Henkel acquired in June 2016. Both companies were to move to a facility in Stamford, Conn.\n\nArizona lost roughly 375 jobs.\n\nHenkel acquired the Dial Corp., formally one of Arizona's largest corporations, in December 2004 for $2.9 billion.\n\nDial Corp.'s history in The Valley began when Greyhound, the company that owned Dial Corp., moved its headquarters to Phoenix in 1971.\n\nIn 1989, a new headquarters was built near downtown Phoenix. The building resembled a bar of soap and would be known as the Dial Tower.\n\nThe company moved to Scottsdale in 1997.\n\nHenkel is a Germany-based company that sells Purex and Persil laundry detergent, Dial soap and Right Guard deodorant, among other beauty products, detergents and adhesives.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/09/12/50-most-popular-restaurants-that-wont-reopen-after-the-pandemic/113707568/", "title": "Coronavirus effect: Popular restaurants that won't open post-pandemic", "text": "Colman Andrews\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nNo segment of the pandemic-battered food service industry seems immune to the financial devastation that has resulted in thousands upon thousands of restaurants nationwide closing their doors permanently.\n\nWhile a small number of fast food chains, especially those with drive-thru windows and menu items well-suited for delivery, have actually increased sales in recent months – KFC, Pizza Hut, and Wingstop among them – many others have experienced substantial downturns. Reduced sales have plagued even popular standbys like Wendy's, Chipotle, and Dunkin', according to a report by Nation’s Restaurant News on major restaurant company performance over the first half of this year.\n\nFull-service chains are hurting, too. The restaurant business data resource Black Box Intelligence reports that 12% of sit-down restaurant chain units that were open before the COVID-19 pandemic are now closed. Such once-thriving chains as California Pizza Kitchen and Chuck E. Cheese have even filed for bankruptcy.\n\nJ.C. Penney acquisition:Mall owners Simon and Brookfield to acquire J.C. Penney out of bankruptcy\n\nPandemic sales:5 reasons COVID-19 pandemic gives the edge to cars, SUVs, pickups\n\nThe effect of COVID-19-related restrictions on multi-unit operations over the coming months remains to be seen. How will business be impacted, for instance, at these 21 restaurant and supermarket chains that require customers to wear masks?\n\nThe situation is just as bad, if not worse, for independent restaurants – whether modest neighborhood establishments, family favorites with decades of history, or flashy newer places opened by celebrity chefs. In the latter category, such culinary luminaries as Wolfgang Puck, David Chang, Daniel Boulud, José Andrés, and Thomas Keller have all been forced by economic circumstance to shutter restaurants in recent months.\n\nAn organization of independent restaurateurs called the Independent Restaurant Coalition has estimated that as many as 85% of the individual restaurants and small restaurant groups around the country might close permanently by the end of 2020. With this in mind, the Coalition is now lobbying Congress to pass a $120 billion bailout bill to help save at least some of the threatened places – an important initiative given that restaurants are definitely among the American brands that might not survive the coronavirus.\n\nBeginning in early May, when it became apparent that government-mandated shutdowns were going to last longer than initially anticipated, 24/7 Tempo has begun tracking permanent restaurant closings around the country. Many thousands of places, chains and independents, have now announced that they will not be reopening even after the pandemic subsides. Iconic establishments in New York state and California – the former particularly hard hit earlier this year, the latter a more recent virus hotspots – have proven particularly vulnerable.\n\nWhile the demise of any restaurant is unfortunate, of course – for its owners, investors, staff, and customers alike – some closings resonate more than others. It's safe to say that the more popular a restaurant was, the more its disappearance will be felt. This list, covering permanently closed establishments in some 17 states and the District of Columbia, focuses on those of particular fame and/or value to their community. All will be greatly missed.\n\nCalifornia: Bäco Mercat\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nIn what Time Out described as \"a shocking turn,\" noted Los Angeles chef-restaurateur Josef Centeno – whose other establishments, Orsa and Winston, has a Michelin star – closed Bäco Mercat early in Aug. Known for its flatbread sandwiches, fried chicken, and seasonal small plates, the establishment is credited with having kicked off the lively downtown L.A. dining scene when it opened in 2011. \"I'm not one for dwelling too much on anything,\" wrote Centeno philosophically in a statement on the restaurant's Instagram page when he announced its closing. \"I know that there is always a beginning, a middle and an end.\"\n\nCalifornia: Ton Kiang\n\n• Location: San Francisco\n\n\"Thank you for your years of support,\" read a hand-written sign sitting on a table at this 42-year-old Richmond district dim sum parlor. \"We will be closed for good on Aug. 30, Sunday at 7:30 PM.\" Neither the sign nor a longer statement posted in the window of the place specifically cited COVID-19 as the reason for closing, but weekend business had declined, and the restaurant found it difficult to hire and keep staff, according to Eater.\n\nCalifornia: Din Tai Fung\n\n• Location: Arcadia\n\nThis highly acclaimed international dumpling and noodle house chain, founded in Taiwan in 1972, opened this, its first North American location, in 2000. Now it's gone. A post on the restaurant's Instagram page reads, \"As a result of the current economic climate, we have made the difficult decision to permanently close...\" Southern Californians will still be able to enjoy Din Tai Fung's famous xiao long bao – better known as soup dumplings – and other specialties at the chain's Century City and Santa Anita locations.\n\nCalifornia: Broken Spanish\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nDescribed by Eater Los Angeles as \"powerful\" and \"genre-bending,\" this five-year-old contemporary Mexican restaurant depended heavily for business on the downtown nexus of sports, convention, and concert venues – all now closed because of the pandemic. Owner-chef Ray Garcia announced the restaurant's demise in early August on Instagram. He does plan, however, on launching a delivery-only taco outlet called Mila.\n\nCalifornia: The Bazaar by José Andrés and Somni\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nHigh-profile chef-restaurateur and humanitarian José Andrés announced in early August that he was shuttering his Spanish-inspired dining room The Bazaar in the SLS Beverly Hills hotel. Though the closing comes amidst legal actions between the chef's ThinkFoodGroup and the hotel owners that aren't directly related to the pandemic, the group's statement on the closure blames the hotel company for \"alleging defaults that were obviously incapable of being cured while our employees lived through shelter-in-place orders.\" Also closed is Somni, the 10-seat avant-garde tasting-menu counter operation, nestled behind The Bazaar – one of the few L.A. restaurants with two Michelin stars.\n\nCalifornia: Dong Il Jang\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nLos Angeles is home to the world's largest Korean community outside Korea itself, and its ever-growing Koreatown neighborhood has long been famous for its many restaurants, serving both traditional and modern Korean fare. Dong Il Jang was one of the oldest of these, launched 41 years ago. In announcing on Instagram that this year was their last, the owners wrote, \"Over the four decades we have been through many difficult situations but the Covid-19 pandemic has made it very difficult for us to survive ...\"\n\nCalifornia: Patina\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nGerman-born, French-trained chef Joachim Splichal opened the original Patina in Hollywood in 1989, moving it downtown to the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Center in 2003. Patina eventually spawned an empire of more than 50 other restaurants in five states and Japan, and while Splichal no longer owns the Patina Restaurant Group, the original had remained his flagship. Though no official announcement of its closing has been made, employees recently received letters of termination, effective Aug. 15, and the restaurant no longer appears on the group website.\n\nCalifornia: Trois Mec\n\n• Location: Los Angeles\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the proprietors of this hole-in-the-wall tasting-menu restaurant – French chef Ludo Lefebvre and his American colleagues Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo (of the popular Animal and Son of a Gun) – \"are surely among the most influential restaurateurs\" in L.A. Unfortunately, neither their prominence nor their Michelin star helped them survive the pandemic. \"Covid-19 has changed everything,\" Lefebvre wrote on his Instagram page, adding, \"I had to accept the reality that it was time to let the idea of reopening Trois Mec go.\"\n\nCalifornia: Español Italian\n\n• Location: Sacramento\n\nEspañol Italian Restaurant – the oldest continuously operating restaurant in the state capital, opened in 1923 – has announced that it has permanently ceased operations. Originally, the dining room at the Hotel Español, or Spanish Hotel, was known for Basque food. When the Luigi family bought it in 1959, they switched to Italian fare, moving the place to its current location in 1965. Looking at the books in early July, co-owner Perry Luigi told Valley Community Newspapers, he \"kind of made the decision that we can't stay open another month or everything will be gone.\"\n\nCalifornia: Biba Restaurant\n\n• Location: Sacramento\n\nBologna-born Biba Caggiano ramped up the restaurant scene in the California capital when she opened this place 33 years ago. Caggiano, who went on to become a successful cookbook author and TV food personality, died last August, and her family was already reportedly having difficulty running the restaurant before the crisis. A statement signed by Caggiano's husband and daughters on the Biba website announced \"Our last day was Friday, May 8th, 2020,\" explaining that \"Our beloved restaurant community has been shuttered and with the uncertainty of what the future holds, we are unable to wait out this storm.\"\n\nCalifornia: Hakkasan\n\n• Location: San Francisco\n\nAn upscale 170-seat Chinese restaurant, which cost a reported $7 million to build, Hakkasan closed permanently in late May after eight years of serving black cod with Champagne and honey, black truffle duck, and other luxurious specialties. The decision was made \"To preserve the long-term stability of our business,\" according to a company statement given to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThere are 11 other outposts of the chain – three more in the U.S., two in London, and one each in five other cities in Asia and the Middle East. The Hakkasan in Shanghai, the chain's only operation in China itself, has also closed in response to the coronavirus's effects on business.\n\nCalifornia: Louis'\n\n• Location: San Francisco\n\nA San Francisco restaurant icon that opened in 1937 above the remains of the historic 1894-vintage public swimming complex called Sutro Baths, Louis's is no more. The owners – grandchildren of the original owners – posted a message on the restaurant Facebook page in mid-July reading in part \"After much deliberation and a lot of tears we have decided after 83 continuous years of business...to close our business permanently.\"\n\nCalifornia: Pacific Dining Car\n\n• Location: Santa Monica\n\nThe original Pacific Dining Car in downtown L.A., founded in 1921 and probably the city's best-known steakhouse, spawned this Westside location in 1990. Serving 24 hours a day until the coronavirus lockdown, it was considered a Santa Monica essential. The owners say that the combination of the pandemic crisis and curfews imposed during the recent protests made it untenable for the restaurant to reopen.\n\nThe contents of the place – including kitchen equipment, table settings, furniture, and paintings – were sold at auction in June.\n\nColorado: 20th Street Café\n\n• Location: Denver\n\nAfter 74 years in business under three generations of the Okuno family, this neighborhood breakfast-and-lunch establishment has called it quits. The place has survived \"up-turns and crazy downturns in the economy,\" wrote current owners Rod and Karen Okuno on the restaurant website, \"but this final one proved to be insurmountable for our little corner of the world.\"\n\nFlorida: Elize\n\n• Location: Orlando\n\nAug. 22 was the last night for this well-reviewed offshoot of a restaurant with the same name in Utrecht, in The Netherlands. Elize chef Leon Mazairac – said to be a culinary celebrity in Holland – was hailed in March by Orlando Weekly as \"one of the city's best new chefs.\" His menu of modern European small plates, however, was no match for COVID-19. \"[T]he large economic impact resulting from the coronavirus pandemic has made it impossible for us to sustain operations,\" wrote the restaurant's owners on the Elize Facebook page.\n\nFlorida: Le Sirenuse Restaurant & Champagne Bar\n\n• Location: Miami\n\nOne of two luxury restaurants in the 1930s-vintage Four Seasons Surf Club hotel – the other being the Surf Club Restaurant, run by famed chef Thomas Keller – Le Sirenuse is now permanently closed. \"The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the South Florida community [...] have required us to make this difficult decision,\" reads a statement on the three-year-old restaurant's website. The original Le Sirenuse on Italy's Amalfi Coast remains open, as does Keller's restaurant – though his similarly themed TAK Room in Manhattan (see below) is another COVID-19 casualty.\n\nFlorida: La Tropicana\n\n• Location: Tampa\n\nPresidents George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, along with several Florida governors, were among the many customers of this 1963-vintage Cuban cafÃ© over the years. A focus of public life in Tampa's historic Ybor City neighborhood, La Tropicana also served a wide range of less famous customers. In explaining why the place was closing down, proprietor Gio PeÃ±a told the Tampa Bay Times, \"I'd say 80 percent of my regular customers are older people. They are afraid to come out.\" He added \"We were doing good. Business was steady. And then came COVID.\"\n\nGeorgia: Anne and Bill's\n\n• Location: Forest Park\n\nAfter 46 years in business in this Atlanta suburb, Anne and Bill's – known for its meat-and-three menu (various meats served with a variety of side dishes), its breakfasts, and its homemade desserts – is going out of business. A statement from the restaurant in mid-May said that \"our sales have dropped so low that we cannot continue to operate....\" A second location, in McDonough, southeast of Forest Park, has also closed.\n\nIllinois: Blackbird\n\n• Location: Chicago\n\nThis well-loved West Loop restaurant – hailed by the Chicago Tribune as \"one of Chicago's greatest restaurants\" – was opened 22 years ago by Paul Kahan, who has since become one of the city's best-known chef-restaurateurs. (His other places include Avec, Publican, and Big Star). Blackbird's intimate size and layout made social distancing impossible, and the restaurant announced on its website that \"we have made the very difficult decision to close our doors.\"\n\nIllinois: Katana\n\n• Location: Chicago\n\nAn offshoot of an upscale Los Angeles-based Japanese restaurant with a celebrity clientele opened in Chicago three years ago, specializing in creative sushi offerings and top-of-the-line wagyu beef cooked on charcoal imported from Japan. The group that owns Katana announced in mid-May that it would not be reopening. A location in Dubai has also closed.\n\nLouisiana: DTB\n\n• Location: New Orleans\n\nThis popular \"Cajun coastal\" restaurant, which opened in March 2017, survived the death of its co-owner and original chef Carl Schaubhut last year. It reopened this July after shutting down in mid-March with the arrival of the pandemic. The reopening proved to be a brief one. \"[I]t was the prospect of an uncertain future and an unknown timeline to return to some semblance of normalcy that prompted ownership to make this very tough decision to close,\" the restaurant's proprietors said in a statement published by Eater.\n\nLouisiana: K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen\n\n• Location: New Orleans\n\nThe demise of the legendary K-Paul's in mid-July is one of the most significant of all COVID-related restaurant closures. This highly influential Cajun establishment was opened in 1979 by chef Paul Prudhomme and his wife, Kay, and it soon became a Crescent City bucket-list destination, with lines forming nightly outside. With such vividly flavored dishes as the iconic blackened redfish, K-Paul's ignited a nationwide craze for Cajun cooking. Kay died of cancer in 1993 and Prudhomme passed away in 2015, but the place stayed open under the chef's niece, Brenda Prudhomme, and her chef husband, Paul Miller.\n\nAfter several coronavirus-mandated closings and reopenings earlier this year, though, they issued a statement on July 13 \"regretfully announcing permanent closure of K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen.\" Miller explained to NOLA.com that \"The business has been bleeding through this, and you can only bleed so much before you have to stop it.\"\n\nMaine: Vinland\n\n• Location: Portland\n\nFamous for its rigorously local New England-based menu (such staples as olive oil and black pepper were banned from the kitchen on the grounds they're not produced in the Northeast), Vinland served its final meal on Aug. 21. Chef-owner David Levi posted a message on Facebook reading in part, \"Vinland could not withstand the long quarantine required for the Covid-19 pandemic, the disproportionate impact on the fine dining sector of the food industry, and the overall downturn in the economy, the last of which may reverberate for years.\" He added, \"I’d hoped for a reopening even as I failed to see the viable path. The path, for us, didn’t exist. \"\n\nMassachusetts: Legal Test Kitchen\n\n• Location: Boston\n\nA branch of the famed Massachusetts fish and shellfish chain Legal Seafoods, this once-bustling 15-year-old establishment in Boston's Seaport district is now out of business, according to information reported on Aug. 27. \"Due to the lack of area business and travel ... \"the company felt it didn't make sense to reopen the location,\" Legal explained to Boston.com. There is one other Test Kitchen location at the city's Logan Airport (the idea was that the Test Kitchens would experiment on dishes not found on the chain's usual menus). It is currently closed but will reopen in early fall. Meanwhile, 11 other Legal Seafood locations around the state remain open.\n\nMassachusetts: Caffe Bella\n\n• Location: Randolph\n\nAfter almost three decades of serving Italian fare in this community south of Boston, Caffe Bella closed down in March like other area restaurants for what owner Patrick Barnes Jr. hoped would be a temporary hiatus. Unlike other local establishments, though, it didn't reopen when restrictions were eased. It never will. In late July, Barnes posted a statement on Facebook saying that \"[U]nfortunately the pandemic has caused the Caffe to call it a day!\"\n\nMassachusetts: Craigie Burger\n\n• Location: Boston\n\nThough it specializes in tasting menus of imaginative modern American fare, chef Tony Maws' Craigie on Main in Cambridge became most famous for its epic burger, only 18 of which were prepared each evening. Last year, Maws capitalized on its fame by opening Craigie Burger in the new Time Out Market Boston in Fenway. The temporarily closed Craigie Burger won't reopen, according to Maws and his partners. They feel that the lack of Red Sox games at Fenway Park and the absence of students from several nearby colleges would make reviving the enterprise too chancy.\n\nMaws told the Boston Globe that the concept will eventually make a comeback, and that the burger is still available on Craigie on Main's takeout menu.\n\nMichigan: Markovski's Family Restaurant\n\n• Location: Dearborn Heights\n\nAfter 50 years in business in this suburb of Detroit, Markovski's, famous for its stuffed cabbage, kielbasa, and other Polish specialties, has said goodbye. In a statement on Facebook, the proprietors declared that \"A worldwide pandemic was the only thing that could separate our tightly knit family [and] if you were here, you were definitely family.\"\n\nMinnesota: Octo Fishbar\n\n• Location: Minneapolis\n\nChef Tim McKee, winner of a James Beard Award as Best Chef Midwest, opened this place in 2017 in a two-level space in the Market House Collaborative, a small food hall in which customers could pick out their own seafood for the restaurant to cook and serve. It got good reviews and offered takeout meals after it had to close down in March, with indoor dining resuming in June. However, McKee made the decision to shut down the restaurant permanently at the end of July. \"The impacts surrounding COVID promed to be just too much,\" managing partner Loren Zinter told the Star Tribune.\n\nMinnesota: Fuji Ya\n\n• Location: Minneapolis\n\nWhen Reiko Weston opened Fuji Ya in 1959, it was apparently the first-ever Japanese restaurant in Minnesota. It expanded and spawned offshoots. Weston died in 1988, and two years later the place closed down – until her daughter brought it back to life in 1997. The restaurant shuttered temporarily in early May, but by the end of that month, its website carried the message: \"Thank you for your support! Unfortunately we are closing our doors.\"\n\nMissouri: Cusanelli's Restaurant\n\n• Location: St. Louis\n\nOccupying a building that traces its history back two centuries, this institution in the city's Lemay neighborhood – featuring what it billed as \"The Original St. Louis Style Pizza\" – opened in 1954. It became a family favorite, and comments on the restaurant's Facebook page sentimentally recall first dates, birthdays, anniversaries, and other momentous occasions celebrated there. It was also on Facebook that the owners announced that Aug. 30 would be the restaurant's last night of service, \"Due to covid and unforeseen circumstances ...\"\n\nNew York: Maison Premiere\n\n• Location: Brooklyn\n\nThis popular nine-year-old Williamsburg restaurant, known for its oysters, its New Orleans-style dishes, and its James Beard Award-winning bar program, is apparently out of business. Though it has issued no official statement, its website and Instagram page have shut down, its Facebook page continues no posts, and its phone number is not in service. Maison Premier's sister restaurant, Sauvage, also in Brooklyn, is apparently similarly closed. Both restaurants filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a year ago but had continued operating until they were closed, theoretically temporarily, with the advent of the pandemic.\n\nNew York: Augustine\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nBlaming the inflexibility of his landlord, celebrated restaurateur Keith McNally announced on Instagram in late July that his French brasserie in downtown Manhattan's Beekman Hotel, opened in 2016, is now out of business. McNally, who himself was hospitalized for COVID-19 in April but is now fully recovered, had earlier closed his 31-year-old SoHo bistro Lucky Strike due to the pandemic. On Instagram, McNally wrote that he looked forward to seeing his customers at one of his other New York City establishments – which include Balthazar, Pastis, and Minetta Tavern – \"Or Debtor's Prison - whichever comes first.\"\n\nNew York: TAK Room\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nJoining the ranks of other celebrity chefs who've been forced to permanently close restaurants around the nation – including the likes of Wolfgang Puck, José Andrés, Daniel Boulud, and David Chang – Thomas Keller has announced the demise of his TAK Room in the massive Hudson Yards development. The decision to close the super-pricey TAK Room as well as Keller's more modest Bouchon Bakery in the same complex came, according to a statement on the restaurant's Instagram page, \"after painful deliberations amid a pandemic that has devastated the global economy and caused irreparable damage to our business and profession.\"\n\nNew York: Uncle Boons\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nTwo former chefs at Thomas Keller's acclaimed Per Se, Ann Redding and Matt Danzer, opened this small but very popular (and eventually Michelin-starred) Thai restaurant in Manhattan's Nolita neighborhood in 2013. Now, a statement on the restaurant's Instagram page says, \"We've made the very difficult decision not to reopen Uncle Boon on the other side of the pandemic.\" Eater called Redding and Danzer \"some of the most exciting restaurateurs in NYC\" on the basis of this place and their subsequently opened restaurants Uncle Boons Sister (which remains open for delivery and takeout) and Thai Diner (which will continue to deliver some favored Uncle Boons menu items).\n\nNew York: Aquagrill\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nAdd this 24-year-old SoHo seafood restaurant to the list of establishments that had closed temporarily in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, but has now decided to make the closure permanent. \"Aquagrill is not continuing to operate in light of the unsafe effects of the coronavirus on public dining out,\" reads a statement on the restaurant website.\n\nNew York: Gotham Bar & Grill\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nOne of the most famous and long-lived restaurants to shut down permanently in the face of the pandemic, Gotham weathered the departure last year of chef Alfred Portale, who had been in charge of the kitchen for 34 years (he started in 1985, a year after the restaurant opened). The new chef, Victoria Blamey, received promising reviews. Then came the pandemic.\n\nIn announcing the decision to close in mid-March, Gotham issued a statement explaining that \"the unforeseen situation created by the coronavirus has made operation of the restaurant untenable.\"\n\nNew York: Jewel Bako\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nA sign in the window of this well-loved Michelin-starred sushi bar near Manhattan's Cooper Square, posted in mid-May, announced an \"open house sale\" of kitchen goods, appliances, and equipment, as well as wine \"for cheap.\" In 2018, Jewel Bako's owners opened a chef's counter place next door called Restaurant Ukiyo, which also won a Michelin star. A statement on the Ukiyo website announced officially that both establishments have closed for good.\n\nNew York: Toro\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nNoted Boston chef-restaurateurs Ken Oringer and Jamie Bissonnette have permanently closed the once-bustling Manhattan location of this tapas restaurant, opened in 2013. The original Boston restaurant and a location in Dubai remain in business. \"Toro NYC has come to the end of our journey,\" reads a statement on the restaurant's Instagram page, \"and the staff will not have a restaurant home to come back to when this pandemic ends.\"\n\nOregon: Pok Pok restaurants\n\n• Location: Portland\n\nJames Beard Award-winning chef-restaurateur Andy Ricker, whose Pok Pok restaurant group specializes in northern Thai and Vietnamese cooking, announced on Instagram in mid-June that he was closing four of his six Portland locations. It was originally reported that the shuttered restaurants would include Pok Pok NW, Whiskey Soda Lounge, and two outposts of Pok Pok Wing. The original Pok Pok would reopen, it was said, and a third Pok Pok Wing might also come back to life. Currently, however, the Pok Pok website states that \"All Pok Pok restaurant locations are closed for on site service,\" adding that meal kits and some prepared food is available for pickup at the company's commissary kitchen.\n\nPennsylvania: Ritz Barbecue\n\n• Location: Allentown\n\nDescribed by the Morning Call as \"An Allentown landmark restaurant where generations of families gathered for barbecue, banana splits, milkshakes and more,\" the Ritz grew out of a fairgrounds stand established in 1927 and moved to its present site 10 years later. The current owners, Jeff and Grace Stinner, who took over in 1981, announced in mid-June that they would not reopen. Though the restaurant had been for sale since 2019, Grace stressed to the Morning Call that the pandemic is to blame for their recent decision. \"We did want to stay open until someone else took over,\" she said, \"but that's not feasible now.\n\nSouth Carolina: Jestine's Kitchen\n\n• Location: Charleston\n\nA major tourist draw for 24 years, Jestine's was named for Jestine Matthews, the African American housekeeper and cook employed by the white family that founded the place (Matthews died in 1997 at the age of 112). It was recently criticized as \"the last Charleston restaurant to openly capitalize on the narrative of black servitude,\" in the words of The Post and Courier. After reopening on May 20, the restaurant announced in mid-June that it would cease operations for good due to \"the quick onset of the scary pandemic.\"\n\nSouth Carolina: McCrady's\n\n• Location: Charleston\n\nKnown for the avant-garde tasting menus introduced by noted chef Sean Brock (who departed in 2018), McCrady's will not resume serving even after restrictions are lifted. David Howard, president of Neighborhood Dining Group, which owns the restaurant, issued a statement saying in part that \"we've come to the difficult decision that McCrady's...will no longer be viable in this changed business environmentâ¦.\" The group's Mexican restaurant, Minero, upstairs from McCrady's, has also closed for good, but the Atlanta location has reopened, with restrictions in place, and a new location, on John's Island, just southwest of Charleston, is scheduled to open later this summer.\n\nDunkin' vs. Starbucks:Among America's favorite brew-at-home coffee brands, which comes out ahead?\n\nPandemic effect:Dog days of the pandemic create a thriving economy for man's best friend\n\nTexas: Cafe Texan\n\n• Location: Huntsville\n\nThis iconic 83-year-old establishment north of Houston, said to have been the oldest cafÃ© in Texas still in its original location, is gone for good. Owner John Strickland told The Huntsville Item that he had remained closed for months out of concern for the health of his customers, many of whom were seniors, and his staff. However, he said, \"I had not intended to close it permanently.\" When he realized that that would be necessary, he sold the building, which will apparently be turned into a museum.\n\nTexas: Highland Park Cafeteria\n\n• Location: Dallas\n\nKnown for its zucchini muffins, chicken-fried steak, homemade pies, and other comfort food, this community favorite, opened in 1925, will not reopen. Addressing its customers, a statement on the restaurant website said \"We would love to have a farewell event to honor you and our faithful employees, but due to the current restrictions, we won't be able to do so.\" The statement left open the possibility that the place might be revived in the future, adding \"So, making no promises – but who knows? Zucchini Muffins may one day make a comeback!\"\n\nTexas: Threadgill's\n\n• Location: Austin\n\nOpened as a gas station and beer bar in 1933, this Austin institution evolved into a leading music venue, hosting such luminaries as Janis Joplin and Jerry Lee Lewis, and then into a restaurant in 1981 after a new owner bought it. Threadgill's spawned a second location in 1996, but that one closed in 2018, and now the original Threadgill's has closed as well. The premises will be sold at auction on Aug. 8.\n\nWashington: HaNa Sushi\n\n• Location: Seattle\n\nThe longest-running business in Capitol Hill's popular Broadway Alley mall, opened in 1989, HaNa was described on the Vanishing Seattle Facebook page as \"relaxed, homey & down to earth, with a steady stream of regulars & folks who've been coming here for decades.\" They won't be coming any longer. Owner Aung Aung confirmed HaNa's permanent demise to the Capitol Hill Seattle blog, saying \"Now is a very hard time. I don't know about Broadway right now.\"\n\nWashington: Trattoria Cuoco\n\n• Location: Seattle\n\nProlific Seattle restaurateur Tom Douglas temporarily closed 12 of his 13 local establishments in mid-March over coronavirus concerns. Now, he has announced that he won't reopen this one, a popular pasta place located in one of Amazon's buildings in the South Lake Union neighborhood.

Its content is produced independently of USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/04/01/highway-rest-stops-disappearing/99868368/", "title": "Why old-fashioned highway rest stops are disappearing", "text": "Jenni Bergal\n\nPew/Stateline\n\nFor more than half a century, old-fashioned, no-frills highway rest stops have welcomed motorists looking for a break from the road, a bathroom or a picnic table where they can eat lunch.\n\nBut in some states, these roadside areas are disappearing.\n\nCash-strapped transportation agencies are shuttering the old ones to save money, or because they don’t attract enough traffic or are in such bad shape that renovating them is too costly. Or, the stops have been overtaken by tourist information centers, service plazas that take in revenue from gasoline and food sales, or commercial strips off interstate exits.\n\nFlorida, Michigan, Ohio and South Dakota are among the states that have closed traditional rest stops in the last two years. And a battle is brewing in Connecticut over a proposal to shut down all seven stops on its interstate highways to save money.\n\nBut advocates of maintaining traditional rest areas say even if motorists are offered flashier options for pit stops, the ones that sprung up as highways did are still needed for driver safety and convenience. Some view them as a tranquil, environmentally friendly alternative to crowded service plazas and commercial strips.\n\n“Shutting them down would be the end of an era,” said Joanna Dowling, a historian who researches rest areas and runs the website RestAreaHistory.org. “Rest areas take you away from the road and the hecticness of travel and immerse you in the natural landscape.”\n\nRead more:\n\nN.Y. highway rest area offers pit stop and prayer\n\nHow to Find Rest Stops\n\nHighway rest area sponsorships raise some questions\n\nSome of the old rest areas are rustic and offer just the basics — two toilets, water fountains, a parking area and picnic tables. Others are spiffier and more modern, with larger bathrooms, vending machines, dog walk areas and a desk staffed by state workers who hand out maps and other tourist information.\n\nBut unlike service plazas, rest areas on federal interstate highways are prohibited from selling gasoline or food other than from vending machines, the proceeds of which traditionally go to people who are visually impaired. State transportation departments run the rest areas and are responsible for cleaning and maintaining them. That can take a chunk of their budget, depending on staffing and amenities, officials say.\n\nIn Florida, for example, the Department of Transportation tore down a traditional highway rest area on a local road off I-75 in Punta Gorda in 2015 because it didn’t get much use, agency spokesman Zac Burch said. Travelers were choosing instead to pull over at a truck stop, gasoline station and fast food chains off nearby exits.\n\nGetting rid of the rest area saved an estimated $300,000 a year in maintenance costs, and the state probably will sell most of the 20-acre site, Burch said. The department also built a new, fancier rest area the year before about 100 miles away on I-75 and is constructing another on the opposite side of the road.\n\nBut groups that represent motorists and truckers say shuttering rest areas is a disservice to drivers — and a safety concern.\n\n“To us, this is more than just a restroom break and snack,” said Rich Romer, AAA’s state relations manager. “It’s a safety issue because of drowsiness. Rest stops are one of the many tools to keep motorists safe and help them arrive at their destination alive.”\n\nHighway rest areas are critical for truck drivers’ safety and their ability to comply with a federal law limiting the number of hours they can drive without rest, said Darrin Roth, spokesman for the American Trucking Associations, a trucking industry trade group.\n\nIn many parts of the country, particularly outside metropolitan areas, there’s a severe shortage of places for trucks to park, Roth said. Commercial truck stops often fill up, he said, and highway rest areas offer a safe place to park for the night because they are well-lit and often filled with other truckers.\n\n“They may not necessarily have the facilities that truck stops do, but they are critical to meeting the needs of truck drivers,” Roth said. “And they’re certainly more desirable than having a truck park on the shoulder or on a ramp, which is not just dangerous, it’s illegal.”\n\nRest area history\n\n“Safety rest areas” were constructed as part of the U.S. interstate highway system that was created in 1956. They were envisioned as off-road respites where motorists could take a break. They were easy to access and offered clean bathrooms, drinking water and picnic grounds.\n\nThey often were built where there weren’t many options for family road trippers in need of a rest. Over time, however, fast food chains, gasoline stations and motels have sprung up just off of exits, offering more services to drivers.\n\n“Decades ago, when these rest areas went in, we didn’t have a convenience store or a truck stop at every exit, like we do now,” said Tammy Williams, an engineer for the South Dakota Department of Transportation. “It was a totally different world.”\n\nNowadays, motorists in some areas also can pull into state-owned service plazas that contain gas stations, fast-food restaurants and convenience stores. Some states lease service-area space to businesses that operate them and give back a percentage of sales revenues.\n\nAll of this has diminished the need for — and the number of — traditional rest areas on interstates and state highways.\n\nIn Ohio, for example, the number has dropped from 294 in 1961 to 89 today, said state transportation department spokesman Matt Bruning.\n\nAge and costs have helped speed the demise of rest areas.\n\nMichigan, for example, closed a 1970s-era rest stop on US-127 near Houghton Lake in December. It was old, needed renovation or replacement, wasn’t used much and was located within 30 miles of other rest areas, said transportation department spokesman James Lake. The building did not meet Americans with Disabilities Act or energy efficiency standards, had water and septic problems, and would have cost about $2 million to replace.\n\nSouth Dakota shuttered four rest areas in October — two on I-90 in Tilford and two on I-29 in Hidewood. All were in major need of rehabilitation or reconstruction, which would have cost an estimated $8.5 million, the transportation department’s Williams said. Closing them will save the state about $210,000 a year in maintenance, a task force report found.\n\nWilliams said the agency’s goal is to focus on tourism by opening two new welcome centers at the state’s borders and expanding two others.\n\n“We don’t look at shutting down the old rest areas as negative; we look at it as positive,” she said. “Tourism is the second-highest revenue-generating source that we have in our state.”\n\nConnecticut controversy\n\nIn Connecticut, a battle is raging over the state’s proposal to shut down all seven interstate rest areas.\n\nThe Legislature eliminated funding to operate, staff and maintain them about two years ago, and the transportation department has been shifting funding ever since to keep them open, said department spokesman Kevin Nursick.\n\nThe areas used to be staffed 24/7. But about six months ago, officials cut back, and the buildings at each stop, which have bathrooms, are now open only seven hours during the day. Portable toilets remain available outside.\n\nThat, too, may change. The department is proposing to close the buildings, remove the portable toilets and only keep the parking. Twelve positions for rest area attendants would be cut and the state would save $1.1 million over two years, Nursick said.\n\n“We’ve been doing this on our own dime, scraping and picking up the pennies on the floor to keep the rest areas open,” he said. “There’s no more funding left to scrounge.”\n\nInstead of the rest areas, motorists will be able to use nearly two dozen renovated state-owned service plazas operated by the private sector — what Nursick calls “rest areas on steroids” — that are staffed 24/7 and offer food, gasoline and other amenities.\n\nBut some, especially in the trucking industry, aren’t happy.\n\n“We believe the rest areas should stay open and be fully staffed, for safety purposes,” said Joseph Sculley, president of the Motor Transport Association of Connecticut, which represents trucking companies. “The drivers are mandated by federal law to take breaks and there’s already a shortage of safe places where they can do that. This would make that situation even worse.”\n\nRecreational vehicle owners, who often pull into stops to stretch their legs, eat lunch and walk the dog, are also unhappy about the nation’s changing highway landscape.\n\nThey never have to worry about a rest stop parking area being too small to accommodate their motor homes, said Pamela Kay, of the Family Motor Coach Association, a national RV owners group.\n\n“It’s easier for someone in a passenger vehicle to just hop off the interstate and pop into a fast-food restaurant for a break,” Kay said. “That’s not the case when you’re traveling in an RV.”\n\nStateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/economy/us-gdp-third-quarter/index.html", "title": "The US economy's growth was stronger than expected in the third ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe US economy grew much faster than expected in the third quarter, according to the latest gross domestic product report, which showed GDP rose by an annualized rate of 2.9%.\n\nThat’s an improvement from the initial government reading in October that showed 2.6% growth in economic activity, and better than the Refinitiv forecast of 2.7%. And it’s a marked turnaround from economic contractions of 1.6% in the first quarter of the year and 0.6% in the second.\n\nThe better-than-expected growth came as consumer spending increased more than in the goverment’s previous reading, while the value of imports was revised down. Imports are subtracted from GDP, which is the broad measure of economic activity within the country.\n\nThe strong reading does not necessarily remove the risk forecast by many economists of the US economy falling into recession at some point in the next year.\n\nBut the stronger-than-expected growth shows the resilience of the economy as it deals with the headwinds caused by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive course of large interest rate hikes in an attempt to slow the economy in order to tame decades-high inflation.\n\nThe US labor market, which will be measured again when Friday’s November jobs report is released, remains strong, with employers still hiring and unemployment near a half-century low. And while consumers are struggling with higher prices, they continue to spend money. More than two-thirds of US economic activity is driven by consumer spending.\n\nOne of the biggest drags on economic growth is the pullback in spending on home building in the face of higher interest rates. The GDP report showed that investment in housing construction shaved 1.4 percentage points off overall growth. That means the economy would have grown at a very strong 4.3% annualized pace if spending on home building had remained flat.\n\n“The Federal Reserve’s rate hikes to date have mostly just sent the housing sector into a recession where the rest of the economy continues to run fairly smoothly,” said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist for markets research firm Fwdbonds.\n\nThe report does give a green light for the Fed to remain aggressive in raising rates, Rupkey said.\n\n“Consumer spending and business investment in equipment are looking good despite the Federal Reserve ratcheting interest rates 3.75 percentage points higher this year,” he said. “If the Fed is trying to slow the economy by hitting the brakes, they haven’t done enough yet.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/business/dr-pepper-history/index.html", "title": "The soda market is flat, but not for Dr Pepper | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nIn the pantheon of sodas, Dr Pepper is the odd one out: It doesn’t have the popularity or sales of Coca-Cola or Pepsi, you can’t use it in a standard cocktail, and it doesn’t fall neatly into a category like cola or root beer.\n\nFor decades, the peppery soda has marketed its blend of 23 flavors as a unique choice for discerning soda drinkers. Over the years Dr Pepper has found success as a quirky alternative to Coke and Pepsi.\n\nToday, Dr Pepper is hardly a scrappy underdog — it’s the hero brand in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) which, along with Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP), make up the three largest soda companies in the $37 billion US market, as measured by NielsenIQ in retail and convenience stores.\n\nAnd recently, Dr Pepper has been gaining ground on its competitors, even as the overall soda market goes flat.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper is the third-largest soda maker in the country.

Today, Dr Pepper is the fourth most popular soda in the country after Coke, Pepsi and Mountain Dew.\n\n“Over the past 20 years, carbonated soft drinks have been declining in volume,” said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. “One of the bright spots … has been Dr Pepper.”\n\nFounded in 1885 in Waco, Texas, Dr Pepper was the first in a wave of 19th-century upstart soda companies. (It dropped the period in the 1950s for design reasons.) The little brand rose to prominence in the latter half of the 20th century and helped shape the soda industry, all while cultivating its reputation as an outsider.\n\nThe early days of Dr Pepper\n\nThe drink was invented by Charles Alderton, a pharmacist at a drug store owned by Wade Morrison, who is credited with patenting the drink and naming it.\n\nLegend has it that Morrison named the beverage after one Charles Pepper, the father of a woman he loved, hoping that the gesture would facilitate a match. That’s the tale on the Dr Pepper website. But Joy Summar-Smith, associate director of the Dr Pepper Museum in Waco, said there are several origin stories, and this one doesn’t hold up.\n\n“By the time [Morrison] came across Dr. Pepper he was married and he had a son,” said Summar-Smith.\n\nCoca-Cola was created in 1886. Pepsi was invented in the 1890s, but got its name in 1898.\n\n“The soft drink industry itself, as a whole, was still really trying to figure itself out in the late 1800s, early 1900s,” Summar-Smith said. “Each town had their own soft drink manufacturing facility.”\n\nCoca-Cola established itself most quickly, aided by its invention of the coupon, which offered free samples of its new beverage. Pepsi positioned itself as a less expensive competitor to Coke.\n\nAds for Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola on a store in North Carolina, in April 1938. John Vachon/Everett/Shutterstock\n\nWhile Coke and Pepsi were making waves, Dr Pepper “just didn’t push it that hard,” said Tristan Donovan, author of “Fizz: How Soda Shook Up the World.”\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Dr Pepper encouraged customers to drink a Dr Pepper three times a day, at around 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., to keep their energy up. While successful, the campaign never focused on the product’s unique, non-cola flavor.\n\nIn the 1950s, Dr Pepper branded itself “the friendly Pepper-Upper,” once again focusing on the rush of energy you could get from any can of soda.\n\nThen, everything changed.\n\nNot a cola\n\nIn the early 20th century, national bottlers that worked with with Coke or Pepsi shied away from Dr Pepper, fearing they would run afoul of agreements that barred them from partnering with a competitor. As a result, Dr Pepper had little national distribution, focusing primarily on Texas and nearby states.\n\nIn the 1960s, PepsiCo sued Dr Pepper for trademark infringement. Dr Pepper countered, accusing Pepsi of denying the beverage entry to its distribution platform. In 1963, a judge ruled for the bottler, opening the door to the product’s national expansion.​​\n\nDr Pepper “pulled off a legal coup that gave it the necessary leg up: It argued effectively in a US District Court that Dr Pepper was not a cola,” a 1984 article in D Magazine explained. Or as the Federal Trade Commission put it, “the suit opened up PepsiCo and Coca-Cola bottlers to Dr Pepper and its sales rose immediately.”\n\nWith new-found access to the whole country, the brand “started promoting [itself] much more heavily,” said Donovan, the author of “Fizz.”\n\nThrough the 1970s, Dr Pepper marketed itself to a national audience as a unique flavor, a shift that D Magazine said “fleshed out an identity for Dr Pepper that may be its most formidable asset.” In 1977, the company launched its “Be a Pepper” campaign, encouraging people to identify as Dr Pepper drinkers.\n\nThe \"Be a Pepper\" campaign ran from 1977 to 1983. Courtesy Keurig Dr Pepper\n\nToday, Dr Pepper advertises itself as a treat, using a pint-sized mascot called Lil’ Sweet in its commercials. Another campaign, Fanville, is set in a fictionalized world where people are obsessed with college football and also Dr Pepper, positioning the beverage as a cult favorite.\n\nAfter Dr Pepper established itself as an alternative to mainstream colas, it launched on a path that ultimately made it part of the country’s third-largest soft drink maker, Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nDr Pepper hits the scene\n\nDuring the wave of mega-mergers in the 1980s, Coca-Cola tried to scoop up Dr Pepper.\n\nIn 1986, soon after PepsiCo announced its intention to purchase 7Up, Coca-Cola said it had agreed to acquire Dr Pepper. The plans would have made Coke and Pepsi the most formidable players in the market by far, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time.\n\nBut both Coke’s and Pepsi’s deals were blocked, as the FTC decided the beverages were similar enough to pose a possible antitrust threat.\n\nA whirlwind series of mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs ensued. Dr Pepper and 7Up merged in the late 1980s. Over the years, Cadbury Schweppes took stakes in the combined company and, eventually, full ownership of the brands. In 2008 Cadbury spun off its North American beverage division to create the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. A decade later, Keurig Green Mountain merged with that company, creating Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nBottles of Dr. Pepper move down a production line at the Swire Coca-Cola bottling plant in Utah. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper, soda giant\n\nToday, KDP still trails behind Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, but it’s narrowing the gap.\n\nBy volume, Coca-Cola controlled about 40% of the US retail market in the first nine months of 2022, followed by PepsiCo with about 29% and Keurig Dr Pepper with roughly 25%, according to Beverage Digest’s data.\n\nCompared to the year before, PepsiCo’s share fell by 1%, while Keurig Dr Pepper’s ticked up. And over the years, the Dr Pepper brand has been gaining momentum while some of its competitors struggle. That might be because of consumers’ increasing interest in flavored soft drinks, said Stanford, the publication’s editor.\n\nThere are other advantages to existing outside of the cola dichotomy. Food-service providers typically have an agreement with either Coke or Pepsi for its soda fountains, and one fountain won’t feature products made by the other. But the fountains often offer Dr Pepper, making it a widely available choice.\n\n“Dr Pepper is the number one most differentiated trademark in beverage — not just soft drinks, but in beverage,” said Derek Dabrowski, general manager of juices, mixers and sauces at KDP. People reach for Dr Pepper when they want a treat, he added. That’s “where we have been winning.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/06/04/delaware-development-latest-businesses-first-state/7487483002/", "title": "Delaware development: The latest on businesses coming and going", "text": "We've all driven past a construction site and wondered what it will become.\n\nAs we venture out to shop, dine and see friends and family after a year spent apart, those questions may be popping up more and more.

The average lifespan of a restaurant is five years and by some estimates, up to 90 percent of new ones fail within the first year. There are, however, some very successful exceptions that manage to rake in millions of dollars a year.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed food service trade publication Restaurant Business’s latest annual ranking of the top 100 independent restaurants in America, which is based on their reported or estimated gross food and beverage sales for the year. They define independents, for the survey’s purposes, as restaurants with no more than five locations. Fewer than a dozen of the places on this list are single-operator restaurants.\n\nThe most recent Restaurant Business rankings, sponsored by Campbell’s, were published late last year, based on figures from 2016. The shuttering in late July of one of their top 50 establishments, Carnevino (No. 23), due to sexual misconduct allegations, inspired us to take a new look at the list. In the course of doing that, we discovered that two other restaurants in the top 50 have also closed since the list was published. There’s no indication that these two went out of business for financial reasons, but the fact that even restaurants that are phenomenally successful can close might serve as a reminder that sales and profits are not the same thing.\n\nPerusal of this list reveals a few interesting facts. First, American diners are obviously carnivorous, as 16 of the top 50 are steakhouses or focus strongly on meat. Second, though Los Angeles has been getting much publicity lately as the country’s new food capital, it shows poorly on the list of top grossing restaurants, with only one restaurant making the cut. New York City, on the other hand, accounts for 20 of the 50. Next in line are Las Vegas, Chicago and vicinity, and Washington, D.C. Finally, celebrity chefdom apparently doesn’t mean very much when it comes to serious financial success. Only half a dozen of these highly grossing restaurants have or had famed culinary personalities attached. Two of those are among the places that have since closed, and two more are no longer associated with the noted names.\n\nSome of the restaurants on this list serve breakfast (and brunch), lunch, and dinner, while others are open only in the evenings; many are open seven days a week, while others might close for a day or two. These factors obviously influence the number of meals served annually. The restaurant industry usually computes “average check” (or “check average”) by dividing total sales by number of those meals. In some instances in this list, the math doesn’t work out, but that’s most likely because the restaurants in question (especially those with nightclubs and/or large bars or lounges) racked up substantial sales from alcohol unaccompanied by meals.\n\nMore: Employment trends: 20 jobs that have become dominated by women\n\n50.

Controversial city planner Robert Moses turned it into a restaurant in 1934. Over the years, the fortunes of the place ebbed and flowed, and the management changed frequently. Restaurant impresario Warner LeRoy ran it from 1976 to 1988; famed chef Jeremiah Tower took over the kitchen for a scant five months in 2014 and '15. Today, under Philadelphia restaurateurs Jim Caiola and David Salama, it seems to have found its groove with solid cooking and a something-for-everyone menu that includes kale and quinoa salad, grilled baby octopus, and roasted organic chicken.\n\n39.

The classic French fare focuses on variations on steak frites, though many other choices are available. Breakfast and weekend brunch are also served, and there is an ample gluten-free menu.\n\n38.

Meals served annually: 210,000\n\nSteakhouse veterans David Flom and Matthew Moore opened this busy steakhouse in 2010. It has proven popular with a wide range of sports stars as well as celebrities like actors Colin Farrell and John Cusack, who were presumably tempted by its bone-in prime rib, prime steaks, and fresh seafood -- and maybe even by its foot-long Kobe beef hot dog.\n\n37.

Hundreds of farms involved supply raw materials to the restaurants. The fare is mostly home-style — skillet cornbread, fried green tomatoes, chicken pot pie, Yankee pot roast, pork chops — and there are numerous sandwiches and homemades pastas. Founding Farmers also serves proprietary \"farm-to-still\" rye whisky, gin, and Peruvian pisco brandy.\n\nMore: SNAP benefits: Which cities have the most people on food stamps?\n\n36.

The no-nonsense menu is centered around prime corn-fed Black Angus beef, aged for 40 days. There's also plenty of seafood, including a spicy lobster cocktail, as well as spit-roasted chicken, baby back ribs, and a charbroiled burger. Owned by the Gibsons Restaurant Group, this Gibsons is across from Rosemont's Donald E. Stephens Convention Center.\n\n35.

It's easy to see the appeal. The kitchen seems more concerned with satisfying cravings than breaking new ground. Thus: a raw bar, tomato soup, Caesar salad, ricotta gnocchi, lobster roll, two burgers, five steaks (with fries or field greens), spaghetti and meatballs as a Sunday special…. You get the idea.\n\n34.

Its parent company, the Tavistock Restaurant Collection, runs 18 restaurants in eight states, including a second Abe & Louie's in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\n33.

A raw bar and an artisanal cheese selection round out the menu, and breakfast and brunch are served. The restaurant's corporate parent, BR Guest Hospitality, which runs 17 restaurants in New York, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Las Vegas, was acquired in late 2016 by the massive Landry's, Inc., which itself oversees more than 600 restaurants, hotels, casinos, and sports teams across the country.\n\n32.

Meals served annually: 110,000\n\nThis elegant, justifiably pricey Italian restaurant is described on its website as a \"creation of Joe Bastianich, Lidia Bastianich and Executive Chef Melissa Rodriguez.\" That's true as far as it goes, but the missing name on that list is the now-disgraced Mario Batali, whose vision was essential to the place for more than a decade. Opened in 2005, Del Posto got a three-star review in the New York Times the following year, and then a four-star ranking — the paper's highest restaurant accolade — in 2010. No other Italian place had reached that level since 1974. Chef Rodriguez -- who joined the staff in 2011, was promoted to chef de cuisine in 2015, and became executive chef last year -- prepares refined but full-flavored versions of many Italian classics, including vitello tonnato, orecchiette with rabbit sausage and turnips, and the seafood stew called cacciucco livornese.\n\n31. Acme Feed & Seed\n\nLocation: Nashville, Tennessee\n\nNashville, Tennessee Avg. check: $16\n\n$16 Meals served annually: 611,454\n\nBuilt in 1890, the building now occupied by Acme Feed & Seed has housed a grocery store, a flour company, and a wholesale drug firm, among other tenants, and from 1943 to 1999 it was home to the business that became known as Acme Farm Supply. After that closed, the structure was occupied only occasionally until 2014, when Nashville chef-restaurateur and caterer Tom Morales took it over. In the space, he created a four-level complex with a \"funkytonk\" on the ground floor, serving such fare as hot chicken sandwich, gorgonzola meatloaf, and \"redneck lo mein;\" a lounge and bar with sushi bar and bar food on the second level; an event and music venue on the third floor; and an open-air bar on the roof.\n\nMore: US population boom: Fastest growing county in every state\n\n30.

There's a salad bar, a selection of fresh fish, and some meat dishes marked on the menu as \"for the landlubber.\" Some 13 variations on surf & turf are also offered.\n\n29.

The restaurant's winning customer-suggested dessert is cheesecake ice cream with Key lime pie ribbons, graham cracker crunch, and toasted marshmallow swirl. T.G.I. Fridays and Smith & Wollensky founder Alan Stillman and his son Michael run Quality Branded.\n\n28.

The menu is steakhouse-standard: shrimp cocktail, baked clams, spinach salad, extra-thick veal and lamb chops, lobster, swordfish, and of course steak. The wine list is immense and justly famous, and there are private rooms that can seat up to 250 people.\n\n27. The Smith (Lincoln Square)\n\nLocation: New York, N.Y.\n\nNew York, N.Y.

Burke, the celebrity chef who has opened and closed a number of restaurants in New York and elsewhere, actually left the place in 2014 but didn't take his name off it until last year. Despite its success, the restaurant, which is located in the James Hotel, closed on Dec. 9 and is scheduled to be reinvented soon as The James Kitchen + Bar.\n\n25.

He is also a showman, well-suited to Las Vegas, where this carnivore's paradise offers an array of tartares, carpaccios, and cured meats; steaks galore, including Japanese Kobe; roast suckling pig (by special order); and, just for variety, caviar tasting flights and what the menu calls \"meats from the sea\" like whole turbot and grilled Maine lobster.\n\n23.

It was known for its wide range of pastas and its veal, beef, lamb, and pork dishes. Following allegations of sexual misconduct against Batali earlier this year, Batali separated from the organization, and the group announced that it was closing its three Las Vegas restaurants this month, including this one. Carnevino shut down on July 23.\n\n22. Angus Barn\n\nLocation: Raleigh, N.C.\n\nRaleigh, N.C.

The structure burned in 1964 but was rebuilt and reopened the following year. Aged steaks, in various cuts and sizes, are a specialty — the restaurant claims to serve an average of 22,000 of them a month — but seafood, seafood-and-meat combinations, and even a char-grilled vegetable plate are also available.\n\n21.

The main dining room is illuminated with chandeliers that one critic described as being “as big as Volkswagens” hung from a ceiling and another called “as high as the Himalayas.”\n\nThe menu is Asian-inspired, with a selection of dumplings and other dim sum, a Peking duck salad with sherry vinaigrette, Mongolian lamb chops, kung pao monkfish, and Dungeness crab sticky rice with Chinese broccoli among the choices.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n20.

Two more were subsequently launched, in Las Vegas and Washington, D.C., and all three are among\n\nthe highest-grossing restaurants in the country (see No. 15 and No.17).\n\nFlorida stone crab remains a staple of the menu, along with other fish and shellfish choices such as oysters Rockefeller, crispy fried shrimp, and grilled Alaskan halibut.

The design of this three-level, 300-seat place is appropriately theatrical, with a dining room dominated by a 16-foot-tall seated Buddha above a virtual reflecting pool.\n\nDim sum and other small plates such as rock shrimp lettuce cups, and chicken satay, as well as Chinese-style spareribs, tempura vegetables, sushi and sashimi, seafood in various guises, kung pao chicken, and a grilled Kobe ribeye with yuzu cilantro butter are among the menu choices.

The group launched this place — which it describes as \"the first modern steakhouse in the United States\" — in 2004.\n\nThe extensive menu includes a raw bar selection, more than 20 appetizers and salads -- including such unusual choices as truffle provolone fondue and pan-seared diver scallops with slow-braised wagyu short rib -- 15 different cuts and sizes of steak with 17 accompanying sauces and compound butters, 10 kinds of regular and sweet potatoes, 22 vegetable preparations, and a raft of \"chef's compositions,\" from blackened local swordfish to chicken and waffles.\n\n12.

It can be debated whether yellowtail crudo with blueberry and ginger, avocado toast with peas and radishes, or a 50-day-dry-aged 36-ounce tomahawk ribeye steak were \"[i]nspired by street food from around the world,\" as the website puts it, but there is certainly a multi-cultural flavor to such dishes as roasted squash tostadas, shawarma salad, tortilla soup dumplings, and wild mushroom \"street pizza.\"\n\n11.

The menu goes far beyond that, though, with a full deli-style selection of blintzes and potato pancakes, deli sandwiches (including four Reuben variations), burgers, and entrees, including brisket of beef and Hungarian beef goulash. Less in the deli mode are such appetizers as Thai ginger BBQ wings, disco fries, and seven barbecue shrimp, chicken, and ribs choices. When this first Junior's in Manhattan's Times Square neighborhood opened in 2006, according to the restaurant website, its \"Brooklyn NY\" sign confused would-be customers who thought they'd come out of the subway at the wrong stop. There's a newer Junior's four blocks north, as well as outposts at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut and in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in?

It opened its doors in 1989 in the space that once housed the legendary club Mister Kelly's, where the likes of Bette Midler, Sarah Vaughan, and Muddy Waters once appeared. Gibsons was the first restaurant group in the country to be granted its own USDA Prime certification, and it serves only Midwestern grass-fed Black Angus beef plus a couple of 75-day-aged Australian grass-fed cuts. The menu is similar to that at the Rosemount restaurant, and prices are basically the same.\n\n9.

Meals served annually: 420,000\n\nIn the early 1980s, Manhattan's centrally located Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library's main branch, was an unkempt no-go landscape where dope dealers and other disreputable types plied their trades. Today, it is a major destination, hosting over a thousand free activities, classes, and events each year as well as a popular Winter Village of shops — and this beautifully situated restaurant, opened in 1995 in a latticed pavilion and environs.\n\nBreakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and all-day café service are available here. The menu is international in flavor, ranging from Moroccan lamb kebab and sashimi tuna taco appetizers to such main dishes as sweet and spicy monkfish and grilled chicken fricassée. Ark Restaurants, which operates 22 establishments in six states and Washington, D.C., runs the place.\n\n8. Smith & Wollensky\n\nLocation: New York, N.Y.\n\nNew York, N.Y.

The man behind it was Alan Stillman, who a dozen years earlier had created T.G.I. Fridays. He described the steakhouse originally as \"the American version of the French restaurants I loved in France.\" Since its founding, Smith & Wollensky grew into a small chain, which today has nine venues around the country and one in London. In 2007, however, Stillman sold the company to the Patina Restaurant Group, keeping the Manhattan original for himself.\n\nPrime dry-aged steaks form the heart of the relatively restrained menu, but there are also such traditional dishes as Caesar salad, New England clam chowder, lemon pepper chicken, and Dover sole meunière. Wine lovers appreciate the thrice-yearly Wine Week promotion, which offers samples of 10 different wines with lunch or dinner for $20.\n\n7.

Antique mirrors, reclaimed subway tiles, and old factory bricks frame the dining room.\n\nThe menu offers a few surprises, but covers such basics as baked clams oreganato, Maine lobster cocktail, \"The Meatball,\" an assortment of pizzas and pastas, chicken Marsala, and grilled red snapper with panzanella salad.

He and his wife had opened a lunch stand in Miami Beach in 1913. In 1921, a visiting ichthyologist from Harvard brought him a sack of these crustaceans. At first, Joe thought nobody would eat them, but he tried boiling and then chilling them, and they were a hit. In 2000, Chicago's Let Us Entertain You restaurant group went into partnership with Weiss's descendents to open a hybrid called Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab (see No. 20 and No. 17), but the original remains a one-of-a-kind operation.\n\nBesides the signature claws -- fresh stone crabs are in season from October 15 to May 15 -- the large menu offers plenty of other seafood, including oysters, snapper and shrimp ceviche, crab cannelloni, potato-crusted mahi mahi, and even skirt steak tacos and steak frites. If you can't get to Joe's in person, the restaurant ships \"Claws for Celebration\" packages, featuring stone crab claws, the house mustard sauce, a cracking board, a mallet, cocktail forks, and bibs.

We are a purpose-led and values-driven organization that believes in doing the right thing.”\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is also planning to break away from its Russian business.\n\n“As a result of the Russian government’s invasion of Ukraine we have decided that, under the circumstances, PwC should not have a member firm in Russia and consequently PwC Russia will leave the network,” the “Big Four” consultancy said in a statement.\n\n“Our main focus at PwC continues to be doing all we can to help our Ukrainian colleagues and support the humanitarian efforts,” it added.\n\n“We are also committed to working with our colleagues at PwC Russia to undertake an orderly transition for the business, and with a focus on the wellbeing of our 3,700 colleagues in PwC Russia.”\n\nEnergy and metals\n\nBP said it was planning to exit its 19.75% stake in Russia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft, and suspending their joint ventures — which amount to one of the biggest foreign investments in Russia.\n\nEquinor will also begin to exit its joint ventures in Russia, the Norwegian oil and gas company announced.\n\n“We are all deeply troubled by the invasion of Ukraine, which represents a terrible setback for the world,” said CEO Anders Opedal.\n\nThe company said it had $1.2 billion in long-term investments in Russia at the end of 2021.

Employees will still be paid.\n\nBurger King said it is pulling corporate support from its businesses in Russia. Restaurant Brands International, which owns the burger chain, said it “has suspended all of its corporate support for the Russian market, including operations, marketing and supply chain.” That doesn’t necessarily mean that Burger King restaurants will be closed in Russia, however, as the company said the chain’s roughly 800 locations there are “fully franchised and managed by a local master franchisee.” This means that the company cannot simply pull the plug on those restaurants as other brands such as McDonald’s have done.\n\nCoca-Cola (COKE) said that it is “suspending its business in Russia.” The company stated that “our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,” adding that it will monitor the situation as things change.\n\nHeineken will stop producing and selling beer in Russia.

The crisis is the worst he’s seen, he told CNN Business.\n\nThe trade group represents 1,200 fish-and-chip businesses, and has been running for more than a century.\n\nCrook, who owns his own shop, said prices started rising toward the end of last year, but the costs of staple ingredients have shot up since late February, when Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n“Across the board, everything’s gone up,” Crook said.\n\nBusinesses across industries are struggling with soaring prices as supply chain snarls have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. But British fish and chip shops, which traditionally operate under very narrow margins, are feeling a particular squeeze because of the industry’s reliance on Russian imports.\n\nUp to 40% of the industry’s cod and haddock come from Russian waters, and about half of its sunflower oil is imported from Ukraine, Crook said.\n\nBusinesses are paying about 83% more for sunflower oil compared to early March, according to Crook. Palm oil, a common alternative, has doubled in price. Indonesia — the world’s biggest exporter of palm oil — started to restrict exports last month to help maintain domestic supplies.\n\nAdding to the pain are eye-watering energy bills and rocketing prices for fertilizer needed to grow potatoes.\n\nFish and chips is one of the UK’s unofficial national dishes. The first shops opened in the 1860s and spread rapidly as the country industrialized, helping to feed factory workers, according to the trade group. During World War II, as the government rationed other staples such as tea, butter, meat, fish and chips were exempt, so important was the dish to the working classes.\n\nCustomers expect their fish and chips to be cheap, Crook said. A year ago, the average price for a regular cod and chips would be about £7, Crook said. Now, he estimates it’s around £8.50 — a 21% increase.\n\n“We are running the risk of pricing ourselves out of the market…we’re trying to keep increases as low as possible,” Crook said. Some have already turned away.\n\n“I’ve lost some regular customers that used to come every Friday,” he added.\n\nFears that the UK government will impose harsh import tariffs on Russian white fish have pushed businesses to stock up on alternatives, further jacking up the price of the Icelandic and Norwegian fish that Crook buys.\n\nThe price of a case of Icelandic cod is now £270 ($331), up from £140 ($176) this time last year, Crook said.\n\nBusinesses like Crook’s face the uphill task of selling fish and chips to customers facing the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Annual consumer price inflation hit 7% in March, its highest level in 30 years, and could hit 10% later this year, according to the Bank of England.\n\nMore than half a million small businesses in the UK — that’s about one in 10 — plan to shut, downsize or sell up in the next year as many struggle to secure financing, according to a survey by the Federation of Small Businesses.\n\nFor Crook, the fate of his shop is personal.\n\n“It’s more than just a job. For many of us, we’ve taken on family businesses,” he said. “I’m second generation in the business — and you don’t want it failing on your watch.”", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/05/16"}]}

So has my viewpoint", "text": "Once upon a time, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue was a puzzlement to me. I was 12, and I didn’t understand why there was a women’s swimsuit issue in my sports magazine.\n\nThen I figured it out, and like millions of Americans, I put up with it. For years, women were denied their rightful place on the cover of SI, unless they were wearing almost nothing at all, in which case the cover was all theirs. It wasn’t right and it wasn’t fair, but it was just the way it was. I smiled as people wrote in cancelling their subscriptions. I would never do that.\n\nThen top female athletes started showing up in SI photo shoots, some of them posing more like those scantily-clad models than the terrific athletes they were.\n\nI wrote a column about this in August 2000. People who can’t recall what they had for lunch yesterday somehow still remember it. I pointed out that a picture of Olympic swimming champion Jenny Thompson, who appeared topless while clenching two strategically placed fists, sent girls \"the insecure message that an old stereotype still lives and thrives.” When you looked at the picture, you didn't focus on her stunning biceps or abs or quads. No, your eyes went “right to her chest.”\n\nLATEST SI SWIMSUIT COVER:Tyra Banks sizzles on the cover in a bikini at 45\n\nI asked Olympic icon and women’s sports advocate Donna de Varona what she thought. “I guess I’m old-fashioned,” she said. “I want them to keep their clothes on.”\n\nStill pretty good advice all these years later. But times have changed, and more and more of these young athletes believe they are striking a blow for empowerment, not succumbing to sexism’s lowest common denominator, by appearing in various stages of undress.\n\nThey do it for SI, as four members of the U.S. women’s national soccer team just did. And they have done it for years in ESPN’s The Body Issue. There are far more athletes who do not appear in these issues than do, of course. But those who do are now so numerous, it’s certainly not the headline-grabbing story it used to be.\n\nAnd it’s not just female athletes, but some males too. The split is nowhere near 50-50, and likely never will be, which is of course a problem, because if this really is all about empowerment and showing off your muscles, the guys would be as interested in participating as the women.\n\nThat said, something very interesting appeared in the latest issue. U.S. soccer star Megan Rapinoe, who is responsible for the most famous pass in the history of the American game (to Abby Wambach’s forehead in the 2011 World Cup), became the first openly gay woman to be featured in an SI swimsuit issue, while Somali-American and Muslim model Halima Aden became the first woman to wear a hijab and burkini.\n\nIf we are to assume that SI readers (i.e. men, mostly) would have written in cancelling their subscriptions had they been subjected to such things in a swimsuit issue a few decades ago, then, yes, this is progress.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/19/opinions/women-basketball-wnba-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-cretaz/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue is a step back in time ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Editor’s note: Frankie de la Cretaz is an independent journalist whose writing sits at the intersection of sports and gender.

Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nSports Illustrated this week rolled out its annual swimsuit issue, with this year’s edition highlighting body diversity and incorporating buzzwords like “inclusive” and “powerful” to describe the women depicted.\n\nThe photo spreads featured Asian American recording artist Yumi Nu, whose pictures generated a backlash from men angered by the fact that she is a plus-sized woman. It also included Kelly Hughes, a model with a visible c-section scar, as well as 74-year-old Maye Musk, mother of business magnate Elon Musk and the oldest cover model to ever grace the magazine.\n\nAlso included in the issue is a photo spread featuring five WNBA players: Sue Bird, Nneka Ogwumike, Breanna Stewart, DiDi Richards and Te’a Cooper. It marks the first time athletes from the professional women’s basketball league appear in SI’s swimsuit issue, a move the magazine called “unprecedented,” “history-making” and “radical.”\n\nFrankie de la Cretaz Delia M. Harrington\n\nBut while in theory their inclusion could be seen as progress, the glam shot aesthetics of the photos – and the WNBA’s language promoting the pictures – feels like a step backwards for the league’s image and branding.\n\nThe WNBA promoted the shoot last week in a tweet which read “we can do both [fire emoji].”\n\nWhat was meant by “both” wasn’t clear, but it’s not hard to conclude that they meant that players can be both “athletic” and “feminine” – two things that often are wrongly assumed to be at odds.\n\nThe photo seems jarring: All five players in the picture have been glammed up in a way that seems inconsistent with their usual off-the-court self-presentation. That’s particularly true for the out queer players in the group, Bird (typically femme-leaning, but unfussy) and Stewart (who favors more of a soft butch aesthetic).\n\nNot only does that framing buy into century-old anxieties around women’s gender roles and presentation, but it’s a bizarre misstep for a league that has grown, since its inception, in terms of letting their players embrace a more diverse range of gender expressions.\n\nBird said in a statement posted online by the magazine that posing for the picture allowed the players to put the diversity of the league on full display – and show just how far the WNBA has come in terms of representation.\n\n“We represent a variety of things: of course women, women of color, members of the LGBTQIA2+ community and much more,” Bird said of the players’ involvement.\n\nUS female athletes' fight for equal pay (2021) 03:28 - Source: CNN\n\n“The [swimsuit] issue for so many years has been iconic and has represented a lot for women. Now you are seeing an evolution in what that can mean and what that can look like, and I think the WNBA players being a part of that is what makes it special. There is no better group of women to showcase that evolution.”\n\nOther players quoted in the same SI statement suggested that the photo spread afforded them visibility to help advance other causes: Stewart said she hoped to promote the league’s social justice initiatives and Ogwumike highlighted the strength of the league’s players’ union.\n\nStill, it’s unsettling to look at the photos of these women – who are generally seen as not conforming to societal expectations and standards around women’s beauty – being featured in a magazine issue known for objectifying women. It’s hard to view it as “evolution” in any way.\n\nIt’s also difficult to see how posing in swimwear brings meaningful attention to the initiatives that Stewart and Ogwumike hope to spotlight. Rather than showcasing its progress, the images seem to be a throwback to the league’s early, less enlightened days.\n\nWhen the WNBA began in the late 1990s, its marketing replicated contradictory ideas around how women athletes should look. Players were sometimes photographed in swimsuits or encouraged to wear makeup and dresses. There were league-sanctioned makeup classes for rookies.\n\nAnd while straight players’ families were highlighted, there was rarely ever mention made of the significant others of players whose partners might not be men.\n\nIt was a part of a perpetual attempt to appeal to the cisgender, heterosexual male gaze – because, after all, why else would men watch women’s sports except to ogle at the athletes on screen? And it tapped into debunked, antiquated and even ludicrous ideas that sports make women masculine and even somehow interfere with their fertility.\n\nPlayers have taken control of their public images in recent years, thanks in large part to the rise of social media and the ability of athletes to create their own brands and aesthetics through their platforms. The league sometimes seemed to be following the players’ lead in allowing them more room for self-expression: The featured player heading into the 2022 WNBA draft, for instance, was Destanni Henderson, whose draft day outfit was a sea foam green suit and matching Yankees hat.\n\nWNBA All-Stars (l. to r.) Kym Hampton; Rebecca Lobo; Vickie Johnson and Theresa Weatherspoon, of the New York Liberty, look at video at the NBA Store on Fifth Ave., where they met fans. New York Daily News Archive/Getty Images\n\nNevertheless, more often than not it’s the conventionally attired, conventionally attractive (read thin, White, feminine) women who get the league’s focus, media attention and sponsorship dollars. A study of coverage of the 2020 season showed that White players receive almost twice as much coverage as Black players, despite the fact that the league is 80% Black.\n\n“In [women’s basketball], you gottah be the best player, best looking, most marketable, most IG followers, just to sit at the endorsement table,” Connecticut Sun player and WNBA MVP Jonquel Jones tweeted earlier this year. “Not to mention me being a black lesbian woman. Lord the seats disappearing from the table as I speak.”\n\nDespite the fact that the league sometimes falls short on issues of race and gender inclusivity, SI apparently feels that including WNBA players in its swimsuit issue can only help it appear more inclusive, less emblematic of oppressive and unrealistic beauty standards for women and embracing of values that are relevant to 2022.\n\nBut that’s nearly impossible: The swimsuit issue is a holdover from an earlier century. It feels oddly archaic alongside Sports Illustrated’s often excellent coverage of women and trans athletes (Full disclosure: I have written for the publication).\n\nJewell Loyd #24 of the Seattle Storm drives to the basket against the Las Vegas Aces on May 15, 2021. Stephen Brashear/NBAE/Getty Images\n\nI’m also left to wonder why the WNBA felt it would help its brand to be associated with an antiquated annual tradition that has women’s objectification at its roots.\n\nAnd as long as SI says it is aiming to expand the representation of women on its pages, it should try steering away from the traditional femininity that is often the only aesthetic allowed to be promoted.\n\n“I love Sports Illustrated’s attempt to be more inclusive and amplify women in the W,” Connecticut Sun player Courtney Williams said on Twitter.\n\n“At the same time though it would of been raw to see a sleek lil sports bra & some shorts swaggin’. There’s more than one way to look sexy, and I hope in the future we can tap into that.”\n\nThe decision to market these athletes as exclusively hyperfeminine – whether made by the magazine or the league – isn’t just regressive. In a league that is largely made up of queer women, it sends a message that’s outright queerphobic.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThere are plenty of feminine queer women, but queer womanhood is much more expansive than that. In distancing itself from the potential of an explicitly queer aesthetic, this photo display distances itself from the truth of what the league actually is: a group of elite athletes that includes a lot of queer, Black women.\n\nIt’s long past time to celebrate and uplift queer, masculine-of-center aesthetics as desirable.

The women featured in the Sports Illustrated VR videos are former cover models Hannah Davis, Irina Shayk and Nina Agdal.\n\n(For the first time, the magazine itself will feature three separate covers, featuring Hailey Clauson, plus-size model Ashley Graham and a body-painted Ronda Rousey, as well as spotlight 56-year-old Nicola Griffin, the magazine's editors announced Saturday.)\n\nConsumers have the option of viewing the VR videos either on their smartphones (with or without goggles such as Google Cardboard or Samsung Gear VR) or on coming high-end units such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Some videos are free while other clips will be accessible to subscribers through special codes.\n\nSuper Bowl fans get hit of virtual reality future\n\n“VR is an emerging tech and we want to get out ahead in this space,” says Chris Hercik, creative director at Sports Illustrated, noting that the magazine aims to roll out more VR content this year. “(SI) is all about access. Sure it’s nice to be courtside at a game (in VR), but we can take you to a practice or inside a locker room.”\n\nVirtual reality, which uses blackout goggles to project a 360-degree view of the world, is expected to boom this year. While the new hardware looks promising, there is still much experimentation to be done on what sort of content will appeal to consumers and how long they’ll be willing to engage with it during each occluded sitting. While there is no issue binge-watching videos for hours, top VR researchers recommend no more than 15 minute sessions in the often disorienting virtual world.\n\nSuch caveats aside, Hercik says Time Inc. is determined to use VR across its dozens of properties, which include People, Fortune and InStyle. He allows that VR adoption rates remain to be seen given both the tech’s novelty and its relative lack of content but is convinced VR will prove invaluable in engaging an increasingly fickle audience.\n\nInStyle tried its hand at VR content last fall, bringing readers to a photo shoot with Drew Barrymore. Next week, the lifestyle title will unveil a new VR effort that brings viewers behind the scenes of a recent Golden Globes afterparty.\n\n“As a company, we’re known for storytelling, and VR is the next frontier in storytelling,” says Angela Matusik, executive editor of InStyle Digital.\n\nMedia giants are racing to leverage virtual reality content in their efforts to both stay with the times and engender consumer loyalty.\n\n\"As the installed base for this new tech grows, we anticipate over $10 billion combined AR/VR video revenues by 2020,\" says Tim Merel, founder of industry advisors Digi-Capital and app-maker Eyetouch Reality.\n\nVirtual reality's promise, risk loom large for health researchers\n\n\"For editorial content, the market is being tested by traditional media like The New York Times, CNN and USA TODAY, as well as cutting edge creators like Nonny de la Peña's Emblematic Group,\" he says. \"From a scale perspective, the much larger installed base of competing media, which is mobile, web, TV, print, should outweigh AR/VR editorial for a while yet. But the growth rates for AR/VR editorial content could be significantly higher than their traditional counterparts.\"\n\nGannett, which owns USA TODAY and a network of nearly 100 publications across the country, has brought readers to the streets of Havana and inside a Blue Angels jet via VR. “We started 18 months ago with an award-winning (Des Moines Register) series called Harvest of Change, which took viewers inside the life of a family farm in Iowa,” says USA TODAY editor in chief David Callaway.\n\nThe New York Times also has been a VR video leader, producing immersive reports about Europe’s refugees and Paris after the terrorist attacks. Last year, the company distributed a million cardboard smartphone goggles to print subscribers. “This year, we’re putting more money into a program of films of our own, and are curating VR content in partnership with (film fest organizers) Sundance,” says New York Times spokesperson Eileen Murphy.\n\nThe United Nations has even taken advantage of VR's ability to generate empathy. Its 2015 short film Clouds Over Sidra, about a young Syrian refugee's life in a camp, has won a number of awards and put a spotlight on the transportive nature of VR content.\n\nStanding in obvious contrast to Sidra is Sports Illustrated's comparatively voyeuristic effort, which is bound to rile its persistent critics even further.\n\n“Sports Illustrated’s Swimsuit Issue should be renamed the Sexploitation Issue,” Dawn Hawkins, executive director of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, said in a statement last week just before the issue's cover model was revealed. “This magazine has a long history of sexually objectifying women for sport, and any store that displays SI’s February issue is sending the message that it agrees women’s bodies are for public consumption.\"\n\nSI's Hercik says simply that the VR project was \"just meant to address the question I always get, which is, 'What's it like to be on a swimsuit shoot?'\"\n\nWevr co-founder Anthony Batt says his mission was to be as unobtrusive as possible during the SI shoot. Using a variety of cameras, the Wevr crew sought to capture scenes from multiple perspectives. In some, the viewer take the point of view of the photographer. In others, you're a fly on the wall able to see the entire crew from the vantage point of the model.\n\n\"Instead of looking at a page, you're actually standing in the page,\" Batt says. \"VR is transformational for the (magazine) medium.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter @marcodellacava.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/05/19/sports-illustrated-swimsuit-2023-launch-party-megan-fox-machine-gun-kelly/70234451007/", "title": "SI Swimsuit 2023 launch party: Megan Fox, MGK, Padma Lakshmi ...", "text": "NEW YORK — Flocks of women confidently sauntered down the red carpet Thursday night at the Hard Rock Hotel in New York to celebrate the 2023 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit release.\n\nAnd closely trailing behind them were their supportive partners.

The Spurs never missed the playoffs during Duncan's 19 seasons, but their 22-year playoff streak came to an end in 2020 and they have failed to reach the postseason since.\n\nNow, they have another cornerstone to build around.\n\nEYE ON THE FUTURE:Here are the best NBA player and team future bets\n\nThe lottery took place in Chicago, prior to the start of the first game of the Western Conference finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Denver Nuggets. It was conducted in a separate room just before ESPN’s draft lottery show. Select media, NBA officials and representatives of the participating teams and the accounting firm Ernst & Young were in attendance in the room for the drawings.\n\nThe 2023 NBA draft will be held June 22 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nWhat were the results of the NBA draft lottery for the 2023 NBA draft?\n\nSan Antonio Spurs (14% chance of top pick) Charlotte Hornets (12.5%) Portland Trail Blazers (10.5%) Houston Rockets (14%) Detroit Pistons (14%) Orlando Magic (9%) Indiana Pacers (6.8%) Washington Wizards (6.7%) Utah Jazz (4.5%) Dallas Mavericks (3%) Orlando Magic (via Chicago) (1.8%) Oklahoma City Thunder (1.7%) Toronto Raptors (1%) New Orleans Pelicans (0.5%)\n\nWho is Victor Wembanyama, the presumptive No. 1 NBA draft pick?\n\nFrance’s Victor Wembanyama is the clear-cut No. 1 pick and has been for some time. He’s 19 with an impressive skill set — a guard’s game in a big man’s body and a big man’s game in a 7-2 frame. He’s athletic, can handle the basketball, shoot it, pass and he possesses great footwork and shot-blocking ability. Think Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kevin Durant — if Wembanyama maximizes his potential.\n\nThis season, Wembanyama is averaging 21.8 points, 10.3 rebounds, 3.1 blocks, 2.4 assists and is shooting 54.7% from the field. He will need to improve on his 29.2% 3-point shooting.\n\nWembanyama would be the first player from France drafted No. 1 overall.\n\n\"Everybody’s been a unicorn over the last few years,\" Lakers star LeBron James said in October. \"Well, he’s more like an alien.\"\n\nHow does the NBA draft lottery work?\n\nAccording to the NBA, \"Fourteen ping-pong balls numbered 1 through 14 will be placed in a lottery machine.

There is a 10-second mix, and then the fourth ball is drawn. The team that has been assigned that combination will receive the No. 1 pick.

The 19-year-old has been labeled one of the best prospects in years — perhaps the best since LeBron James was selected right out of high school 20 years ago.\n\nTuesday night's events will shape the course of the NBA for years.

The first two worked out pretty well.\n\nSan Antonio also picked first in 1997, selecting Tim Duncan, and in 1987, when it selected David Robinson. Both players are in the Basketball Hall of Fame and Duncan finished his career with five NBA championships. The Spurs never missed the playoffs during Duncan's 19 seasons, but their 22-year playoff streak came to an end in 2020 and they have failed to reach the postseason since.\n\nNow, the Spurs, who went 22-60 this past season, presumably have another big-man building block in Wembanyama. Managing partner Peter J. Holt did not hide his excitement when it was revealed the Spurs would pick first.\n\nGregg Popovich ... and whoever coaches the Spurs next\n\nPopovich is the NBA's all-time winningest coach, but he has not had a ton of talent to work with in the years since Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard left the team. Wembanyama could be the key to Popovich getting the Spurs back on track. But \"Wemby\" also figures to help the next coach of the Spurs. Popovich is 74 years old, and while he's given little indication about his future, we know he will not coach forever. Wembanyama could improve the Spurs in the immediate and make San Antonio an attractive destination for prospective coaches whenever Popovich is ready to hand the reins over.\n\nVictor Wembanyama\n\nRegardless of who got the first pick, Wembanyama was going to be a winner. He's going to be the first pick in the NBA draft. That's awesome. Landing with the Spurs is a nice bonus. This isn't the same franchise that churned out 18 straight 50-win seasons, but the Spurs are still generally more stable with a more recent track record of success than teams like Detroit and Charlotte and they have a long history of embracing and succeeding with international players.\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\nThough ending up No. 2 to the Spurs stings — Charlotte last picked this high in 2012, when it selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist ... right behind top pick Anthony Davis — the Hornets should still be getting a real solid player. For the team with the longest playoff drought in the NBA, that's a good thing.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers\n\nPortland had the fifth-best odds but jumped up to No. 3. The Blazers can either use that pick to add a talented young player ... or perhaps package it to bring in another star alongside Damian Lillard. The slight jump gives Portland even more possibilities.\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nDallas pretty blatantly tanked the end of its season to try and preserve its first-round pick; if the Mavericks' selection fell outside the top 10, it would become property of the New York Knicks via 2019's Kristaps Porzingis trade. The NBA fined the Mavs $750,000 for their actions but the team got what it wanted in the end, keeping their first-round pick by sticking at No. 10.\n\nLOSERS\n\nDetroit Pistons and Houston Rockets\n\nDetroit was the worst team in the NBA at 17-65 and Houston matched the Spurs with a 22-60 record. The teams had the same 14% chance of selecting first as San Antonio did. Wembanyama would have been a welcome addition with both squads fielding extremely young cores. Instead, the Pistons tumbled to fifth while Houston fell to fourth. That stings.\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nThe Bulls only had a 1.8% chance at the top pick, but they end the night without a pick at all. Chicago's pick was top-four protected, but the Bulls remained at 11 and instead the Orlando Magic will pick in their place thanks to the 2021 trade for Nikola Vucevic. The Bulls went 40-42 this season and lost the play-in for the No. 8 seed to the Heat.

But they didn't leave Tuesday's NBA draft lottery with the grand prize.\n\nDetroit will have the fifth pick in this year's draft, which will take place at Brooklyn's Barclays Center in New York on June 22. The Pistons won't be able to draft French phenom Victor Wembanyama — a tough result for a franchise coming off of an NBA-worst 17-65 season. The Pistons were one of three teams with a 14% chance of winning the No. 1 spot, but the reveal of the No. 5 pick — the league draws for the top four spots — revealed the Pistons' logo at the draft lottery Tuesday night in Chicago.\n\nCARLOS MONARREZ:Pistons’ horrible NBA draft lottery luck proves we just can’t have nice things\n\nThat meant the Portland Trail Blazers, who entered the draft with a 10.5% chance at the No. 1 spot and a 42.1% chance of a top-four pick, had moved up. Picks Nos. 6-14 fell according to their pre-lottery odds. The Blazers jumped to No. 3, with the Charlotte Hornets coming in at No. 2 and the San Antonio Spurs, one of the two other teams with 14% odds, winning No. 1. The Houston Rockets, the other 14% squad, finished with the No. 4 pick.\n\nLike any other draft, there will be star talent outside of the top pick. And the Pistons will be in prime position to select from a talented group of players. G League Ignite guard Scoot Henderson and Alabama forward Brandon Miller are likely to be gone, but Overtime Elite twin guards Amen and Ausar Thompson could be available, with Villanova's Cam Whitmore and Houston's Jarace Walker also top-five possibilities.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nFEELING A DRAFT?Pistons big board 2.0: Victor Wembanyama and the best fits ahead of the lottery\n\nONES TO GROW ON:LeBron James and the greatest No. 1 overall picks Victor Wembanyama has to compete with\n\nThat player will join a talented group of young players including 2021 No. 1 overall pick Cade Cunningham, who will return next season after missing most of the 2022-23 with a shin injury and surgery, and 2023 All-Rookie Second Team selections Jalen Duren and Jaden Ivey.\n\nIvey was the No. 5 pick last summer. Quite a few Hall of Fame players have been selected fifth overall, including Charles Barkley (1984), Scottie Pippen (1987), Kevin Garnett (1995), Ray Allen (1996) and Vince Carter (1998), who'll soon be enshrined.\n\nDetroit will also have the first selection of Round 2, the 31st overall pick of the draft.\n\nThis year represented the 17th time the Pistons were in the lottery and the third year in a row they had a 14% chance at the No. 1 pick. They lucked out in 2021 and landed Cunningham, who finished third in 2022's Rookie of the Year voting. That was also the only time their pick improved thanks to the lottery. In seven previous drawings, the Pistons dropped at least one spot (last year and in 2020, they dropped two spots). Eight other times, they remained in their original position.\n\nOMARI SANKOFA II:If Pistons lose chance to get Victor Wembanyama, it's not the end of the world.

The Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, and Houston Rockets each have a 14% chance of landing the top choice.\n\nThe No. 1 overall pick is always valuable in the NBA, a league where one player can change the fortunes of a franchise overnight. But not every first choice is created the same.\n\nBecause of the nature of basketball and the importance of height, a lot of times you know who the prospects are at a really young age, sometimes as young as 14 or 15. They don't always develop into NBA stars — remember when Emoni Bates was supposed to be the nation's top player? — but seemingly more than any other American sport, they do.\n\nSHAWN WINDSOR:Victor Wembanyama is big prize, but whomever lands him faces long odds of winning big\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nOMARI SANKOFA II:If Pistons lose chance to get Victor Wembanyama, it's not the end of the world. Here's why\n\nWembanyama certainly finds himself in an elite class of the top basketball prospects of all time, alongside LeBron James, Shaquille O'Neal, Patrick Ewing and other can't-miss stars. But even if \"Wemby\" pans out as expected, he still has a lot of work to be considered among the greatest first picks of all time.\n\nSo before the lottery tonight, let's take a look at the ten greatest No. 1 overall picks of the lottery era, which started with the selection of Ewing in 1985 (with our apologies to Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, etc.).\n\nNo. 1: LeBron James, 2003\n\nAs the years go on and LeBron James continues to dominate, this choice keeps getting easier and easier.\n\nThe NBA's all-time leading scorer is a four-time NBA champion, a four-time MVP, and opening the Western Conference finals on Tuesday night in his 20th season. James is either the greatest or second-greatest player of all time, and considering Michael Jordan wasn't taken No. 1 overall, that makes James an easy choice here.\n\nWith career averages of 27.2 points, 7.5 rebounds and 7.3 assists per game, James has perfected the Swiss Army knife role on the court and has proved to be the greatest \"one-man rebuild\" in the league's history, bringing championships to three different franchises.\n\nFREEP FLASHBACK:Inside LeBron James' five greatest regular-season games against the Pistons\n\nNo. 2: Tim Duncan, 1997\n\nWhere to start with \"The Big Fundamental\"?\n\nTim Duncan accomplished pretty much everything possible as the cornerstone of a franchise: Five NBA titles, two MVPs, 15 All-Star and All-NBA nods and so many other achievements — all with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nHis low-maintenance mentality and consistent approach helped the Spurs be the model NBA franchise for almost 20 years. He gets the nod at No. 2 because he did it all with the team who selected him. Could you argue that his selection was the most valuable ever made by a franchise? Sure. But he's just not better than LeBron.\n\nNo. 3: Shaquille O'Neal, 1992\n\nPerhaps the most physically dominant basketball player in history, Shaquille O'Neal slides in at No. 3.\n\nHe took over the league as soon as he stepped foot on an NBA floor and averaged 29.3 points and 13.2 rebounds in his second year in the league.\n\nOver an impressive 20-season run, O'Neal made 15 All-Star teams, 14 All-NBA teams, won four championships, and was the MVP in 2000.\n\nO'Neal won three titles with the Los Angeles Lakers and one with the Miami Heat. He averaged 23.7 points, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks for his career.\n\nNo. 4: David Robinson, 1987\n\nWhat a career \"The Admiral\" had.\n\nRobinson missed the first two years of his career completing his military service requirement with the U.S. Navy. That's how good Robinson was. The Spurs knew that and still picked him first.\n\nAlthough he's not in the same class as Duncan or O'Neal, Robinson's accolades are definitely impressive: two NBA titles, 10 All-Star teams, 10 All-NBA nods and the 1995 MVP.\n\nRobinson helped shape the Spurs franchise and was as consistent as it gets, averaging at least 23.2 points per game in each of his first seven seasons in the league (before an injury cost him almost all of a season and led to the Spurs being in position to draft Duncan).\n\nThe Admiral signed off his career by winning an championship in 2003 alongside Duncan.\n\nWHAT COULD HAVE BEEN:Pistons almost got Allen Iverson in his prime. How different would history be?\n\nNo. 5 : Allen Iverson, 1996\n\nAllen Iverson ... Detroit Pistons legend! Just kidding of course: Iverson spent just 54 games on the Pistons' roster during the 2008-09 season. But he's definitely still a legend.\n\nOne of the most popular players of all time, Iverson was a walking bucket — he led the league in scoring four times. He also seemingly never got tired, leading the league in minutes in seven seasons; for his career, he averaged 41.1 minutes per game over 914 games. In the age of \"load management,\" we may never see that again. For comparison, the NBA's 2022-23 minutes leader was Pascal Siakam, at 37.4 per game.\n\nIverson's nasty crossover and simultaneously herky-jerky but silky-smooth style made him a pleasure to watch.\n\nHe averaged 26.7 points, 6.2 assists, and 3.7 rebounds per game while racking up 11 All-Star appearances, seven All-NBA nots and winning the 2001 MVP award — the season he led his Philadelphia 76ers to the NBA Finals before losing to O'Neal's Lakers in a sweep. Other than that run, Iverson often struggled in the playoffs, which is why he's not higher on this list.\n\nNo. 6: Patrick Ewing, 1985\n\nIf you want a reminder of just how highly touted and rated Patrick Ewing was coming out of Georgetown, watch the ESPN documentary \"Requiem for the Big East,\" showing just how feared Ewing was before he even came into the league.\n\nEwing's arrival with the Knicks launched a million conspiracy theories when the storied franchise landed the No. 1 pick in the inaugural NBA draft lottery era. He was a dominant defensive player who was also a force to be reckoned with on offense. He averaged 21 points a game over his career, but got as high as 28.6 points per game (in 1989-90, when he finished fifth in MVP voting); combined with his elite defense, that touch made him one of the top players in the league.\n\nHe never won an NBA championship but racked up 11 All-Star appearances, seven All-NBA nods and was on the All-Defense team three times.\n\nNo. 7: Anthony Davis, 2012\n\nThis is where we are starting to split hairs.\n\nAnthony Davis barely tops the person who was drafted No. 1 the year prior. It might be surprising to see him up this high, but the résumé doesn't lie: The former New Orleans Pelican is an eight-time All-Star, a four-time member of the All-NBA team, and plays elite defense, perhaps more than anyone else on this list.\n\nDespite never winning Defensive Player of the Year, he has made the All-Defense team four times and has led the league in blocks three times. His elite rim protection — stopping Ja Morant, Stephen Curry and others from scoring in the paint — is a big reason his Lakers are in the West finals.\n\nWhile he can be a bit of a floater sometimes on offense, his size and skill alone allow him to score well over 20 points a game. In his career, he has averaged 24 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 2.3 blocks.\n\nPlus, he won the 2020 NBA championship alongside James during the NBA's bubble playoffs in Orlando, Florida. If he can stay healthy — the biggest knock on his career, by far — he can continue to move up this list.\n\nNo. 8: Kyrie Irving, 2011\n\nKyrie Irving is perhaps the most gifted pure scorer on this list.\n\nHis finishing around the rim through traffic is second to none, and when he gets going, he has that rare microwave ability. His career high is 60 points in a game, but he has also scored 54, 55 and 57 points, plus 50 on two occasions. And in the playoffs, he had a 41-point game in the 2016 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors.\n\nMuch like Davis, the knocks on Irving largely have nothing to do with his on-court skill. Over his 11-year career, he has only topped 60 games six times. Plus, Irving has created more than a few controversies with his anti-vaccine stance, comments on the Holocaust and general locker room difficulties.\n\nStill, with a career average of 23.4 points and 5.7 assists per game, eight All-Star selections, three All-NBA teams and a 2016 championship, Irving is one of the all-time greats.\n\nNo. 9: Dwight Howard, 2004\n\nIn all likelihood, Dwight Howard will one day be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nHoward dominated the paint on both offense and defense for roughly a decade. Drafted by Orlando when he was just 19, Howard quickly became a physical force.\n\nHe was at the center of Stan Van Gundy's Orlando Magic squads that revolutionized the league with their \"3-and-D\" approach; their furthest run was a loss to the Lakers and Kobe Bryant in the 2009 NBA Finals.\n\nHoward made eight straight All-Star and All-NBA teams teams, won three Defensive Player of the Year awards and won the 2020 championship alongside Davis and James.\n\nMITCH ALBOM:Chris Webber finally gets the gold star, but remains a mercurial figure\n\nNo. 10: Chris Webber, 1993\n\nThis spot was a tough one to pick, but we're giving the nod to the Detroit native and Birmingham Detroit Country Day star.\n\nChris Webber had an outstanding pro career. He is a Hall of Famer, five-time All-Star and All-NBA selection and helped turn the Sacramento Kings into one of the Western Conference's toughest teams in the early 2000s.\n\nAfter dominating at Michigan as part of the Fab Five, Webber starred as a rookie, averaging 17.5 points and 9.1 rebounds per game.\n\nWebber played 15 seasons in the NBA and averaged 20.7 points, 9.8 rebounds and 4.2 assists, a sign of his underrated passing abilities.\n\nToward the end of his career, Webber signed on with his hometown Pistons and was part of their next-to-last Eastern Conference finals appearance.\n\nHonorable mentions", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2023/05/16/nba-draft-lottery-how-to-watch-detroit-pistons-victor-wembanyama-number-one-pick/70220387007/", "title": "NBA draft lottery recap: Spurs get No. 1 pick, chance to draft Victor ...", "text": "The future of the NBA is in the balance and the Detroit Pistons are center stage.\n\nAt 8 p.m. Tuesday, the world will find out which city 7-foot-5 French phenom Victor Wembanyama will call home.\n\nBasketball fans have been seeing and hearing about \"Wemby\" for years now, as clips, rumors and legends have built up around his ridiculous size and skills.\n\nFor the last year or more, teams across the league have prepared for this moment, trying to gather every last ping pong ball available by losing early and often, or as soon it was clear they couldn't compete.\n\nSHAWN WINDSOR:Victor Wembanyama is big prize, but whomever lands him faces long odds of winning big\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nOMARI SANKOFA II:If Pistons lose chance to get Victor Wembanyama, it's not the end of the world. Here's why\n\nNow, the day is here. The 14 teams who did not qualify for the NBA playoffs have been slotted into different percentages based on where they finished in the regular season standings.\n\nIt's a little complicated, but the teams in the lottery are given a number of combinations that could be drawn from the Smart Play lottery machine. The worse you were in the 2022-23 season, the better the chance you have of getting the No. 1 pick, or in this case, getting Wembanyama.\n\nAt the top are the Pistons, the Houston Rockets and the San Antonio Spurs, each with a 14% chance of winning the top pick. The NBA flattened the odds a few years ago in an effort to temper the race to the bottom. It hasn't stopped tanking, but it has made losing slightly less of a guarantee to acquire elite talent. In flattening the odds, they also made it so the bottom three teams also have a strong chance of dropping to pick No. 5.\n\nWE'RE NUMBER 1!LeBron James and the greatest No. 1 overall picks Victor Wembanyama has to compete with\n\nThe highly-anticipated night is filled with drama and definitely made for TV.\n\n2023 NBA draft lottery\n\nWhen: 8 p.m., before Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals\n\nWhere: McCormick Place Convention Center, Chicago\n\nTV: ESPN\n\nPistons' full odds:\n\nPick 1: 14%\n\n14% Pick 2: 13.4%\n\n13.4% Pick 3: 12.7%\n\n12.7% Pick 4: 12%\n\n12% Pick 5: 47.9%\n\nLive updates\n\nDon't see the updates?

Every year, we watch the relevant few minutes where NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum reads off the results of a totally random ping-pong ball drawing and come away convinced that some greater force was at play with a guiding hand on history.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs won the Victor Wembanyama sweepstakes. Of course they did.\n\nWho else was going to get a generational big man other than the team who got the lottery to fall perfectly in 1987 and 1997 when it just so happened that two other generational big men were available?\n\nSomehow, these things happen all the time in the NBA. How does LeBron James end up in Cleveland, a mere 40 miles from where he grew up? How does Cleveland get the No. 1 pick again the year James is a free agent, clearing the way for him to return and win a championship? How does Chicago, with a mere 1.8 percent chance of getting the No. 1 pick, end up with the chance to draft hometown kid Derrick Rose? How does New Orleans, stung by Anthony Davis’ trade demand in 2019, immediately win the lottery again when Zion Williamson was by far the hottest prospect on the planet?\n\nWe’ll never know how the cosmos keeps lining up perfectly for the NBA to tell and sell these too-good-to-be-true stories. But as of Tuesday, we can add another one to the list.\n\nThe Spurs? The perfect organization once again getting the perfect player? Ridiculous, and yet, entirely predictable.\n\nBrazen tanking has been a pox on the NBA over the last decade, to the point where the league changed the playoff format and the draft lottery rules to disincentivize it. For the Spurs, it didn’t matter. Knowing there was little chance of rebuilding a contender, they went aggressively all-in on the tank because a 7-foot-2 teenager from France was available.\n\nWhat can you say? It paid off — again.\n\nOf course, there’s a very, very long way between where the Spurs are now and where David Robinson and Tim Duncan led them, winning titles in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014.\n\nBesides Wembanyama, the Spurs will start next season with a good 24-year-old wing in Keldon Johnson, an intriguing second-year forward in Jeremy Sochan and … not much else that will help them win games anytime soon. The Spurs didn’t finish 22-60 by accident; to the contrary, it was quite deliberate.\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW: Stay up to date with our sports newsletter\n\nOn the other hand, if Wembenyama is really as good as the hype — ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski relayed that some NBA executives think he could be the best offensive and defensive player in the league by his third season — it shouldn’t be that difficult for the Spurs to get back to the playoffs in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nIt would also seem likely that Gregg Popovich, who will turn 75 in the middle of next season, sticks around for awhile when a lot of people wondered whether he’d have interest in going through a rebuild.\n\nIn other words, if the two decades after Duncan’s arrival in the league wore you out on watching Popovich and the Spurs win a lot of games, Tuesday night was tough. They’re probably going to be back pretty quickly — because that’s just how things tend to shake out in the NBA. The symmetry is seemingly always perfect.\n\nThe real intrigue in the draft, though, came at No. 2 where the Charlotte Hornets jumped over the Detroit Pistons and Houston Rockets. All year long, G-League point guard Scoot Henderson has been hyped as the No. 2 pick with a combination of NBA-ready explosiveness and physicality that you rarely see at the position. If not for Wembanyama, Henderson is considered the type of prospect who would be No. 1 in a lot of other draft years.\n\nThe Hornets, though, already have three years invested in LaMelo Ball as their point guard. Could Ball and Henderson play together? Do the Hornets trade the pick? Could they possibly try to get some assets or a more veteran star by trading Ball? Maybe it brings Brandon Miller into play for No. 2 if they keep the pick.\n\nThen there’s Portland at No. 3, which like San Antonio had a lot riding on their late-season tankapalooza given Damian Lillard’s age (32), his desire to stay in Portland if all things are equal and yet the reality that they haven't been close to contending lately. The No. 3 pick — especially if Henderson is available — is a really prime asset if they are going to push all their chips into the middle. Or maybe Portland goes the other way, uses the pick and finally sends Lillard somewhere else.\n\nEither way, those two scenarios set up some real intrigue and potential for mega trades as the NBA gets closer to the June 22 draft.\n\nWe won’t know for years if any of these players will change the face of the NBA. But as always when there’s a truly special prospect at the top of the draft, the ironies and the narratives never cease to amaze.\n\nEye on the future:Here are the best NBA player and team future bets", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnists/gregg-doyel/2023/05/17/nba-draft-lottery-sucks-indiana-pacers-wont-get-victor-wembanyama/70192323007/", "title": "NBA draft lottery sucks; Indiana Pacers won't get Victor Wembanyama", "text": "INDIANAPOLIS – It just wasn’t the Indiana Pacers’ night.

Tim Duncan, San Antonio's No. 1 pick in 1997, led the Spurs to five titles.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nRegardless, the team with the No. 1 pick will take its chance on the best player available.\n\nLANDING SPOTS:Victor Wembanyama's best fits among 2023 NBA draft lottery teams\n\nLook to the future:Best bets for player and team futures\n\nWhen is the NBA draft lottery?\n\nTuesday, May 16 in Chicago at 8 p.m. ET\n\nWhat channel is the NBA draft lottery on?\n\nESPN\n\nHow does the NBA draft lottery work?\n\nAccording to the NBA, \"Fourteen ping-pong balls numbered 1 through 14 will be placed in a lottery machine. There are 1,001 possible combinations when four balls are drawn out of 14, without regard to their order of selection. Before the lottery, 1,000 of those 1,001 combinations will be assigned to the 14 participating lottery teams.\n\n\"All 14 balls are placed in the lottery machine and they are mixed for 20 seconds, and then the first ball is removed. The remaining balls are mixed in the lottery machine for another 10 seconds, and then the second ball is drawn. There is a 10-second mix, and then the third ball is drawn. There is a 10-second mix, and then the fourth ball is drawn. The team that has been assigned that combination will receive the No. 1 pick. The same process is repeated with the same ping-pong balls and lottery machine for the second through fourth picks.\"\n\nThe remaining lottery teams are slotted in order of their draft odds.\n\nThe lottery is conducted in a separate room just before ESPN’s draft lottery show. Select media, NBA officials and representatives of the participating teams and the accounting firm Ernst & Young will be in attendance in the room for the drawings.\n\nWhat are the NBA draft lottery odds for each team?\n\n1. Detroit − 14%\n\n2. Houston − 14%\n\n3. San Antonio − 14%\n\n4. Charlotte − 12.5%\n\n5. Portland − 10.5%\n\n6. Orlando − 9%\n\n7. Indiana − 6.8%\n\n8. Washington − 6.7%\n\n9. Utah − 4.5%\n\n10. Dallas − 3% (Pick is top-10 protected but will go to New York if pick falls outside of top 10.)\n\n11. Chicago − 1.8% (Pick is top-four protected but will go to Orlando if pick falls outside of the top four.)\n\n12. Oklahoma City − 1.7%\n\n13. Toronto − 1%\n\n14. New Orleans − .5%\n\nThe three teams with the best odds — Pistons, Rockets, Spurs — also have a 52.13% chance to land a top-four pick.\n\nWho is the projected No. 1 NBA draft pick?\n\nFrance’s Victor Wembanyama is the clear-cut No. 1 pick and has been for some time. He’s 19 with an impressive skill set — a guard’s game in a big man’s body and a big man’s game in a 7-2 frame. He’s athletic, can handle the basketball, shoot it, pass and he possesses great footwork and shot-blocking ability. Think Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kevin Durant — if Wembanyama maximizes his potential.\n\nThis season, Wembanyama is averaging 21.8 points, 10.3 rebounds, 3.1 blocks, 2.4 assists and is shooting 54.7% from the field. He will need to improve on his 29.2% 3-point shooting.\n\nWembanyama will become the first player from France drafted No. 1 overall.\n\nWho else is a projected high pick in the NBA draft?\n\nScoot Henderson, 19, played for the G League Ignite the past two seasons. In 2022-23, he averaged 17.6 points, 6.6 assists and 5.1 rebounds and shot 44.4% from the field and 32.4% on 3-pointers.\n\nBrandon Miller, 20, spent his freshman season at Alabama. The 6-9 forward averaged 18.9 points and 8.2 rebounds and shot 43.3% from the field and 37.9% on 3s.\n\nAmen and Ausar Thompson: The 20-year-old twins played in Overtime Elite the past two seasons. They are 6-7 perimeter players. Ausar averaged 16.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, 6.1 assists and shot 56.2% from the field and 29.8% on 3s and Amen averaged 16.4 points, 5.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists and shot 66.2% from the field and 25% on 3s in 2022-23.\n\nNBA draft lottery simulator results\n\nUsing tankathon.com’s draft lottery simulator, this is what the draft lottery results could look like:\n\n1.

Another business called Gregory’s owns it in New Jersey, according to Taco Bell.\n\n“Taco Bell seeks no damages or trademark rights in ‘Taco Tuesday,’” the company said in a statement. “It simply seeks common sense for usage of a common term.”\n\nThis is a “Taco Tuesday” throwdown years in the making.\n\n“This Chain Owns the Taco Tuesday Trademark, and It's Not Afraid to Sue You,” was the headline of a 2017 Vice article about the cease and desist letters Taco John's sent to anyone infringing on the trademark or using the hashtag #TacoTuesday.\n\nTaco John CEO Jim Creel thanked Taco Bell for \"reminding everyone that Taco Tuesday is best celebrated at Taco John’s.\"\n\n\"When a big, bad bully threatens to take away the mark our forefathers originated so many decades ago, well, that just rings hollow to us,\" Creel said in a statement to Axios. \"If ‘living más’ means filling the pockets of Taco Bell’s army of lawyers, we’re not interested.\"\n\nAccording to CNN, it could take up to two years for the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to reach a decision.\n\nTaco John’s has 40 days to file a response and the case will move to a discovery period if the two chains don’t reach an agreement.\n\nTaco Bell is asking its fans to show support for its efforts by signing a \"Freeing Taco Tuesday petition\" at Change.org.\n\nA Taco John’s restaurant owner coined the phrase “Taco Twosday” in the early 1980s to increase sales with a 99-cent deal for two tacos on a slow day of the week, according to CNN.\n\nThe chain changed the phrase to “Taco Tuesday” and trademarked it in 1989.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/06/most-iconic-items-america-biggest-fast-food-chains/39885515/", "title": "The Most Iconic Items at America's Biggest Fast Food Chains – 24/7 ...", "text": "Colman Andrews\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nMore than 36% of American adults ate fast food on a given day between 2013 and 2016, according to a report on fast food consumption by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and there’s no reason to think that our intake has decreased.\n\nHowever much we might claim to disdain the chains that purvey fast food on nutritional and/or aesthetic grounds, the fact is that a lot of us find it pretty irresistible.\n\nAs with most indulgences, the best game plan for enjoying it is simply not to indulge too much. Eating fast food every day is clearly not a good strategy for a long and healthy life. On the other hand, will an occasional cheeseburger or pizza or bucket of fried chicken kill you? Probably not.\n\nIf and when you do join the line at McDonald's or pull up to the Sonic Drive-In window, what should you choose? That’s a matter of personal taste, of course, and there’s plenty of variety out there, even beyond the obvious. In addition to their core menus, pizza chains sell chicken wings; burger chains sell fish sandwiches; doughnut chains sell bagels.\n\nBut every chain has an iconic offering or two – foods that pretty much define them, and that few people can resist when they place their orders.\n\n$145,000 at a steakhouse?:Employee charged with embezzling $5 million from his company\n\n24/7 Tempo has chosen the single most iconic food item at each of the nation’s top 20 fast food chains in annual sales as determined by the restaurant industry trade publication QSR. These are the chains whose units are apt to be most accessible to the largest number of us, even though they may sometimes be less interesting or unusual than America’s favorite regional fast food chains.\n\nThe iconic items on this list are often the things most often ordered, but sometimes they’re the original offerings that helped make the chain’s reputation – or just the ones that people are most likely to bring to mind when the name of the chain is mentioned.\n\nAll these iconic foods (and in two cases drinks) are items that the operations in question do particularly well. That certainly doesn’t mean that that they’re among the choices health experts would recommend – these are the healthiest food options at every fast food restaurant.\n\nAre you guilty of committing it? Millennials consider this their top financial mistake\n\n1. McDonald's\n\n• French fries\n\nYou could argue that the Big Mac – perhaps the ultimate fast-food burger, with its double patty, sesame bun, American cheese, and pickles, lettuce, and onions – is the icon here. Or maybe it's the Egg McMuffin, which launched the breakfast sandwich craze when it was introduced back in 1972. But the one thing almost everybody seems to agree on – even people who'd never admit to eating a McDonald's burger – is that the fries are great, and maybe reason enough in themselves to pull into the drive-thru.\n\nTheir secret? Good potatoes, to begin with. But the spuds are treated with dextrose and sodium acid pyrophosphate for color, various preservatives, and \"natural beef flavor.\" Whatever they do to them, it seems to work.\n\n2. Starbucks\n\n• Pumpkin Spice Latte\n\nStarbucks is famous for its many specialty coffee drinks, most of all its blended Frappuccinos and its various lattes. But the one item most strongly associated with the chain – the one it first offered in 2004, and the one that has gone on to become its most copied creation by far – is the autumnal specialty called the Pumpkin Spice Latte, or PSL. The day on which this drink, with its cinnamon-based spice mix, goes on sale each year is eagerly anticipated, and Starbucks is said to sell as many as 350 million cups of it annually.\n\n3. Subway\n\n• Italian BMT\n\nThis combination of Genoa salami, spicy pepperoni, and Black Forest ham, typically served on Italian bread and garnished with various vegetable additions (lettuce, onions, pickles, tomatoes, etc.) is Subway's best-selling sandwich. BMT originally stood for Brooklyn Manhattan Transit, the name of one of New York City's original subway (get it?) lines. Now, says the chain, it stands for \"Bigger, Meatier, Tastier.\"\n\nMiraculous find:Man accidentally throws away $23K in savings, somehow recovers it at a recycling facility\n\n4. Burger King\n\n• The Whopper\n\nIn 1957, 11 years before the appearance of the Big Mac, Burger King launched this oversize flame-broiled burger, served with mayo, ketchup, and the usual lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions, on a sesame seed bun. There are myriad ways to customize the Whopper by adding or subtracting ingredients, asking for light or heavy servings of the additions, choosing a variety of sides, etc. (the company website says there are 221,184 possible variations, though that seems unlikely).\n\nThe size and packaging of the burger have changed several times since its birth, but the Whopper remains Burger King's trademark item.\n\n5. Taco Bell\n\n• Crunchy taco\n\nAuthentic Mexican food is becoming easier and easier to find around the U.S. these days. This isn't it. But Taco Bell has brought at least some hints of Mexican flavors and ways of presenting food to a wide audience across America, even if they are in the form of such never-in-Mexico offerings as the Crunchwrap Supreme, the Quesarito, and the Fiery Doritos Locos Taco Supreme.\n\nThe basic Taco Bell order, though, is the crunchy taco – a staple of the chain's menu since founder Glen Bell is said to have invented the pre-formed crispy taco shell in the 1950 and filled it with seasoned ground beef, shredded lettuce, and shredded cheddar cheese.\n\n6. Wendy's\n\n• The Baconator\n\nSome Wendy's fans might consider the Double Stack – two burger patties with cheese, ketchup, mustard, pickle, and onion – to be the chain's most essential item. It's a little too similar to other fast-food burgers, though. That can't be said of the Baconator, introduced in 2007. This one also has two patties and cheese, but what makes the difference is three strips of bacon placed across each of the two burgers – six in all. The only other things on the bun are mayo and ketchup – no vegetables or mustard (though these may be ordered specially).\n\nThe chain has periodically featured variations on the Baconator, including one with jalapeños, pepper jack cheese, and chipotle ranch sauce, and another that is a regular Baconator but with three patties and nine strips of bacon.\n\n7. Dunkin' Donuts\n\n• Munchkins\n\nDunkin' puts such emphasis these days on its coffee, its frozen drinks, its bagels, and its sandwiches and wraps that it's easy to forget about the eponymous doughnuts. Nobody forgets about Munchkins, though – otherwise known as \"Donut Holes.\" Jelly-filled, glazed, chocolate, and more, these are little spheres of doughnut dough, one-or-two-bite-size. Even people who might never eat a whole doughnut will grab one or two (or more) of these.\n\nProfessional snuggler? Hangover helper? Here's the weirdest job in your state\n\n8. Chick-fil-A\n\n• Deluxe Chicken Sandwich\n\nNamed America's favorite fast-food chain year after year, Chick-fil-A recently introduced such innovations as Spicy Chick-n-Strips, Chick-n-Sliders, and the Grilled Chicken Cool Wrap. The bedrock here, however, is this basic offering: a slab of breaded boneless chicken breast pressure-cooked in peanut oil, served on a toasted buttered bun with dill pickle chips, lettuce, and tomato (a choice of three kinds of cheese is offered at extra cost).\n\n9. Domino's\n\n• Pepperoni pizza\n\nNow the largest pizza brand in the United States., Domino's offers its popular and ubiquitous specialty with a customizable choice of three sizes, five crusts, nine sauces, and 27 toppings, as well as a dozen ready-made combinations (plus chicken dishes, pastas, sandwiches, and more). According to the food delivery app Caviar, among other sources, pepperoni is the nation's number-one favorite pizza topping – and pepperoni pizza gets ordered at Domino's more than any other variation.\n\n10. Pizza Hut\n\n• Pepperoni pizza\n\nEdged out of the number-one pizza shop by Domino's a few years back, Pizza Hut is still a strong number-two. Like its rival, the chain offers some standard pizza toppings as well as the opportunity to customize, but again it's the tried and true that rules: a large pepperoni pizza is the most popular order here.\n\n11. Panera Bread\n\n• Broccoli cheddar soup\n\n\"Bread\" might be part of this chain's name, and sandwiches are definitely featured on the extensive menu, but soups are also offered – and this creamy specialty, available daily, is said to be the most popular item ordered around the country (and the internet is full of copycat recipes).\n\n12. Chipotle\n\n• Chicken bowl\n\nThis make-your-own-sorta-Mexican-food chain continues to thrive. Bowls (instead of burritos or tacos) are the most popular item here – and the definitive order (apparently also the most popular) includes white rice, black beans, chicken, mild salsa, lettuce, and cheese.\n\n13. KFC\n\n• Original Recipe chicken\n\nFast food menus constantly evolve to match consumer tastes and health concerns. Sometimes, though, the original – the item that made a chain's reputation in the first place – is best. You could certainly order some Nashville Hot tenders here, or a Smoky Mountain BBQ chicken sandwich, but why would you? It's the Original Recipe chicken, seasoned with that famous \"secret blend of 11 herbs & spices\" that made the chain world-famous.\n\n14. Sonic Drive-In\n\n• Cherry limeade\n\nSonic fans love the cheeseburgers, the chicken sandwiches, the potato tots, the jalapeño-popper-like Ched 'R' Peppers, and more, but it's the drinks that really seem to stir passions. And it's the cherry limeade – made with fresh-squeezed lime juice and poured over pellet ice – that wins raves again and again. There is also a diet version, and Sonic periodically offers such limited-time variations as the Cherry Limeade Red Bull Slush.\n\n55% of Americans want a side hustle:Here's how to start\n\n15. Dairy Queen\n\n• Blizzard Treats\n\nSure, there are burgers, dogs, and chicken sandwiches here, not to mention fries and onion rings and such. But the \"Dairy\" part of the name is key. The chain's \"upsidedownright thick\" Blizzard Treats (or simply Blizzards) – introduced in 1985 – have become its veritable emblem. These are dense concoctions of soft-serve ice cream loaded with pieces of various candies, baked goods, and/or miscellaneous sundae toppings. They are indeed so thick that they won't flow out of the cup when turned upside down. There are always at least 15 varieties available, and they may be customized. A current favorite is the Peanut Butter Pie Blizzard, made with Snickers.\n\n16. Arby's\n\n• Classic Roast Beef\n\nArby's has experimented with venison sandwiches, and offers a wide range of chicken, turkey, and pork options. The chain made its reputation with roast beef, though, and while it now offers such variations as Bourbon BBQ Barrel Stack, Bacon Beef 'N Cheddar, and Jalapeño Roast Beef Slider, it's the good old original Classic Roast Beef, with thin-sliced meat piled on a toasted sesame bun and anointed with ketchupy Arby's Sauce or the horseradish-flavored Horsey Sauce, that continues to define the place.\n\n17. Little Caesars\n\n• Crazy Bread\n\nThis is basically a pizza chain, of course, so it's not surprising that items like its Hot-N-Ready Extramostbestest Stuffed Crust pizza and other specialty pies are the main focus. It's a non-pizza that has become most symbolic of Little Caesars, though: its Crazy Bread – soft breadsticks full of butter and garlic and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. These are best ordered with a side of Crazy Sauce, which is basically tomato sauce jacked up with various herbs and spices, perfect for dipping.\n\nDemocrats or Republicans:Which party has the best plan to fix Social Security?\n\n18. Jack in the Box\n\n• Two Tacos\n\nSome people think of Jack in the Box as a hamburger place but the chain's take on tacos – two to a serving – is the most often-ordered item on the menu. The Wall Street Journal reports that Americans eat 554 million of them a year. While they're filled with seasoned ground beef and shredded lettuce like the ones at Taco Bell, they get a slice of American cheese inside instead of that other chain's shredded cheddar, and the taco sauce is already added.\n\nThese tacos have been called everything from \"a wet envelope of cat food\" to \"vile and amazing.\" Whatever they are, it's impossible to imagine Jack in the Box without them.\n\n19. Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen\n\n• Biscuits\n\nPopeyes makes good fried chicken and a credible version of Louisiana-style popcorn shrimp, among other things, but chances are that if you mention the chain to Popeyes fans, the first thing they'll say is \"Biscuits!\" They're unusually good for mass-produced examples of this classic American specialty – substantial but also flaky and light, with buttery flavor and a slight tang of buttermilk.\n\n20. Papa John's\n\n• Cheese pizza\n\nPapa John's has come under fire over the past few years for founder John Schnatter's racial comments and the subsequent departure of franchisee and spokesman Peyton Manning from the operation. It's still the nation's fourth-largest pizza chain, though, and while it offers numerous options – including a John's Favorite Pizza with two meats and a six-cheese blend that has been described as \"grease on top of grease\" – it's the cheese pizza that keeps a lot of people coming back. Hailed for its \"solid-looking crust and glistening cheese,\" it can be ordered with one of eight dipping sauces, from ranch to honey mustard to blue cheese.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The game will be broadcast on NBC stations in the markets of the two teams. It will also be available on mobile devices through the NFL+ package. It will be preceded by a late afternoon playoff game on NBC and Peacock that will kick off at 4:30 p.m. EST.\n\nSubscription rates for Peacock start at $4.99 per month.\n\n“We had our first season with Amazon (this past year) and I think that with the digital platforms, we’re ready for live sports at scale. And the next step is to step into the postseason,” said Hans Schroeder, NFL executive vice president and chief operating officer of NFL Media. “We like the plan that Peacock and NBC put together. In this case knowing we're going to have a bigger audience and focused on having the widest reach possible across each platform.”\n\nThe league has made forays into streaming games for nearly a decade, but has gone all in over the past couple seasons. Amazon Prime Video became the exclusive home of “Thursday Night Football” last season while ESPN has had one international game per season on ESPN+ since 2021.\n\nUnder the NFL's 11-year contract with NBCUniversal that began this season, Peacock has an exclusive regular-season game. That will be on Dec. 23 when the Buffalo Bills face the Los Angeles Chargers in prime time. The Cincinnati Bengals vs. Pittsburgh Steelers matchup on NBC will precede that.\n\n“We spent a lot of time with the NFL and had productive meetings about the proper positioning of that (Peacock) game,” NBC Sports Chairman Pete Bevacqua said last week when the regular-season schedule was released. “We think that’s going to be a great combination of using the power of NBC with that late-afternoon game and driving that audience to Peacock for the regular-season exclusive game.”\n\nThe Saturday night wild-card game the past two seasons has drawn over 20 million viewers. Last season's game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Chargers averaged 20.6 million while Buffalo and New England averaged 26.4 million.\n\nWhether Peacock can match or get close to those numbers remains to be seen. Last season's 15-game Thursday night package on Prime Video averaged 9.58 million according to Nielsen and 11.3 million according to Amazon's first-party measurement. The most-watched game was the first one between Kansas City and the Chargers. Nielsen had the average at 13 million while Amazon reported 15.3 million.\n\nNBC will have three games during the first weekend of the postseason, marking the first time a network has had that many on a single playoff weekend.\n\nNBC also has the prime-time Sunday game on Jan. 14, while Fox and CBS will have the earlier contests. ESPN has the Monday night game to close the opening weekend on Jan. 15. This will be the third year the NFL has played the wild-card games over three days.\n\nUnder the NFL's contract, each of the four broadcast partners — NBC, CBS, Fox and ESPN/ABC — get at least one wild-card game. Of the two remaining games, one game rotates each year between NBC, CBS and Fox, while the other will likely be up for bid each year. That means Amazon or ESPN+ could eventually be in the running for a future postseason game.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/football/nfl/bills/2023/01/04/who-do-the-buffalo-bills-play-next-nfl-week-18-new-england-patriots/69774885007/", "title": "A game with playoff implications up next for heavy-hearted Buffalo ...", "text": "Football certainly seems pretty inconsequential right now given the ongoing situation surrounding the health and well being of Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin.\n\nHamlin remains in the intensive care unit at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center after suffering cardiac arrest during the first quarter of Monday night’s game against the Bengals.\n\nThe incident occurred with 5:58 remaining in the first quarter and after Hamlin was transported by ambulance to the hospital, the NFL suspended the game which, as far as we know, is an unprecedented event in NFL history. No known game has ever been suspended and then not finished on the same day or night.\n\nAfter closely monitoring the situation Tuesday morning, the NFL announced in the afternoon that the game would not be resumed this week.\n\nSign up for the Bills Blast newsletter:Delivered straight to your inbox, additional Bills analysis, insight, stats, quotes and team history from Sal Maiorana\n\nHowever, the Week 18 schedule will be played as normal, in its entirety, meaning the Bills will be hosting the New England Patriots Sunday at 1 p.m. at Highmark Stadium.\n\nAs for the fate of the Bills-Bengals game, which was to be perhaps the biggest game of the NFL season given the major playoff ramifications for both teams, the NFL is still trying to figure out what to do.\n\nBut it now seems that only two options are available, and neither are good. The first, and probably the easiest, would be to cancel it altogether. If that happens, it means both teams will have played only 16 regular-season games, one less than the rest of the league, and the playoff seeds in the AFC would be determined by best winning percentages.\n\nThis was a plan the NFL was prepared to implement during the COVID-impacted seasons of 2020 and 2021 when there was a chance that teams would play an uneven amount of games due to outbreaks and resulting scheduling problems. Incredibly, the league found a way to overcome several obstacles and every game was eventually played.\n\nThe other would be to push the game all the way to the weekend of Jan. 14-15, which was supposed to be the start of the wild-card round of the playoffs. If the NFL does this, the Bills-Bengals game would be the only one played that weekend, and the playoffs would start a week later.\n\nThe NFL can do this because it can eliminate the bye week between the conference championship games and the Super Bowl, but there are a whole bunch of logistical problems that would have to be dealt with, not the least of which are the upheaval of the prime-time TV schedule.\n\nWhile that huge decision is still up in the air, and because the games must go on, the Bills are now confronted with the enormously difficult task of turning their attention to the Patriots for a game that also has major playoff implications, though bigger, actually, for New England.\n\nBill Belichick’s team, which owned the first two decades of the 21st century by winning 17 AFC East division titles, nine AFC championships and six Super Bowls, is playing for its postseason life.\n\nIf the Patriots beat the Bills, they will secure the seventh and final seed in the AFC bracket. But if they lose, the only way they get in is if all three of these things happen: The Dolphins lose to the Jets, the Titans lose to the Jaguars, and the Steelers lose to the Browns.\n\nBuffalo has already clinched the AFC East division title and a playoff berth, but if it hopes to have any chance of securing the No. 1 seed, it has to win the game.\n\nAlso, if the Bengals game is eventually canceled, the Bills would need the Chiefs to lose Saturday night against the Raiders to get the top seed.\n\nHere’s an early look ahead to the matchup:\n\nTop players for New England Patriots on offense, defense\n\n▶ QB Mac Jones: He is the very description of mediocre as he has completed 65.2% of his passes, but he has averaged only 6.8 yards per attempt and has a mere 11 TDs compared to eight interceptions. Part of Jones’ problem, of course, is the lack of elite talent around him on offense.\n\n▶ RB Rhamondre Stevenson: When he’s not throwing laterals to cost the Patriots against the Raiders, and fumbling near the goal line to cost the Patriots against the Bengals, Stevenson is a fine player. He’s a powerful runner who has 986 rushing yards (4.8 per attempt) plus he’s a favorite check down option for Jones who has 64 catches for 393 yards.\n\n▶ WR Jakobi Meyers: He is by far the Patriots best outside target as he has 64 catches for 771 yards and five TDs. With a catch percentage of 71.3, Meyers has been a reliable player who has typically made the Patriots’ biggest plays in the pass game.\n\n▶ TE Hunter Henry: He hasn’t been the stud the Patriots thought they were getting when they signed him to a big-money free agent deal in 2021, but he now has 35 catches for 467 yards and two TDs. He can be a red zone problem for the Bills.\n\n▶ DE Matthew Judon: He was leading the NFL in sacks midway through the year and now he has 15.5, but only 2.5 have come in the last six games. Still, he has a team-high 68 pressures and can be a game-changer on the edge.\n\n▶ DE Josh Uche: As teams have done a better job blocking Judon, Uche has become a major threat. He has 50 pressures and 11.5 sacks with 7.5 in the last six games.\n\n▶ LB Ja’Whaun Bentley: He leads the Patriots with 118 tackles and 45 of those were considered stops meaning he was the player that caused the play to fail.\n\n▶ SS Kyle Dugger: He’s one of the most versatile defensive players in the NFL for his ability to play the run and pass, plus his big-play skills. Sunday against Miami he had his third touchdown return of the season, two interceptions and once fumble. He has 72 tackles and has allowed only 139 yards after catch this season.\n\n▶ CB Jonathan Jones: He has allowed only 53.9% of the passes into his coverage area to be completed and leads the team with four interceptions including one which he returned for a touchdown, one of a league-leading seven defensive scores for New England.\n\nWhat the game means to Buffalo Bills, New England Patriots\n\nAs stated above, the Patriots have to have it. Win and they’re in, but if they lose, they need a cascading series of events to take place for them to avoid missing the postseason for the second time in three years.\n\nThe only thing at stake for the Bills is the chance to get homefield advantage throughout the playoffs, and that is no small intangible. The Bills have never won a road playoff game under Sean McDermott (0-4), so staying home, while not guaranteeing anything, would certainly be preferred.\n\nWho is favored to win Bills vs Patriots?\n\nThe Bills have opened as 7.5-point favorites for the game.\n\nThe money line is Bills minus-340 (bet $340 to win $100) and Patriots plus-280 (bet $100 to win $280).

Now, expect to see more Lions games on CBS this season, outside of the traditional Thanksgiving Day game and occasional home game vs. an AFC team. The conference-network relationships are not being totally done away with — Fox/NFC and CBS/AFC still have appearance minimums per team, so Fox can get most Cowboys games and CBS can protect Chiefs games — but Sunday games are now \"free agents\" or \"jump balls.\" There is no tie between network and conference.\n\n\"Thursday Night Football\" doubles: Teams can now appear on Amazon Prime Video's TNF twice this season.\n\nNo primetime guarantees: There will be some teams left off the primetime schedule, which should be an improvement on the product for fans.

That share was higher than any other group, including Gen X, which was 47%, and Boomers at 37%. Credit Karma classifies Gen X as born between 1965 and 1980 and Boomers between 1946 and 1964.\n\nBudgeting is among the top reasons people, especially Gen Zers with limited incomes, turn to cash as they try to manage high inflation, stock market volatility and rising interest rates that make it more expensive to use credit cards.\n\n“For folks having trouble keeping up ... they’re looking to reverse that trend by not accruing additional debt,” said Courtney Alev, Credit Karma’s consumer financial advocate. “That’s where budgeting tricks like “cash stuffing” come in.”\n\nBudgeting for Dummies:Adulting 101: Budgeting for beginners amid inflation, when everything costs more\n\nLearn more: Best credit cards of 2023\n\nHigher interest:Best online savings accounts of May 2023\n\nWhat is cash stuffing?\n\nCash stuffing is when you set aside cash at the start of each month for different categories of expenses like groceries, clothing and entertainment. Whatever is allocated to each category is all you get to spend that month.\n\nThe strategy became popular, particularly among Gen Zers, after influencers on TikTok talked about using it to keep spending in check. Seventy-two percent of Gen Z adults are familiar with cash stuffing and 30% use it to budget (47%) and save (55%), Credit Karma said.\n\nSince starting, 89% of Gen Zers who use cash stuffing have been able to funnel more money into savings.

Cash allows me to feel in control of my daily expenses.”\n\nSound familiar? Boom!\n\n“My family have also been victims of stolen credit cards, counterfeit checks, and stolen identities, so we try to keep our digital footprint at a minimum,” said Mah, who does use PayPal for certain purchases.

Using more cash is one way. Nearly 20% of Gen Zers say cash forces them to be more thoughtful about spending, the survey said. Of the Gen Zers who pay with greenbacks, 64% said they spent less – an indication that cash is a great budgeting tool \"especially if you’re someone who tends to overspend when swiping using debit or credit,” Alev said.\n\nShould I stop using my credit card altogether?\n\nNo, don’t cut your credit cards yet!\n\n“Make sure you’re still doing the work to build your credit,” Alev said. “That can be as simple as setting up monthly subscriptions on one credit card and paying it off at the end of each month or using one card to pay for gas expenses,” she said. “It’s important to build credit so that you’re able to gain access to better priced financial products, like auto loans and mortgages, down the line.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/business-food/gen-z-restaurants/index.html", "title": "Gen Z isn't that into dining out. Here's how restaurants are chasing ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nRestaurants have had a tough couple of years, with the pandemic, soaring ingredient prices and labor shortages. Now they have another problem: Gen Z isn’t all that interested in dining out.\n\nAccording to a recent survey from market research company NPD Group, people between the ages of 18 and 24 ordered from (or at) restaurants 218 times on average between February 2021 and February 2022. When Gen Xers were that age, in 2002, they patronized restaurants 284 times apiece in a year. And when Millennials were that age they went to or ordered from restaurants 244 times in the course of a year.\n\nThat’s not great for restaurants, which want to hook young consumers and turn them into life-long customers.\n\n“The earlier you can engage with a consumer, the more potential you have for building loyalty and building frequency over the course of more years,” said Robert Byrne, director of consumer and industry insights at the restaurant consulting firm Technomic. It’s hard to develop loyalty “once somebody’s past that window,” he said.\n\nYoung consumers are maintaining the same pandemic habits as consumers in other demographics, but face even more constraints. To try to get them excited about restaurant food, operators are instating loyalty programs and partnering with young stars — and may have to lower prices.\n\nWhy fewer young consumers are dining out\n\nGen Z consumers are dining out less often compared to older generations at their age. Stephen Maturen/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nLike other consumers, some young employees are spending more of their workdays outside of the office. Without regular daily commutes, demand for restaurant meals can wane, said David Portalatin, NPD’s food industry advisor. Plus, a lot of people learned how to cook during the pandemic, and they’ve held on to that skill. “Those are the kinds of things that have made it a little bit more challenging to generate customer traffic at restaurants.”\n\nAnd let’s not forget inflation and record high gas prices, which are hurting people’s wallets.\n\nYounger consumers have even more constraints, he noted, such as more spending on tech, apparel and other items.\n\n“The smart phone has been attached to them probably since they were kids,” Portalatin said. “That brings along with it all kinds of what we call ‘committed consumption,’ whether that’s streaming services, or gaming, or other things that you’ve already committed a certain monthly amount of your budget to.”\n\nNPD sees this as a short-term problem caused by temporary habits created amid the pandemic, as well as those macroeconomic pressures. “We expect the restaurant industry will ultimately recover all of its pre-pandemic traffic volume,” Portalatin said.\n\nBut some restaurant operators are nervous about what this change in buying habits portends for future sales, said R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, which tracks restaurant visits. They’re wondering if “they have to change the ways they go about things,” he said.\n\nAnd some restaurants are bucking the trend.\n\nWings and donuts\n\nWings are a hit among younger consumers. Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nChicken wing restaurants like Wing Zone and Wingstop and donut shops including Winchell’s, Yum Yum Donuts and Shipley Do-Nuts get more visits from Gen Z consumers than other spots, according to Placer.ai, which uses census data to help determine the age of customers visiting US restaurants.\n\nBetween 13 to 18 percent of visitors to these locations are between the ages of 18 and 24, according to Placer.ai’s research. Typically, just about 10% of US retail visitors are in that demographic, Hottovy said.\n\nFood items like donuts and wings tend to be more popular with young people, Hottovy noted. But brands can still attract Gen Z customers “even if you’re not in those categories that skew well to a younger audience,” he said.\n\nIn addition to building a brand that resonates with younger customers, good value helps, he said.\n\nAccording to NPD, 18- to 24-year-old consumers consider price to be the most important factor when choosing which restaurants to try. And to drive more traffic to their stores, restaurants may have to start offering more deals, Hottovy said — even if it hurts their margins.\n\nOther companies are using different tactics to try to bring young shoppers into the fold.\n\nLoyalty programs, celebrity meals and discounts\n\nRestaurant chains like Chipotle have been revamping their loyalty programs. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nRestaurants love online loyalty programs because they can use them to learn their customers’ preferences and market to them directly, and, of course, increase loyalty. They’re also a way to reach young consumers where they’re already spending a lot of their time: On their phones.\n\n“The Gen Z audience definitely is more active on mobile devices than other generation groups,” said Hottovy, and companies like Chipotle (CMG), McDonald’s (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) have all been “revamping” their programs accordingly.\n\nOthers, like IHOP, have taken a pun-ful approach. The chain’s loyalty program is called the International Bank of Pancakes, and customers earn PanCoins when they spend money through the app. They find rewards in the app’s Stack Market.\n\nIn addition to loyalty programs, restaurants are also teaming up with celebrities and influencers to get young consumers excited about their food.\n\nMcDonald’s, in particular, has had a lot of success with its “famous orders platforms,” or meals that contain a celebrity’s favorite orders. The burger chain has partnered with Saweetie, BTS and others on the limited-time offers.\n\nSuch offerings “definitely skew more towards the Gen Z and younger audiences,” said Hottovy. Since McDonald’s launched the concept, other chains like Burger King (and even Coca-Cola (KO)) have followed suit. Burger King joined forces with singer-songwriter Lil Huddy, among others, on special meals. Coca-Cola (KO) tapped DJ Marshmello to help it develop a new limited-edition flavor.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/economy/retail-sales-july-inflation/index.html", "title": "US consumers continue to spend, but rising inflation has shifted their ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith lower gas prices effectively putting more money back in their pockets, Americans continued to spend last month. But persistent inflation has reshaped their shopping habits.\n\nIn July, US retail sales were flat compared to the previous month, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday. That marks a slowdown from June, when retail sales rose by a revised 0.8% over the month.\n\nSpending at gas stations fell by 1.8% month over month, reflecting the recent drop in gas prices, while spending at grocery stores rose 0.2% for the month.\n\n“[American shoppers] are clearly spending money on consumables and basics at the expense of some discretionary merchandise,” said Sarah Henry, portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management.\n\nConsumers have no choice but to buy essentials like groceries and gas, although they may switch to cheaper brands or change how frequently they buy, said Kayla Bruun, economic analyst at decision intelligence company Morning Consult. “It’s really those discretionary goods we’re seeing a lot of cutback on, particularly among those lower- and middle-income groups,” she said. Retail sales at department stores, for example, dropped in the month of July and were also lower on a year-over-year basis.\n\nEven wealthier Americans are being impacted by the highest inflation in 40 years: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Tuesday on the company’s investor call that higher prices were contributing to an influx of higher-income shoppers at the discount store.\n\n“We expect inflation to continue to influence the choices that families make,” McMillon said.\n\nHigher prices on food and gas impact lower-income households to a greater degree, because they must spend a larger share of their earnings for these necessary purchases, said Mike Rittler, head of retail card services at TD Bank.\n\n“It’s kind of a double whammy – you have less coming in, more going out. It really makes for challenging times,” he said, noting that the amount of debt people are carrying on their credit cards has been creeping up. The Federal Reserve said earlier this month that consumers added $40.1 billion worth of debt to their balance sheets in June.\n\nThe July data also showed that sales at home improvement stores rose by 1.5% over the month and by 10.1% from a year ago – as corroborated by recent earnings in this sector. Home Depot said Tuesday it had record sales in the most recent quarter, and that although the number of transactions ticked down by 3%, people spent about 9% more when they did make purchases. Lowe’s missed on expectations for same-store sales, but beat analyst estimates for earnings.\n\n“It speaks to the wealth effect of consumers who own homes,” Henry said.\n\nIncreasingly, experts worry that the divide between homeowners and renters is further driving economic inequality, as concerns grow that lower income households are losing more ground the longer inflation remains entrenched and prices for everything from groceries to rent keep rising.\n\nFor example, homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages are insulated from rising rents and are “not necessarily having to bear that burden of higher housing prices,” Bruun said, noting that lower-income adults are more likely to be renters, not homeowners.\n\n“There’s reasons to be optimistic, but also reasons to be concerned. Inflation still is really high, even if it’s slowing down,” Bruun said. “That’s a really long time for consumers to be living with these elevated prices.”", "authors": ["Martha C.

But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nPolice speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/peoria/2022/09/20/peoria-election-q-a-mayoral-and-city-council-candidates/10392195002/", "title": "Peoria election: Q&A with mayoral and city council candidates", "text": "Peoria voters have choices for mayor and City Council in the Nov. 8 election and part of the decision-making equation may be: Are residents comfortable with the city's direction, or do they want change?\n\nPeoria's three competitive races — two council races and the mayoral contest — have shaped up with candidates who are incumbents or have helped shaped the city's current direction and candidates who stress the need for change, from more police funding to different economic development strategies.\n\nIn the mayoral race, Jason Beck, a Peoria business owner and political newcomer, faces Bridget Binsbacher, head of the Cactus League and a former City Council member who, as required by state law, resigned to run for mayor.\n\nPeoria election: A competitive mayoral race is shaping up as Cathy Carlat faces term limits\n\nBeck has the support of Councilmember Dennette Dunn, who's running unopposed for a second term, and Jennifer Crawford, a political newcomer trying to unseat longtime Councilmember Vicki Hunt.\n\nFormer state schools Superintendent Diane Douglas, who's running for council, said she supports Beck's vision for the city. Her run is largely a repudiation of the council's approval of a development that included apartments near her north Peoria neighborhood.\n\nCouncilman Jon Edwards, who's not up for reelection, also endorsed Beck.\n\nBinsbacher is endorsed by term-limited Mayor Cathy Carlat.\n\nAlso supporting Binsbacher are three council members: Michael Finn, who's running unopposed, Hunt, and Brad Shafer, who is competing against Douglas to keep the seat he was appointed to in April.\n\nPeoria voters must be registered to vote by Oct. 11 to participate in the November election.

Some responses were edited to meet the 150 word limit.\n\nMayoral candidates\n\nTop 3 issues facing Peoria\n\nWhat are the top 3 city concerns you would address, and how do you propose solving them?\n\nBeck: \"Public safety, economic development and education are my top priorities. Peoria has a soaring crime rate and population. Response times are increasing and officers are fleeing to other cities … In this year’s budget, zero officers were added. I will ensure the … department is fully funded, staffed, trained and properly compensated. …\n\n\"Economic development drives revenues, which pays for services like public safety … Over 80% of Peoria’s workforce leaves the city to work elsewhere, and employers continue to locate in other cities. I am the only candidate that has a plan that brings thousands of jobs to Peoria, billions of dollars in economic impact, and moves Peoria to an economic powerhouse.\n\n\"… Employers look at the education system for a pipeline of talent. Our city leaders have simply ignored it. I am the only candidate (with) a plan to solve our school capacity crisis and to elevate our workforce.”\n\nBinsbacher: \"Water: For the last seven years as a councilmember, I enacted calculated and deliberate investments to bank water for future use and expand infrastructure that will allow us to reuse every drop of water. I’m the only candidate with knowledge and experience in the complexities of water in the desert.\n\n\"Public Safety: Public Safety is a matter of deep, personal conviction for me. My family lives the value, and the risk, involved in protecting the public. As firefighters, my husband and son put their lives on the line every day. To me, public safety is too important to be used and exploited during an election.\n\n\"Job Creation: As an experienced voice of the citizens of Peoria, I know that economic development must benefit Peoria’s workforce and enhance our quality of life. I’m committed to building a city that offers viable career opportunities that allow future generations to remain in Peoria.\"\n\nAttracting the development Peoria wants\n\nWhat kind of development does Peoria need, and how can the city attract that?\n\nBeck: \"From a business perspective, Peoria should be fully aligned with the Arizona Commerce Authority and the Greater Phoenix Economic Council when recruiting companies. Some of those industries include aerospace and defense, manufacturing, bioscience and healthcare, business and financial services, and technology and innovation.\n\n\"Also, with Taiwan Semiconductor’s $35 billion facility essentially next door to Peoria, we should be focusing on locating supply chain companies to Peoria, which makes up an estimated 70-80% of total jobs. We should also be focused on building a municipal airport, which would have a massive economic impact, turning Peoria into an economic powerhouse.\n\n\"From a housing perspective, we need to focus on housing that best aligns with our workforce and the industries we are recruiting. This alignment spans quality affordable housing for young families, first responders and teachers to executive housing (for those) who choose to live close to where they work.\"\n\nWhat's coming:The northernmost point in Phoenix, a vacant stretch of desert, could soon become a housing community\n\nBinsbacher: \"As mayor, I will protect the best interests of Peoria’s workforce, natural assets, and quality of life by qualifying development based on the value brought to Peoria residents.\n\n\"Peoria land located near the Taiwan Semiconductor facility has been purposefully planned as an employment corridor. I will evaluate the many interested developers based upon Peoria’s high standards. As a co-location strategy, I will build upon my long-term relationships with ASU, local, and regional educational interests to advance education and STEM opportunities for our future workforce.\n\n\"Our council strategy to bring development to targeted locations throughout the city has been paying off.\n\nPeoria Logistics Park, 150-acre project anchored by Frito Lay.\n\nStadium Point at P83, $500 million project, 1 million square feet of mixed-use space, including Class-A office space, bringing more jobs to Peoria.\n\n\"Benefitting our medical workforce, there are now more than 300 medical employers in Peoria, with more under construction.\"\n\nHousing affordability\n\nHow would you solve skyrocketing rent and housing costs that are pricing people out?\n\nBeck: \"Inflation is caused by a number of factors that are related to the national and global economy. Among the factors that cause inflation are supply and demand (including labor shortages), infusion of money supply (e.g. multiple stimulus packages), and regulatory policies. The federal reserve, through monetary policy, attempts to control inflation (e.g. raising/lowering interest rates). None of these falls under the control of local government.\n\n\"That said, at the local level, I will focus on head-of-household job growth to be located right here in Peoria. This means higher wages for our citizens (making housing more affordable for families), and a reduction of overall home budgets (less travel to and from work). I will also work with homeownership partners such as ones offered by my friends at Chicanos Por La Causa. Time is money, and I will streamline the development process, leading to faster build times and lower costs to homeowners.\"\n\nBinsbacher: \"Housing costs have escalated throughout the country. Even though Arizona’s increased housing costs are not at the top of the high-price list, builders cannot keep up with demand, keeping prices high.\n\n\"As a member of Peoria’s Community Development Subcommittee, I worked on Peoria’s Action Plan aimed at providing a suitable living environment for varying income residents. Additionally, as this is a regional issue, my service on the Maricopa (MAG) Human Services Committee gave me the context to source funds to assist Peoria residents.\n\n\"As a city leader, I understand that we must thoughtfully expand our housing portfolio, while maintaining the high standards our residents expect. To this end, I have pursued like-minded organizations and developers with innovative solutions and as mayor, I intend to bring a shift in the supply of reasonable housing available in Peoria.\"\n\nPublic safety in Peoria\n\nDoes the city give enough funding to its police and fire departments, and do you believe Peoria is a safe place to live?\n\nBeck: \"Being on the Board of Directors of the 100 Club, endorsed by all major police organizations, owner of a company focused on protecting first responders, and living in Peoria, I can state without reservation that our police and fire departments are understaffed, and lack the resources and training necessary to do their jobs.\n\n\"The simple fact is that we have a soaring crime rate and a growing population. Response times are up and our officers are fleeing to other cities for better working conditions. Our officer to population ratio is the lowest in the greater Phoenix area.\n\n\"In this year’s budget, exactly zero officers were added. This is shocking, and a complete disregard for citizens. Public records show aggravated assaults are up 30%, homicides are up 333%, and violent crime is up 16%. Overall, crime is up 7.36%. As mayor, I will not understaff, or underfund, our first responders.\"\n\nBinsbacher: \"I’m committed to fully funded and staffed police and fire departments. I’m proud that Peoria has one of the lowest crime rates and fewest officer vacancies in the Valley. Peoria is a safe city — transparency and facts matter, which is why all crime data is posted online.\n\n\"Understanding growth, I worked on council to add personnel and training; increase wages and benefits; and expand investigations, specialized units, technology, and victim resources. Peoria’s well-resourced police force has robots, drones, K9’s, cameras, armored vehicles, and fully equipped special unit (SWAT) vehicles. I also voted for the Capital Budget that has a new Police Training Facility scheduled for FY2024.\n\n\"I approved a sixth ambulance and adding 15 police officers and 15 fire fighters as a mid-year budget adjustment. During the budget session, I directed a new medical response unit and personnel be added to the budget as a service multiplier to the Fire-Medical Department.\"\n\nMonitoring water supplies\n\nWhat is your understanding of the water issues confronting the city and why should the public trust you to be a good water steward?\n\nBeck: \"Peoria has done an excellent job in water resource management. Specifically, recognition goes to the true experts, the staff of the water department led by its director Cape Powers and his team. True servant leaders trust the experts around them. As mayor, and a leader, I will continue to support the water department’s vision and plan, listen to their recommendations, and follow their advice by providing them the support they need.\n\n\"Clearly, the major concern is the declining source levels of the Colorado River and (CAP) which makes up 33.9% of Peoria’s water supply. It is important to note that the laws relating to both are controlled by the federal government and seven states (including Arizona). They are not controlled by cities. With staff as our lead experts, we should look at all innovative solutions at the local level including conservation, subterranean irrigation, groundwater banking, etc.\"\n\nBinsbacher: \"I am the only candidate with the knowledge and experience necessary to lead us through this critical time of drought and impending changes to the Law of the River. My understanding of the complexities of water planning are critical.\n\n\"I have been on the front lines creating the policies and plans that have assured Peoria’s water supply. Peoria has a water portfolio consisting of watersheds in northern Arizona and the Rocky Mountains. We store water for future use in various recharge basins, some singular and some shared regionally. We have infrastructure in place to allow for water reuse and are strategically building more systems to take us into the future.\n\n\"As a board member on the Arizona Municipal Water Users Association, I collaborated with elected officials to impact legislation to protect our ability to provide sustainable water supplies to our residents. Experience in water matters, now more than ever.\"\n\nLeadership\n\nWhat perspective and voice would you bring to the City Council?\n\nBeck: \"I bring the perspective of someone who has worked with law enforcement, first responders, has successfully run a business, and for over 22 years has worked with hundreds of local and national governments. I am the father of six sons. I'm a veteran. I'm a business owner who was self-employed at first, now we've grown and employ 300 people right here in Peoria. I know what it is like to take risks, fail, succeed, and have dealt with the bureaucracy in Peoria.\n\n\"I am a servant leader and I will be a mayor for everyone. This means my approach is rooted in complete transparency with our citizens, building consensus, and a collaborative approach to finding solutions. The stakeholders of this city will finally have a seat at the table and their input valued.\"\n\nBinsbacher: \"I represent the perspective of knowledge, experience and foresight.\n\n\"I represent the perspective of a full-time mayor. I know what it takes to advance Peoria’s interests and I intend to resign from my job to give Peoria my all. In our growing city of 200,000 residents, do we indulge a candidate who has so little respect for the job that he claims it only deserves a 'part- time mayor'?\n\n\"In a long-term drought, do we indulge a candidate with no knowledge of the complexities of water sources and structures in the desert?\n\n\"With so many residential and commercial developers at our doorstep, do we indulge a reckless candidate who has professed a distaste for our quality of life, saying we have too many parks, wanting to fill our skies with the sound of close and low aircraft?\n\n\"I bring the voice of the residents of Peoria to the City Council.\"\n\nThe mayor is just one vote on the council, but what distinguishes this post and why are you the best candidate?\n\nBeck: \"The mayor is the leader of the council, representing the values and aspirations of the voters. A great mayor drives a vision for the city and hires the team of leaders that take vision to reality.\n\n\"We have a good city, but we have not become a great city. Our great citizens deserve a great city. We need new leadership, focused on serving its citizens, and one that has a vision, a plan and track record to become a great city.\n\n\"I am the only candidate that has a vision, plan and ability that the city needs at this time to move into the future. Peoria hasn't had a vision for public safety and we see it with increased crime, increased response times and underfunding police. Peoria hasn't been able to attract quality employers. We don't need more bureaucrats leading the city. Together, we can help Peoria realize its full potential.\"\n\nBinsbacher: \"The mayor is the leader of the city. I know what it takes to be a leader in Arizona, I have been doing it in a professional capacity for years. I know what it takes to be a leader in the city of Peoria, I have been doing it in the largest and fastest growing district of the city for years.\n\n\"The mayor builds effective partnerships with the council and sets the vision for the future of the city, working every day to steer the policies and agendas that bring that vision to life.\n\n\"The mayor is the face of the city, representing Peoria’s best interests externally, always assuring the city gets its fair share.\n\n\"The mayor works to strengthen the community. I have a long history of thoughtful, collaborative leadership, supported by shared understanding and respect.\n\n\"The mayor is the leader of the city. I am that leader.\"\n\nAcacia District council candidates\n\nHunt, the incumbent, and Crawford are competing to represent Old Town and other areas of southeast Peoria.\n\nTop 3 issues facing Peoria\n\nWhat are the top 3 city concerns you would address, and how do you propose solving them?\n\nHunt: \"Supporting public safety — reducing crime: Peoria is a safe community. I’m committed to ensuring public safety has the resources they need and have a proven track record of hiring more officers and firefighters to keep up with growth.\n\n\"Improving Acacia’s quality of life: Acacia is a great place to live, and I’ve fought hard on the council to ensure that we continue to improve our quality of life. I’ve repainted walls covered by graffiti, secured 37 miles of neighborhood street improvements and helped place Peoria High School’s Old Main and Peoria Jailhouse on the historic register.\n\n\"Building a viable Old Town: Old Town remains our greatest asset and opportunity. We’ve made great strides in improving Old Town including the community garden, supporting small businesses and activating green spaces, but there’s more to be done.\"\n\nCrawford: \"1. Public safety and health must be the No. 1 priority of our local government and to ensure those departments are properly funded and staffed. 2. Economic development should focus on a balance in commerce and jobs to population. 3. Citizen engagement is also a priority to increase resident feedback.\"\n\nAttracting the development Peoria wants\n\nWhat kind of development does Peoria need, and how can the city attract that?\n\nHunt: \"From small businesses to high-wage employers, Peoria needs a diverse strategy to attract and retain economic development that ensures our city doesn’t take a “one size fits all approach.” As a council, I believe we’ve done a good job recognizing that issue and working to bring a wide variety of development to Peoria.\n\n\"In my district, we have worked to open Valleywise Comprehensive Health Center to bring expanded healthcare to our community and spur other investments. Developments like Valleywise, major renovations to the Peoria Main Library, and the recent announcements of in-fill development speak to the current success and the bright future for my district.\n\n\"All of these successes help drive my passion to establish Old Town as a “center” for our city (like we see in other communities) and give merchants a chance to thrive as they create a walkable area where neighbors can shop, visit, and play.\"\n\nCrawford: \"Peoria can’t be all residential any more than it can be entirely commercial development. A collaborative effort is imperative for a successful project and Peoria needs to foster positive relationships with development groups to attract the kind of industries and companies the community wants and needs.\"\n\nHousing affordability\n\nHow would you solve skyrocketing rent and housing costs that are pricing people out?\n\nHunt: \"With our city’s booming economy and excellent quality of life, there is no doubt that Peoria is a desirable place to live. That has certainly led to an increase in rent prices and housing costs. We must balance ensuring quality development while maintaining affordable options — especially for our essential workers including teachers, police officers, firefighters, nurses and many others.\n\n\"One area where the city can help address this issue is through development. We have to recognize that no single community or area should be responsible for solving this problem. Housing affordability is a citywide issue and must be treated as such. At the same time, we must hold developers to higher standards that recognize the quality of the project, how it will fit in with the community, and how it will age over time.\"\n\nCrawford: \"Affordability is based on wages, interest rates and inventory. Although some of these factors are out of control at the municipal level, Peoria needs to attract companies that will offer high-quality employment opportunities without focusing entirely on increasing inventory.\"\n\nPublic safety in Peoria\n\nDoes the city give enough funding to its police and fire departments, and do you believe Peoria is a safe place to live?\n\nHunt: \"Peoria is a safe place to live, and our City Council has a proven track record of investing in and improving public safety. Crime rates are trending downward at nearly 3% per year and calls for service are down 1.5% per year. Peoria spends more than half of its city budget on public safety, and we have committed to do more to keep up with growth including adding 15 positions to the Police Department earlier this year.\n\n\"During my time on council, we enhanced the successful Community Paramedicine program, added Rescue 194, and invested in body cameras for all police officers. We also secured new vehicles and equipment for public safety, code enforcement and parks personnel. We also added additional school resource officers, launched a dedicated homeless outreach effort and added a misdemeanor repeat offender program. My hard work has earned the endorsement of the Professional Fire Fighters of Arizona.\"\n\nCrawford: \"The city of Peoria has ample funding to allocate to police and fire; however, it has not proven to be a priority. These departments are underfunded and understaffed which is a detriment to the safety of our community. I will fight to put public safety first.\"\n\nMonitoring water supplies\n\nWhat is your understanding of the water issues confronting the city and why should the public trust you to be a good water steward?\n\nHunt: \"We remain in a prolonged drought, but Peoria has been ahead of the game when it comes to planning for our water needs. With the declaration of the Tier 2a shortage, we’ll experience a 1% to 2% impact on our water portfolio. However, we’re preparing for further cuts if these conditions persist. Peoria recently passed our sustainability plan aimed at protecting our water future by reducing our dependence on well water by half and reducing overall usage by 5% by the end of the decade.\n\n\"Peoria has had strong leadership on the Arizona Municipal Water Users Association board and a skilled staff adept at water issues. I am the better-suited candidate for securing our long-term water because I want to continue our city heading in the right direction — unlike those in the opposition who appear to be set on tearing our city and its leadership to the ground.\"\n\nCrawford: \"We are in a Tier 2 water shortage and it is my understanding that projections predict below average precipitation, above average temperatures and low soil moisture levels. I believe the city has been proactive with water management and it is critical to maintain a diverse water portfolio as well as educate residents on the importance of this issue.\"\n\nLeadership\n\nWhat perspective and voice would you bring to the City Council?\n\nHunt: \"I’m the only candidate with experience in understanding the needs of our unique community. I can balance our local priorities while ensuring that the city remains safe and economically successful.\n\n\"I firmly believe in a collaborative approach to solving our issues. There are no quick and easy solutions to these issues. They require focused and passionate management that I bring to the council and can back up with experience on not only the council but across the city on numerous boards and organizations. Unlike my opponent, I’m a uniter, not a divider. I have an open-door policy and know that our best work on the council comes when we are engaged with those that we represent.\n\n\"I encourage everyone to visit the city hall, get to know their government, and see that it is made up of their neighbors who all have Peoria’s long-term best interest in mind.\"\n\nCrawford: \"I have worked in various industries in the private sector for over 30 years, primarily in sales, management and business ownership. I will bring a unique viewpoint and business acumen to the City Council.\"\n\nRepresenting district as city grows north\n\nAs the city grows farther north and west, what will you do to ensure residents in south Peoria are represented fairly?\n\nHunt: \"There are those who try to divide our city and try to pit one part of our community against another — trying to foster a 'north/south' or 'us/them' division that feeds questions like this. It’s wrong and antithetical to the collaborative efforts that most of the council have worked hard to foster for many years.\n\n\"We are blessed to have a district system that ensures that every part of the city has a voice on the council. Acacia District is at the heart of Peoria’s history. Southern Peoria is not, however, exclusively in the past. We’re building up our business community and opportunities to celebrate our city and part of celebrating it means preparing for the future. Certainly, different parts of the city have different needs, but that’s why it’s important to have a council that wants to work well together instead of just protecting their small part of the city.\"\n\nCrawford: \"After living in northern Peoria for almost 17 years, my husband and I moved to southern Peoria almost two years ago. I see firsthand the lack of continuity of service in our infrastructure, parks, and streets. I will be a voice for southern Peoria to make sure we aren’t forgotten or ignored.\"\n\nMesquite District council candidates\n\nShafer, who served on the Peoria Planning and Zoning Commission before being appointed to fill the council vacancy in April, faces Douglas, who served one term as state schools superintendent. The Mesquite District sprawls across fast-growing north Peoria.\n\nTop 3 issues facing Peoria\n\nWhat are the top 3 city concerns you would address, and how do you propose solving them?\n\nDouglas: \"Among my top concerns — public safety, water and development — are included in the questions below. Therefore I will address additional concerns here — fiscal accountability and transparency.\n\n\"The most important duty of the council is the city’s budget; approving and monitoring an appropriate budget, oversight of citizens’ tax dollars and reining in wasteful spending. My background as a financial analyst, a member of the Peoria U.S.D. board responsible for a then $200M+ budget and as Arizona superintendent of public instruction responsible for the allocation of over $10 billion of local, state and federal funding, I am well versed in budgets.\n\n\"In the Mesquite District, specifically the WestWing area, there has been an appalling lack of communication and transparency with residents about a development project which potentially impacts our community’s property values and quality of life. I will work to see residents receive timely and appropriate information; not merely the minimum notice required by law.\"\n\nShafer: \"Keeping citizens safe. Being a third generation veteran and former first responder, I’m committed to making sure police/fire have the resources to do their job. I bring real experience and knowledge to the office having chaired the committee that made recommendations including new training facilities, safety equipment and additional stations.\n\n\"Protecting our water future. I represent Peoria on the Arizona Municipal Water Users Association (AMWUA) collaborating with other cities regarding water usage. I will continue to make recommendations to the Arizona Legislature on conservation issues and water projects that will continue to protect our water.\n\n\"Promoting smart economic development and quality of life. The Mesquite district boasts mountain views, hiking trails and Lake Pleasant. Utilizing these open spaces sets this area apart from anywhere else. I’m committed to working with local leaders, the Economic Development Department, business owners and the community to ensure balanced growth that brings high value businesses.\"\n\nAttracting the development Peoria wants\n\nWhat kind of development does Peoria need, and how can the city attract that?\n\nDouglas: \"Peoria needs economic development bringing in industries which create viable job and career opportunities for our citizens; especially that will keep our children coming home after finishing their education to start their careers. It needs to plan with a vision for the future not just what any developer wants today — with a design and balance between residential and industrial. This will drive revenue to the city and while this will not eliminate the tax burden on our citizens it will at least help carry it.\n\n\"The city can attract such development by making the process as efficient, time and cost effective as possible for the industries that settle in Peoria. When I was on Peoria school board we shuddered when we had to build in Glendale but Peoria was far more cooperative, at least for the school district. That no longer seems to be the case.\"\n\nShafer: \"We need high end development projects that our community will embrace. We cannot prevent landowners from selling their land, but we can provide leadership and direction. I previously served as a Peoria Planning and Zoning commissioner, so I understand the process that developers need to go through when they want to do business in Peoria.\n\n\"One thing I’ve heard over and over during my time on P&Z and as an HOA board member was that the residents didn't know what development was happening until it was too late. Peoria already has better community outreach expectations than other municipalities, but in my short time on the council, I’ve taken things to the next level. We’ve expanded our outreach guidelines and I have personally taken a “boots on the ground” approach to engage with residents, increase their awareness, and make sure we are moving in the right direction as a whole.\"\n\nHousing affordability\n\nHow would you solve skyrocketing rent and housing costs that are pricing people out?\n\nDouglas: \"No one council member can singlehandedly solve any issue. The City Council does not and cannot control the housing market nor interest rates, other than to the extent that it can help the supply by making the process more efficient for developers. What the City Council can do is control its budget and expenses to maintain or lessen the tax burden it imposes upon our citizens. Likewise the city can encourage industrial development. When a city is a bedroom community the support of city services all falls in the wallets of its citizens. Appropriate economic development with job and workforce creation will bring revenue into the city coffers.\"\n\nShafer: \"One component of rising housing costs is supply and demand and since the Mesquite District is still growing, we have supply available. Because of this, development should focus on protecting the existing and future home values in this area and bringing in projects that provide people the opportunity to work close to where they live. I understand the need for a diverse portfolio of housing options and have always advocated to ensure that we encourage the right development in the right places. I’m a champion for smart growth that protects our quality of life. This means being able to articulate what we are for — not simply what we are against. I have a proven track record of going to bat for the residents regarding smart development. When I served on my HOA Board, I often collaborated with surrounding neighborhoods to advocate for the community on projects and upcoming development.\"\n\nPublic safety in Peoria\n\nDoes the city give enough funding to its police and fire departments, and do you believe Peoria is a safe place to live?\n\nDouglas: \"The most important role of government … is ensuring the safety of its citizens. The statistics I’ve seen show that our Police Department’s officer-to-resident ratio is significantly below those of Arizona cities of similar size and demographics; as are our officers’ salaries. Once appropriately adjusted then full staffing must be maintained. When an organization is unable to retain its employees … recruitment and retraining puts an unnecessary strain on the budget not to mention the threat to public safety. We must make public safety … a No. 1 priority over the current agenda of parks and trails.\n\n\"While I personally feel safe living in Peoria, clearly different areas have different concerns. Peoria police … announced its new … Police Incident Map where residents can look up incidents in their neighborhoods. This is an excellent resource … but the numbers will only go up if we don't get the officers we need.\"\n\nShafer: \"Peoria has always had a low crime rate and is a safe place to live. At the same time, we’re growing rapidly, especially the Mesquite District, and as the number of households increase, additional city resources need to follow. Every few years when the census is completed, the city reevaluates its growing demands and budgets accordingly. Part of that process includes additional police and fire personnel, stations and training equipment. With the most recent census, Peoria increased its hiring capacity for public safety to meet those demands. My first few weeks in office, not only did I meet with the police and fire chiefs regarding their needs, but I also participated in a ride along with Fire/Medical at Lake Pleasant to see firsthand some of the challenges they face. I’m proud to say we have made great strides on this front and have already begun putting things in motion.\"\n\nMonitoring water supplies\n\nWhat is your understanding of the water issues confronting the city and why should the public trust you to be a good water steward?\n\nDouglas: \"We know our city and our state are confronting a drought with Tier 2a reductions. As I look around my own HOA, I see so much waste of water with a ridiculous number of plants and trees mandated on every lot. Yes, xeriscape but virtually all being watered in a desert. A waste – IMHO.\n\n\"Peoria is a member of the Arizona Municipal Water User Association created in 1969 by three Valley mayors to advocate, protect and ensure laws and regulations pertaining to water for their cities. Currently only one mayor serves on the association. The remaining seats are filled by city council members. In the case of Peoria, ours is an interim member who has been on the council less than 5 months. If this association is involved with serious plans and negotiations over water rights and issues, it is my opinion that our mayor must represent Peoria on AMWUA.\"\n\nShafer: \"I’m proud to represent Peoria on the Arizona Municipal Water Users Association. In 1922, Arizona was the last state to enter the Colorado River Water Agreement so with Arizona being the “junior” state, we are the first state required to take reductions in our allocation.\n\n\"Peoria’s water supply is made up of one-third CAP (Colorado River), one-third SRP, and one-third groundwater. We currently use 60% of our CAP water and we store the remaining 40%. Because of Peoria’s impeccable water management and investment in conservation projects, the upcoming federally mandated reductions (Tier 2a 1/2023) will not impact current service but will reduce CAP storage by 1-2%. However, to lead by example, Peoria reduced its city water usage by 5%.\n\n\"We need the state and Bureau of Reclamation leadership to work with the seven basin states to help solve the Colorado River water shortage on a larger scale.\"\n\nLeadership\n\nWhat perspective and voice would you bring to the City Council?\n\nDouglas: \"I will bring the perspective and voice of the people of Mesquite District. I bring the experience of a long history of public service, having served on the Peoria Unified board and as Arizona superintendent of public instruction. I will work to protect our communities’ right to know and have input, early and thoroughly about issues that impact our neighborhoods. As (state superintendent) I conducted town hall meetings all across the state to bring the citizens of Arizona to the table. I am willing to conduct similar meetings for the citizens of Mesquite to provide information and solicit input.\n\n\"I always will vote my values and principles in adherence to my oath of office in the best interests of the residents of Peoria and my constituents in the Mesquite District. I will honor the term of office and not walk out on the residents of Mesquite to run for higher office.\"\n\nShafer: \"In my professional career, a majority of my time is spent looking at the big picture and bringing competing stakeholders together to accomplish goals. With that, I manage hundreds of millions of dollars in budgets and contracts spanning several states and have a keen eye for the fine print.\n\n\"I have been engaged with the city for many years as a volunteer and when the previous councilperson vacated her seat to run for mayor, I knew I immediately wanted to get to work serving my community in a new capacity. I was the only applicant to apply for the position and was unanimously appointed by the mayor and council.\n\n\"I’m not afraid to ask questions or respectfully challenge the status quo. I am eager to work for the people and have already made it clear that the community's voice matters to me as I have actively engaged in public outreach.\"\n\nBalancing district and\n\nHow do the needs of Mesquite residents differ from the needs of the city as a whole, and how will you balance those as a council member?\n\nDouglas: \"Clearly Mesquite is a district with significant amounts of open land ripe for development. The city as a whole needs an economic development plan rather than haphazard projects.\n\n\"The whole purpose of representative districts, be they congressional, legislative or city, is so the citizens of a given district have a voice in the government which is making decisions and imposing laws or regulations upon their lives and taxes upon their livelihoods.\n\n\"I will work with my fellow council members on these priorities but much like a school board, no single city council member can mandate changes. But unlike a school board member elected to represent the district at-large, a council member should be a voice for their constituents; bringing their concerns to the decisions made for the city as a whole.\"\n\nShafer: \"The Mesquite District makes up 80% of the city (by land mass) and encompasses a diverse terrain spread over two counties. We’ve been surrounded by wide open spaces for a very long time, however, we must realize that landowners may choose to develop at some point. Finding balance between open spaces and smart development is essential for the district.\n\n\"The community is asking for high-end commercial, chef driven quality restaurants, health care, and top performing education facilities. I’m the only candidate with experience serving both the local community and the city as a whole. Because of that, I’m uniquely qualified to ensure that the vision of Peoria’s future is done right. We must strike a balance between serving our local needs while not pitting one part of the city against another. I believe each council member represents their district well and I respect their input on the council as a whole.\"\n\nReach reporter Taylor Seely at tseely@arizonarepublic.com or 480-476-6116.

They were identified as Glenn Edward Bennett, 84, a customer who was shot in front of the store, and Safeway employee Donald Ray Surrett Jr., 66, who fought the shooter in the produce section, Miller said.\n\n“This is the Safeway employee who engaged with the shooter, which is to say he attempted to disarm the shooter and attacked this person, and we believe he prevented further deaths in addition to the quick police response,” Miller said. “Mr. Surrett acted heroically during this terrible incident.”\n\nGov. Kate Brown released a statement on Facebook Monday honoring Surrett.\n\n“While we are still gathering the facts about last night’s shooting, it’s clear that far more people could have been killed if not for the heroism of Donald Ray Surrett, Jr., who intervened to help stop the shooter, and the officers who entered while shots were still being fired,” Brown’s statement said. “In the face of senseless violence, they acted with selfless bravery. Their courage saved lives.”\n\nThe gunman – identified by police as Ethan Blair Miller, 20 – was found dead at the scene and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the police spokeswoman said.\n\nPolice found an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun close to Miller’s body, according to Bend Police Chief Mike Krantz.\n\nThe shooting unfolded shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday at a shopping center, Krantz said. Police initially received reports there may have been more than one shooter, Sheila Miller said, but there is no evidence of a second shooter. There were reports of at least two other people who had injuries that were not life threatening, as well, she said.\n\nThe motive remains unclear, but police are aware of online posts that might be relevant, Sheila Miller said.\n\n“We are aware that the shooter may have posted information online regarding his plan. We are investigating this. We have no evidence of previous threats or prior knowledge of the shooter. We received information about the shooter’s writings after the incident had taken place and the shooter has no criminal history in the area,” Miller said.\n\nSafeway said in a statement the company was saddened by the “senseless violence.”\n\n“Our thoughts and actions now are directed toward supporting our associates, customers, and the community affected by this tragedy. We thank the officers at the Bend Police Department for their response and will continue to support the department’s investigation over the coming days,” the company’s statement said.\n\nSunday’s shooting follows a spate of other grocery store shootings across the country in the past year and amid an overall surge in “active shooter” incidents, according to an FBI report.\n\nIn May, 10 people were killed in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack in Buffalo, New York. A “hero” security guard and a beloved teacher were among those gunned down.\n\nIn March, another 10 people were gunned down at a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. A veteran police officer with seven children was among those killed.\n\nLast September, a gunman shot 15 people – including one fatally – at a Kroger in Collierville, Tennessee. Some people hid in freezers to survive.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nMiller said police received multiple calls of shots fired around 7 p.m. at the Forum shopping center in northeast Bend.\n\nThe gunman entered from an apartment complex behind the shopping center, Miller said. He moved through the parking lot while firing rounds from an AR-15-style rifle before entering the Safeway.\n\nOnce inside, he shot a customer – Glenn Edward Bennett – who died while being taken to the hospital, Miller said.\n\nEmergency personnel respond to a shooting at the Forum shopping center in east Bend, Oregon, Sunday, August 28, 2022. Ryan Brennecke/The Bulletin/AP\n\nThe gunman continued to make his way through the store before having an altercation with and fatally shooting Donald Ray Surrett Jr., Miller said.\n\n“As our officers responded, they entered Safeway while shots were still being fired. They found the apparent shooter dead inside Safeway,” Miller said.\n\nAn AR-15 and shotgun were found near the gunman’s body, Miller said. Bend police did not fire any shots, she said.\n\nHow the gunman obtained firearms is under investigation. Because of online postings, Bend police also contacted the Oregon State Police Bomb Squad, who cleared the grocery store and the apartment complex, Miller said.\n\nPolice said it’s unclear how many people were in the store at the time of the shooting.\n\nOfficers were on scene within three minutes of the first 911 call, Miller said. It took four minutes from the time officers were dispatched to the time the shooter’s body was found, police said.\n\nPlans appeared to be posted online\n\nA search warrant was served on the gunman’s vehicle and home, Miller said. Investigators found three Molotov cocktails in his car along with a sawed-off shotgun. Police are working with the ATF to learn if the firearms were legal.\n\nIn his apartment, authorities found additional ammunition and digital devices that are currently being reviewed.\n\nCNN has identified several blog entries appearing to belong to Ethan Miller which were published on the blogging site “Wattpad” detailing a plan and reasons for the shooting. The posts were made public on the evening of August 28 by an anonymous account and viewable for 12 hours, according to Wattpad. The posts have since been removed.\n\nThe first blog entry was headlined June 29 and signed with the name Ethan. The writer of the post blamed Covid-19 and quarantine for worsening their mental health.\n\nInitially, this person planned a shooting inside a high school on September 8, according to the posts.\n\nMore than 35 posts were made by this same account on the blogging site. Most of the posts indicated a desire to commit violence.\n\nOne post referenced being “partially inspired” by the Columbine High School shooting.\n\nIn other posts signed with the name Ethan, several reasons were cited for the writer turning into a “ticking time bomb,” which included their family and their love life, which was detailed in a post headlined July 8.\n\nThe writer mentioned buying a shotgun and an AR-15 for the shooting, and said they hoped to kill over 40 people.\n\nThroughout the posts, other mass shootings were also referenced.\n\n“I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’”\n\nCustomers and employees described a chaotic scene at Safeway, saying they scrambled for safety as bullets flew.\n\nJosh Caba told CNN affiliate KTVZ he and his four children were shopping in the store when the shots broke out.\n\n“We started heading to the front. Then we heard I don’t know how many shots out front – six or seven. I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’ People were screaming. … it was a horrifying experience,” Caba told KTVZ.\n\nCaba said he was worried about his wife, who stayed in the car because she wasn’t feeling well. But as he and three of his children fled through exit doors by the produce department, he found that his wife had driven to the back of the store and was “sitting in the car, saying ‘Get in the car! Get in the car!’” KTVZ reported.\n\nThe father was able to rush back into the store and find their fourth child, he told KTVZ.\n\nAn employee who identified himself only as Robert told the Central Oregon Daily News that he and other employees were working a closing shift in the deli when they heard loud gunfire.\n\n“Me and three other employees ran into a walk-in refrigerator and closed the door and stayed there and stayed hidden until authorities arrived,” he said.\n\nA third person was struck and was in good condition at St. Charles Medical Center, spokesperson Lisa Goodman said.\n\nResidents in the central Oregon city were stunned by the shooting.\n\n“I heard anywhere from five to eight shots. I thought it sounded like backfire,” Heather Thompson, who lives across the street, told Central Oregon Daily News.\n\n“Less than a minute later, there were 10 to 20 shots, and then another 10 to 20 shots,” she said. “And by that time, I went inside and told my dad to get away from the window. And people were running out of Safeway.”\n\nClarification: This story has been updated to clarify when the Wattpad posts were made public.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Tina Burnside Caroll Alvarado Hannah Sarisohn", "Amir Vera", "Tina Burnside", "Caroll Alvarado", "Hannah Sarisohn"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/health/pandemic-lessons-public-health-khn/index.html", "title": "Health departments apply lessons learned from Covid to other ...", "text": "KHN —\n\nLIVINGSTON, Mont. — Shannan Piccolo walked into a hotel with a tote bag full of Narcan and a speech about how easy it is to use the medicine that can reverse opioid overdoses.\n\n“Hopefully your business would never have to respond to an overdose, but we’d rather have you have some Narcan on hand just in case,” Piccolo, director of Park City-County Health Department, said to the hotel manager.\n\nThe manager listened to Piccolo’s instructions on how to use Narcan, the brand name of the drug naloxone, and added four boxes of the nasal spray to the hotel’s first-aid kit.\n\nShannan Piccolo, with the Park City-County Health Department in Montana, talks with a hotel manager about how to use Narcan nasal spray to reverse a drug overdose. Katheryn Houghton/KHN\n\nThe transaction took less than 10 minutes. It was the third hotel Piccolo had visited that hot July day in Livingston, a mountain town of roughly 8,000, where, as in much of the nation, health officials are worried about a recent rise in the use of the synthetic opioid fentanyl.\n\nIt was the first time the local health department offered door-to-door training and supplies to prevent overdose deaths. The underlying strategy was forged during the pandemic when public health officials distributed rapid tests and vaccines in high-risk settings.\n\n“We learned this from covid,” said Dr. Laurel Desnick, the county’s public health officer. “We go to people who may not have time to come to us.”\n\nDr. Laurel Desnick, public health officer for the Park City-County Health Department in Montana, prepares to deliver boxes of Narcan to local hotels. The free distribution of Narcan, the brand name of the drug naloxone, which can reverse opioid overdoses, is one public health strategy borne out of the covid-19 pandemic. Katheryn Houghton/KHN\n\nThe pandemic laid bare the gaps and disparities in the U.S. public health system, and often resulted in blowback against local officials trying to slow the coronavirus’s spread. But one positive outcome, in part fueled by a boost in federal dollars, is that health workers have started adapting lessons they learned from their covid-19 response to other aspects of their work.\n\nFor example, in Atlanta, where the county health department planned to mail out at-home kits to test for diseases, a program modeled on the distribution of covid rapid tests. In Houston, health officials announced this month they’ll begin monitoring the city’s wastewater for monkeypox, a tactic broadly used to gauge how far and fast covid spread. And in Chicago, government agencies have tweaked covid collaborations to tag-team a rise in gun violence.\n\nSome of these adaptations should cost little and be relatively simple to incorporate into the departments’ post-pandemic work, such as using vans purchased with covid relief money for vaccine delivery and disease testing. Other tools cost more money and time, including updating covid-borne data and surveillance systems to use in other ways.\n\nSome public health workers worry that the lessons woven into their operations will fall away once the pandemic has passed.\n\n“When we have public health crises in this country, we tend to have a boom-and-bust cycle of funding,” said Adriane Casalotti, with the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nSome federal pandemic relief funding is scheduled to last for years, but other allocations have already run dry. Local health workers will be left to prioritize what to fund with what remains.\n\nMeanwhile, historically short-staffed and underfunded health departments are responding to challenges that intensified during the pandemic, including delayed mental health treatment and routine care.\n\n“You’re not just starting from where you were 2½ years ago, there’s actually a higher mountain to climb,” Casalotti said. “But places that were able to build up some of their systems can adapt them to allow for more real-time understanding of public health challenges.”\n\nIn Atlanta, the Fulton County Board of Health has offered to mail residents free, at-home tests for sexually transmitted diseases. The state has historically had some of the highest rates of reported STDs in the nation.\n\n“This program has the power to demonstrate the scalable effects of equitable access to historically underserved communities,” Joshua O’Neal, the county’s director of the sexual health programs, said in a press release announcing the kits.\n\nThe changes go beyond government. University of Texas researchers are trying out a statewide program to crowdsource data on fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses. Those working on the project are frustrated the national effort to track covid outbreaks hasn’t extended to the overdose epidemic.\n\nDr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said her team is expanding the covid data-driven approach to track and report neighborhood-level data on opioid drug overdoses. Nonprofits and city agencies that have worked together through the pandemic now meet each month to look at the numbers to shape their response.\n\nArwady said the city is trying to use the pandemic-driven boost in money and attention for programs that can last beyond the covid emergency.\n\n“Every day, we’re having these debates about, ‘How much do we continue on? How big do we go?’” Arwady said. “I feel like it’s such a moment. We’ve shown what we can do during covid, we’ve shown what we can do when we have some additional funding.”\n\nThe city also opened a new safety center modeled on its covid-response base to counter gun violence. Employees from across city departments are working together on safety issues for the first time by tracking data, connecting people in highest-risk areas to services, and supporting local efforts such as funding neighborhood block clubs and restoring safe spaces.\n\nSeparately, neighborhood-based organizations created to handle covid contact tracing and education are shifting focus to address food security, violence prevention, and diabetes education. Arwady said she hopes to continue grassroots public health efforts in areas with long-standing health disparities by using a patchwork of grants to retain 150 of the 600 people initially hired through pandemic relief dollars.\n\n“The message I’ve really been telling my team is, ‘This is our opportunity to do things that we have long wanted to do,’” Arwady said. “We built some of that up and I just, I’m gonna kick and scream before I let that all get dismantled.”\n\nBack in Montana, Desnick said not every change relies on funding.\n\nWhen flooding destroyed buildings and infrastructure in and around Yellowstone National Park in June, the Park County health department used a list of contacts gathered during the pandemic to send updates to schools, churches, and businesses.\n\nDesnick posts regular public health video updates that began with covid case counts and broadened to include information on flood levels, federal cleanup assistance, and ice cream socials for people to meet first responders.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nPiccolo, the county’s health director, spent roughly an hour on that day in July going to hotels in Livingston’s core to offer opioid overdose response training and supplies. Three hotel managers took the offer, two asked her to come back later, and one scheduled an all-staff training for later that week. Piccolo plans to extend the program to restaurants and music venues.\n\nIt’s that kind of adaptation to her job that doesn’t require the continuing flow of covid aid. The state supplied the Narcan boxes.

Electric vehicles have much smaller carbon footprints than gas-powered vehicles over the typical lifetime of a vehicle.\n\nGovernments are increasingly embracing electric vehicles. Biden has called for the federal government to shift its fleet to electric vehicles, and for half of all new vehicles to be electric by 2030. California has passed regulations that essentially require vehicles sold in the state by 2035 to be electric, hydrogen-fueled or plug-in hybrids. The federal government passed new tax credits for electric vehicles last month.\n\nBut many consumers have concerns about if they’ll be able to charge an electric vehicle. The nation’s charging network is nascent compared to the long-established network of gas pumps. Last week the Biden administration announced that it had approved EV charging plans from 35 states. Many stations will be built along highway corridors to facilitate long trips.\n\nThe Joint Office of Energy and Transportation has already advised states on their EV charging plans and worked with the Federal Highway Administration on minimal standards for chargers.\n\nThe Biden administration has called for 40% of its climate change and clean energy investments to flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved and overburdened by pollution.\n\nKlein, who has previously called for the country to reckon with its racial history when it comes to urban planning, owns an electric car and an electric bike, both of which he charges with solar, according to the departments.\n\n“We couldn’t be more excited to have him working for more electric cars and trucks on our roadways,” Secretary of Energy Jennifer M.

A generation later, Mom retired as a prison warden after 25 years.\n\nBack then, retirement meant collecting full pensions and full benefits. Their wish was to do little else than rest and recover from decades of body- and soul-crushing work that had zapped their mental and physical strength.\n\nRoxanne Jones CNN\n\nGrandpop, a war veteran, packed his bags and migrated back down South when he retired. And there he sat on his porch, enjoying my grandmom’s peach cobbler and listening to crickets until the day God called him home – just a decade later.\n\nCancer awaited Mom the day she retired. And she spent a decade battling before she, thankfully, won her body back and took flight. Today, she’s an adventure-seeking globetrotter.\n\nThat was retirement life for generations past. Sacrifice all for one job, not out of passion but out of a necessity to provide. Then, retire and pray for enough sunsets left to find joy.\n\nSerena Williams was right to reject the word “retirement” in her recent essay in Vogue that revealed she would be moving on, or “evolving,” from tennis after competition in the US Open.\n\nShe called it her evolution and she was right.\n\nIn this America, retirement – from pro sports or any other job – is not what it used to be.\n\nSerena Williams is congratulated by Venus Williams after winning the Women's Singles Final match at the Australian Open on January 28, 2017 in Melbourne, Australia. Scott Barbour/Getty Images\n\nWilliams’ words resonated deeply for many, including myself, a woman and mother who walked away from a highly successful (though hardly Serena-level) corporate career in my early 40s.\n\n“I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me,” Williams wrote. “A few years ago I quietly started Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, I started a family. I want to grow that family.”\n\nNever one to stick to just tennis, throughout her career Serena (and her sister Venus) were encouraged by their parents to explore their passions outside the game. That lesson has put Serena in a powerful position now as she begins to re-center her life.\n\nSerena Ventures, which the tennis champion launched in 2013, is her one of her passions now. According to Williams, the six-person firm (five women and one recently-hired man) has invested in 16 ventures (including MasterClass, Tonal and Impossible Foods to name a few) that are today valued at more then $1 billion.\n\n“Seventy-eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color, because that’s who we are.”\n\nIf Williams did all that while chasing tennis trophies, imagine what she will accomplish now.\n\nIt would be a mistake to scoff at her rejection of the word retirement. Though immediately after her announcement Monday, many women, and men, debated whether Serena – hands down one of the greatest athletes in the world – was conveniently playing semantics. Some said she was just another woman bowing out to have a baby.\n\nThe eye-rolling around Serena’s word choice is no surprise.\n\nOur culture struggles to validate powerful, iconic women like Williams, let alone other women who have excelled in their chosen fields. And society continues to view our ability to bear children as a weakness instead of the amazing superpower, that I’ve always believed it to be.\n\nSerena Williams posted this photo to Instagram of her and her daughter playing tennis, with the message, 'Caption this.' Serena Williams/Instagram\n\nBy using the word “evolve,” Serena has done what society has failed to do when it comes to framing talented women who excel early in a chosen career, then leave on their own terms and lean instead into themselves. Embracing our full humanity, many women shift their focus to other goals they can transcend in life, be it motherhood, launching a business or exploring other life passions.\n\nWatching women realize their limitless capacity for greatness is a beautiful thing. Williams’ life has been an inspiration for millions of women with less power and prestige. And her latest evolution is no different.\n\nMany women of all economic backgrounds, including those in my own peer group, are reimagining and expanding, what success looks like in our lives.\n\nIt isn’t an easy choice to make. Williams, who calls herself a “savage” competitor, knows her evolution will be painful. Despite breaking numerous records, winning four Olympic gold medals and 23 Grand Slam championships – surpassing tennis greats like Billie Jean King, Martina Hingis, Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova – Williams is not yet rejoicing at this new turn in her life.\n\nNo, this phenomenal woman still only sees areas where she could have been greater: the wins she didn’t get to surpass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles.

So much so that recently, President Joe Biden launched a federal initiative to examine how racism, housing policy, policing, climate change and pollution affect maternal mortality rates.\n\nWilliams opined that were she a man, she would have had a longer career, free to pursue more championships.

But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday, it was pretty easy to read between the lines of the Wyoming Republican’s answers.\n\n“I am working hard here in Wyoming to earn every vote,” Cheney said at one point. “But I will also say this. I’m not going to lie. I’m not going to say things that aren’t true about the election. My opponents are doing that, certainly simply for the purpose of getting elected.\n\n“If I have to choose between maintaining a seat in the House of Representatives or protecting the constitutional republic and ensuring the American people know the truth about Donald Trump, I’m going to choose the Constitution and the truth every single day,” she said at another.\n\nAsked by Tapper whether her service as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6 will have been worth it even if she loses next month, Cheney responded that it was “the single most important thing I have ever done professionally.”\n\nIf it sounds to you like Cheney is framing her August 16 primary for Wyoming’s at-large House seat as a sort of fait accompli, and as not the end of the story but as a part of a broader narrative, well, then, you are right.\n\nThe simple fact is that Cheney is very unlikely to beat Harriet Hageman in next month’s primary. Hageman has the support of former President Donald Trump, as well as a number of top Republicans including, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWhile Cheney has tried to recruit Democrats to cross party lines and support her – and some undoubtedly will – it’s hard to see that making a real difference in the outcome of the race in such an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nSimply put: Cheney looks likely to lose – and she knows it.\n\nWhat she also knows is that, at least in her mind, this isn’t the end of her political career.\n\nHere’s how Cheney answered a question from Tapper on whether she is interested in running for president in 2024:\n\n“I haven’t really – at this point, I have not made a decision about 2024. …\n\n“… But I do think, as we look towards the next presidential election, as I said, I believe that our nation stands on the edge of an abyss. And I do believe that we all have to really think very seriously about the dangers we face and the threats we face. And we have to elect serious candidates.”\n\nWhich tells you everything you need to know about Cheney and 2024. She isn’t an announced candidate. But when you hear a politician talking about the country “standing on the edge of an abyss” and the need to elect “serious candidates,” well, it doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out what’s going on there.\n\nThe real question seems to be then not whether Cheney runs – she sounded to all the world like that decision is mostly made – but rather whether she would have any sort of impact on the 2024 race.\n\nIf Cheney runs as a Republican, it will, undoubtedly, be a very tough road for her.\n\nTrump is the clear frontrunner in all polling conducted on the Republican presidential primary and seems very likely to run. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is widely seen as the only serious alternative to Trump at the moment – and he has positioned himself as a representative of Trumpism without Trump.\n\nThere is no potential candidate garnering any serious support in hypothetical 2024 primary polls who is running expressly against Trump and his four years in office. The Republicans, aside from Cheney, who are signaling an interest in running that sort of campaign – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan being perhaps the most prominent – barely register in polls.\n\nCould Cheney somehow coalesce the anti-Trump vote within the Republican Party? Sure. But even if she was to do so, there’s scant evidence that bloc of voters comprise anything close to a majority of likely Republican primary voters.\n\nThe other – and perhaps more plausible – path for Cheney is to run as an independent in 2024. Assuming Trump is the Republican nominee, such a candidacy could skim off enough votes to potentially hamstring the former President’s chances of winning. (Presumably Cheney, who is conservative on most issues, would appeal more to Republicans than Democrats.)\n\nEven under that scenario, however, Cheney would function as a spoiler – trying to keep Trump from the White House – rather than as a viable candidate to be president. Which, given what she told Tapper Sunday, might be enough for her.\n\n“I’m fighting hard, no matter what happens on August 16, I’m going to wake up on August 17 and continue to fight hard to ensure Donald Trump is never anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again,” said Cheney.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}]}

Here's everything to know about the incident involving Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan.\n\nPrince Harry, Duchess Meghan say they were in 'near catastrophic' car chase with paparazzi\n\nWhat happened during Prince Harry and Meghan's 'car chase'?\n\nThe couple was involved in a car chase fueled by paparazzi Tuesday, their spokespeople said. The pair and Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, were followed for more than two hours by half a dozen vehicles after leaving a charity event in New York on Tuesday, their spokespeople said.\n\nThe chase \"at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi\" to capture photos of the couple \"resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers,\" their team said in a statement to USA TODAY Wednesday.\n\n\"While being a public figure comes with a level of interest from the public, it should never come at the cost of anyone's safety,\" their office said. \"Dissemination of these images, given the ways in which they were obtained, encourages a highly intrusive practice that is dangerous to all in involved.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the duke and duchess' press office for more information.\n\nWhat did police say happened to Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan?\n\nThe New York Police department said officers assisted with the royal duo's security Tuesday night, though they didn't describe what happened as a \"car chase.\"\n\nJulian Phillips, deputy commissioner of public information for the New York Police Department, told USA TODAY in an emailed statement Wednesday that the NYPD assisted in protecting the duke and duchess along with their private security team.\n\n\"There were numerous photographers that made their transport challenging,\" Phillips said.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters Wednesday afternoon he hadn't yet received a full briefing about the incident. He said it is \"reckless and irresponsible\" for vehicles to be chasing each other in New York City, adding that \"two of our officers could have been injured.\"\n\nWhy were Harry and Meghan in NYC?\n\nThe couple were in New York City for the Ms. Foundation for Women's annual gala, at which Meghan accepted the Ms. Foundation Women of Vision Award Tuesday night alongside Black Voters Matter co-founder LaTosha Brown. Meghan and Harry entered and exited the event venue through a public entrance, where paparazzi snapped photos of them, with Meghan clad in a golden Johanna Ortiz gown.\n\nJust before the event, reports surfaced that a stalker had been found near the royal couple's Montecito, California, home in the wee hours of Monday morning.\n\nThe Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office told USA TODAY in an emailed statement Wednesday that deputies responded to a report of someone being detained at a service area under citizen's arrest for stalking. Police say the person was later released on bail for prowling, and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nPrince Harry, Meghan's 'car chase' ended in a taxi\n\nThe couple and Ragland were eventually able to switch vehicles to a taxi cab, video shows.\n\nThe cab driver, Sukhcharn Singh, told The Associated Press he instantly recognized his passengers when they scooted into his car. \"They were following us the whole time,\" he said of the paparazzi, though he said he wouldn't call it a chase.\n\nWhile differing characterizations of the incident may emerge, it can be \"problematic\" to scrutinize the reality of someone’s lived experience, says Mariah Rooney, a clinical social worker and experienced trauma therapist.\n\nRooney says questioning of people's truth can perpetuate a culture of victim-blaming that’s detrimental to survivors of trauma. \"A big part of what can be protective in the face of trauma is how people respond to us: Are we believed? Are we attuned to? Are we supported?\" Rooney says. \"We exacerbate the impacts of harm when we start to question people, not believe them, minimize their stories (and) invalidate their stories and their experiences.\"\n\nWas Prince Harry in a car accident?\n\nNo, Prince Harry and Meghan were not in a car crash or accident. Neither was harmed, according to police.\n\n\"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries, or arrests in regard,\" Phillips said.\n\nPaparazzi 'had no intention' of causing distress on assignment, photo agency says\n\nPhoto and celebrity news agency Backgrid USA received photos from four freelancer photographers seeking to capture the duke and duchess.\n\nThe agency told USA TODAY in an emailed statement that its hired photographers \"had no intention of causing any distress or harm, as their only tool was their cameras.\"\n\n\"According to the photographers present, there were no near-collisions or near-crashes during this incident. The photographers have reported feeling that the couple was not in immediate danger at any point,\" Backgrid said.\n\nBackgrid said its freelancers alleged one of Prince Harry's security escorts was \"driving in a manner that could be perceived as reckless\" blocking off streets.\n\nHowever, the company said it doesn't condone harassment or illegal activity. \"We are taking Prince Harry's allegations seriously and will be conducting a thorough investigation into the matter,\" Backgrid said.\n\nVanessa Díaz, a professor and author of the book \"Manufacturing Celebrity: Latino Paparazzi and Women Reporters in Hollywood,\" encourages people to use this incident as a way to examine celebrity culture at large, rather than demonize paparazzi, many of whom, she said, come from disenfranchised backgrounds and do this work out of necessity.\n\n\"It's a really easy scapegoat to kick the people who are already at the bottom of the entertainment system, who are already disparaged instead of actually dealing with the power structures that demand the labor,\" she said.\n\nInstead of placing the blame entirely on paparazzi, Díaz says broader issues like our culture’s obsession with celebrities and the financial incentives in society for glimpses at their personal lives also contributed.\n\nPrincess Diana’s car accident death following a paparazzi chase and the impact of past trauma\n\nHarry's mother, Princess Diana, died in a car accident in 1997 after being chased by paparazzi in France.\n\nIn the early hours of Aug. 31, 1997, Princess Diana and her beau Dodi Fayed attempted to evade relentless paparazzi by hopping in the backseat of a black Mercedes S280, driven by Ritz security employee Henri Paul. The speeding car, in a misguided attempt to outrun photogs, collided with a concrete pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel. Fayed and Paul died on the scene. Diana was later pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\nHarry has spoken at length about the trauma of losing his mother at a young age, both in his revealing memoir \"Spare\" and in TV interviews. Rooney says it can be \"particularly difficult\" for trauma survivors to experience incidents \"similar to things that we have experienced in the past.\"\n\nA timeline:What happened the day Princess Diana died\n\nPrince Harry's legal battles with the media are ongoing\n\nThe couple's frustrations with media are not new. The incident comes as Prince Harry is embroiled in court battles with British tabloids, which he alleges have invaded his family's privacy and wrought havoc for decades. He is currently suing three British tabloid publishers over alleged phone hacking and other unlawful snooping. Meghan won an invasion of privacy case in 2021 against the publisher of the Daily Mail.\n\nHarry's legal fights have resulted in at least one publisher admitting to gathering information on the prince unlawfully. He is expected to appear in court in June against The Mirror's publisher.\n\nPrince Harry previously denounced the British media's \"malicious\" and \"relentless\" coverage of Meghan, sharing an emotional open letter in 2019. \"Unfortunately, my wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences – a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son,\" he wrote in the statement.\n\n\"My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\" he wrote. \"I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\"\n\nWhat are Harry and Meghan's legal rights against paparazzi?\n\nLegal protections against paparazzi for public figures who are out in public are limited, New York City-based media and entertainment lawyer Craig Delsack tells USA TODAY.\n\n\"In the United States, (it's) much different than the U.K.,\" Delsack says. \"They're public (figures), and they were out in the public. People can take pictures of people out in the public. There's no right of privacy expected when you're out in the public.\"\n\nBeing followed by a car, he said, is not a violation to rights of privacy. Generally speaking, damages have to occur before legal action can be taken.\n\n\"The mere photographing of a person out in public does not amount to a damage unless there was some sort of expectation of privacy,\" Delsack says.\n\nIncident prompts mixed reactions on social media\n\nSocial media became a breeding ground for commentary as news spread.\n\nSome, like former Fox host Megyn Kelly, expressed skepticism about the gravity of the event.\n\n\"I lived in Manhattan for 17 yrs & it is not possible to have a 2hr 'car chase' there,\" Kelly wrote on Twitter. \"Too many street lights/stop signs, too much foot/car traffic & hundreds of places you could safely pull over to protect yourself.\"\n\nUser @paulamatanovich posted a video clip of a yellow cab on Twitter and wrote that there was \"no car chase, one can clearly see the paps were waiting for them and how #princeharry #meghanmarkle slowed and stopped for the pictures to be taken.\"\n\nOthers were more sympathetic, pointing to the trauma Harry has likely faced and sharing frustrations about the paparazzi.\n\n\"Someone's mum dies tragically in a car crash after being chased by paparazzi, so what do you do as paparazzi? Chase them like you did their mum. It's quite sick tbh,\" wrote BBC presenter Richie Brave.\n\nUser @TheLakesDuchess tweeted: \"This is horrifying and is exactly why Prince Harry is fighting so hard to protect his family. Do you understand why the 'we want privacy' jokes aren’t funny now?! Their lives are at stake.

As the Buffalo Bills’ safety starts to show remarkable progress and receive powerful messages from his team of doctors in recovery, prominent figures around the football world have shared some powerful thoughts about the ongoing situation while reflecting on how football is so ancillary here.\n\nOn Thursday, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick began his media availability by discussing Hamlin and the ensuing fallout for NFL players and coaches. One of the more notable tidbits was Belichick seeing what happened with Hamlin on Monday and recounting another scary injury situation from his coaching past.\n\nIn 1997, former Detroit Lions linebacker Reggie Brown was left temporarily paralyzed after helping make a tackle against the New York Jets. At the time, Belichick was a Jets defensive assistant, and he said Hamlin made him think immediately of what happened to Brown.\n\n\"On a personal level, I usually don't watch a Monday night game, maybe randomly flip through it or whatever, but because we were playing Buffalo on a short week, I happened to have it on,\" he said. \"When I saw the situation, it reminded me very much of one that I experienced when I was with the Jets in 1997. We played the Lions, I think it was the last game of the year and Reggie Brown was injured.\"\n\n“It was kind of a normal play,” Belichick recalled of Brown’s injury, which happened while he was an assistant of Bill Parcells’ with the Jets. “… Everyone got up and walked back to the huddle, and Reggie [Brown] laid on the field and didn’t move. He was conscious for a little while. I forget exactly how long — 10 minutes, something like that.\n\nMORE THAN A GAME:'Did we win?'

It must've taken a half hour by the time he was given CPR and revived and then put on the board and put on the ambulance and driven off the field at the Silverdome.\n\n\"It was quite a lengthy process where the teams looked very much like the game Monday night of concern, thought and prayer and kneeling and so forth. It was a very chilling game, one that I'll obviously never forget. And it just, there've been a lot of games, but there's some that just, it's a moment that sticks out and that would be one of them.\"\n\nIt doesn’t sound like Belichick ever quite got over what happened to Brown. For a man who has been around the game for decades, to compare Hamlin’s situation as a result of a routine tackle to another traumatic situation from the past speaks volumes. Belichick’s heartfelt reflection about what can happen in this sport likely won’t be the last from a significant NFL figure as Hamlin continues to recover.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/05"}]}

He declined to say Friday whether he will sign it, but he has already banned TikTok from government-owned devices.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson has vowed a legal challenge to the measure's constitutionality.\n\nHELENA, Mont. – Montana's House gave final passage Friday to a bill banning the social media app TikTok from operating in the state, a move that's bound to face legal challenges but also serve as a testing ground for the TikTok-free America many national lawmakers envision due to concerns over potential Chinese spying.\n\nThe House voted 54-43 in favor of the measure, which would make Montana the first state with a total ban on the app. It goes further than prohibitions already put in place by nearly half the states – including Montana – and the U.S. federal government that prohibit TikTok on government-owned devices.\n\nThe measure now goes to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, who declined to say Friday if he plans to sign it into law. A statement provided by spokesperson Brooke Metrione said the governor “will carefully consider” all bills the Legislature sends to his desk.\n\nGianforte banned TikTok on state government devices last year, saying at the time that the app posed a “significant risk” to sensitive state data.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter promised a legal challenge over the measure's constitutionality, saying the bill's supporters “have admitted that they have no feasible plan” to enforce “this attempt to censor American voices.”\n\nThe company \"will continue to fight for TikTok users and creators in Montana whose livelihoods and First Amendment rights are threatened by this egregious government overreach,” Oberwetter said.\n\nPolitics:A US TikTok ban is gaining support in Congress. Why some say that would hurt free speech.\n\nBanning TikTok? Restrictions on the popular video app are spreading across the US\n\nTikTok, which is owned by the Chinese tech company ByteDance, has been under intense scrutiny over worries it could hand over user data to the Chinese government or push pro-Beijing propaganda and misinformation on the platform.\n\nLeaders at the FBI and the CIA and numerous lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised such concerns but have not presented any evidence that it has happened.\n\nBan supporters point to two Chinese laws that compel companies in the country to cooperate with the government on state intelligence work. They also cite troubling episodes such as a disclosure by ByteDance in December that it fired four employees who accessed the IP addresses and other data of two journalists while attempting to uncover the source of a leaked report about the company.\n\nCongress is considering legislation that does not single out TikTok specifically but gives the Commerce Department the ability more broadly to restrict foreign threats on tech platforms.\n\nThat bill is being backed by the White House, but it has received pushback from privacy advocates, right-wing commentators and others who say the language is too expansive.\n\nTikTok has said it has a plan to protect U.S. user data.\n\n'Foreign technology threats':Commerce secretary could ban TikTok under bipartisan bill\n\nWatch:TikTok CEO testifies before Congress as social media app faces potential ban in US\n\nMontana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, whose office drafted the state’s legislation, said in a social media post Friday that the bill “is a critical step to ensuring we are protecting Montanans’ privacy,” even as he acknowledged that a court battle looms.\n\nThe measure would prohibit downloads of TikTok in the state and would fine any “entity” – an app store or TikTok – $10,000 per day for each time someone “is offered the ability” to access or download the app. There would not be penalties for users.\n\nThe ban would not take effect until January 2024 and would become void if Congress passes a national measure or if TikTok severs its connections with China.\n\nThe bill was introduced in February, just weeks after a Chinese spy balloon drifted over Montana, but had been drafted prior to that.\n\nA representative from the tech trade group TechNet told state lawmakers that app stores do not have the ability to geofence apps on a state-by-state basis, so the Apple App Store and Google Play Store could not enforce the law.\n\nAshley Sutton, TechNet’s executive director for Washington state and the northwest, said Thursday that the “responsibility should be on an app to determine where it can operate, not an app store.”\n\nKnudsen, the attorney general, has said that apps for online gambling can be disabled in states that do not allow it, so the same should be possible for TikTok.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

HandsOn River Region and Uber have partnered with the city on the program, which will not require the Uber app. Rides are available on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. People can access free round-trip rides by calling 211. “Challenges create opportunity, and Montgomery – like cities around the world – continues climbing out of our generation’s greatest challenges in the COVID-19 pandemic,” Mayor Steven Reed said in a statement. “However, this crisis led us to use innovative ideas in our response and recovery efforts.” The Montgomery Rides Program reduces the barriers to citywide vaccination and could be replicated in other public health programs in Montgomery.” Reed earlier this year said the city was exploring possible solution to vaccine access issues. The city has co-hosted several drive-thru and walk-up vaccination clinics, though experts say issues remain around the state in getting vaccine to vulnerable populations who may be elderly, infirm or without reliable transportation. The ride program will provide round-trip transportation from the city to vaccination sites in Montgomery, Autauga and Elmore counties.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Anchorage Assembly has extended into June a local COVID-19 emergency declaration, approving a shorter extension than Acting Mayor Austin Quinn-Davidson requested, with some Assembly members indicating this latest extension, the city’s eighth, could be the last. The Assembly voted 6-4 Tuesday to extend the declaration, first enacted in March 2020, to June 11. Without the extension, emergency orders – including a mask mandate – would have expired, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Quinn-Davidson had asked that the emergency declaration be extended into mid-July. The Assembly also called for regular reports from the mayor’s administration on efforts to transition from emergency operations to normal operations. Assembly Chair Felix Rivera, who voted yes on the extension, asked Quinn-Davidson to continue loosening restrictions. Rivera said he would like to see the declaration’s effects be “as minimal as possible” by June. Other members who supported the declaration said that to revoke emergency orders now could put at risk public health gains that have been made.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Maintaining focus and keeping grades up has been challenging for many students over a year spent learning virtually due to the pandemic. High school seniors faced the added challenge of preparing for postsecondary education, with filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid from home a significant part of that. Many still haven’t submitted it. More than 3,000 fewer seniors have completed the form than by this time last year in Arizona, a more than 9% decline, according to data tracked by the National College Attainment Network as part of its #FormYourFuture campaign. That could signal a possible drop in postsecondary school enrollment for the coming school year on top of last year’s smaller decline. The drop was steeper at high schools in lower-income areas and in communities of color. The FAFSA helps the U.S. Department of Education determine eligibility for financial assistance via loans, grants or scholarships or work-study. More than 27,400 Arizona high school seniors have completed an application so far, according to data from the Arizona Commission for Postsecondary Education’s FAF$A Challenge. “Navigating the postsecondary process was not easy for most students and families before the pandemic, and it is especially difficult for those coming from first-generation, low-income backgrounds,” said Dolores Ramirez, Phoenix Union High School District postsecondary articulation specialist.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The effort to keep the state’s Medicaid expansion another year faced uncertainty Tuesday, with the program falling short of the votes needed for its reauthorization in the Legislature. The House voted 53-31 for the budget bill for Medicaid and the expansion program, falling short of the 75 votes needed for its reauthorization. Another vote was scheduled Wednesday on the legislation, which had already been approved by the Senate. Arkansas’ Medicaid expansion has sharply divided Republicans, who control a majority of the Legislature, since it was first approved in 2013. Past efforts to reauthorize the program have faced repeated votes before winning narrow approval. The bill failed after the House rejected a proposal to consider the expansion budget separately from the Medicaid budget. Lawmakers last month approved a plan to overhaul the expansion program to encourage participants to work after a work requirement was blocked by the courts and President Joe Biden’s administration. That overhaul must be approved by the federal government.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Hollywood’s theatrical business may be slowly rebounding, but for some exhibitors the past year has been catastrophic. Pacific Theaters – which operates some 300 screens in the state, including the beloved ArcLight theaters and the historic Cinerama Dome in Hollywood – said Monday that it will not be reopening. “This was not the outcome anyone wanted, but despite a huge effort that exhausted all potential options, the company does not have a viable way forward,” a Pacific Theaters representative said in a statement. Los Angeles County recently expanded capacity for indoor moviegoing to 50% after more than a year of being closed, but many smaller chains have struggled to remain solvent. The ArcLight theaters were a favorite of many entertainment industry professionals and celebrities, with locations throughout Southern California. The ArcLight Hollywood was the first in the chain to open in 2002 featuring the then-novel concept of reserved seating and ushers who introduced each showing. Latecomers were not admitted. The Cinerama, a concrete geodesic dome on Sunset Boulevard, is an official historic monument and a tourist attraction in and of itself, featured in movies like Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” Its custom curved screen is one of only three of its kind in the world.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Nearly 4,000 people who received COVID-19 vaccinations at a medical spa in the city need to be re-vaccinated because health officials have been unable to verify that the vaccines were properly stored there, the Colorado Department of Public Health said Tuesday. The department stopped vaccinations at Dr. Moma Health and Wellness Clinic on Friday after county health officials observed storage concerns. About 3,000 doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were confiscated, according to The Gazette, as the state launched an investigation into whether what was seen by health officials was isolated. On Tuesday, the department said the shots given at the clinic are considered invalid because the clinic was unable to provide documentation that the vaccines were kept at the proper temperature. No one answered the telephone at the clinic Wednesday, and there was no way to leave a message. According to its website, it offers mostly aesthetic services such as facials, acne treatment and tattoo removal and is led by Sylvienash Moma, who holds a doctorate of nursing degree. After consulting with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the department released guidance saying that people who received one dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines should should start their two-shot vaccination series over again.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBristol: The nation’s longest continuously operating amusement park is hoping to capitalize on eased restrictions as it approaches a milestone year. Lake Compounce announced last month that it has pushed up its opening date three weeks, to May 8. The park is celebrating its 175th anniversary this year. Officials said some changes will be noticeable, like new lighting and a new main gate area. Face coverings, social distancing and temperature checks also will be a part of the experience, and plexiglass has been installed in some areas. “We have clean teams that walk around the park. New plexiglass will be installed to protect both the guest and the team member. And depending on the ride, there might be different restrictions or regulations,” Northeast Marketing Director Amy Thomas told WTNH-TV. “But, overall, it’s not quite business as usual, but we’re really excited to open the park and get back to riding roller coasters.” The park also will feature a new logo and a new, six-story waterslide called Venus Vortex. Currently, outdoor event venues in Connecticut can open to half-capacity, up to 10,000 people. Indoor stadiums and arenas are limited to 10% of capacity.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s economy has recovered significantly since the start of the pandemic a little more than one year ago, according to an economic expert. “A recovery is clearly underway,” said Patrick Harker, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, during a Zoom conference Tuesday with the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. But it’s still not back to normal, he warned. Payroll data, for example, shows Delaware has recovered more than 60% of the jobs lost at the start of the pandemic but is still down about 24,500 jobs, Harker said. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate in the state has fallen from 13.4% a year ago to 6.3% now, he said. In February 2020, just before the pandemic, the state’s unemployment rate was 4.5%. The Department of Labor has received nearly 200,000 unemployment claims since the start of the pandemic. While unemployment rates are dropping, the state still receives thousands of claims a week. Finance and insurance, which are collectively responsible for nearly 30% of Delaware’s gross domestic product, remained “basically unscathed” this past year, according to Harker, former president of the University of Delaware. But other industries, such as tourism and hospitality, are hovering around 50% of “pre-pandemic numbers,” he said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Some independent pharmacies are questioning whether health officials have the authority to require them to use the D.C. Health vaccine portal system instead of their own, WUSA-TV reports. Local and smaller pharmacies have started receiving doses of COVID-19 vaccine through a partnership with the federal government, not the city. But Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt of D.C. Health said in a briefing Monday that local pharmacies cannot use their own registration systems. “We believe the most equitable approach to getting vaccines out is centralized scheduling,” Nesbitt said. Dr. Michael Kim of Grubb’s Pharmacy in the Capitol Hill neighborhood said the department still needs to provide more information. Alfred Addico, co-owner of Dupont Circle Pharmacy, said many of his customers have been eagerly waiting to receive the shot through his business. Nearly 200 people have joined a waiting list, anticipating a phone call from Addico. When asked if he will follow D.C. Health’s instruction, Addico said he’s choosing to stick with his original plan since the supply is from the federal government. “We have been in the community every day,” he said. “We know the customers, we know where they live, and we know what their needs are, so we know them better than D.C. Health.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: When the next school year begins in August, students across South Florida will be expected to return to their classrooms. Online classes, which started when schools shut down in March 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, are ending in three of the state’s largest districts. The superintendents in Miami-Dade and Broward counties made the announcement Tuesday, while Palm Beach County officials announced their decision last Friday. Schools reopened for face-to-face learning in October, and more than half of the students returned to classrooms. “There will be no blended, hybrid or remote learning for students,” Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie told the school board. “It’s about the best way to teach kids,” Miami-Dade Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said. He tweeted that parents who want children to remain at home will have the opportunity with the Miami-Dade Online Academy. Smaller districts in Florida have also decided to end remote learning for the next school year. Runcie said he considered three factors in making the decision for Broward County schools: that teachers can easily get the COVID-19 vaccine, an effort to make vaccinations to children 12 and older, and poor academic results and social struggles over the past year.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStonecrest: A state lawmaker is calling for Gov. Brian Kemp to remove Stonecrest’s mayor from office amid a report into the city’s use of $6 million in COVID-19 relief funds. Sen. Emanuel Jones, D-Decatur, said he plans to provide the full investigative report to Kemp, the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice, which he previously asked to investigate how the money was spent, accusing Mayor Jason Lary of misusing the funds for his own personal gain, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. “There’s a whole bunch of money missing, and someone needs to be held accountable,” Jones said. Lary has previously denied Jones’ accusations, claiming the state senator has a vendetta against him. When asked about Jones’ threat to go to the governor, Lary told the newspaper: “In this country, innocent until proven guilty.” The Stonecrest City Council voted Monday to waive attorney-client privilege on the report, allowing public access to the document. City Attorney Winston Denmark conducted the investigation after council members said their requests to the mayor’s office for information on the funding program were being ignored. In an email to city leaders and media outlets, Denmark said his report “is well over 100 pages.” However, only Lary and the City Council have seen the report so far.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State lawmakers moved this week to delay pay raises that were due to go in effect for themselves, the governor, Cabinet officials and judges, citing lingering economic struggles due to the coronavirus pandemic. “The timing is not the best right now for salary increases at these levels,” with Hawaii enduring the highest unemployment rate in the nation, House Speaker Scott Saiki, a Democrat, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “We have a high number of commercial leases being canceled. There’s still some work we have to do for our economic reopening.” Pay raises of 10% were scheduled to go into effect for legislators July 1 as recommended by the state Salary Commission in 2019, before the pandemic hit and while Hawaii recorded record tourism numbers. Instead, SB 1350, which the House initially approved Tuesday, would defer the raises until January 2023. Gov. David Ige, a Democrat, said he supported suspending the pay raises and noted he had already told his Cabinet he wouldn’t accept the raise recommended by the commission and asked his Cabinet members to do the same. “As public servants, it is our duty to do our part to help the state rebuild the economy, while keeping the health and safety of our community our top priority,” Ige said in a statement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state House on Wednesday approved legislation prohibiting mask mandates by government entities, voting 47-22 with no Democratic support to send the bill to the Senate. Republican Gov. Brad Little has never imposed a statewide mask mandate, but a handful of counties and about a dozen cities have done so in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. “This is a matter of our personal rights and our liberty,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Karey Hanks, told fellow lawmakers. Contradicting public health experts, she cited information she has that masks aren’t effective in preventing disease. She also said some victims of sexual violence find wearing masks to be traumatic if they had their faces covered while being assaulted. Opponents said mask mandates are a local issue, and they effectively prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Private businesses could still require masks if the bill becomes law. If a government agency or official imposed a mask mandate, any declared emergency would be terminated, according to an amendment to the bill.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The University of Illinois Springfield Innovation Hub, UIS Center for State Policy and Leadership, and the Community Health Roundtable will host a public webinar at noon Friday. The “COVID-19 and the Health of the Community: Moving from the Old to the New Normal” webinar via Zoom is free of charge. Panelists will discuss the baseline pre-pandemic health outcomes of people in Sangamon County; how social determinants of health, such as housing quality and affordability, have earned increased attention during the pandemic; and the trajectory of the pandemic in light of recent trends in health care practices, new COVID-19 cases, vaccine administration and coronavirus variants. Panelists include Dr. David Steward, retired faculty member, SIU School of Medicine and convener of the Community Health Roundtable; Ty Price Dooley, UIS associate professor of public administration; and Dr. Vidya Sundareshan, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at SIU School of Medicine and medical adviser to the Sangamon County Department of Public Health. The discussion will be moderated by Molly Lamb, executive director of the UIS Center of State Policy and Leadership. Attendees should register online at go.uis.edu/COVIDwebinar.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Some community leaders fear questions about the safety of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 shot will only fuel the vaccine skepticism they’ve been trying to combat. For months, leaders in the city’s Black, Latino and underserved communities have been fighting a history of racism, mistrust, and issues of lack of representation and language access around the COVID-19 vaccine. Community centers, churches, clinics and nonprofits have joined forces to bring the vaccine to Black and Latino neighborhoods. Bilingual volunteers have helped thousands of Spanish-speaking Hoosiers register to get their shot, and multiple virtual informational panels have been hosted to help debunk myths. But with federal health officials recommending a pause in the administration of the J&J vaccine due to six reported cases of a rare blood clot found in women after receiving the shot, the challenge may grow. “This could be a setback,” said Ebony Walker, practice manager at Oak Street Health, which provides accessible primary care for Medicare patients and has organized vaccine pop-up clinics. “People that were skeptical to begin with could hear that there’s a side effect. And they could feel justified in the fact that they were not on board with being vaccinated or that they were planning to wait or not be vaccinated.”\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: In an already digital society that the COVID-19 pandemic has made even more so, an Iowa State University professor says he hopes parents and legislators recognize the growing need to help children learn how to be safe and healthy online. “My personal wish about this is that we use this opportunity to recognize we’ve put ourselves in a box,” psychology professor Douglas Gentile said. “We’ve been digging a hole, and COVID made us dig a lot faster.” Gentile has worked with the DQ Institute – a global think tank with roots in South Korea and Singapore that describes itself as “dedicated to setting global standards for digital intelligence education, outreach, and policies” – to design a framework for digital literacy education. Gentile and colleagues recently reported in a published commentary that their survey of more than 145,000 children in 30 countries from 2017 to 2019 found 60% of 8- to 12-year-olds were exposed to digital risks such as cyberbullying, gaming disorder, violent content and “sexual grooming.” He said he couldn’t quantify how much those risks have changed over the past year, when the pandemic pushed even more aspects of daily life online, notably school instruction. But Gentile said the greater the digital access children have, the more opportunities there are for problems.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: A particularly contagious variant of the coronavirus that is sweeping through Brazil has been detected for the first time in the state as health officials ramp up their response to the mutations. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment’s announcement Tuesday that the P.1 variant has been detected in Sedgwick County means the state now has all three of the most widely spread variants. The agency said it is investigating how the person became infected and whether others may have been exposed. Earlier this month, the South African variant was identified for the first time in Kansas in someone from Finney County. Another variant first identified in the United Kingdom also has been found in several counties. Lee Norman, secretary of health and environment, urged Kansans in a statement to wear masks, physically distance and get vaccinated. According to state data, 35% of the state’s 2.9 million residents had received at least one COVID-19 shot as of Wednesday. Adrienne Byrne, Sedgwick County health director, said the findings also show the importance of getting tested for the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A majority of Kentuckians favor getting a COVID-19 shot, according to a new poll released by the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky. It found 71% of the 807 adults polled throughout the state said they already have or probably will get vaccinated, Ben Chandler, foundation president, said at a news briefing Wednesday. And of the 29% who said they probably or definitely would not get the vaccine, about half said they might consider vaccination with more time and more information. “Kentucky has a shot at herd immunity,” Chandler said. “We believe there is opportunity here in Kentucky to grow the COVID-19 vaccination rate.” Public health officials consider herd immunity – when enough people are vaccinated to stop spread of the virus – likely to occur at 70%-85%, Chandler said. About 50% of adults in the state have received at least one dose, he said. If people who say they intend to get the vaccine follow through, “that gets us right at the edge of herd immunity here in Kentucky,” Chandler said. The news comes as Gov. Andy Beshear is trying to get at least 70% of Kentuckians 16 and older inoculated. At that point, the Democratic governor said he would lift many of the restrictions in place, including capacity limits and curfews on restaurants, bars and many public gatherings.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: The proportion of first responders in Caddo and Bossier parishes vaccinated for COVID-19 is less than 50% for agencies reporting numbers. First responders were in the first group to receive vaccinations. Agencies in the Shreveport-Bossier area provided vaccinations to more than 550 first responders, which does not include the Shreveport Police Department or Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Office. The Shreveport Fire Department, Bossier Police Department, Bossier Fire Department and Caddo Parish Sheriff’s Office provided numbers of initial vaccinations offered by the departments. Out of 1,599 first responders across all four agencies, just 34% were inoculated. Shreveport police and Shreveport fire offered the vaccine when the first group rolled out. Shreveport police were unable to provide an exact number of vaccines administered due to a third party that collected the information.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Bates College lifted a 12-day lockdown aimed at containing an outbreak of COVID-19, and in-person classes resumed Wednesday. David Joshua McIntosh, vice president for campus life, told students the school was immediately “lifting the in-room restriction” it imposed April 1. “We are confident that we have contained the outbreak that began with social gatherings” during the last weekend of March, McIntosh said. The college still has more than 30 students who tested positive in isolation housing – half the number it had at the peak of the outbreak. Six students remain in quarantine, and the college will continue to conduct coronavirus tests for the rest of the week out of an abundance of caution. Meanwhile, the Cumberland County jail is working with the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention to contain an outbreak. Nearly 30 people – 27 inmates and two employees – have tested positive for the coronavirus, jail officials said. Inmates and staff started showing symptoms last week. Over the weekend, all inmates at the jail and staff were tested for the virus, and another 24 inmates tested positive, officials said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Takeout cocktails, which have proved a vital lifeline for struggling restaurants and bars during the pandemic, are set to become permanent under legislation the General Assembly passed Monday. The House and Senate granted final, last-minute approval to a bill that grants local jurisdictions the power to approve the sale of cocktails and other alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption or delivery. The near-unanimous votes came on Sine Die, the final day of the three-month legislative session. Under the bill, restaurants and bars would be allowed to sell mixed drinks and cocktails in sealed containers to customers who are also buying food. Eateries and taverns would have to get sign-off from the local licensing board if their jurisdiction passed a local law allowing for takeout alcohol sales. The bill calls on counties to “weigh the need to promote the economic recovery of different categories of small businesses in the wake of COVID-19.” Gov. Larry Hogan allowed carryout alcohol sales in his March 19, 2020, emergency order as pandemic shutdowns, capacity limits and social distancing requirements threatened businesses across the state. Bar and restaurant owners said to-go alcohol sales were a lifesaver when profits plummeted. The bill was sent to Hogan’s desk for his signature.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: University of Massachusetts trustees voted Wednesday to approve President Marty Meehan’s proposal to freeze tuition for most students over concerns that many are struggling financially because of the coronavirus pandemic. The vote applies to all in-state undergraduate and graduate students at the Amherst, Boston, Dartmouth and Lowell campuses for the academic year that starts in the fall. The freeze also applies to out-of-state students at Boston, Dartmouth and Lowell. “This freeze was made possible by the active management of university finances at the system and campus levels,” trustees Chair Robert Manning said in a statement. “The decisions made over the last year have ensured that the university will emerge from the pandemic in a strong, stable financial condition.” The university has also increased its institutionally funded financial aid to a record high of $352 million this fiscal year. “We recognize the very real challenges that our students and their families continue to face due to the pandemic and we are committed to doing everything within our control to lessen the burden while also preserving the quality of a UMass education,” Meehan said in a statement. UMass has about 75,000 students across the four undergraduate campuses and a medical school in Worcester.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration on Tuesday extended workplace coronavirus restrictions for an additional six months, including a requirement that employers prohibit office work if employees’ jobs can feasibly be done remotely. The emergency rules, issued in the fall, could be modified or withdrawn before they expire in mid-October. An advisory group of business, labor and health care leaders is assessing a phased return to offices and may make recommendations to the governor as soon as next week. Sean Egan, the state’s director of COVID-19 workplace safety, said “some tweaks” possibly could have been made to the regulations now if not for Michigan’s spike in infections. It has the country’s highest two-week case rate, with hospitals treating more than 4,000 adults with confirmed infections – a daily record surpassing the previous high from a year ago. A coalition of business groups had criticized the restrictions on office work, citing competitiveness issues, the mental health of employees, and negative effects on downtowns and municipal governments. Business leaders also have contended there is little evidence of spread within carefully managed offices. Egan said the rules allow employers to have workers in the office. “It’s the employer making the determination. So there is room there for them to maneuver,” he said, adding that the state may provide more clarity on the “feasibility” standard.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: More than a year after COVID-19 slammed the door on theaters, stages and music venues, live shows are beginning to return to Central Minnesota. A relative lull in the pandemic in February and March gave venues and audiences hope for the return of live entertainment. However, with ongoing restrictions and a potential for another spike in cases, live shows will likely be different for months to come. The Paramount Center for the Arts is planning a “soft reopening” in May, with three weekends of live Vietnam War-era music performed by the Fabulous Armadillos. The Paramount’s first shows will be limited to 200 people, or about 25% of the theater’s capacity. Household groups and “COVID pods” will be seated together, and guests will be asked to head straight to their seats and remain there during performances. Meanwhile, in Waite Park, a long-awaited outdoor venue will host some of the area’s first live shows since the start of the pandemic, including GREAT Theatre’s rescheduled performance of “Cinderella” in late July. The Waite Park amphitheater, originally set to open last summer, is now set to host its first shows in early June. “It really is a little bit of luck,” Executive Director Dennis Whipple said, “to think they built an outdoor theater that’s ready to go post-COVID.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Health officials said 78 people in the state have tested positive for the coronavirus after being fully vaccinated, and one died. “We knew we would see some because (the vaccine is) not 100% effective at preventing any illness,” State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs said during a Tuesday media briefing. “It’s been fortunately an uncommon thing.” The Moderna vaccine is more than 90% effective against COVID-19 six months after the second dose is administered, according to the most recent study. Pfizer said its vaccine is 91.3% effective in preventing the disease caused by the coronavirus. While Johnson & Johnson’s shot, currently facing questions related to rare blood clots, has a lower effectiveness against COVID-19 at 66%, it’s highly successful at preventing hospitalization and death in infected people, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. In proportion to the more than 630,000 people who have been fully vaccinated in the state, the risk of contracting the virus afterward is very low, State Epidemiologist Paul Byers said during the briefing. “If you think of the several hundred thousand cases that we’ve had to date from COVID, and you put that in perspective with the total number of individuals who’ve been vaccinated, we’re talking about less than 80 cases,” Byers said.\n\nMissouri\n\nBranson: The tourist town is ditching its mask mandate early after electing a new mayor who ran on a platform that called for doing away with it. “The city heard your voices loud and clear,” newly elected Mayor Larry Milton said after the Board of Alderman voted 6-0 on Tuesday night to repeal the public masking ordinance effective Friday. The ordinance was first enacted July 31 after extensive discussion amid rising COVID-19 case counts. Last month, the Board of Aldermen voted 4-2 to repeal it but delayed implementation until May 24 to allow Branson’s tourism industry an opportunity to vaccinate its front-line workers. But that wasn’t fast enough for voters, who on April 6 decisively elected Milton to the city’s highest office and remade the composition of the Board of Aldermen. The discussion leading up to the vote was heated, with one community member called masking mandates “diabolically evil.” Milton called for everyone to support Branson’s business community, regardless of how policy differences over masking requirements played out. “I want to be very clear with this message,” the mayor said. “If this ordinance passes, I will encourage and fully support any business that continues to mandate masks. I will support anybody who chooses to wear a mask.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte issued an executive order Tuesday banning the development or use of vaccine passports in the state. The move by Gianforte comes as vaccine passports – documents used to verify COVID-19 immunization status and allow inoculated people to more freely travel, shop and dine – have been portrayed by Republicans across the country as a heavy-handed intrusion into personal freedom and private health choices. Montana’s order prohibits state agencies from requiring COVID-19 vaccines to access state services or facilities. It also prohibits the state from issuing or funding such documentation and from sharing individuals’ vaccination status with other entities. Finally, it prohibits businesses in the state from requiring customers to be inoculated to access services. Gianforte, a Republican who got his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine earlier this month, was diagnosed with the coronavirus last week and is recovering and isolating in his home. He said in a statement that he encourages Montanans to get the vaccine, but receiving it is “entirely voluntary” and will not be mandated by the state. “We are committed to protecting individual liberty and personal privacy,” Gianforte said. The Legislature is also considering several bills that would ban the use of vaccine passports.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state Department of Health and Human Services and Nebraska Public Health Lab have confirmed that the New York variant of the coronavirus, known as B1.526, has arrived in the state. The initial case was identified as a Douglas County resident. An investigation is underway and ongoing. The B1.526 variant has been spreading throughout the United States, specifically in the Northeast, and is still being studied to determine the level of contagiousness and severity. Testing platforms like Test Nebraska and others will still produce a “positive” result for the strain, and COVID-19 vaccines are expected to remain effective.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday that he hopes each of the state’s 17 counties will be able to reopen at 100% capacity by June 1. A roadmap unveiled in February set May 1 as a target date by when Sisolak and state health officials planned to cede some decision-making power over Nevada’s coronavirus guidelines to local officials. It directed counties to prepare to set capacity and social distancing guidelines but kept a statewide mask mandate in effect and reserved the right to tighten restrictions if coronavirus variants proliferated or if vaccination rates remained low despite availability. Sisolak said counties would still retain control over decisions, and his intention was not to influence or take ownership over reopening decisions. “This is the first piece of good news that I’m able to deliver in a long time,” the first-term Democrat said at a news conference. From Las Vegas to the state’s rural north, local officials have for weeks deliberated over plans to reopen businesses and lift capacity caps on private gatherings upon regaining control. In Washoe County, home to Reno, officials are weighing plans to lift social distancing requirements as soon as 50% of the population is vaccinated. In rural Nye County, commissioners are considering making masks optional altogether – a choice Sisolak said he has not given them the authority to make.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The speaker of the state House wants to revisit a decision by an appeals court to vacate a judge’s ruling that upheld his refusal to provide remote access to legislative sessions to lawmakers at a higher risk of serious complications from COVID-19. Lawyers representing Sherman Packard are planning to seek a rehearing on the case, according to court documents Wednesday. Seven Democratic lawmakers sued Packard, a Republican, arguing that holding in-person sessions without a remote option violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and the state and federal constitutions and that it forces them to either risk their lives or abandon their duties as elected officials. Meanwhile, a state House seat left vacant by the COVID-19 death of previous Speaker Dick Hinch will remain in Republican hands, following a special election. Bill Boyd, a town councilor in Merrimack, won Tuesday, defeating former state Rep. Wendy Thomas, a Democrat. He received 2,531 votes; Thomas got 2,144 votes. Independent candidate Stephen Hollenberg got 104 votes. Hinch died Dec. 9, a week after he was sworn in as speaker.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWoodland Park: It is the state’s responsibility to remove trash along its highways, but some residents say the garbage is out of control this year. Grassy shoulders are covered in car parts and soda cans, and shrubs are festooned with tattered plastic bags. A frustrated Mayor Keith Kazmark recently accompanied a crew from the Woodland Park Department of Public Works to pick up a child’s mattress that had been a roadside eyesore for weeks along Route 80. Trash, especially around exit ramps, is a perennial problem, but the COVID-19 pandemic has made it worse. “We all see the litter and are extremely concerned by it,” said JoAnn Gemenden, executive director of New Jersey Clean Communities. The organization has 65 Adopt-A-Highway groups that have taken on cleaning sections of highways, and 12 more are pending. But the pandemic has limited the ability of many of these groups to get out and clean up, Gemenden said. For one thing, COVID-19 has reduced crew sizes. Instead of four workers traveling in one car, coronavirus restrictions mean that often only one person can occupy a car, she said. Some workers are reluctant to go out during the pandemic at all. Another contributing factor was the COVID-19-related suspension of Passaic County’s SLAP, the program that provides inmates to pick up trash along roads.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Authenticity and the idea of adventure steeped in culture have fueled the state’s award-winning “True” tourism campaign for more than a decade. That won’t change, but Tourism Secretary Jen Paul Schroer said Tuesday that it was time to refresh the brand ahead of what she said will be a “complete rebirth of New Mexico’s tourism economy” as more people are vaccinated and as more public health orders prompted by the coronavirus pandemic are relaxed. Schroer unveiled the new “New Mexico True” logo and tagline during a virtual announcement that included a glimpse of the video storytelling that will drive the latest iteration of the tourism campaign. The new design features the state symbol – the iconic zia, whose origins are rooted in the Indigenous community of Zia Pueblo – and the classic slogan of “Land of Enchantment.” Aside from staying on the cutting edge of the marketing game, officials said the goal is to reignite demand for New Mexico’s unspoiled outdoor expanses, its cuisine and culture following a year in which the state lost out on more than $3 billion in visitor spending, and tens of thousands of leisure and hospitality workers were left jobless. The downturn forced by the pandemic followed several years of consecutive record-breaking tourism numbers for New Mexico.\n\nNew York\n\nBuffalo: Buffalo Bills and Sabres fans will have to show proof they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19 if they want to attend games, Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz announced Tuesday. “Our goal is to have a 100% full house for the Bills and the Sabres starting in the fall,” Poloncarz said during a daily briefing. “Our plan is that unless you are vaccinated, you will not have entry to the stadium. It is easy. It is safe.” Ticket-holders entering Highmark Stadium for NFL games or the KeyBank Center for NHL games will be asked to show digital proof they are fully vaccinated using New York state’s Excelsior Pass cellphone app. Both venues are owned by Erie County. There will be no religious or other exemptions. “There’s no God-given right to attend a football game,” Poloncarz said. The Buffalo Sabres announced last month that fans could attend ice hockey games in April if they provided proof of vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test result. Erie County’s vaccination rule won’t affect the remainder of the Sabres’ current season.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State House members on Tuesday commenced their biennial efforts to give local school systems more flexibility over when they can hold classes, as a committee passed several school calendar measures. Current law requires K-12 districts to open the school year no earlier than the Monday closest to Aug. 26 and end no later than the Friday closest to June 11. There are exceptions, such as for districts where weather-related school closings are common. One statewide bill approved by a House education committee would permanently move up the start date by a week. Other local measures applying to one or a few districts would allow even earlier starts or provide school boards wide-ranging calendar flexibility. Some local bills would only allow temporary changes for two or three years. The General Assembly approved a uniform calendar law in 2004 in response to parents and businesses worried that traditional summer vacations from school were diminishing, making it harder to find young people who could fill seasonal jobs at the coast. The Senate has blocked efforts through House legislation over the years to eliminate or weaken that base law. Some sponsors of the new bill say schools need flexibility to address academic failings caused by virtual learning during the pandemic.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group submitted a proposed ballot measure Tuesday that aims to raise the approval threshold for changing the state constitution through the citizen-initiative process. The citizen-led Protect North Dakota’s Constitution wants to change voter approval of constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60%. The petition, submitted to Secretary of State Al Jaeger following a press conference at the state Capitol, also seeks to limit ballot measures to a single issue. Retired Maj. Gen. Michael Haugen, a previous adjutant general of the North Dakota National Guard and former member of the state Board of Higher Education, is co-chairman of the group. Haugen, who lives in Fargo, said constitutional amendments have been put before voters in every election cycle for more than a decade, Often, he said, they have contained “confusing language that addresses multiple issues” and are routinely backed by out-of-state interests. Citizen initiatives allow residents to bypass lawmakers and get proposed state laws and constitutional amendments on ballots if they gather enough signatures from voters. North Dakota is among about two dozen states with some form of an initiative process.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County is offering take-home coronavirus tests in select drive-thru windows. UC Health and the Health Collaborative will continue to offer on-site virus testing, but there is also a take-home option. “We realize that our customers may not be able to find a day or location that’s convenient for them. And if you or someone you love need a COVID test for work, school, travel, time is of the essence,” a press release said. The Ohio Library Council, with the Ohio Department of Health, will provide free Abbott BinaxNow at-home coronavirus test kits, along with eMed telehealth sessions. The tests provide 15-minute results. A device with a camera and microphone is required in order to access a telehealth appointment and complete the test. The tests are part of a statewide effort to provide widespread accessibility of free testing throughout Ohio. At least 90 public libraries are a part of the initiative.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The City Council on Tuesday did not vote as scheduled on a proposal to lift the city’s mask mandate, which is due to expire April 30. The proposal to end the mandate was removed from the council agenda. City health officials have recommended keeping the mask requirement. In McAlester, the City Council ended its mask requirement. “Now that these vaccines are rolling out, I don’t think we need a mask-mandating ordinance,” Counciler Zach Prichard told the McAlester News-Capital. “I don’t want our mask mandate to be a disincentive to get vaccinated.” The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Wednesday reported 406 new coronavirus cases and 25 additional COVID-19 deaths, bringing the total number of infections to 444,288 and the statewide death count to 8,093 since the pandemic began.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: A large winery has notified its workers that they must show proof they’ve received a COVID-19 vaccine by May 20. Many workplaces are weighing similar requirements as pandemic restrictions loosen, KLCC reports. King Estate Winery sits on more than a thousand acres outside Eugene. Chief Operating Officer Brent Stone said it’s like a small city, with about 70 employees and workers working close together on bottling lines. He said concerns about workplace safety and preventing a coronavirus outbreak are behind the vaccine requirement. “It’s coming from a really good place, in our minds,” Stone said. “It’s really intended to be supportive and not punitive by any means.” Stone said King Estate has offered on-site vaccination clinics and an additional vacation day as incentive, with paid sick time for vaccine recovery. During the pandemic, weekly food boxes have been available to workers, and the winery boosted its minimum wage to $15 an hour. University of Oregon Law School Associate Professor Liz Tippet said employers can require their workers to get the vaccine, with some exemptions. But she expects most won’t go that far. It’s also in people’s interest to get the vaccine, especially those who interact a lot with others in the workplace, she said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A pandemic power struggle that has raged for a year between the Democratic governor and Republican-led Legislature will land on voters’ laps next month in the form of two proposed constitutional amendments that could limit the length of disaster emergencies. Republicans wasted little time getting a statewide question about disaster emergencies onto ballots for the May 18 primary after losing a court ruling in July over a similar resolution that would have ended Gov. Tom Wolf’s disaster declaration. Constitutional amendments must pass both chambers in two consecutive, two-year sessions but do not require the governor’s backing. GOP leaders have denounced the wording for the referendums, developed by the Wolf administration, as loaded language. Because they are ballot questions, all voters are eligible to participate in the primary. “They clearly wrote it in a way for it to fail,” Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, R-Centre, said in February, arguing the state’s disaster emergency has gone on too long. “Look, even a benevolent dictator is still a dictator. And when you have unilateral control, one individual, that’s what you have.” It’s unclear how much of Wolf’s authority would be curtailed by passage of the amendments.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Accidental drug overdose deaths in the state jumped by 25% in 2020 over the prior year, to their highest level since records have been kept, health officials said Wednesday. There were 384 accidental overdose deaths last year, most involving opioids, according to the state’s Overdose Prevention and Intervention Task Force, which released the final overdose data for the year during a virtual briefing. That was up from 308 in 2019. The previous high was 336 in 2016. The records date to 2009. Fentanyl was involved in about 3 out of 4 overdoses in 2020. Cocaine-involved overdoses also increased in 2020. Roughly 3 in 4 cocaine-involved deaths also involved fentanyl. Alcohol was involved in about one-third of the deaths. Most of the overdoses were in people ages 35 to 44, and 3 out of 4 were among men. The state is responding to the issue with the distribution of 10,000 naloxone kits, an overdose reversal medication. The isolation of the pandemic has been cited as a possible factor in the increase in deaths last year. “Illegal drugs have always been dangerous, but right now they are more deadly than ever,” state health department chief Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott has said. “If you do use drugs, do not use alone, and make sure that your friends and family have naloxone available.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state House on Wednesday passed a proposal to require all schools to offer in-person classes five days a week starting the last week in April and continue to offer them next school year no matter what happens with the COVID-19 pandemic. The House also removed from the Senate resolution a requirement that teachers be paid extra if they have to teach students both in the classroom and online. The extra pay proposal had to be taken out because education officials and lawmakers were still working to figure out parameters like whether teachers get credit for an online class if the lessons are simply streamed without interaction with students who are not in person, said Rep. Raye Felder, R-Fort Mill. “We’re not leaving those teachers hanging, doing all that additional work?” Rep. Wendy Brawley, D-Hopkins, asked Felder during Wednesday’s debate. “We plan to continue to work on that,” Felder said. The House passed the resolution 106-7, and it faces one last procedural vote before being sent back to the Senate. Senators passed a version with the extra pay and a different deadline, so either they will have to agree to the House version, or the two sides will have to work out their differences in a committee.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Alcohol abuse is driving an uptick in liver diseases in the state and across the country, a sign of “collateral damage” from the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Christine Pocha, a transplant hepatologist at Sioux Falls-based Avera Medical Group and Fellow of the American Association of the Study of Liver Disease, said large medical centers across the U.S. are seeing 30% to 50% increases in patients with acute or worsening liver disease. And with survival rates from afflictions like liver disease and cirrhosis as low as 10% in severe cases, that has coincided with a drastic jump in deaths associated with such diseases. The South Dakota Department of Health recently reported the number of residents who died from liver failure last year –234 – was 76% above the state’s 10-year average. “What we see now is the collateral damage of the pandemic,” Pocha said. “Factors such as isolation due to quarantine, unemployment, financial difficulties, the decreased access to in-person medical and intervention support, as well as the overall additional stress of the pandemic, are driving the uptick in cases.” Historically, liver diseases are most prevalent in middle-aged men. But Pocha said several years ago, more cases started appearing in younger patients and women, a trend “fueled by the pandemic.”\n\nTennessee\n\nPortland: Gov. Bill Lee on Tuesday announced that one of North America’s largest manufacturer of coronavirus testing swabs will establish a new manufacturing and distribution operation in the state. Puritan Medical Products, a medical supplies manufacturer headquartered in Maine, will open a factory in Orlinda, state officials said in a news release. The project will result in 625 jobs over the next five years. Puritan has played a major role in the United States’ efforts to conduct enough testing to help corral the coronavirus pandemic. The company’s total production of flock tip swabs and foam swabs has increased from 15-20 million swabs a month to 70-90 million per month. The Orlinda factory is expected to produce up to 200 million swabs per month.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Local health authorities are toning down some pandemic safety rules for people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, Austin Public Health announced Tuesday. “As more people become vaccinated in our area, we are able to move to more lenient requirements for those individuals,” Interim Austin-Travis County Health Authority Dr. Mark Escott said in a statement. “However, we have not yet reached herd immunity in our community.” People are considered fully inoculated two weeks after their last dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to Austin Public Health officials. Those who are fully vaccinated are no longer asked to quarantine after exposure to the coronavirus if they do not have any symptoms. Additionally, they will not be required to wear a face covering in settings and situations deemed safe by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Under the CDC’s current guidance, released April 2, people who are fully vaccinated can meet with others who are fully vaccinated indoors without wearing masks or social distancing. They can also interact indoors without masks and social distancing with people within their households who are not fully vaccinated and are not at high risk for severe symptoms from COVID-19, according to the guidance.\n\nUtah\n\nOrderville: Popular tourist lodging company Airbnb has released a list of its most searched destinations for the upcoming summer, and the tiny town of Orderville is No.6. As the weather warms and COVID-19 pandemic restrictions relax, the state’s national parks are preparing for an influx of tourists that is already breaking records. Zion National Park, the nation’s third most popular national park and Orderville neighbor, saw more than 300,000 visitors in January and February alone this year, topping records for the winter months. “The forecast looks like it’s going to be a really busy year; there’s a lot of pent-up energy around the country and the world. Because we have open space and we’re accessible, the demand is high,” Greater Zion Office of Tourism Director Kevin Lewis said. In a February report from the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah, senior tourism analyst Jennifer Leaver found that visitors spent a record $253.6 million at Zion in 2019. And once visitors are here, they also spend their vacation money in surrounding gateway communities, like Orderville. In Airbnb’s February report, the company found that home hosts earned a collective $1 billion during the pandemic, an average of $7,900 per year.\n\nVermont\n\nNewport: A business owner is seeking a new trial in his fight against the state’s mask mandate during the pandemic. Andre Desautels, the owner of Derby Port Press in Newport, was sued by the state after he refused to wear masks in his store, which offers printing services and was also a pickup spot for packages. In February, United Parcel Service Inc. severed its relationship with the store, saying it refused to comply with the company’s uniform policy, which includes wearing masks. Police and the Vermont attorney general’s office had warned Desautels several times to comply with the emergency orders or face fines, the Caledonian-Record reports. Desautels argued that the mask mandate was unconstitutional. Last month, a Vermont judge upheld the state’s mask mandate, and a hearing on potential fines is pending. Desautels has hired a new lawyer who filed a motion last week seeking another trial, with complaints about how his former lawyer handled the case, the newspaper reports. Vermont reported 29 cases of the coronavirus Wednesday for a statewide total of at least 21,480 since the pandemic began. Four new deaths were reported for a total of 237 to date. According to the state Health Department, 29 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, with four in intensive care.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Public transit systems from Northern Virginia to Hampton Roads are looking for a path forward after losing riders and revenue during the pandemic. Some transit systems have been harder hit than others. The Greater Richmond Transit Co. faced a “potentially catastrophic budget deficit” since eliminating fares last March in response to the pandemic and reductions in public funding starting in July of this year, according to the organization’s annual report. Federal pandemic relief and Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation emergency funding covered the deficit, according to the report. The transit system lost about 20% of riders when comparing March-November 2019 with the same nine-month period in 2020. Almost 350,000 riders boarded Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority buses per day on average in 2019, including passengers in Northern Virginia. That number dipped to 91,000 average daily boardings in 2020, according to Metro statistics. Hampton Roads Transit buses served 10.7 million people in 2019 and 6.2 million in 2020. The decline has carried into 2021. Almost 1.6 million passengers took HRT transit buses in January and February 2020, and just over 815,000 have in 2021, resulting in a nearly 50% decrease.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: State health officials said Wednesday that 115 more cases of fully vaccinated people testing positive for the coronavirus have been discovered out of 1.7 million people who have been fully inoculated against COVID-19 in Washington. A total of 217 of the “breakthrough cases,” as they are known, have now been recorded in 24 of the state’s 39 counties, the state Department of Health said. Officials also said Wednesday that they are investigating five suspected deaths of people who experienced vaccine breakthrough. The people who died were between 67 and 94 years old, and all had multiple underlying conditions, officials said. Four lived in long-term care facilities. Officials said breakthrough cases are expected with any vaccine. The breakthrough cases in Washington represent about 0.01% of the fully vaccinated population. A person is confirmed with vaccine breakthrough if they test positive for the coronavirus using a PCR test or antigen test and received their final dose of the COVID-19 vaccine more than two weeks before the positive test.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: West Virginia University announced Tuesday that it will temporarily stop administering the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Johnson & Johnson. The announcement came hours after the U.S. recommended a “pause” in using the single-dose vaccine to investigate reports of rare but potentially dangerous blood clots. Dr. Clay Marsh, the state’s coronavirus czar and vice president and executive dean of WVU Health Sciences, noted that the federal recommendation occurred amid an investigation of unusual clots in six women between the ages of 18 and 48. One person died. “The fact that CDC and FDA are acting out of caution for 6 clotting episodes in 6.8 million doses given should reassure West Virginia residents that we are watching any and all associated findings in those vaccinated to make sure safety is our priority,” Marsh said in a statement. Until the cases are reviewed, WVU will pause the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccines on all campuses out of abundance of caution, the statement said. The university will work with people scheduled to receive the J&J doses to enable them to receive doses for Pfizer and Moderna vaccines based on availability.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that Gov. Tony Evers’ administration does not have the authority to issue capacity limits on bars, restaurants and other businesses without the Legislature’s approval, a ruling that comes two weeks after the conservative-controlled court struck down the state’s mask mandate. The high court also ruled last year in a similar case that the Democratic governor needed the approval of the Legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, to issue an emergency declaration that shut down businesses early in the coronavirus pandemic. There has not been a statewide capacity limit restriction in place since October. That order limited the size of indoor public gatherings to 25% of a building’s or room’s occupancy or 10 people in places that don’t have an occupancy limit. The on-again, off-again order was blocked by a state appeals court that month. The high court ruled 4-3 on Wednesday that the order issued by Evers’ Department of Health Services meets the definition of a rule, which by law must go through the Legislature. The court’s four conservative justices ruled against Evers, while three liberals dissented. “At a time when public health experts are imploring pandemic-weary Wisconsinites to stay vigilant, a faulty statutory analysis once again leads this court to undermine public health measures,” Justice Ann Walsh Bradley wrote for the dissent.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state health department is remind residents who lost a loved one to COVID-19 that they may apply for federal reimbursement of funeral expenses to help ease some of the financial stress and burden caused by the pandemic. A dedicated toll-free phone number to call is 844-684-6333. Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives are available to assist callers from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday. The helpline has received thousands of calls, causing some callers to receive a busy signal. Having the required documents ready when calling can ease some of the congestion, officials said. Individuals who feel they need crisis counseling are encouraged to call Wyoming 2-1-1. The service provides free, confidential, health and human services information and referrals.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/12/07/gala-uproar-deputy-dragged-anti-mask-doctor-news-around-states/115112030/", "title": "Gala uproar, deputy dragged: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: With the state’s mask mandate set to expire this week even as COVID-19 cases explode, filling hospitals and killing people daily, health leaders urged the state Friday to again extend the requirement, perhaps into 2021. Dr. Sarah Nafziger, who teaches emergency medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told an online news briefing it was “critically important” for Gov. Kay Ivey to extend the mask requirement, which is opposed by some who consider it an infringement on personal rights or who discount the threat of the coronavirus. “A lot of people like to argue that masking is not helpful, that it’s a bunch of voodoo,” Nafziger said. “I’m here to tell you that the science shows that it works.” The president of the Alabama Hospital Association, Dr. Don Williamson, said the organization “absolutely” supports continuing the order as coronavirus trends worsen. “We would support one probably through January. The situation is slipping rapidly in the wrong direction,” Williamson said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A coronavirus outbreak at the state’s biggest prison is still growing and has left almost half its population infected. As of Thursday, 581 inmates at Goose Creek Correctional Center had active cases of the virus, said Alaska Department of Corrections spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher. That figure is 46% of the prison’s total population of 1,253 inmates, which includes both convicted prisoners and those awaiting trial. Corrections officials said 193 people at the prison have recovered from the virus, meaning over half of inmates have contracted COVID-19 since the outbreak was first identified Nov. 2, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Two inmates at the prison have died. An outbreak at the Yukon Kuskokwim Correctional Center in Bethel has been identified as well, with 46 people infected as of Thursday, according to the state Department of Corrections. The jail hosts both male and female prisoners and has a capacity of 207 people. Thirteen inmates were hospitalized statewide due to the coronavirus as of Thursday.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state expects to get enough doses of new coronavirus vaccines by the end of the year to inoculate more than 383,000 health care workers and long-term care facility residents, Arizona’s health director said Friday. Health Services Department Director Dr. Cara Christ said the federal government has allocated those doses of vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gives the new vaccines emergency use authorization. Both vaccines were shown to be more than 90% effective, but they require a second dose within a month. Christ said the federal government will hold back that second dose for later delivery. Once those health workers and long-term care residents receive the vaccine, teachers and other essential workers are next in line, followed by older Arizonans or people otherwise at higher risk of serious cases of COVID-19. It will be months before all Arizonans who want to get a vaccine will be able to sign up to receive one. The state has about 7.3 million residents.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The hours and some services at state parks are being limited because of the coronavirus. The state health department on Saturday reported 2,245 newly confirmed or probable cases and 34 additional deaths for totals of 169,382 cases and 2,620 deaths since the pandemic began. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in the state rose from 1,656.8 on Nov. 20 to 1,922.8 per day Friday, and deaths fell slightly from 24.7 per day to 21.4. The parks department’s visitor information centers and museums will be open five days a week on what are typically their busiest days, while restaurants will reduce seating and end buffets, the department said in a statement Friday. Marinas at DeGray Lake and Lake Ouachita will limit services through February. “Flexibility is necessary during these unprecedented times,” said Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism Secretary Stacy Hurst. Cabins, campgrounds and lodges remain open with contactless check-in.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The California Assembly will be trading its Capitol chambers for a downtown NBA arena when it kicks off the new session Monday in an effort to limit coronavirus spread. Speaker Anthony Rendon said the extra space and better air filtration at the Golden 1 Center will help keep lawmakers, staff and the press safe. The Senate, meanwhile, will still convene in its regular chambers, President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins said. Neither chamber will allow guests, including lawmakers’ families. The arena, home to the Sacramento Kings’ NBA team, is several blocks from the Capitol. Lawmakers will be sworn in for the new two-year session, and they will return for work in January. Atkins, a Democrat, said health officials deemed the Senate’s distancing and screening procedures, as well as its air filtration systems and no-guest policy, as sufficient to meet in the chamber safely.\n\nColorado\n\nAspen: A ski county is asking prospective visitors to fill out an online traveler affidavit confirming they’ve tested negative for the coronavirus. The new rules for Pitkin County, home to Aspen Snowmass Ski Resort, take effect Dec. 14. Pitkin is the only county in the state currently planning to require visitors to be tested for the virus, KUSA-TV reports. Visitors must be symptom-free from COVID-19 for 10 days and receive a negative test result within 72 hours of arrival in the county. Visitors also have the option of quarantining for 10 days or until they receive a negative test result. Once people fill out the affidavit, they’ll receive a confirmation email. Visitors who violate the public health order could face a $5,000 fine. But ensuring compliance will be tricky, and there won’t be a lot of enforcement actions, said Tracy Trulove, Pitkin County public information officer for COVID-19 response.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed an order allowing the Connecticut Department of Labor to expand eligibility for a federal unemployment program to an estimated 38,000 additional recipients who were previously disqualified. Under the Democratic governor’s order, $7.5 million from the state’s unemployment trust fund will be used make sure residents who are unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and were previously disqualified from receiving the temporary, extra financial benefit receive at least $100 a week in unemployment benefits. That would then make them eligible retroactively for an additional $300 under the federal Lost Wages Assistance Program. “This is a temporary increase. It covers only the six weeks that the original program ran but is an important increase that allows those claimants to bring in potentially $1,800 each,” Labor Commissioner Kurt Westby said Friday.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Some school systems in the state have been announcing plans to go fully virtual in the wake of Gov. John Carney’s latest COVID-19 advisory. Carney recommended that schools pause in-person learning from Dec. 14 to Jan. 8 and resume hybrid learning Jan. 11. The Red Clay School District will be moving to virtual learning Monday. Red Clay is the state’s the largest district by population. Officials there said the district is facing “operational challenges … due to increased quarantines and spread in the community.” Smyrna also will begin virtual school Monday. Brandywine will wait until Dec. 14. Appoquinimink School District will move to virtual-only learning starting Monday. Superintendent Matthew Burrows said the district is facing staffing challenges and is “at a point where we don’t have people to cover classes as we move forward.” Over the past week, districts in Kent County made the decision to return to virtual learning. Some districts in New Castle County have done the same.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city set a new record Saturday for the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in a single day with 392, WUSA-TV reports. The news comes as the Centers for Disease Control has updated its guidance to help curb new coronavirus cases. The new guidance out Friday calls for universal mask use. For months the CDC has encouraged Americans to wear masks while in public spaces, but the new guidance asks people to put on masks while anywhere outside their homes. D.C. reported 392 new cases of the coronavirus Saturday and two new deaths. The district is now averaging 223 cases per day, up 36% from two weeks ago.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The state’s coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths have climbed dramatically over the past two months, and some epidemiologists fear those numbers could soon hit or exceed levels reached in the summer when the pandemic was at its peak. After a dramatic three-month decline that began in July, Florida’s confirmed cases began rising again in October, two weeks after Gov. Ron DeSantis removed nearly all capacity restrictions on restaurants, bars and other businesses and barred cities and counties from fining violators of local mask ordinances. The increase has not slowed since as Florida passed 1 million confirmed cases and 19,000 deaths last week. Epidemiologists Cindy Prins of the University of Florida and Jason Salemi of the University of South Florida said Friday that lifting the restrictions led some to stop taking proven and effective precautions like wearing masks and social distancing. Many people wanted to get back to normal. “You’re sick of doing all these things, you’re sick of COVID, and so I think you start to relax,” Salemi said. “When cases go down, people drop their guard.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s coronavirus infections are soaring above their worst peaks of the summer, pushing more people into hospitals and resulting in more deaths. Hitting a new single-day record of more than 6,000 suspected and confirmed infections Friday pushed Georgia’s rolling seven-day average to nearly 4,300. For the second straight day, the rolling average of confirmed and suspected infections was above the record average of confirmed infections of 3,745 set July 24. In July, the state wasn’t reporting suspected infections because few rapid antigen tests were being administered. But state Public Health Commissioner Kathleen Toomey has said Georgia treats both categories as an infection of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, as advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Deaths, which usually come after infections and hospitalization, are also rising. Georgia has now recorded 9,725 confirmed and suspected deaths, and at a current average of nearly 50 deaths a day, it could cross the 10,000-death mark sometime this week.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The acting state epidemiologist, Sarah Kemble, said the number of state contact tracers will shrink after the end of the year. Kemble told reporters the program is currently overstaffed and will downsize to match demand. The state Department of Health said it has 103 permanent staff, 194 contractors, 62 National Guardsmen and 32 volunteers conducting contact-tracing duties. The agency did not say exactly how many tracers would be let go. The health department had been criticized earlier in the pandemic for what critics said was a failure to build an adequate contact-tracing program, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Since then, Hawaii has hired hundreds of contact tracers, but many are now inactive, according to Kemble. “We’re in a really different place than we were back in the summer,” Kemble said. “We now have a much larger trained workforce. Hawaii is actually doing pretty well right now.” The number of cases in the state peaked during the summer and has stayed relatively consistent since October, according to health department data. Kemble left the door open to hiring more contact tracers if cases spike again.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Soldiers triaging patients in parking lots in a capital city is normally the stuff of science fiction. Yet that’s the reality in Boise, where troops direct people outside an urgent-care clinic revamped into a facility for coronavirus patients as infections and deaths surge in Idaho and nationwide. Inside Primary Health Medical Group’s clinic, physician assistant Nicole Thomas works extra 12-hour shifts to help out. She dons goggles, an N-95 mask, a surgical mask over that, gloves and a body covering to examine 36 patients a day with symptoms. Some days, she said, half of them test positive for the virus. “I’ve had patients crying in the car because they think they’re going to die,” Thomas said. In a conservative state where many are resisting pandemic restrictions, overworked staff are getting sick themselves or quitting to avoid the stress. And Idaho’s attempt to hold the coronavirus in check is failing, health officials say. Just over 1,000 people have died from COVID-19 so far, about four to five times the number of annual deaths from flu and pneumonia. Confirmed infections have surpassed 100,000. Elective surgeries mostly have been halted to conserve bed space and staff. COVID-19 patients have been sent home with monitoring devices to care for themselves.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The initial delivery of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 will be distributed among the 50 counties with the highest death rates per capita, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Friday as the coronavirus claimed an additional 148 lives in the state. Officials are expecting an opening shipment of 109,000 vaccine doses as early as mid-month. While hundreds of thousands more are expected in subsequent weeks, Pritzker said, he would not predict how long it would take to vaccinate those first in line. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the state public health director, reported 10,526 newly confirmed cases of the coronavirus. The 148 deaths comprised the eighth-highest single-day total during the pandemic. Fatalities have topped 100 on eight of the past 11 days. Illinois is following federal guidelines for distributing the vaccine, with health professionals and nursing home residents part of what’s called Phase 1a. “Some quick math will tell you that it’s going to take multiple weeks of distribution to even get our health care workers their first of the two doses that they require, while also getting to the long-term care facility residents,” Pritzker said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: As the state announces its preparations to begin coronavirus vaccinations for some 400,000 health care workers by the end of the month, the inoculation timeline for nursing home residents is still to be determined. Anyone who provides care to patients or is exposed to infectious materials will be the first in the state to be offered the vaccine, though it will not be required, said Dr. Lindsay Weaver, chief medical officer for the Indiana State Department of Health, during a webinar meeting Friday. That includes doctors, nurses, dentists, first responders, laboratory workers and medical students. During the first week or two of availability, Weaver said state officials anticipate they’ll have “a reduced amount” of vaccine on hand – only enough to cover about 15% of health care personnel in Indiana. Those who have tested positive for the virus in the previous 90 days are recommended to let others who have not tested positive get “closer to immunity” first, Weaver said, though the expectation is that those who were formally infected will still get the vaccine later, as well.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Another 17 people with COVID-19 have died in the state, and there have been an additional 1,869 confirmed cases, the state reported Sunday. The day earlier, the state reported 2,369 newly confirmed cases and 62 more deaths, of which 18 were members of Morningside Lutheran Church in Sioux City, the Sioux City Journal reports. The Rev. Tom LoVan, pastor of Morningside Lutheran, said many of the primarily immigrant worshippers at the church work at meat plants, where sometimes close working conditions have led to outbreaks across the country. “It was horrible. … There was a lot of fear,” LoVan said. Overall, though, Iowa’s numbers are trending downward. The state reported 16,206 new cases of coronavirus in the week ending Saturday, down 9.8% from the previous week, when 17,976 new cases were reported. The share of Iowa test results that came back positive was 39.6% in the latest week, compared with 40.2% in the week before, a USA TODAY Network analysis of COVID Tracking Project data shows.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state considers meatpacking plant workers and grocery store employees essential workers, putting them just behind health care workers and nursing home residents in the queue for coronavirus vaccines, Gov. Laura Kelly said Friday. The Democratic governor also said members of the Republican-controlled Legislature won’t get any special treatment. Individual lawmakers will get vaccinated at different times, based on the risk outside their political lives of being exposed to COVID-19 or developing serious complications once infected, she said. Kelly’s comments about vaccines came shortly before the state Department of Health and Environment reported record seven-day spikes in both COVID-19 deaths and coronavirus hospitalizations. Kansas’ vaccine plan calls for the first shots to go to front-line health care workers with a high risk of coronavirus exposure, including workers in nursing homes, as well as nursing home residents, Kelly said. In the second phase of distributing the vaccine, she said, the state will focus on essential workers, using definitions developed early in the pandemic.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear responded to a request by the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday by defending his suspension of in-person classes at public and private schools. The filing came days after Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron asked the nation’s highest court to strike down the Democratic governor’s ban on in-person classes, arguing that the rule violates the First Amendment rights of families that send their children to religious schools as an act of worship. But Beshear is adamant that the restriction is backed up by law, arguing that the suspension of in-person classes does not impose “tougher restrictions on a religious activity than a secular activity.” “We’re confident because we’re treating every school the same. We’re not picking on anybody,” Beshear said in an interview, contending that the orders are necessary to curb rising virus cases and to protect hospitals from an overflow of patients. The governor also noted that he is a deacon at his church and said his faith is “a critical part of who I am.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s treasurer is back home after being released from the hospital where he was being treated for complications related to COVID-19. John M. Schroder was released Friday night, his office said in a statement Saturday. “I’m feeling much better, and I want to thank the doctors and nurses who cared for me. Health care workers are the true heroes of this pandemic,” Schroder said. “Please continue to pray for all those battling this horrible disease.” Schroder was hospitalized Thursday after exhibiting respiratory symptoms. The Republican leader tested positive for the disease caused by the coronavirus shortly before Thanksgiving, Schroder spokesperson Michelle Millhollon said. Schroder, 59, is a former member of the state House of Representatives who has been in elected office as state treasurer since 2017.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said Friday that she is extending through Jan. 3 a requirement that some businesses close by 9 p.m. Mills initiated the policy prior to Thanksgiving and originally said it would apply to some businesses until Dec. 6. The rules apply to all outdoor and indoor entertainment venues, performing arts venues, casinos, movie theaters, and businesses that provide seated food and drink. That includes social clubs, restaurants, bars and tasting rooms. “It’s too early to know the impact of the Thanksgiving holiday on the spread of COVID-19 in Maine,” Mills said, “but with hundreds of people getting sick all across the state, and many more dying and so many receiving critical care in our overburdened hospitals, we cannot afford to let down our guard.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state has reported more than 3,000 cases of the coronavirus for the second straight day. Maryland reported Saturday that it had 3,193 confirmed COVID-19 cases over 24 hours. The state reported 3,792 cases Friday. That was the highest number of cases reported on a day in Maryland yet. The previous highest number had been 2,910 on Nov. 19. Hospitalizations went up by four people to 1,598. That includes 379 people in intensive care. Maryland’s highest number of COVID-19 hospitalizations was 1,711 on April 30. The state also reported 29 new deaths from the virus. Maryland has recorded a total of 4,659 deaths linked to COVID-19.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The top education official in the state is urging public school districts in its three largest cities to bring high-needs students back to the classroom for in-person learning. Jeffrey Riley, commissioner of elementary and secondary education, ordered the Boston, Worcester and Springfield school districts in letters released Friday to submit within 10 days their plans to bring students with disabilities and special needs back to school. “For these particularly vulnerable groups of students, it is vital to have a plan for providing in-person instruction as soon as possible,” Riley wrote. Unsatisfactory responses could spark an audit “to assess overall efforts to provide in-person instruction and to ensure your remote learning program is consistent with state and federal laws and regulations,” according to the letter. Boston is providing in-person learning for fewer than 200 students at four schools, representing less than 1% of the more than 51,000 students in the system. Springfield and Worcester do not currently have any in-person instruction, according to the state.\n\nMichigan\n\nHolland: The senior pastor of a church in western Michigan has encouraged his congregation to catch the coronavirus to “get it over with,” calling it “all good.” Bart Spencer made the statements during a Nov. 14 sermon at Lighthouse Baptist Church, The Holland Sentinel reports. “COVID, it’s all good,” Spencer said. “It’s OK. Get it, get it over with, press on.” More than 9,500 people in the state have died from the virus, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The sermon was posted on the church’s website and shared on Facebook, the newspaper reports. Spencer later told the paper he and several members of his family contracted the virus and have recovered. “It’s not fun,” he said. “I lost my sense of taste and smell, but my bout with the flu was worse.” Former Lighthouse Baptist member Miguel Medina said he posted the video clip of the sermon on Facebook. “I had no intention of posting, but I couldn’t believe what I just saw and heard,” Medina said in an email. The church has been holding services in person. Some attendees wear masks and social distance. Others don’t, according to the newspaper.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials on Sunday confirmed more than 5,550 new cases of the coronavirus and 64 new deaths from complications due to COVID-19. There were about 1,468 new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks in Minnesota, which now ranks second in the country behind South Dakota for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. One in every 136 people in Minnesota tested positive in the past week. Health care workers have accounted for 25,471 of the more than 350,000 positive tests, state data shows. The fatalities announced Sunday raised the state’s death toll to 2,637 since the start of the pandemic. The COVID Tracking Project ranks that as the 22nd highest in the country overall and the 28th highest per capita.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state reported another record-high day of new confirmed coronavirus cases Friday. The Department of Health said 2,480 new people have become infected with the virus, and 37 more people have died as of Thursday evening. Twenty-three of those deaths occurred between Nov. 26 and Dec. 3 and were recorded later using death certificates. Mississippi, with a population of about 3 million, has reported more than 161,516 coronavirus cases and at least 3,916 deaths from COVID-19. The numbers reported Friday were the highest the state has seen in a single day. The previous high was Wednesday, with 2,457 new cases. “The only thing more worrisome than the number is the trajectory,” the state health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, tweeted late Thursday. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba signed an executive order to close City Hall and many other city offices through Dec. 18 to try to slow the spread of the virus. The bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Mississippi, the Rt. Rev. Brian Seage, ordered all Episcopal churches in the state to temporarily stop in-person services.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Children’s hospitals have started treating adult patients as area hospitals struggle to keep up with rising coronavirus cases. Both St. Louis Children’s Hospital and SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children’s Hospital opened their doors to adults, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Staff at SSM Health and BJC Healthcare children’s hospitals have also started volunteering to work at other overwhelmed hospitals. St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson on Friday announced the city reopened a temporary morgue, the Post-Dispatch reports. Meanwhile, the St. Louis County health department shut down a fifth business for serving customers inside. The agency suspended Whalen’s Bar’s license for violating a public health order limiting indoor dining, according to the newspaper. The state health department on Saturday reported at least 19,223 new cases of the coronavirus in the past week, or about 2,746 new cases a day on average.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov.-elect Greg Gianforte hosted his first press conference since the election Friday, saying his focus when he takes office next month will be on keeping the most vulnerable safe while opening the state’s economy. Gianforte did not make any specific policy announcements but said addressing the COVID-19 pandemic will be his administration’s top priority once he takes office Jan. 4. The governor-elect has named a COVID-19 task force, composed of health care workers, business representatives, local government officials and others. The task force is expected to make recommendations to Gianforte in the coming weeks. Gianforte, a Republican, said he chooses to wear a mask and encourages other Montana residents to do so, NBC Montana reports. Gianforte did not outright say whether he would keep in place a mask mandate put in place by Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock that currently applies to all 56 of the state’s counties.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Residents of long-term care facilities could soon get in-person visits from relatives or friends under a new program designed to help them during the pandemic, state officials said Friday. The essential caregivers program will allow volunteers to go into nursing homes and other care facilities once they’ve been trained on how to properly don and doff protective clothing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The program was created as a workaround to restrictions that have kept most visitors out of Nebraska’s long-term care facilities since March. Gov. Pete Ricketts and other officials warned that facilities that choose to participate may not be opening their doors right away. The volunteers could also help ease the workload on a facility’s regular staff members, said Becky Wisell, an administrator with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. She said they’ll be able to advocate on a resident’s behalf and bring problems to the attention of staff members. They’ll also likely assist with simple tasks, such as helping residents get dressed and keeping them company.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Health officials in the state on Sunday reported 2,511 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 14 additional deaths and a record-high two-week positivity rate. The latest numbers pushed the state’s totals to 168,139 cases since the pandemic began, with 2,315 known deaths. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services officials said the state’s positivity rate calculated over a two-week period now is 21%. On Saturday, Nevada reported a record 3,194 cases with 29 deaths. It was only the second time the state had more than 3,000 additional cases on a single day. The previous time was 3,159 cases Nov. 25. Gov. Steve Sisolak noted the record-high number of additional cases and the state’s high COVID-19 positivity rate and urged Nevadans to stay home as much as possible, wear masks and avoid crowds. He said the outbreak is straining hospitals, and the state is “in the middle of our three-week statewide pause, and we cannot let our guard down against this virus now.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A GOP caucus meeting that resulted in at least four lawmakers testing positive for the coronavirus was “horribly managed,” but lawmakers, not public health officials, should have alerted Democrats, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said. Democrats learned of the Nov. 20 meeting held indoors at McIntyre ski area on Tuesday, the day before the Legislature was to be sworn in at the University of New Hampshire. Sununu said there was an open buffet at the caucus meeting, and “a lot” of the participants were not wearing masks or socially distancing. The Department of Health and Human Services conducted contact tracing to alert lawmakers who were in close contact with their infected colleagues, and a letter went out to the rest of the GOP members, Sununu said. Republican leaders should have also notified Democrats, he said. “It was badly managed from the beginning, and communication should’ve been much better,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: A Garden State restaurant that hosted a political gala put on by a New York Republican club was ordered temporarily closed Friday over potential violations of coronavirus guidelines. Photos and video posted on Twitter showed dozens of maskless partiers at the New York Young Republican Club event Thursday night in Jersey City, some of whom tweeted taunting messages to Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Among the attendees was U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, and conservative political activist James O’Keefe. Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, a Democrat, said in a statement that the event at the Maritime Parc restaurant in Liberty State Park was “an egregious violation” of state coronavirus guidelines and that he was ordering the restaurant temporarily closed. Gov. Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, criticized the group for holding the gala in New Jersey, saying at a news briefing Friday that they “snuck” into Jersey City because they couldn’t find a venue that would take them in New York City. He told Gaetz that “you are not welcome in New Jersey, and frankly I don’t ever want you back in this state.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Employers must continue reporting all coronavirus cases among their workers to the state, the New Mexico Environment Department announced Friday. The agency said it has adopted another emergency amendment to New Mexico’s workplace safety laws to extend the disclosure requirement, which was first implemented in August. Under the provision, employers have to notify the state within four hours of learning about a positive case. The department is seeking to make the requirement permanent through a formal rule-making effort. A virtual public hearing is scheduled for Dec. 18. Environment officials say any violations of the reporting rule may result in enforcement action by the state. The state Department of Health said it is expanding a partnership with Curative to expand testing locations in southeast New Mexico and the use of less invasive oral fluid tests.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The co-owner of a Staten Island bar that authorities said has been defying coronavirus restrictions was taken into custody early Sunday after running over a deputy with a car, authorities said. Danny Presti tried to drive away from Mac’s Public House as deputies were arresting him for serving patrons in violation of city and state closure orders, Sheriff Joseph Fucito said. Deputies attempted to arrest Presti as he left his bar early Sunday, but Presti got into his car, struck a deputy and kept driving for about 100 yards even as the deputy was left hanging onto the hood, Fucito said. Presti, 34, was eventually stopped and apprehended, the sheriff said. Charges against him were pending. The injured deputy was taken to a hospital for treatment of injuries. The tavern is in an area designated by Gov. Andrew Cuomo as an orange zone because of spiking COVID-19 rates and was not supposed to be serving customers indoors. But the owners had declared the bar an “autonomous zone,” a nod to protesters who claimed control over a Seattle neighborhood in June.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state has reported a new record high of coronavirus cases for the second day in a row. North Carolina reported 6,438 confirmed COVID-19 cases Sunday after adding 6,018 on Saturday. Cases have been rising significantly in the state in the past week. The state’s health secretary described the increases as “very worrisome” on Saturday. Dr. Mandy Cohen said state officials were looking at what further actions could be taken to save lives. “In less than a week, we went from exceeding 5,000 new cases reported in one day to exceeding 6,000,” Cohen said. “This is very worrisome. We are seeing our highest rates of tests that come back positive despite the fact we are doing a lot of testing. This indicates we have even more viral spread across our state right now.” North Carolina also has a record number of people in intensive care, Cohen said. A total of 5,516 North Carolinians have died from the virus, an increase of 49 since Friday, the health department said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Several days of falling positive tests for the coronavirus have dropped the state to fourth in the country for new cases per capita in the past two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. North Dakota had for many weeks led the country in the number of virus outbreaks compared to population. South Dakota now ranks first in the number of new cases per capita, according to data assembled Saturday. North Dakota health officials on Sunday reported 474 new virus cases, the lowest number in five days. A total of 82,504 people have tested positive since the start of the pandemic. The numbers follow a day when the state surpassed 1,000 total deaths from complications due to COVID-19. Officials confirmed six new deaths in the prior day. The update showed 305 people hospitalized with COVID-19, an increase of seven. The state’s hospital tracker reported 19 staffed intensive care unit beds and 242 staffed inpatient beds available across North Dakota.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Emergency medical responders, along with health care workers and others caring for COVID-19 patients, will be first in line for the state’s initial doses of the coronavirus vaccine, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Friday as he announced details about the vaccine distribution. Vulnerable people who live together and those who care for them, such as nursing home and assisted facility residents and staffers, will be next, DeWine said. To date, about 6 of every 10 deaths in Ohio have been in nursing homes. The state expects more than 650,000 in combined doses from Pfizer and Moderna by the end of December, the governor said. Among other people in group settings who are among the first to receive the vaccine are patients and staff at state psychiatric hospitals; people with intellectual disabilities and mental illness who live in group homes and their staff; and residents and staff at Ohio’s two veterans homes.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state health department is providing $5.8 million to continue free coronavirus testing through the end of the year. “As we enter the holiday season, we have been running an unprecedented number of COVID-19 tests for Oklahomans,” state health commissioner Dr. Lance Frye said in a statement. “We urge Oklahomans to continue to get tested, especially if you plan to travel or gather with anyone outside of your household during the holiday season.” Federal funding has been used to provide more than 2 million free tests statewide since the pandemic began, the health department said. There were 4,370 newly reported coronavirus cases Saturday, according to the state health department, and the seven-day rolling average of new cases has topped 3,000 per day. The increase is due largely to community spread, according to both the health department and Dr. Dale Bratzler of the University Oklahoma medical center.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Oregon Medical Board has indefinitely suspended the medical license of a doctor who said at a pro-Trump rally that he doesn’t wear a mask at his Dallas, Oregon, clinic and doesn’t require his staff to wear face coverings either. Dr. Steven LaTulippe also said at the Nov. 7 rally in Salem that he encourages others not to wear masks, according to KGW-TV. A state order requires health care workers to wear a mask in health care settings. State regulators voted late Thursday to suspend LaTulippe’s license immediately due to concerns about patient safety. The suspension prevents LaTulippe, who ran a family medicine clinic called South View Medical Arts, from practicing medicine anywhere in Oregon. “I and my staff, none of us, not once, wore a mask in my clinic,” he said, according to a Multnomah County Republican Party video of his speech, adding that people should “take off the mask of shame.” He has said publicly that he has treated about 80 patients for COVID-19 but incorrectly equated it to the “common cold.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A successful national COVID-19 vaccination effort hinges on states improving on their vaccination results for last year’s flu, a new report says, but Pennsylvania is in a better position than most. Looking at results for 2019 flu and 2009 swine flu vaccinations, researchers for The Commonwealth Fund wrote that “the story of past adult vaccination programs is not encouraging” when it comes to a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination rollout. Although the target for flu vaccinations is 70%, no state exceeded 51% last year, said Eric Schneider, the senior vice president for policy and research for The Commonwealth Fund and a co-author of the report. Pennsylvania, which the report said had 48% of residents vaccinated last year, was in the upper range of the country with 10 other states and Washington, D.C., while it is in the lower range of states ranked by coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents. On Friday, the state Department of Health reported a new daily record of newly confirmed cases with 11,763. The report also warned that there needs to be a concerted effort to promote a COVID-19 vaccination in black and Latino communities, which have historically lower rates of flu vaccinations.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s coronavirus numbers continue to head in the wrong direction, according to data released Friday. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from almost 884 on Nov. 19 to 1,033 on Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The state Department of Health on Friday reported 1,326 new positive tests from the previous day, out of nearly 14,500 tests, for a daily positivity rate of 9.2%. The latest seven-day average positivity rate in Rhode Island is 8.84% as of Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project – up from 6.2% two weeks ago. The state also reported 13 more virus-related deaths, for a total of 1,413 fatalities since the pandemic began. The good news is that there were 408 patients in the hospital with COVID-19 as of Wednesday, the latest day for which the information was available, down from 420 the previous day. Forty-five were in intensive care.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The number of new COVID-19 cases in the state is now greater than the levels South Carolina saw when it became one of the nation’s hot spots over the summer. More than 2,450 new COVID-19 cases were reported for three consecutive days. That’s more than any single day of new infections during the July peak of the coronavirus in the state. Saturday’s 2,715 new infections were the most reported on one day since the pandemic started in March, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. South Carolina reported 2,538 new cases Sunday and 2,470 on Friday. The seven-day average of new cases is now above 2,000 for the first time. South Carolina also reported 43 deaths Sunday from the coronavirus. The death rate is also climbing. Experts warned cases would rise after Thanksgiving. Several school districts are looking at cutting back on how much time students spend in physical classrooms.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials on Sunday reported 19 new deaths due to complications from COVID-19, lifting the total number of fatalities since the start of the pandemic to 1,110. The COVID Tracking Project reports that the state’s death count is the 38th highest in the country overall and the ninth highest per capita at about 124 deaths per 100,000 people. The state has reported 164 deaths in December. Health officials confirmed 687 positive tests in the past day, raising the total number to 85,991. There were about 1,484 new cases per 100,000 people in South Dakota over the past two weeks, which now ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. One in every 142 people in the state tested positive in the past week. Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 dropped by 15 on Sunday, to 497.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee has authorized medically trained National Guard members to fill nursing roles, drive ambulances and perform coronavirus testing for hospitals that have been increasingly overstretched on staffing while they care for a climbing number of coronavirus patients. The Republican’s executive order Friday allows the adjutant general to send hospitals reinforcements from the Tennessee National Guard. The state is focusing on members who are actively assigned – including those serving in coronavirus testing roles statewide – not those currently serving in civilian jobs in health care. The Tennessee National Guard currently has 353 people in COVID-19 testing roles, according to Guard spokesman Chris Messina. The state reported 2,485 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 in Tennessee, with 14% of floor beds and 8% of ICU beds still available. Tennessee reported another daily record in COVID-19 deaths Friday at 95, bringing the statewide total to at least 4,876.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State health officials on Friday moved nursing home residents to the front of the line for coronavirus vaccines after initially deciding that only health care workers would have access to the first round of doses that are expected to arrive this month. The reversal comes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week issued nonbinding guidance that called for putting nursing home residents first along with front-line medical staff. Advocacy groups have also pressed states to give nursing home residents first access to a vaccine, pointing to outbreaks that have spread through long-term care facilities since the start of the pandemic. The change was recommended by a state panel of health experts and lawmakers following the new guidance from the CDC, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said an initial round of 1.4 million vaccine doses is expected to arrive soon as Dec. 14.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: An investigation has begun into whether civil action or criminal charges should be filed against the organizers or attendees of a very large Halloween party. The Utah County Attorney’s Office said in a statement that the investigation will take at least a few more weeks. The Daily Herald reports videos of the event showed what looked like thousands of people partying together with music blaring and professional lighting throughout. Utah County Sheriff’s Office Public Information Officer Sgt. Spencer Cannon had said in November that the organizers of the event did not have a permit. The state reported a then-record 5,352 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus Nov. 14, two weeks after Halloween, according to state Department of Health data. After the party was shut down, Cannon said there were at least two minor car crashes, including one in which a vehicle landed on top of another vehicle. No injuries were reported from the accidents.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott on Friday urged Vermonters to take care of their mental health, seek help if needed and check in on others during the coronavirus pandemic, which Scott called “among the most stressful events” most people have endured in his lifetime. “It’s been so prolonged, and we don’t know when it will end,” he said at his biweekly virus briefing. “It’s forced us to be physically and emotionally separated from the people closest to us, those we typically rely on during challenging times.” Vermonters who are feeling COVID-19 fatigue, the loss of getting together with others, or the anxiety and pressure of a job loss or financial struggles are not alone, the Republican governor said. “These are reasonable, normal responses to a very abnormal event,” Scott said. He urged Vermonters to reach out to loved ones by phone, video, email or text to maintain connections regardless of whether they’re feeling these feelings and said resources are available for people struggling with mental health or substance misuse.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state has reported a record number of coronavirus cases for the second straight day. Virginia reported 3,880 cases Sunday morning. That compares to Saturday’s total of 3,793. Virginia has reported a total number of 255,053 virus cases. The state’s health department reports there have been 4,200 total deaths from the virus in Virginia. The state reported a 10.6% positivity rate, up from 10% on Saturday. The Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association says there are 1,490 people hospitalized in the state with confirmed cases of the virus. Of them, 395 were in intensive care.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: More than 1 million Washingtonians enabled a coronavirus exposure app in the first four days of the technology going live statewide. Officials with the state Department of Health said that as of Friday, the number of phones with the WA Notify app was more than 19% of the more than 5.8 million adults in the state. Last Monday, the state joined 18 states or U.S. territories that have already enlisted the use of smartphone technology in the effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The technology, created by Apple and Google, is in use in more than 30 countries. People with iPhones can enable the “exposure notifications” feature that is already in their phone’s settings, and Android devices can download the app, called WA Notify. Use of the app is voluntary, and users can opt out at any time. The statewide expansion comes after a monthlong pilot project used by 3,500 participants – including students, faculty and staff – at the University of Washington.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said the state expects to get its first doses of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine Dec. 15 if the shot receives emergency use authorization from federal regulators. The governor said the state’s initial allocation of 60,000 doses from Pfizer and 26,000 from Moderna will go to health care workers and people in long-term care centers. West Virginia has recorded 799 deaths linked to COVID-19, and 47% were of individuals in nursing homes or assisted living facilities, Justice said. “We got to get vaccinated quickly to stop this thing,” he said at a coronavirus news conference Friday. Justice said he had a more optimistic timeline than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for when most West Virginians can get a shot, predicting it may be as early as mid-March. First responders and essential workers remain higher on the priority list. “We’re the oldest state and we’re absolutely the most critically ill state in many ways,” Justice said. “So we’re pushing, I promise you, as hard as we possibly can” for the most doses as possible. Justice said he would take the vaccine, which requires two doses weeks apart, on camera.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state crossed the 400,000 mark in recorded COVID-19 cases Friday, adding nearly 4,900 positives in one day and 63 additional deaths. There have now been 404,555 positive cases in the state and 3,625 deaths. Gov. Tony Evers on Thursday cited high case counts in the state when making the argument with President Donald Trump’s administration to get $466 million to fight the virus and prioritize the state for vaccine distribution. Wisconsin is slated to receive 50,000 doses within weeks, but Evers wants enough to inoculate the state’s 450,000 health care workers. Evers is also urging Republicans who control the Legislature to act quickly on virus-related bills, but Senate Republicans have said they won’t return until January. Over the past two weeks, the state’s rolling average number of daily new cases has decreased by 41%.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A state Department of Health official involved in Wyoming’s response to the coronavirus questioned the legitimacy of the pandemic and described a forthcoming vaccine as a biological weapon at a recent event. The “so-called pandemic” and efforts to develop a vaccine are plots by Russia and China to spread communism worldwide, department readiness and countermeasures manager Igor Shepherd said at the Nov. 10 event held by the group Keep Colorado Free and Open. Shepherd was introduced as and talked about being a Wyoming Department of Health employee. Shepherd’s baseless and unsubstantiated claims undermined Wyoming’s public health measures – and public exhortations – to limit spread of the virus, as well as its plans to distribute COVID-19 vaccines in the months ahead. Even so, Wyoming officials including Gov. Mark Gordon, who at a recent news conference called people not taking the virus seriously “knuckleheads,” declined to comment. Shepherd has worked for the health department since 2013 and has been a part of the state’s team responding to COVID-19, though not in a leadership role, department spokeswoman Kim Deti said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/07"}]}

(AP) — The Latest on NASCAR media day for the Daytona 500 (all times local):\n\n3 p.m.\n\nJimmie Johnson has a lofty goal for the Boston Marathon: completing the grueling, 26.2-mile course in less than three hours.\n\nThe seven-time Cup Series champion plans to run the April 15 marathon two days after a 400-mile NASCAR race at Richmond Raceway. And he doesn't expect it to be just a Monday stroll.\n\n\"As long as I stay healthy and I can keep that (training) volume up, I think I'll have the kind of day I want to have,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe 43-year-old Johnson, an avid cyclist and fitness freak, has never attempted a marathon. He ran 22 miles once and has run 20 miles every Monday for the last five weeks. Attempting the Boston Marathon hadn't even been an option until NASCAR's schedule changed this year.\n\nIt first caught his eye in 2013, the year of the bombings.\n\n\"I was watching the race on television and recognized it was on a Monday and thought, 'Man, I can do that,'\" Johnson said. \"I can only imagine how special the following year would have been with 'Boston Strong.'\n\n\"I was convinced I was going to do it. But the NASCAR schedule comes out, schedule changes, it's Sunday Bristol, Monday Boston, and I'm like, 'There's no way. I can maybe limp my way through it, but there's just no way. So I've been watching ever since, wondering if and when the NASCAR schedule would change and it did this year.\"\n\nSo Johnson already has started training. He's running 70 miles a week and hopes to extend that to 90 to 100 miles a week by late March.\n\nHe also teamed with sports drink Gatorade to help prepare him.\n\nJohnson spent Tuesday \"treating my body like it was a race car, what lubricants it needs, what fuel it needs and all the particulars that go with it. I feel like I have a good plan coming together. As long as I stay healthy.\"\n\nAs for \"Heartbreak Hill,\" the infamous incline about 20 miles into the race that poses a daunting challenge for even the most experienced runners?\n\n\"I'm trying to ignore it until I have to meet her in person,\" Johnson said.\n\n___\n\n2 p.m.\n\nRyan Newman would relish the opportunity to drive the Oscar Mayer wienermobile.\n\nOscar Mayer is Newman's primary sponsor this season on the No. 6 Ford for Roush Fenway Racing. Newman wore a yellow and orange firesuit and was grilled on his desire to take a spin in Oscar Mayer's famed 27-foot-long hot dogs on wheels.\n\n\"I would do it, yes,\" Newman said. \"I don't think anybody's 'Dukes of Hazzard' jumped the Oscar Mayer wienermobile.\"\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nPaul Menard says he talked with Jimmie Johnson and hashed out the late-race wreck that cost Menard a win in the exhibition Clash.\n\nJohnson triggered a wreck that wiped out nearly the entire 20-car field when he dipped low and tried to side-draft Menard as they battled for the lead. Johnson turned Menard, starting a massive chain-reaction behind him. Johnson zipped past Menard and won the rain-shortened race.\n\n\"Jimmie did what he did to try to win. It was not intentional,\" Menard said.\n\nMenard declined to discuss many specifics of the conversation, saying he was ready to \"move on\" from the incident.\n\n\"What's done is done. Looking into the rearview mirror on that one,\" Menard said.\n\nNot everyone was ready to let it go. Fellow driver Corey LaJoie joked that he might have a better shot in the season opener \"if Jimmie can take out another 20 cars on Sunday.\"\n\n___\n\n1 p.m.\n\nCorey LaJoie believes he's got the best beard in the Cup Series.\n\nIt's about to get national exposure.\n\nLaJoie's face and beard are featured on the front of his No. 32 Ford for Speedweeks.\n\n\"I was against it at first,\" LaJoie said at Daytona 500 media day Wednesday. \"But Old Spice had an idea what they wanted to do and they ran with it. They only gave us the one option. There was no A, B and C options.\n\n\"It was, 'Your face is going on the car with what's going to look like hair down the (side) of the car because we're pushing our dry shampoo and deal with it.' I was like, 'Fine, right?' But as soon as we put that thing out, it's just taking traction like no other, way more than anybody expected.\"\n\nThere have been jokes, memes and plenty of puns since the paint scheme made its debut at Daytona last week.\n\n___\n\n12:50 p.m.\n\nKyle Busch says he's deep into negotiations on a contract extension with Joe Gibbs Racing.\n\nBusch has driven the No. 18 Toyota for Gibbs since 2008 and is in a contract year with the organization. He was surprised Wednesday to learn his contract status was public knowledge but indicated he's not truly a free agent.\n\n\"We're in discussions right now, we are talking. It's all been agreed to,\" Busch said. \"It's just a matter of putting pen to paper. We're all good.\"\n\nBusch has won 47 Cup races with Gibbs and the 2015 championship. He's raced for the title in each of the last four seasons.\n\n___\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nJohnny Sauter has salvaged his 2019 season roughly a month after it fell apart with no notice.\n\nSauter lost his ride with GMS Racing in January when the team decided to instead use reigning Truck Series champion Brett Moffitt.\n\nThe decision blindsided Sauter, who won six races for GMS last season and finished fourth in the championship finale. Sauter won the Truck Series championship in 2016, has not finished lower than fourth the last six seasons and won 13 times for GMS.\n\nSauter finally put together a new job right before he had to report to Daytona International Speedway. He will drive again this season for ThorSport Racing, where raced from 2009 until he joined GMS in 2016.\n\n\"I'm returning home,\" Sauter said. \"I couldn't be more proud of going back there and running for a championship.\"\n\nThorSport is expanding to four full-time Truck entries with Sauter. He'll be teammates with Matt Crafton, Ben Rhodes, Myatt Snider and Grant Enfinger. Snider will drive in select races for the team.\n\nSauter arrived in Daytona three days before the Truck Series season opening race Friday night.\n\n___\n\n11 a.m.\n\nCasey Mears will have a paint scheme for the Daytona 500 .Mears secured one of the open spots for Sunday's race when he qualified in an all-black No. 27 Chevrolet. Without a guaranteed spot in the field, Germain Racing was unable to sign a primary sponsor in time for qualifying.\n\nStill wearing a plain, black fire suit, Mears at least had a Rim Ryderz hat on his lap.\n\n\"They literally handed me this hat when I walked through the door,\" Mears said at Daytona 500 media day. \"I'm learning as I go. It looks like a pretty cool company.\"\n\nThe company makes skateboard rims.\n\nMears, who has one career Cup win in 488 starts, said he had no other races scheduled for this season. He was second in the 2006 Daytona 500.\n\nMears is running a second entry for Germain in a car built in collaboration with Premium Motorsports. He was one of the six drivers vying for four open spots in NASCAR's season opener.\n\n___\n\n10:45 a.m.\n\nRoss Chastain, a watermelon farmer from Florida and aspiring race car driver, had accepted he'd likely always be a journeyman driving for back-marker teams that had little chance of winning races.\n\nThen a chance encounter with a potential sponsor changed Chastain's life.\n\nChastain was spotted washing a motorhome between practices by the head of DC Solar, and the chairman was fascinated to learn that was how Chastain earned additional money needed to fund his racing dreams. Jeff Carpoff was adamant he wanted to sponsor Chastain and paid for Chastain to drive a handful of Xfinity Series races for Chip Ganassi Racing.\n\nChastain won in his second start in Ganassi's equipment and by November he had a full-time Xfinity ride with Ganassi funded by DC Solar.\n\nThe joy from his long-awaited break was short-lived. Federal investigators raided DC Solar's headquarters in December and the Carpoffs have been radio silent since. Ganassi has shuttered the Xfinity team, and Chastain was looking for work roughly a month before the season began.\n\n\"I am not driving the race car I thought I would be, but there are thousands of people whose lives got turned upside down and when I can't sleep at night it is because of that,\" Chastain said. \"A lot of people who have had to find new jobs.\"\n\n___\n\n10:30 a.m.\n\nDenny Hamlin is dedicating this NASCAR season to the memory of Joe Gibbs Racing co-founder J.D. Gibbs.\n\nThe eldest son of team owner and Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Joe Gibbs died in January at age 49. J.D. Gibbs discovered Hamlin at a late-model test at Hickory Motor Speedway in North Carolina in the early 2000s.\n\nHamlin's charity is donating $111 to the J.D. Gibbs Legacy Fund for each lap he leads in the No. 11 Toyota in 2019. Hamlin also hopes to dedicate a victory to Gibbs, preferably at Daytona.\n\n\"It'll be super important,\" Hamlin said. \"Obviously, everyone knows how important he was for me and my career and everything he did for us. Certainly having success on track will be crucial for that. Now that I pledged $111 for every lap we lead, it's going to be important for me to get up front and be up front often.\"\n\nHamlin's career high for laps lead is 1,380 in 2009.\n\nGibbs died from complications following a long battle with a degenerative neurological disease. It was revealed in 2015 that he was dealing with \"conditions related to brain function.\" He was serving as president of JGR at the time.\n\n___\n\n10 a.m.\n\nDaniel Hemric hopes his surprise run in time trials for the Daytona 500 is just one of many highlights in his rookie season.\n\nHemric advanced into the final round of single-car qualifying and landed fifth on the timing stand — behind only Hendrick Motorsports' four-car sweep.\n\nHemric will make his Cup Series debut in Sunday's season-opening race and use the biggest stage to introduce himself as a throwback of NASCAR's earliest stars. Hemric grew up in Kannapolis, North Carolina, home of the Earnhardt family and he grew up rooting for the late Dale Earnhardt.\n\nHis big break came with Richard Childress Racing, Earnhardt's old team, and his car number is from a sacred stash that isn't given to just any driver. Hemric will drive the No. 8 Chevrolet, used before by Earnhardt family patriarch Ralph Earnhardt and later Dale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nEarnhardt Sr. drove the No. 3 Chevrolet, and Childress brought that number back for his grandson, Austin Dillon. Dillon drove the No. 3 to victory in last year's Daytona 500.\n\n\"It's a huge sense of pride to be from Kannapolis and also a sense of pride in our race shop, when guys realize where I come from, where I've been and how I got to this point, it puts a pep in everybody's step,\" Hemric said. \"It's the American dream of how a guy can get to this level, and I'm pumped up to carry the flag for Kannapolis and have a shot to build something incredible.\"\n\n___\n\n9 a.m.\n\nJoey Logano no longer feels like the NASCAR Cup Series champion.\n\nEven though he thinks it's cool that people call him \"champ,\" he says he and his Team Penske crew need to turn the page and start looking toward the new season.\n\n\"That was last year,\" Logano said Wednesday at Daytona International Speedway. \"One of my favorite Roger Penske's quotes is, 'Don't trip over your press clippings.' That's last year and we need to keep looking forward because right now we're past champions in my eyes. As soon as we unloaded down here, the championship fun is over and it's back to trying to win another one. We're back at zero with everyone else.\"\n\nHe finished third in the exhibition Clash on Sunday and was back at the track three days later for Daytona 500 media day.\n\nThe 28-year-old Logano won his first Cup championship in November at Homestead-Miami Speedway, beating out fellow title contenders Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and Martin Truex Jr.\n\nLogano will try to become the first defending series champion to win the Daytona 500 since Dale Jarrett in 2000.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/business-food/taco-bell-breakfast-menu-strategy/index.html", "title": "Taco Bell is enlisting Pete Davidson to help apologize for its ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTaco Bell is apologizing for its breakfast menu.\n\nIn recent years, it has been littered with questionable foods, such as the Naked Egg Taco or even the Waffle Taco, that have since been discontinued. Turns out, people just want the basics and the chain is finally accepting that. Now, the company is releasing a new ad campaign that includes with an apology of sorts for its past behavior, along with a promise that it won’t go that crazy again.\n\n“We honestly over-innovated in breakfast,” admitted Sean Tresvant, Taco Bell’s chief brand officer, in an exclusive interview. “When you look at today’s consumer and the [fast food] breakfast business, it’s about familiarity and it’s about comfort.”\n\nTaco Bell has been focusing on those two things. Since it was brought back last year after a brief pandemic-induced pause, its breakfast menu has been filled with unique items without going overboard compared to past creations.\n\nTaco Bell hires Pete Davidson to help apologize. Taco Bell\n\nCurrently, the menu features breakfast-themed takes on its popular afternoon and evening foods, such as breakfast burritos, quesadillas and crunchwraps all stuffed with eggs, cheese and meats.\n\nAs a result, breakfast sales have surpassed its 2019 sales levels, Tresvant said, adding that “slow and steady wins the race and in breakfast, you have to be consistent.” Breakfast makes up about 6% of its sales, the chain has previously said.\n\nTo help promote breakfast, Taco Bell has enlisted Pete Davidson, a comedian best known for a stint on “Saturday Night Live” that Tresvant said “probably took it a little bit too far sometimes,” similar to how the chain went a “little too far on breakfast.” Tresvant said it was a “great partnership” because Davidson is a fans of the chain and appeals to Taco Bell’s younger customer base.\n\nTwo 30-second TV ads featuring Davidson will be released this month and run until December 24. In one cheeky spot, Davidson walks into a Taco Bell says “Sometimes, we go too far. I have, and that’s why Taco Bell has hired me to make an apology for them.” The other ad shows Davidson waking up from a dream thinking about the chain’s breakfast.\n\nBattle for breakfast\n\nAlthough Taco Bell isn’t making any changes to its breakfast menu, its competitors have adjusted their own. In recent weeks, Wendy’s added french toast sticks, McDonald’s (MCD) is selling a new cheese danish and Tim Horton’s has a new waffle sandwich on its US menus.\n\nBolstering breakfast is a smart business decision: A recent report from research firm NDP Group revealed that business for mornings has remained steady in the second quarter of 2022, while other parts of day (including lunch and dinner) declined in the midst of rising menu prices.\n\nAccording to new research from GlobalData, breakfast is also entering a resurgence because of people are resuming their pre-pandemic routines of returning to the office.\n\n“With such a large portion of the population regularly making a commute, it is unsurprising that breakfast sales have remained steady,” said Hannah Cleland, a food service analyst at GlobalData, in a recent note. “Consumer spending habits in response to the cost-of-living crisis have been nuanced, but it is clear that a small breakfast treat is still being incorporated into many people’s budgets.”", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}]}

Seated at a black grand piano in the Crimson Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, the Princess of Wales smiled as she performed, clad in a one-shoulder, bright blue gown, her skirt pooling on the red carpet. She wore her hair long in loose waves, accessorized with sparkling, dangling earrings.\n\nThe opening film, shot earlier this month, showed Kalush Orchestra singing and dancing in the Kyiv subway, with the tune picked up by musicians in the U.K., including Kate.

Competitors each have three minutes to meld catchy tunes and eye-popping spectacle into performances capable of winning the hearts of millions of viewers.\n\nAbout 6,000 fans watched the show inside the arena, and tens of thousands more at big-screen events across the U.K. The global television audience has been estimated at 160 million.\n\nFounded in 1956, Eurovision is a European cultural institution that has produced breakout stars − ABBA, Celine Dion and Måneskin are past winners − alongside performers whose careers sank without a trace.\n\nContributing: Kim Willis and Brian Truitt, USA TODAY, and Jill Lawless, The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/14/entertainment/eurovision-2022-preview-ukraine-saturday-intl-scli-cmd/index.html", "title": "Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra the favorite to win Eurovision Song ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nIt tells you plenty about the Eurovision Song Contest that Norway’s participants – two grown men in wolf costumes who sing about bananas and the imminent consumption of their grandparents – are flying relatively under the radar this year.\n\nThe continent’s garish and much-loved singing competition returns in Turin, Italy on Saturday, but only one group is commanding the spotlight in the build-up: Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra.\n\nThe folk-rap group are runaway favorites in the betting markets and their presence at the tournament has captured the imagination of fans from every competing country.\n\n“As we speak, our country and our culture is under threat. But we want to show that we are alive, Ukrainian culture is alive, it is unique, diverse, and beautiful,” Oleg Psyuk, the band’s front man, told CNN.\n\nKalush Orchestra performing during rehearsals. Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“This is our way to be useful to our country,” he said.\n\nAt first sight, the six-piece group seem to slot in comfortably with dozens of their more eccentric Eurovision brethren.\n\nMost members wear elaborate national dress, with rapper Psyuk also sporting a pink bucket hat. One member is so submerged by patterned embroidery that only his mouth is visible, while the group’s double bassist comes dressed as a ball of yarn.\n\nBut getting Kalush Orchestra to the Eurovision stage took some doing, and their journey is deeply interwoven with the war at home.\n\nThe band initially finished second in Ukraine’s national selection competition, but they were elevated after it emerged the winner had previously traveled to Russian-annexed Crimea. They were unveiled as the country’s entry on February 22, two days before Russian troops invaded Ukraine.\n\n“All members of the group are somehow involved in the defense of the country,” Psyuk told CNN via email.\n\nA member of the team’s media team joined the territorial defense and is fighting on the front line, leaving the group shorthanded in Turin. Psyuk, meanwhile, volunteers to find internally displaced Ukrainians shelter and organizes the transportation of food and medicines.\n\nThe backdrop of conflict complicated preparations for Eurovision. The group were forced to rehearse virtually until they were finally able to meet in Lviv after weeks of war.\n\nAnd their song has taken on new meaning. “Stefania,” sung in Ukrainian, is a tribute to Psyuk’s mother, who still lives in the western city of Kalush from which the band takes its name. “On some days there are rockets flying over people’s houses and it is like a lottery – no one knows where it will hit,” Psyuk told CNN.\n\nOrganizers banned Russia from the contest in February, 24 hours after an initial, widely criticized decision to allow it to take part. The European Broadcasting Union concluded that the country’s presence “would bring the competition into disrepute.”\n\nBelarus, which aided Moscow’s invasion, had already been suspended due to the suppression of media freedom in the country.\n\nKalush, meanwhile, sailed through Tuesday’s semifinal and elicited wild cheers from the crowd when they came onstage. Eurovision is notoriously difficult to predict, given its point system relies both on jury verdicts and public voting from dozens of countries, but Kalush seem a safe bet to take this year’s crown.\n\nA Ukrainian victory would mean the country had the right to host next year’s contest – but it is far from certain that such an event would be possible in Ukraine next May.\n\nPsyuk, though, is optimistic. “We believe in our song … it has become a song about the motherland,” he said.\n\n“If it turns out that we will win, Eurovision 2023 will be held in Ukraine. In a new, integral Ukraine … a rebuilt, prosperous, happy country.”\n\nNorway's electro duo Subwoolfer will be facing off with Ukraine and dozens of other hopefuls. Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe frontrunners\n\nKalush Orchestra are joining a typically ragtag group of national competitors at this year’s contest, and while they are the clear favorites to triumph, a number of other artists have managed to get Europe talking in the build-up.\n\nItaly could clinch the crown for a second consecutive year if hometown heroes Mahmood and Blanco deliver. Both are successful artists in the country; now they’re joining forces to emulate Maneskin, the punk rockers who won in an upset last year.\n\nSubwoolfer, Norway’s enigmatic electro duo, have also attracted buzz with their entry “Give That Wolf a Banana.”\n\nThe pair claim they were formed on the moon 4.5 billion years ago and never remove their yellow canine masks. They most closely resemble a TikTok-ified Daft Punk, had the legendary French pair hired David Lynch as their artistic director and hit the kids’ parties circuit.\n\nLess “out there” are entries from Sweden, Poland and Greece – all three have brought ballads to the table that are sure to interest the national juries.\n\nAnd here are some words this seasoned Eurovision reporter never thought he’d type: The United Kingdom might win this year.\n\nThat’s right – the nation that has, in the past decade, sent what remains of Bonnie Tyler and Engelbert Humperdinck to compete with Europe’s up-and-comers has reluctantly accepted that modernity is not just a passing fad, turning to a TikTok sensation in a play for Europe’s under-65 demographic.\n\nSam Ryder’s “Space Man” is an unusually strong British entry that takes inspiration from Elton John and Ziggy Stardust-era Bowie, and some bookmakers give only Ukraine better odds to win.\n\nBut the track relies heavily on the remarkable vocal acrobatics that helped Ryder go viral during the early days of the pandemic – so he can’t afford an off-night if he’s to break the UK’s 25-year Eurovision curse.\n\nThe best (and worst) of the rest\n\nItaly is hoping to put on a show on Saturday night, to mark the first post-Covid Eurovision in front of a full audience. The 2020 edition was canceled, and last year’s took place with crowd restrictions.\n\nThat competition marked the release of two years’ worth of suppressed weirdness, and the tone of this contest is somewhat more traditional by comparison. But this is still Eurovision, and it is still weird – so casual viewers tuning in exclusively to shake their heads and tut won’t be let down.\n\nAlready eliminated are Latvia, whose environmentally conscious anthem “Eat Your Salad” began with the line “I don’t eat meat, I eat veggies and p*ssy.” Organizers unsurprisingly asked them to skip over the feline allusions, and in doing so wiped away the song’s only interesting feature.\n\nKonstrakta opines on the importance of hydration to the hair of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Stefano Guidi/Getty Images\n\nSerbia’s Konstrakta begins her entry, “In Corpore Sano,” with the question keeping us all up at night: “What could be the secret of Meghan Markle’s healthy hair?” Then she sort of just … keeps going with that theme. “What could it be?” Konstrakta sings in her native tongue. “I think it’s all about the deep hydration.”\n\nLast year, the landlocked micronation of San Marino inexplicably included Flo Rida in their song, and then forced the bemused rapper to sit and watch as the people of Europe successively shrugged at his waning star power, dumping the country to a fourth-from-bottom finish.\n\nThis year, Achille Lauro – a man who takes his stage name from a famously hijacked cruise ship – picks up the mantle for the smallest country in the competition. With a tattooed, androgynous aesthetic and lyrics that liken his heart to a sex toy, Lauro is probably the bad boy of Eurovision 2022. (Though he’s still got a way to go to beat last year’s winners, who were ultimately cleared of taking cocaine on air following a viral video that sparked an investigation by organizers.)\n\nOther long shots worth your time include Stefan, Estonia’s answer to Johnny Cash. He’s played up the Western theme in his music video, and though his Eastwoodian credentials extend about as far as being able to wear a poncho and stare somberly into the middle distance, his throaty vocals and catchy chorus could trouble the frontrunners.\n\nAlbanian entrant Ronela Hajati arrives for the contest's opening ceremony. MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd then there are party-crashers Australia. Initially invited in 2015 to mark the show’s 60th anniversary, Australia continue to rock up each year, boxed wine in hand, awkwardly laughing along at Europe’s inside jokes and hoping to clinch a victory for the hardcore fans who wake up in the early hours to watch the show back home.\n\nTo be fair to Australia, they give it their all – and this year’s competitor Sheldon Riley’s aptly named track “Not the Same” is expected to turn in a respectable finish.\n\nAnd the popularity of Eurovision in the southern hemisphere is testament to its growing strength, even in its seventh decade.\n\nA US knock-off – something called the “American Song Contest,” which Europeans look at with the same suspicious scowl they wear when handling own-brand mayonnaise in a discount store – recently concluded stateside, and a 2020 Netflix film starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams introduced new demographics to the feverishly followed competition.\n\nEurovision, for all its oddities, maintains a special place in the cultural calendar. But winning would be uniquely significant for Kalush Orchestra, and it’s hard to imagine a more popular victor in the tournament’s history.\n\n“For us, the victory would mean appreciation of Ukrainian music, its uniqueness and beauty,” Psyuk told CNN. “The victory would also lift the spirit of Ukrainian people, who (have) not had any break (for) joy for more than two months.”\n\nEurovision airs at 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET) on Saturday, and it’s available on Peacock for US viewers.\n\nCNN’s Xiaofei Xu contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/05/14/5-things-you-need-know-this-weekend/84135512/", "title": "5 things you need to know this weekend", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFor the first time, Europe's over-the-top Eurovision finale to air in U.S.\n\nOutlandish costumes, bizarre lyrics, political controversy and the occasional decent song can mean only one thing: the 2016 Eurovision Song Contest is here.

So it is perhaps fitting that, in coronavirus times, nothing will be happening on Saturday at the scheduled venue of the Ahoy Hall in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam.\n\nIn 1974, it was ABBA that ushered in a new era for the once-staid and conservative song contest; in 2020, it is another acronym, COVID-19, and everyone hopes its reign will be brief.\n\nDespite the cancellation of the contest that’s wildly popular in Europe and beyond, the evening of Saturday’s finale will bring some respite for diehards, with a remote television show bringing to over 40 nations many of the artists who normally would have been vying for a career-changing victory.\n\n“We’re, like, 41 people that are all in some kind of weird little club that didn’t, like — the Eurovision that never was,” said British entry James Newman.\n\nBelgian Eurovision expert Peter Van de Veire feels particularly sorry for Iceland’s Dadi Freyr, and his quirky and danceable “Think About Things.”\n\n“Iceland had a top song and it could well have won, had the contest gone ahead. They might have had something of a global hit. That won’t be so now,” he said.\n\nThe satisfaction now, is all internet driven, and Freyr should still have lots of it.\n\n“I never expected that it would be as much as it is. Like, now on TikTok, there are, like, 44,000 videos using the song,” he said.\n\nTikTok is a far cry from 1956, when Eurovision set up the first contest in which countries from across Europe — and a few from beyond it — compete for the continent’s musical crown, seeking votes from all participating countries.\n\nThe contest started in the black-and-white era of television, in real, chandelier-hung palaces, and reflected all too long its staid origins with sugary-sweet ballads or corny upbeat songs. Meanwhile, outside its bubble, Woodstock, the Rolling Stones and The Doors were titillating the youth of yore.\n\nThen came 1974, and with it a sea change. Almost half a century later, you may cringe at the glittery outfits if you want, but never underestimate the impact it had. The ABBA song “Waterloo” proved to be anything but a crushing defeat for the competition itself.\n\nIt launched the Swedish foursome as a superband of the seventies, and allowed people to dream that at Eurovision, anything could happen.\n\nAnd really it did. Somehow, it became a vector of camp and kitsch. Perhaps because acts can be expected to be in such addictively bad taste, nowadays almost 200 million viewers tune in for the finale. The concept of “guilty pleasure” could have been invented for Eurovision.\n\nEven more surprising than ABBA’s victory, if not quite as artistic, was the win in 2006 for Lordi, a Finnish heavy metal band that will always be remembered for its monster masks and post-apocalyptic outfits.\n\nThe Eurovision contest became much more than that, though, and has become a symbol for sexual rights and, sometimes, a cesspool of politics.\n\nIt has increasingly developed a gay following, especially after the breakthrough victory of transgender Israeli singer Dana International in 1998. It also has its conservative critics, and rarely more so than when bearded Austrian drag queen Conchita Wurst won in 2014.\n\n“There are al lot of extrovert and colorful figures that compete and that has been embraced by a part of the LGBT community. But it has been a lot more important that people like Dana International and Conchita Wurst have been able to make clear statements,” said Van de Veire.\n\nMore:Netherlands singer Duncan Laurence wins Eurovision song contest in Tel Aviv\n\nMore:Madonna sparks controversy at 'non-political' Eurovision with her flag display\n\nPolitics has also butted in. Sometimes the voting is perceived to push for or deny victory to certain nations, always grist for the rumor mill, but never proven.\n\nIt took a much more serious turn when Ukrainian singer Jamala won the 2016 edition with “1944,” about the deportation of Crimean Tatars under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, which could also be interpreted as an allusion to the situation in Russia-annexed Crimea under Vladimir Putin.\n\nThere won’t be any such issues this Saturday, when the Eurovision broadcast will seek to honor each and all of the competitors, and still keep a surprise element.\n\nBritish

of a fifth title in six seasons.\n\n“Every time we win a game we’re a bit closer but Chelsea (May 21) and Brighton (May 24) will be tough games,” Guardiola said. “Now we know two wins from the last three games will be enough.”\n\nIn fact, now just one win is necessary after Arsenal later conceded second-half goals from Julio Enciso, Deniz Undav and Pervis Estupinan at Emirates Stadium to leave City three points away from lifting the Premier League trophy.\n\nA win against Chelsea would secure the title.\n\nDefeat for Everton, meanwhile, leaves the Merseyside club just one point above the relegation zone and in a desperate fight for survival after 69 years in the top flight.\n\nIf Leicester beats Liverpool on Monday, Everton would drop into the bottom three with two games to play.\n\n“We just need to get it over the line, that’s the priority, not Manchester City,” Everton manager Sean Dyche said.\n\nFew expected Everton to cause an upset against City, even after its shock 5-1 win against Brighton on Monday.\n\nAnd despite holding the visitors for a long period of the first half, the game was effectively settled inside two minutes before the break.\n\nGundogan fired City ahead with a moment of improvisation that seemed to come from nothing in the 37th minute.\n\nWith his back to goal, the Germany international controlled Riyad Mahrez’ cross from the right with one touch before flicking a shot over his shoulder and past Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.\n\nTwo minutes later City’s lead was doubled, with Gundogan the provider this time when crossing for Haaland to head in a second goal.\n\nIt was only the Norway striker's third touch of the match to that point.\n\nGundogan struck his second after the break with a curling free kick from the edge of the area to continue his outstanding campaign.\n\nWhile Haaland's goal-scoring feats has earned him the majority of the praise this season, and saw him named Footballer of the Year on Friday, Gundogan has been a key part of City's three-pronged trophy pursuit of the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup.\n\nGundogan's two goals at Goodison came after his double against Leeds last week and took his total for the season to nine in all competitions.\n\nHe is widely expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires and has been strongly linked with a move to Barcelona.\n\nThat would leave Guardiola with a hole to fill in his midfield, with one potential replacement, Jude Bellingham, reportedly closing in on a transfer to Real Madrid.\n\nCity's attentions will now turn to Madrid, with the teams playing each other in the second leg of the Champions League semifinals on Wednesday.\n\nWith that game finely poised at 1-1 after the first game in Madrid, Guardiola was concerned about the impact the Eurovision Song Contest would have on his preparations for that match.\n\nHe would have preferred the Everton game to be played a day earlier to give his players more rest time, but said the staging of Eurovision in Liverpool on Saturday had meant that was impossible.\n\nIt mattered little to the outcome of this game, with City a comfortable winner in the end, but it remains to be seen what effect it will have on the performance against Madrid.\n\n___\n\nJames Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer:

A source familiar with the dinner confirmed to CNN that Trump on Tuesday met with Fuentes and West, who became engulfed in controversy after repeating antisemitic conspiracy theories and making other offensive claims during an appearance on a podcast in October.\n\nThe source said that Fuentes was a guest of West, who attended the dinner along with Karen Giorno, who ran Trump’s 2016 Florida campaign, and another unidentified man. The group feasted on a Thanksgiving dinner for roughly two hours at Trump’s outdoor patio table.\n\nTrump was engaged with Fuentes and found him “very interesting,” the source said, particularly Fuentes’ abilities to rattle off statistics and data, and his familiarity with Trump world.\n\nDuring the dinner, Fuentes told Trump that he was familiar with “Trump’s base,” which preferred Trump being natural and himself, speaking off the cuff and ad-libbing. Trump said that his advisers don’t like that, and want him reading from the teleprompter.\n\nAt one point during the dinner, Trump declared that he “liked” Fuentes.\n\nGOP governor calls Trump's dinner with a Holocaust denier and Kanye West 'very troubling' 02:21 - Source: CNN\n\nAccording to the source, the dinner grew tense at various times, including after West asked Trump to join his 2024 campaign ticket for president as vice president, which Trump “laughed off.” The source could not pinpoint the exact moment the former president’s mood shifted.\n\nTrump acknowledged the dinner in a post on Truth Social Friday stating: “This past week, Kanye West called me to have dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Shortly thereafter, he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about. We had dinner on Tuesday evening with many members present on the back patio. The dinner was quick and uneventful. They then left for the airport.”\n\nTrump repeated later Friday that he “didn’t know” Fuentes and had offered West business as well as political advice.\n\n“I told him he should definitely not run for President, ‘any voters you may have should vote for TRUMP,’” the former president wrote on Truth Social. “Anyway, we got along great, he expressed no anti-Semitism, & I appreciated all of the nice things he said about me on ‘Tucker Carlson.’”\n\nThe White House on Friday condemned Fuentes’ appearance at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFormer GOP lawmaker identifies 'larger problem' after Trump's dinner 02:15 - Source: CNN\n\n“Bigotry, hate, and antisemitism have absolutely no place in America - including at Mar-A-Lago. Holocaust denial is repugnant and dangerous, and it must be forcefully condemned,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to CNN.\n\nDavid Friedman, Trump’s former Ambassador to Israel, also condemned the former president’s association with West and Fuentes.\n\n“To my friend Donald Trump, you are better than this. Even a social visit from an antisemite like Kanye West and human scum like Nick Fuentes is unacceptable. I urge you to throw those bums out, disavow them and relegate them to the dustbin of history where they belong,” he said in a pair of tweets Friday afternoon. “Antisemites deserve no quarter among American leaders, right or left.”\n\nKanye West's Hitler 'obsession' helped create hostile work environment, source says 03:25 - Source: CNN\n\nWest’s recent antisemitic remarks caused companies that he was affiliated with – including Adidas and Balenciaga – to sever their relationships with him. He has made numerous inflammatory statements over the years, including assertions that slavery was a “choice” and “racism is a dated concept.”\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League has identified Fuentes as a White supremacist and he has been banned from most major social media platforms for his White nationalist rhetoric. Fuentes was present on the grounds of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and he has promoted Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about fraud in the 2020 election. The House select committee investigating the events of January 6 issued a subpoena to Fuentes in January.\n\nWest tweeted late Tuesday night that he had kept Trump waiting during his first visit to Mar-a-Lago due to rain and traffic. And Right Wing Watch, a project of the left-leaning group People for the American Way, posted Tuesday footage of West and Fuentes walking through the Miami airport together. That footage was included in the video West posted on Twitter.\n\nThis story has been updated with new reporting about the dinner.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston Kristen Holmes", "Maeve Reston", "Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/politics/hunter-biden-investigation-critical-juncture/index.html", "title": "Federal investigation of Hunter Biden reaches critical juncture ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s business activities is nearing a critical juncture as investigators weigh possible charges and prosecutors confront Justice Department guidelines to generally avoid bringing politically sensitive cases close to an election, according to people briefed on the matter.\n\nWhile no final decision has been made on whether to bring charges against President Joe Biden’s son, sources say the probe has intensified in recent months along with discussions among Delaware-based prosecutors, investigators running the probe and officials at Justice Department headquarters.\n\nDavid Weiss, the US Attorney in Delaware, is leading the probe, which dates back to as early as 2018.\n\nDiscussions recently have centered around possibly bringing charges that could include alleged tax violations and making a false statement in connection with Biden’s purchase of a firearm at a time he would have been prohibited from doing so because of his acknowledged struggles with drug addiction.\n\nThe investigation of the President’s son has loomed large among the politically fraught issues Merrick Garland faces as attorney general. Weiss is one of a handful of appointees of former President Donald Trump who were kept on by the Biden administration because they were overseeing politically sensitive investigations.\n\nAdding to the pressure, Republicans in Congress have already announced that if they take over the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, they plan to launch new investigations and hold hearings to examine the conduct of Hunter Biden and others in the Biden family.\n\nAlso potentially in play are Justice Department guidelines governing politically sensitive investigations during an election year. Current and former Justice Department officials say there is an unwritten rule that prosecutors avoid bringing politically sensitive cases within 60 days of an election.\n\nSome current and former Justice officials have debated whether the rules necessarily apply in this instance since Joe Biden isn’t on the ballot in the midterms.\n\nA lawyer for Hunter Biden declined to comment. The US Attorney’s Office in Delaware declined to comment.\n\nHunter Biden has not been charged with any crimes and has previously denied any wrongdoing. His father is not being investigated as part of the probe of his son’s business activities, according to sources who have been briefed.\n\nNarrowing the focus\n\nThe Justice Department investigation initially focused on Hunter Biden’s financial and business activities in foreign countries dating to when Joe Biden was vice president. But investigators have examined a swath of broader conduct, including whether Hunter Biden and associates violated money laundering, campaign finance, tax and foreign lobbying laws, as well as whether Hunter Biden broke federal firearm and other regulations, multiple sources said.\n\nAs the investigation has entered its final stages, prosecutors have narrowed their focus to tax and gun-related charges, the people say.\n\nJustice officials have debated the strength of the case for months, and have held discussions about whether more work is needed before deciding on possible charges. Those discussions have involved investigators from the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation agency and prosecutors in Delaware and at Justice Department headquarters, CNN previously reported.\n\nHunter Biden has publicly discussed his own substance abuse struggles, and some Justice officials questioned whether his open discussions of his past drug use could potentially weaken their case should they bring one.\n\nSome officials have noted that Biden could argue he wasn’t aware of wrongdoing because he was on drugs, one source said. CNN has previously reported that some officials were concerned it could be a defense, but more recently, Justice officials have coalesced around the view that Biden’s own public accounts of his recovery show he was fully responsible for actions now under scrutiny, according to the person familiar with the discussions.\n\nIn the meetings, officials also discussed the timing of any possible indictment given the sensitivity of bringing a politically connected case close to an election, another person said.\n\nJustice Department memoranda advise prosecutors against bringing any cases or taking any overt investigative steps with the purpose of impacting an election or providing an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate.\n\nGarland issued a memo in May to prosecutors reiterating the department’s stance on election year sensitivities. The memo is one attorneys general send every election year, and generally advises prosecutors about avoiding making major investigative or charging decisions near an election to avoid the perception of partisan motives.\n\nIn 2018, the last year of congressional midterm elections, prosecutors with the US attorney’s office in Manhattan charged two politically sensitive cases in August: one against Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, and another against Chris Collins, then a Republican congressman and early Trump supporter who was up for reelection that year.\n\nIn both cases, prosecutors made their charging decisions with the elections in mind, people familiar with the cases said.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty that August to campaign finance, tax and other charges and completed a three-year prison sentence. Collins, who won his reelection while under indictment, later pleaded guilty and resigned his seat. Collins was sentenced to 26 months in prison but only served two months after he was pardoned by former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump Justice officials pushed back on a request by New York prosecutors to execute a search warrant on Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s personal attorneys, during the months around the 2020 election.

There’s a growing range of probes into his lies, with CNN reporting Wednesday night that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating his finances and local prosecutors are “looking into” his fabrications.\n\nThose falsehoods – several more of which CNN’s KFile uncovered on Wednesday – combined with Santos’ defiance and Republican leadership’s silence are setting up the GOP for a fraught first week in power.\n\nGOP leadership hasn’t even acknowledged the controversy, which is leading to fears among some of Santos’ fellow incoming congressmen from the Empire State that his issues could overshadow Republicans’ ascent to power.\n\n“Attempts to blame others or minimize his actions are only making things worse and a complete distraction from the task at hand,” Rep.-elect Mike Lawler said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n“New Yorkers deserve the truth and House Republicans deserve an opportunity to govern without this distraction,” said Rep.-elect Nick LaLota, who was elected to a Long Island district, in a statement Tuesday in which he called for an ethics investigation “and, if necessary, law enforcement” involvement.\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who has not returned CNN’s requests for comment about Santos, has been focused on trying to secure the votes for the speakership next month. That task became harder after Republicans won a narrower majority than he had hoped, a slim margin that will empower the conference’s most extreme members. Asking Santos to step down could cost him a vote in his already tenuous quest to reach 218.\n\nBut by not addressing the New York Republican’s lies, McCarthy may risk looking like he’s not in control of his party before ever taking the speaker’s gavel.\n\nAnalysis: Why a decades-old federal law could be Santos' undoing 01:40 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutors ‘looking into’ Santos’ lies as more false claims emerge\n\nHouse Republicans’ path to the majority this year ran through New York, which was a bright spot for the party in an otherwise disappointing midterm performance. While falling short of their anticipated “red wave,” the GOP flipped four Democratic seats in the Empire State – one of which was the 3rd District that Santos carried by about 8 points.\n\nIt emerged on Wednesday that he made even more false claims about his family history, work history and education, according to a KFile review of statements made in his 2022 and 2020 congressional campaigns. Santos has not responded to CNN’s repeated requests for comment.\n\nSantos admitted to the New York Post on Monday that he didn’t “graduate from any institution of higher learning,” despite his biography at times listing an education at Baruch College and New York University. He also admitted that he never worked directly for the financial firms Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, as he has previously suggested, but claimed that he did do work for them through his company, telling the Post it was a “poor choice of words” to say he worked for them.\n\nThe Nassau County district attorney’s office said Wednesday it is “looking into” the fabrications.\n\n“No one is above the law and if a crime was committed in this county, we will prosecute it,” District Attorney Anne Donnelly, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nProsecutors in the US attorney’s office in the Eastern District of New York are investigating Santos’ finances, a source familiar with the matter told CNN later Wednesday. Santos has faced questions over his wealth and loans totaling more than $700,000 he made to his successful 2022 campaign.\n\nSantos told Semafor on Wednesday that he made his money through “capital introduction” and “deal making” for “high net worth individuals.” CBS News first reported the probe and the US attorney’s office declined to comment.\n\nHe lost to Santos. Hear him weigh in on his opponent's lies 02:46 - Source: CNN\n\nRepublicans condemn Santos but leadership’s silence is deafening\n\nThe condemnations from three incoming House Republicans – all of whom won in competitive territory – look like an effort to distance themselves from a troubled neighbor, while implicitly trying to pave the way for leadership to speak up. The claims from Santos that have earned the sharpest rebuke have been those about his proclaimed Jewish identity.\n\nSantos said in an appearance on a Fox News digital show in February that his maternal grandparents changed their Jewish last name from Zabrovsky – a claim for which there is no evidence and that records contradict, KFile reported on Wednesday.\n\nThat followed last week’s KFile revelations that Santos’ claims that his grandparents “survived the Holocaust” as Ukrainian Jewish refugees from Belgium who changed their surname are contradicted by sources including family trees compiled by genealogy websites, records on Jewish refugees and interviews with multiple genealogists.\n\nHis explanation has quickly become the source of mockery.\n\n“I never claimed to be Jewish,” Santos told the New York Post. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background, I said I was ‘Jew-ish.’”\n\nAnd yet, Santos described himself as a “proud American Jew” in a document shared with Jewish groups during the campaign, which was first reported by the Forward and confirmed by CNN this week.\n\nThe backlash came swiftly from local corners of the GOP and quickly went to larger influential groups.\n\n“I am deeply disappointed in Mr. Santos, and I expected more than just a blanket apology,” Nassau County GOP Chair Joseph G. Cairo, Jr., said in a statement Tuesday. “The damage that his lies have caused to many people, especially those who have been impacted by the Holocaust, are profound.”\n\n“His fabrications regarding the Holocaust and his family’s history are particularly hurtful,” Rep.-elect Anthony D’Esposito of New York added in his own statement.\n\nAnd Matt Brooks, the CEO of the Republican Jewish Coalition – a powerful player in GOP national politics – said on Tuesday that Santos had “deceived us” and “will not be welcome at any future RJC event.”\n\nBut a week and a half after the initial revelations, most Republicans currently serving in the House are quiet, at least publicly.\n\nWith Congress out of session for the holidays, reporters can’t catch lawmakers in hallways of the Capitol. But they’ll be back next week, and it’s only a matter of time before members face pointed questions.\n\nOne member speaking up for Santos is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene – not necessarily the defender that a New York Republican, whose district voted for President Joe Biden by 8 points in 2020, probably wants in his corner.\n\n“I think we Republicans should give George Santos a chance and see how he legislates and votes, not treat him the same as the left is,” the Georgia Republican wrote on Twitter.\n\nWhen Greene was stripped of her committee assignments early last year, in the wake of incendiary and violent past statements that had recently been unearthed, it was the Democratic-controlled House (along with 11 Republicans) who made that happen – not GOP leadership. And once again, leadership seems to be looking past the problem.\n\n'Did I embellish my resume? Yes I did': GOP Rep.-elect speaks out about lying 01:04 - Source: CNN\n\nTrumpian tactics\n\nSantos brought this upon himself – and yet, like the former president who still wields major influence over the House GOP, he seems eager to deflect responsibility. At one point, he has even tried to explain away his actions by casting himself as a victim of America’s elites.\n\nIn a bizarre interview with City and State on Monday, he spoke about having “the weight of the world” on his shoulders over the past week as news organizations have pored over his background. He then said “elitists” had looked down on him for working in customer service, seeming to suggest that’s why he omitted that experience and fabricated others on his resume.\n\nAlthough there’s no evidence he’s ever been convicted of a crime, Santos has tried to obfuscate on the issue. He was charged with embezzlement in a Brazilian court, as the New York Times first reported last week and CNN confirmed on Wednesday, according to case records from the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice. Court records from 2013, however, state that the charge was archived after court summons went unanswered and they were unable to locate Santos.\n\n“I am not a criminal here – not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world,” Santos told the Post on Monday.\n\nIn another classic Trump move, he pivoted to attacking Biden and Democrats in a Tuesday interview on Fox’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight” when the guest host, former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, pressed him on the meaning of “integrity” and asked, “Do you have no shame?”\n\nBut in trying to defend the discrepancies in his record, Santos then made a statement that Gabbard seized on for the way it could offend the everyday Americans he claims to have so much affinity for.\n\n“We can have this discussion that’s going to go way above the American people’s head, but that’s not what I campaigned on,” Santos said.\n\nAs Gabbard rightly pointed out in that interview, he’s not the only politician – from either party – whose background, as they’ve presented it, has received scrutiny. Santos is clearly leaning into the unpopularity of the institution he’s planning to join as he tries to defend his record.\n\n“I challenge all 434 members of Congress, aside myself, in the House, to go through the same litany test I just went through last week,” he told City and State. “Open yourselves up to the media. Let them dig deep and pull in your deepest secrets. If we did that, we wouldn’t have a single congressman in the House. And I bet you, we wouldn’t have a single senator in the Senate.”\n\nJust 22% of Americans approved of Congress in Gallup’s latest survey this fall. Santos claims his policy work is what will matter, but so far, he – and his party’s leadership – aren’t doing much to bring up those numbers.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/politics/trump-bad-week-analysis/index.html", "title": "Trump's bad week is bad news for his comeback | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s bad week is bad news for his comeback.\n\nHis family business was convicted Tuesday of criminal tax fraud. On the same day, his hand-picked candidate lost a winnable Senate race in a red state. The House January 6 committee has decided to make criminal referrals to the Justice Department – possibly of him or his close associates. And his call to terminate the Constitution has once again backed Republicans into a corner.\n\nHear how Pence reacted to Trump's call to terminate Constitution 04:42 - Source: CNN\n\nSo many premature political obituaries have been written for Trump that it would be foolish to write him off as he embarks on his third consecutive White House bid.\n\nBut it’s getting more and more difficult to figure out how the man who rewrote the American political playbook can come back from weeks like this.\n\n“I think Georgia, after this midterm, after what happened in 2020, may be remembered as the state that finally broke Donald Trump,” senior CNN political commentator Scott Jennings, a Republican, said after CNN projected that Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock would win a full six-year term.\n\nJennings is no Trump fan, but he is an astute follower of GOP politics.\n\n“Losing Georgia in the presidential election, losing the Senate race, this is not a state Republicans ought to be losing,” he said.\n\nEx-Trump White House official says Trump is liable for Walker's loss 01:21 - Source: CNN\n\nWalker’s loss, despite a massive infusion of cash from Republicans in Washington and the borrowed ground game of recently reelected Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, a Trump antagonist, provided another painful reminder for Republicans that their general election losses come when election deniers and Trump allies face general election voters.\n\n“Every Republican in this country ought to hold Donald Trump accountable for this,” said Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who noted that the difference between Walker and the Georgia Republicans who won statewide office this year was Trump’s involvement. He said the party must pivot to stay competitive.\n\nConviction by jury vs. witch hunt\n\nTrump will dismiss all setbacks as part of the “witch hunt,” but that may be a harder catchall to use against a jury of peers than of public officials.\n\nAnd it’s more difficult to say the case against his companies is flawed when it’s built on the testimony of the former chief financial officer he worked with for decades.\n\nThe Trump Organization was found guilty on all charges, which stemmed from a years-long scheme in which prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said generous perks and benefits were paid to Trump employees but not reported to tax authorities as income.\n\nNeither Trump nor his family were personally charged in this case. But Trump and three of his children face a separate civil suit brought by the New York attorney general that’s not likely to go to trial until next October.\n\nMany shades of scrutiny\n\nThe scrutiny New York authorities applied to Trump’s company’s finances has yielded these tax fraud convictions.\n\nAn even larger question racing to its conclusion is whether the scrutiny applied by the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack and the Department of Justice will lead to federal criminal charges for his effort to overturn the 2020 election and his role inspiring US Capitol rioters.\n\nThe January 6 committee can recommend that the Justice department bring charges against Trump or his allies and CNN has reported that members on the panel have been in wide agreement that Trump and some of his closest associates committed a crime by pushing a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBut the committee, which includes outgoing Republican Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, has been split over what to do.\n\nWhat kind of criminal referrals?\n\nCommittee chair Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said Tuesday the members would issue criminal referrals, but did not elaborate, saying the panel has not narrowed down the universe of individuals who may be referred.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the committee went so far as to appoint a subcommittee of members to assess “how to present evidence of possible obstruction, possible perjury and possible witness tampering as well as potential criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, according to multiple sources familiar with the committee’s work.”\n\nA criminal referral by the committee, which could come in conjunction with its much anticipated final report and just before an incoming GOP House majority shuts the inquiry down, could help focus a sprawling Department of Justice investigation into the effort to overturn the election and the riot.\n\n“We know the committee has really been ahead of the Justice Department,” CNN’s Jamie Gangel said Tuesday, noting the Justice Department has sought testimony and evidence gathered by the January 6 committee.\n\nHelping alleged rioters\n\nInstead of focusing on the next election, Trump continues to fixate on his 2020 loss.\n\nAmong his few appearances since announcing a 2024 run is an effort, by video, to help raise money for a group that helps people put on trial by the government for joining the Capitol riot.\n\nTrump’s obsession with his 2020 loss continues to motivate his public statements and is complicating his plan to consolidate power in the party and clear anticipated GOP primary challengers out of his path.\n\nCall to terminate the Constitution is not catching on\n\nThe bizarre call in a post on his Twitter-like Truth Social platform to terminate laws and the Constitution in favor of a 2020 re-do continues to reverberate in a party whose rhetoric is often built around fidelity to the nation’s hallowed founding documents.\n\n“It would be pretty hard to be sworn in to the presidency if you’re not willing to uphold the Constitution,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nThere’s little surprise in the Kentucky Republican’s criticism of Trump. But the dodges of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy are more telling.\n\nA split in the GOP\n\nMcCarthy’s mission impossible is to find 218 votes from 222 House Republicans to gain the speaker’s gavel when the full chamber votes in January.\n\nHis problem is that the far right of the party – the roughly 40 Trump-aligned Freedom Caucus members – want assurances he’ll adopt a damn-the-torpeodes approach to using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip in government funding. He needs their support and is having trouble getting it.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the California Republican only said, “I fully support the Constitution,” when asked about Trump’s call.\n\nOther top Republicans were caught off-guard when asked by CNN about the comments.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise, the No. 2 Republican in the House and a possible fill-in if McCarthy can’t get the support among Republicans to become speaker, said he doesn’t support terminating the Constitution when Trump’s comments were read to him.\n\n“Next to the Bible, it’s the most important document in the history of the world,” the Louisiana Republican said, refusing to comment on whether the former president should move on from election denialism.\n\nScalise and McCarthy are relatively mainstream Republicans and Trump’s recent taste in company has veered more extreme, such when he dined with the White Nationalist Nick Fuentes and the antisemitic rapper Kanye West, now known as Ye.\n\nThat was last week’s controversy. But this week is off to just as bad a start.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

By mid-summer, he built a lead in national polls, and despite a deluge of inflammatory statements in the months since, nothing has derailed his front-runner status in the GOP race.\n\nNow, with just seven weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, here's a look back, week by week, at some of the memorable developments in Trump's campaign thus far.\n\nWeek 1: Not your average announcement speech\n\nAfter a history of past flirtations with a presidential bid, Trump officially throws his hat into the ring for the GOP nomination on June 16. His rambling announcement speech at Trump Tower in New York draws the most attention for his comments on Mexican immigrants:\n\n“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. …. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"\n\nWeek 2: Trump dumped\n\nOn June 25, Spanish-language network Univision dumps Trump's Miss Universe pageant in response to his comments on Mexican immigrants.\n\nWeek 3: More ties cut\n\nTrump tries to clarify his remarks on CNN's State of the Union on June 28:\n\n\"I like Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I do business with the Mexican people. But you have people coming through the border that are from all over. And they're bad. They're really bad.\"\n\nThe fallout continues on June 29, when NBC/Universal cuts off its business relationship with Trump. The next day, Trump sues Univision for $500 million over its decision to drop its telecast of the Miss USA pageant.\n\nOn July 1, Trump's menswear collection at Macy's becomes the latest casualty of his immigration comments.\n\nWeek 4: Big beautiful wall\n\nOn July 8 and 9, celebrity chefs José Andrés and Geoffrey Zakarian back out of deals to open restaurants in Trump’s new D.C. hotel.\n\nTrump takes his immigration message to Phoenix on July 11, telling the crowd:\n\n\"I respect Mexico greatly as a country, but the problem we have is that their leaders are much smarter, sharper and more cunning than our leaders, and they're killing us at the border.\"\n\nHe repeats his vow to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border — paid for by Mexico — and says as president he would charge Mexico $100,000 for every undocumented immigrant who crossed the border.\n\nWeek 5: 'I like people that weren't captured'\n\nLindsey Graham tells CNN's State of the Union on July 12 that Trump is a \"wrecking ball for the future of the Republican Party with the Hispanic community and we need to push back.\"\n\nOn July 14, a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll shows Trump atop the crowded GOP presidential field, though he fares the worst among the top seven GOP candidates in head-to-head matchups with Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn July 17, Trump says the Marines killed in the previous day's shooting at a military facility in Chattanooga, Tenn., “never had a chance” and called for an end to gun-free zones.\n\nThe Huffington Post announces its coverage of Trump will be handled by its entertainment section and not its politics team.\n\nThe week is capped off with the most attention-grabbing moment of the campaign so far: Trump's comments on Sen. John McCain at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa:\n\n\"He's not a war hero — he's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured.\"\n\nWeek 6: 'The best way to win is to win as a Republican'\n\nTrump refuses to apologize to McCain on the day after his \"war hero\" remarks, amid criticism from his 2016 rivals. He further slams the senator in an op-ed in USA TODAY:\n\n\"The reality is that John McCain the politician has made America less safe, sent our brave soldiers into wrong-headed foreign adventures, covered up for President Obama with the VA scandal and has spent most of his time in the Senate pushing amnesty.\"\n\nAn ABC News/Washington Post poll released July 20 gives Trump a double-digit lead over his GOP rivals, though most of the survey was conducted before the McCain flap.\n\nOn July 21, Graham tells CBS that Trump should \"stop being a jackass.\" Later that day, Trump gives out Graham's cellphone number while speaking at a town hall in Graham’s home state of South Carolina. (Graham later destroys his phone.)\n\nTrump outlines his billions in personal financial disclosure forms released July 22, with 92 pages of documents detailing his income, assets and liabilities.\n\nOn July 23, Trump makes a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border, where he said he supports legal immigration.\n\nHe makes an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on July 24 and addresses the possibility of a third-party bid:\n\n\"The best way to win is to win as a Republican. I do not want to do independent at all. Now if I'm treated poorly, that's one thing. If I'm treated well and with great respect and don't win, I would not do that. But if I'm treated poorly, I will do it.\"\n\nWeek 7: Trump's supporters stick with him\n\nDespite a tumultuous week following the McCain flap, Trump still sits atop the GOP field in polls released July 26.\n\nA Monmouth University Poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters released July 28 shows Trump topping fellow Republicans, with 24% compared with Jeb Bush's 12%. In a national Quinnipiac Poll released July 30, Trump again leads the GOP field, but he also tops the “no way” list, with 30% of Republican voters saying they definitely wouldn't support him.\n\nWeek 8: 'Blood coming out of her wherever'\n\nAs anticipation mounts for the first Republican debate, Trump's campaign grapples with a report of a racially charged Facebook post by one of its advisers. On Aug. 2, his campaign announces it is parting ways with Sam Nunberg.\n\nAs the debate nears, Trump downplays expectations, telling CBS' Face the Nation, “I don’t stand up and debate like these politicians.” Meanwhile, he holds on to a commanding lead in polls.\n\nOn Aug. 6, Trump and the other nine candidates who ranked in the top 10 of polls meet at last in the Fox News debate. In the debate's opening moments, Trump signals that he won't rule out an independent bid. Trump seems to perform well enough in his first-ever debate to maintain his front-runner status, though his remarks regarding women prove controversial in the days ahead.\n\nThe next night, Trump continues his withering criticism of debate moderator Megyn Kelly:\n\n\"Well, I just don’t respect her as a journalist. I don’t think she’s very good. I think she’s highly overrated … She starts asking me all sorts of ridiculous questions, and you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever. She was, in my opinion, she was off-base.\"\n\nThough Trump denied the implication he was referencing Kelly's menstruation cycle, critics pounced, including RedState Gathering organizer Erick Erickson, who disinvited Trump from addressing the Atlanta event.\n\nWeek 9: 'I said nothing wrong whatsoever'\n\nTrump declines to apologize for his comments about Fox's Kelly. He tells CNN's State of the Union, “I said nothing wrong whatsoever\" in one of several Sunday show appearances on Aug. 9. He also appears on NBC, CBS and ABC, but not Fox. He makes a return to Fox News two days later.\n\nHe makes his first public appearance since the debate on Aug. 11 in Michigan and discusses immigration, China, the military, Obamacare and his Republican opponents.\n\nTrump continues to lead polls in Iowa and New Hampshire despite the controversy stemming from his debate comments.\n\nHe makes a grand entrance at the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 15, landing near the fairgrounds via helicopter.\n\nWeek 10: 'The greatest wall that you've ever seen'\n\nTrump releases his immigration plan on Aug. 16, centered on three \"core principles\":\n\n1. A nation without borders is not a nation. There must be a wall across the southern border. 2. A nation without laws is not a nation. Laws passed in accordance with our Constitutional system of government must be enforced. 3. A nation that does not serve its own citizens is not a nation. Any immigration plan must improve jobs, wages and security for all Americans.\n\nHe sees no loss of momentum in polling, garnering 24% support among GOP registered voters in a CNN/ORC poll released Aug. 18, with Bush being the only other candidate to hit double digits in the nationwide poll.\n\nHe holds a town hall in Derry, N.H., on Aug. 19, at around the same time Bush holds a town hall in nearby Merrimack. In discussing immigration, he pledges to “build the greatest wall that you’ve ever seen ... If they call it the Trump Wall, it has to be beautiful.”\n\nTrump's Aug. 21 rally in Mobile, Ala., is moved from a hotel ballroom to a local football stadium to accommodate crowds.\n\nWeek 11: 'Go back to Univision'\n\nTrump continues his attacks on Kelly on Aug. 24, as she returned to her show after a family vacation. Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes fires back the next day, calling on Trump to apologize.\n\nIn an Iowa news conference on Aug. 26, Trump has Univision anchor Jorge Ramos booted out by security. Ramos had tried to ask Trump questions about immigration, and Trump insisted he hadn't called on Ramos yet.\n\nTrump: Excuse me. Sit down. You weren't called. Sit down. Ramos: No, no, no... Trump: Sit down. Sit down. Go ahead. Ramos: I have the right to ask a question. Trump: No, you don't. You haven't been called. Ramos: I have the right to ask a question. Trump: Go back to Univision.\n\nThe atmosphere is lighter at an Aug. 27 news conference in South Carolina, highlighted by Trump asking a supporter to touch his hair to quash rumors that he wears a toupee.\n\nThe week is capped off with strong polling for Trump in Iowa, which follows polls from earlier in the week showing Trump leading nationally and in South Carolina.\n\nWeek 12: The loyalty pledge\n\nThere's more good Iowa polling news for Trump to start off the week, though Ben Carson is emerging as a challenger to his lead.\n\nBush launches his defense against Trump's comments that he is \"low energy,\" ripping Trump as a \"germophobe\" in a Sept. 2 \"candidate quiz\" that also compares his record to Trump's more liberal positions in the past. In a Sept. 3 interview on ABC’s Good Morning America, Bush says, “I think Donald Trump is trying to insult his way to the presidency, and it’s not going to work.\"\n\nBut the biggest news of the week following Bush vs. Trump is Trump's signing of the GOP loyalty pledge, in which he promises to back the Republican presidential nominee if it is not him:\n\n\"I have no intention of changing my mind. I see no circumstances under which I would tear up that pledge.\"\n\nLeading into Labor Day weekend, Trump botches his answers to foreign policy questions during a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt; he accuses Hewitt of \"gotcha\" questioning.\n\nWeek 13: 'Look at that face!'\n\nTrump hits the nation's capital on Sept. 9, joining fellow candidate Ted Cruz and Tea Party supporters to denounce the Iran nuclear deal. \"We are led by very, very stupid people,\" he tells the crowd.\n\nLater that day, in a moment that rivals his comments on McCain and Kelly, Rolling Stone pubilshes an article that describes Trump mocking fellow candidate Carly Fiorina’s looks.\n\n\"When the anchor throws to Carly Fiorina for her reaction to Trump’s momentum, Trump’s expression sours in schoolboy disgust as the camera bores in on Fiorina. ‘Look at that face!’ he cries. ‘Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!’ \"\n\nHe defends his comments in a Thursday morning phone-in interview on Fox & Friends:\n\n“Probably I did say something like that about Carly — I’m talking about persona, I’m not talking not about looks. … When I get criticized constantly about my hair, nobody does a story about ‘Oh, isn’t that terrible, they criticized Donald Trump’s hair.’ ”\n\nHe hits a new polling high of 32% in a CNN/ORC poll released Sept. 10; additional polls that week show him leading in Iowa, with Carson as the only other candidate hitting double digits.\n\nTrump caps off the week with an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, discussing potential vice-presidential picks, Clinton's emails and his \"beautiful wall,\" among other topics.\n\nWeek 14: 'No-win situation'\n\nA CBS News/New York Times poll released Sept. 15 shows a tighter race between Trump and Carson.\n\nThat same day, the political arm of the Club for Growth announces a $1 million advertising campaign against Trump.\n\nTrump takes hits from all sides in the second primary debate, held in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 16, but he dismisses his GOP rivals in trademark Trump fashion:\n\n\"Everything I've done, virtually, has been a tremendous success.\"\n\nThe next day, Trump faces this question from an audience member at a New Hampshire town hall:\n\n\"We got a problem in this country. It’s called Muslims. We know our current president is one. We know he’s not even an American. (Trump: We need the question.) But anyway. We have training camps brewing where they want to kill us. That’s my question. When can we get rid of them?\"\n\nTrump, not addressing what the man said about President Obama, replies:\n\n\"We’re going to be looking at a lot of different things. A lot of people are saying that. A lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there. We’re going to be looking into that and plenty of other things.\"\n\nHe responds to criticism in a series of tweets two days later, saying he was in a \"no win situation.\"\n\nTrump caps off the week by campaigning in Iowa, repeating his defense of how he handled the Muslim question, and appears before a high school homecoming, telling the crowd that he's willing to appoint a Muslim to his Cabinet.\n\nWeek 15: Rubio in the cross hairs\n\nTrump maintains his lead in a CNN/ORC poll released Sept. 20, but he drops 8 points since the network's poll earlier in the month. Carly Fiorina surges 12 points after another strong debate performance.\n\nIn a Sept. 21 Twitter Q&A, Trump says he'll forgo the $400,000 annual salary if he becomes president. On Sept. 22, he sends a cease-and-desist letter to the Club for Growth over its recent attack ad.\n\nMarco Rubio becomes the latest Trump target on Sept. 23, with Trump calling the senator a “lightweight” and “overly ambitious, too young” and mocking his sweating habits. Rubio fires back the next day, calling Trump “touchy” and “insecure.”\n\nAlso on Sept. 23, Trump tweets that he's done with Fox News.\n\nThe next day, he and Ailes set a meeting for the following week “to discuss their differences of opinion regarding Fox’s coverage.\"\n\nTrump ends the week with an appearance at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, where he brings along his childhood Bible and tells the audience that he's a faithful Christian who will fight for religious freedom. (He also dings Rubio again, calling him a \"clown.\")\n\nWeek 16: Outsiders on top\n\nA Sept. 27 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll has Trump and Carson in a virtual tie. Trump shows a more commanding lead in a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll released three days later, in which the \"outsider\" candidates dominate.\n\nTrump releases his tax plan on Sept. 28, which includes the following goals:\n\n1. Tax relief for middle class Americans: In order to achieve the American dream, let people keep more money in their pockets and increase after-tax wages. 2. Simplify the tax code to reduce the headaches Americans face in preparing their taxes and let everyone keep more of their money. 3. Grow the American economy by discouraging corporate inversions, adding a huge number of new jobs, and making America globally competitive again. 4. Doesn’t add to our debt and deficit, which are already too large.\n\nTrump ends his six-day Fox News boycott with a Sept. 29 appearance on The O'Reilly Factor.\n\nWeek 17: 'I'm not getting out — I'm going to win'\n\nIn a New York Times interview published Oct. 5, Trump says TV ratings would plummet without him in the race.\n\n“There’d be a major collapse of the race, and there’d be a major collapse of television ratings ... It would become a depression in television.”\n\nAmid rumors that he could exit the race early in light of his polling lead tightening, Trump tells CNN, \"I'm not getting out — I'm going to win.\"\n\nA Quinnipiac poll released Oct. 7 shows Trump leading in three key swing states. “Those who were waiting for Donald Trump’s campaign to collapse will need to wait longer, at least in the three key states of Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania,” said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.\n\nAt an Oct. 8 rally in Las Vegas, Trump invites a woman on stage, whom he says he's never met, while discussing a People magazine cover that features his family. She proclaims: \"I’m Hispanic and I vote for Mr. Trump! Yes, Mr. Trump! We love you! We love you all the way to the White House!\"\n\nWeek 18: 'The World Trade Center came down during his reign'\n\nLest anyone think that the first Democratic debate on Oct. 13 would be a Trump-free occasion, he gets in on the action by live-tweeting the event.\n\nAt a rally in Richmond the next day, he tells supporters that his biggest criticism of the debate was that no candidate was aggressive enough in going after Hillary Clinton, and he called Bernie Sanders a \"maniac.\"\n\nNational polls from Fox and CBS show Trump and Carson continuing to lead the GOP field, with no other candidate breaking into double digits. Trump's response to Carson gaining on him? “He’s been getting a lot of ink on the Muslims and other things,” he tells ABC News on Oct. 14. “And I guess people look at that and they probably like it. Some people thought they wouldn’t like it, but they probably do.”\n\nDespite Trump's insistence that he can self-fund his White House bid, his documents filed Oct. 15 with the Federal Election Commission showed that his campaign raised $3.9 million from July through September, with nearly all of that coming from other people's donations.\n\nTrump and fellow candidates resolve their issues with the debate format on Oct. 16, when CNBC agrees to limit its upcoming debate to two hours, including opening and closing statements and commercial breaks.\n\nIn a Bloomberg interview released Oct. 16, Trump slams George W. Bush for the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks happening on his watch.\n\n“I think I have a bigger heart than all of them. I think I’m much more competent than all of them. When you talk about George Bush, I mean — say what you want — the World Trade Center came down during his time.\" “He was president, OK? Don’t blame him or don’t blame him, but he was president. The World Trade Center came down during his reign. If you look at Sandy Hook, those people are still begging for help. It’s a disaster.”\n\nWeek 19: A 'young intern' at fault\n\nThe week kicks off with Trump and Jeb Bush taking aim at each other on the Sunday shows over Trump's comments on George W. Bush and 9/11.\n\nTrump tells Fox News Sunday on Oct. 18:\n\n\"Look, look, Jeb said, 'we were safe with my brother. We were safe.' Well, the World Trade Center just fell down. \"Now, am I trying to blame him? I'm not blaming anybody. But the World Trade Center came down. So when he said, we were safe, that's not safe. We lost 3,000 people, it was one of the greatest -- probably the greatest catastrophe ever in this country if you think about it, right?\"\n\nAnd Bush tells CNN's State of the Union:\n\n\"Look, my brother responded to a crisis, and he did it as you would hope a president would do. He united the country. He organized our country, and he kept us safe. And there's no denying that. The great majority of Americans believe that.\"\n\nNational polls released Oct. 19 and 20 from NBC News/Wall Street Journal and CNN/ORC continue to show Trump and Carson well ahead of their fellow GOP candidates. But a Quinnipiac poll released Oct. 22 shows Carson passing Trump in Iowa. “It’s Ben Carson’s turn in the spotlight,” said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.\n\nHours after the release of the Iowa poll, Trump's Twitter account retweets a tweet that riles up Iowans:\n\nTrump goes on to blame the retweet on a \"young intern.\"\n\nWeek 20: 'We need tremendous energy'\n\nWith Carson's rise in the polls, Trump continues his attacks on the new Iowa front-runner. “Ben Carson is super low energy, right?” Trump says on CNN’s State of the Union on Oct. 25. “Super low energy. We need tremendous energy.”\n\nThe next day, a Monmouth poll of Iowa Republicans shows Carson with a 14-point lead over Trump. And on Oct. 27, Carson passes Trump in a New York Times/CBS News national poll., garnering the support of 26% of GOP primary voters compared with Trump's 22%.\n\nBut the Oct. 28 Republican debate comes and goes without the expected fireworks between the two candidates. The aftermath of the debate is instead focused on criticism of the moderators from Trump and others.\n\nWeek 21: High noon for Trump and Rubio\n\nIn the wake of the criticism over the third GOP debate, representatives from the candidates' campaigns meet on Nov. 1 to discuss demands for future debates. But the next day, Trump's campaign says it will continue to negotiate directly with the networks.\n\nNov. 2 marks the second dip in a week for Trump in national polling, with Carson leading the Republican field in a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll with 29% compared with Trump's 23%.\n\nAnother round of Trump vs. Rubio begins on Nov. 3, with Trump attacking the Florida senator on his immigration stance, missed votes in the Senate and personal finances during a news conference to promote his latest book. “He doesn’t show up for the people of Florida,” Trump says.\n\nRubio fires back two days later when speaking to reporters in New Hampshire. “I find it ironic that the only person running for president that’s ever declared bankruptcy — four times in the last 25 years — is attacking anyone on finances,” he says in response to Trump's comments on his use of a party-issued credit card when he served in the state Legislature.\n\nOn Nov. 5, the Department of Homeland Security confirms that Trump and Carson are receiving Secret Service protection.\n\nTrump caps off the week by hosting Saturday Night Live, boosting the show to its best ratings in almost four years.\n\nWeek 22: Dramatic re-enactment\n\nNov. 10 brings the fourth Republican debate. Trump elicits boos from the audience after a spat with John Kasich over immigration when he dismisses the Ohio governor by saying, “I don’t have to hear from this man, believe me,\" and again when he says of Fiorina, “Why does she keep interrupting everybody?”\n\nAt a Nov. 12 campaign stop in Iowa, Trump weighs in on mounting criticism over the accuracy of a number of Carson's anecdotes from his personal history and troubled youth, even re-enacting the scene of Carson attempting to stab a friend:\n\n“I have a belt. Somebody hits me with a knife, it’s going in because the belt moves this way. It moves this way. It moves that way! It moves the buckle! Anybody have a knife and want to try it on me?”\n\n“If you’re pathological, there’s no cure for that,” Trump tells the audience in Fort Dodge, Iowa. “If you’re a child molester, there’s no cure. They can’t stop you.”\n\nHe continues the theme in a video released the next day:\n\nCarson tells reporters on Nov. 13 in South Carolina that Trump is engaged in “the usual politics of personal destruction\" but that he will not get into the “mud” with his GOP rival.\n\nWeek 23: Matters of national security\n\nAs the world reels from the attacks in Paris, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Nov. 17 finds Trump and Clinton atop the list of presidential candidates who respondents felt were best equipped to deal with the threat of terrorism, each with about 20% support.\n\nAmid the post-Paris escalation of the debate over Syrian refugees in the U.S., Trump jumps on an Internet report of Syrians detained at the Texas border as another reason to build his wall on the Southern border:\n\nHe causes a bigger stir on Nov. 19 in his response to NBC News about a mandatory database to track Muslims: “I would certainly implement that. Absolutely.” He later backtracks, amid criticism from both his Republican and Democratic rivals:\n\nOn Nov. 20, Kasich is the latest subject of a Trump tweetstorm, focused on an ad by Kasich's super PAC targeting Trump.\n\nWeek 24: 'Thousands of people were cheering'\n\nIn a Nov. 22 appearance on ABC's This Week, Trump addresses his recent comments on a Muslim database and closing mosques:\n\n\"I want a database for the refugees that -- if they come into the country. We have no idea who these people are. When the Syrian refugees are going to start pouring into this country, we don't know if they're ISIS, we don't know if it's a Trojan horse. And I definitely want a database and other checks and balances.\" \"Well, I don't want to close mosques; I want to surveil mosques. I want mosques surveiled. ... And let me tell you, the people that are involved in those mosques, they know who the bad ones are and they know who the good ones are, but they don't talk.\"\n\nDuring the same appearance, he also repeats his widely discredited claim, which he first discussed the previous day at an Alabama rally, about seeing television footage of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center on 9/11.\n\n\"Hey, I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering.\"\n\nOn Nov. 22, Trump defends his retweet two days earlier of an inaccurate, racially charged graphic on crime statistics:\n\n“I retweeted somebody that was supposedly an expert,” Trump tells Fox News’ O'Reilly. “Bill, am I gonna check every statistic?”\n\nTrump maintains his lead in New Hampshire in a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll released Nov. 22, coming in 22 points higher than his closest competitor, Rubio. He regains his lead in Iowa in a Quinnipiac University poll released Nov. 24, with 25%, though Cruz comes in just two points behind.\n\nCapping off Thanksgiving week, Trump faces criticism for mocking the movements of a New York Times reporter, Serge Kovaleski, who has a disability affecting his joints.\n\nIn a statement, Trump says he didn't know Kovaleski personally and was only \"mocking the fact that the reporter was trying to pull away from a story that he wrote 14 years ago,\" referring to a story Kovaleski wrote while at The Washington Post that Trump had cited to back his controversial 9/11 comments.\n\nWeek 25: $5 million threat\n\nAfter touting an impending endorsement from a group of black pastors, Trump's campaign backtracks and cancels a planned news conference for Nov. 30 amid criticism of Trump's racial insensitivity and denial of any plans to endorse him. Trump ends up holding an impromptu news conference after meeting with the group and touts the meeting as successful, though no specific endorsement are announced.\n\nDuring a Nov. 30 campaign stop in Georgia, Trump throws out the idea that he'll skip the next debate unless CNN gives him $5 million (which he said he'd donate to \"Wounded Warriors or the vets\").\n\nBut three days later — and several hours after CNN President Jeff Zucker proclaimed, “We do not pay candidates to appear at debates\" — he changes his tune. “When you’re leading in the polls, I think it’s too big of a risk to not do the debate,” Trump tells The Washington Post. “I don’t think I have the kind of leverage I’d like to have in a deal and I don’t want to take the chance of hurting my campaign. So I’ll do the debate.”\n\nIn a national Quinnipiac University poll released Dec. 2, Trump leads with 27% of Republican voters, 10 points ahead of Rubio. A national CNN poll released two days later shows Trump leading by a whopping 20 points, with 36% compared with Cruz's 16%.\n\nWeek 26: 'A total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States'\n\nOn Dec. 6, President Obama gives a rare Oval Office prime-time address on the U.S. fight against the Islamic State in the wake of the Paris attacks and San Bernardino shootings. Trump live-tweets the occasion and is underwhelmed:\n\nDec. 7 brings Trump’s most divisive proclamation thus far, with a campaign statement that elicits widespread condemnation:\n\n“Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.”\n\nHe doesn’t back down from his position in the days following, claiming it has “tremendous support” and that he has gotten calls from people worried about terrorist attacks who “just want to see something happen.”\n\nIn the wake of Trump’s Muslim ban proposal, the Huffington Post reverses its earlier decision to classify Trump content as “entertainment.”\n\nIt's a mixed bag of polling for Trump over the course of the week. A Monmouth University Poll released Dec. 7 has Cruz leading Trump by 5 points in Iowa, but an Iowa poll released by CNN the same day has Trump up 13 points over Cruz. And on Dec. 12, The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll has Cruz surging to a 10-point lead over Trump.\n\nNationally, Trump leads Cruz in a Dec. 8 USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll and a Dec. 10 CBS News/New York Times poll. The USA TODAY/Suffolk poll also finds that 68% of Trump's supporters say they'd vote for him if he bolts the GOP and runs as an independent — a stat that Trump is quick to tout.\n\nOn Dec. 10, The Washington Post reports that top figures in the Republican Party are preparing for a brokered convention scenario, recounting a Trump-centric discussion in which “several longtime power brokers argued that if the controversial billionaire storms through the primaries, the party’s establishment must lay the groundwork for a floor fight, in which the GOP’s mainstream wing could coalesce around an alternative.”\n\nThe week concludes with a battle percolating between Trump and Cruz. The New York Times reports on a private donor meeting in which Cruz questions Trump's judgment. Cruz continues to hold back on criticizing Trump in public, despite Trump's bait.\n\nOn Dec. 13, Trump sets his sights on Cruz in Sunday show interviews, telling Fox News Sunday that Cruz acts like \"a bit of a maniac\" in the Senate.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/politics/surveillance-video-voting-machine-breach-coffee-county-georgia/index.html", "title": "Newly obtained surveillance video shows fake Trump elector ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Republican county official in Georgia escorted two operatives working with an attorney for former President Donald Trump into the county’s election offices on the same day a voting system there was breached, newly obtained video shows.\n\nThe breach is now under investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and is of interest to the Fulton County District Attorney, who is conducting a wider criminal probe of interference in the 2020 election.\n\nThe video sheds more light on how an effort spearheaded by lawyers and others around Trump to seek evidence of voter fraud was executed on the ground from Georgia to Michigan to Colorado, often with the assistance of sympathetic local officials.\n\nIn the surveillance video, which was obtained by CNN, Cathy Latham, a former GOP chairwoman of Coffee County who is under criminal investigation for posing as a fake elector in 2020, escorts a team of pro-Trump operatives to the county’s elections office on January 7, 2021, the same day a voting system there is known to have been breached.\n\nThe two men seen in the video with Latham, Scott Hall and Paul Maggio, have acknowledged that they successfully gained access to a voting machine in Coffee County at the behest of Trump lawyer Sidney Powell.\n\nText messages, emails and witness testimony filed as part of a long-running civil suit into the security of Georgia’s voting systems show Latham communicated directly with the then-Coffee County elections supervisor about getting access to the office, both before and after the breach. One text message, according to the court document, shows Latham coordinating the arrival and whereabouts of a team “led by Paul Maggio” that traveled to Coffee County at the direction of Powell.\n\nThree days after the breach, Latham texted the Coffee County elections supervisor, “Did you all finish with the scanner?” According to court documents, Latham testified she did not know what Hall was doing in Coffee County. But when confronted with her texts about the scanner, she asserted her Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nMaggio did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Instead, the data firm he works for, SullivanStrickler, which court documents show was hired by Powell, said in a statement to CNN that it was “directed by attorneys to contact county election officials to obtain access to certain data” in Georgia and also “directed by attorneys to distribute that data to certain individuals.”\n\nIn an August 29, 2022, email, an attorney for SullivanStrickler acknowledges that Latham was the “primary point of contact” in coordinating the team’s visit to Coffee County.\n\nThe firm said it had no reason to believe these attorneys would ask or direct it to “do anything either improper or illegal.”\n\nHall, an Atlanta bail bondsman and Fulton County Republican poll watcher, did not reply to repeated requests for comment from CNN.\n\nConflicting answers\n\nThe newly obtained surveillance video and text messages in the civil lawsuit suggest the fake elector plot and the effort to breach voting machines in Georgia were part of a larger, coordinated plan to subvert the 2020 election. Some of the same Trump lawyers and allies who helped orchestrate the effort to seat fake electors in states Trump lost in 2020 were also involved in attempts to gain unauthorized access to voting machines in numerous counties in states around the country seen as friendly toward the former president.\n\n“The video reveals that Cathy Latham had a more significant role with the SullivanStrickler team’s work in Coffee County than she claimed,” said David Cross, an attorney representing election integrity groups suing Georgia over its voting systems and who has reviewed the video. “We can see her escort the team into the office that morning, for example. And she’s an important connection to the effort to create a slate of Georgia electors who would have wrongly voted for Trump for the 2020 election, which now looks to be the subject of a grand jury investigation in Fulton County.”\n\nAccording to court documents, Latham has provided conflicting answers during depositions when asked about her involvement in the breach and whether she was at the Coffee County elections office on the day it occurred. The video confirms she was there when it took place and literally held the door open for those who breached the voting systems. Previously, the Justice Department had warned elections officials not to allow outside access of this kind.\n\nLatham did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. A lawyer representing Latham did not dispute the facts of the story and said that Latham did not have the authority to “authorize anyone to do anything with the ballots.”\n\nThe lawyer said Latham did not “participate personally in anything that the elections board and/or its employee … may have decided to do under their own authority (or at least their perceived authority) with the ballots.”\n\n“So, regardless of whether she correctly remembers the details of what time she spent there on January 7, it doesn’t change the fact that she had no authority to do any of this and was not personally involved in whatever was done,” the lawyer added.\n\nA second lawyer representing Latham, Bob Cheeley, told CNN, “Cathy Latham has dedicated significant time and effort over many years protecting the integrity of elections in Coffee County, Georgia. She would not and has not knowingly been involved in any impropriety in any election.”\n\n“Latham did not authorize or participate in any ballot scanning efforts, computer imaging, or any similar activity in Coffee County in January 2021.”\n\nOperatives connected to Trump’s campaign and legal team worked with local GOP officials to gain access to voting systems in counties across several states following the 2020 election, including Coffee County. The goal was to produce evidence to back up Trump’s baseless claims and ultimately upend Joe Biden’s victory – even after it was certified on January 6.\n\nAmong them was Cyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan, who oversaw the partisan election audit in Maricopa County, Arizona, and was recently named by the Michigan attorney general as a target in the state-level criminal investigation into unauthorized voting machine breaches in that state.\n\nThe newly obtained surveillance video shows Logan also visited the Coffee County elections office more than once in January 2021, roughly two weeks after the breach took place. CNN has reached out to attorneys for Logan.\n\nSeparately, federal investigators have issued subpoenas seeking information about Latham’s communication with Rudy Giuliani and other members of Trump’s legal team as part of a DOJ probe, sources said.\n\nOn December 30, 2020, eight days before the January 7 voting machine breach, Latham testified along with Giuliani before Georgia state lawmakers about supposed voter machine irregularities in Coffee County.\n\nAt the time, Latham and the Giuliani legal team were represented by the same attorney, according to the minutes from that hearing. When asked during a recent deposition in the Georgia civil case whether she knew or ever had any communication with Giuliani, Latham asserted her Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nLatham is a target of two criminal investigations into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, one by the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office, and a parallel probe by the Justice Department, according to multiple sources and documents obtained by CNN. Both of those investigations are looking specifically at the fake electors plot. State investigators in Georgia are also examining the Coffee County voting machine breach.\n\nTrump allies target rural GOP stronghold in Georgia\n\nIn the weeks after the election, Coffee County quickly emerged as a central part of the Trump team’s push to overturn the election. The reliably Republican stronghold of about 43,000 residents was the only county in Georgia that refused to certify its results after the election, even though Trump won nearly 70% of the vote.\n\nTrump and his lawyers had an ally in Latham, who was open to helping push their claims of fraud and was a leading voice among those raising concerns about the Dominion voting systems used in Coffee County.\n\nIt was one of two counties referenced in draft executive orders that, if signed by Trump, would have ordered the military or Department of Homeland Security to seize voting machines across the country. They would have also installed a special counsel with the power to investigate voter fraud.\n\nWhile those documents were never signed, the draft orders were presented to Trump during a now-infamous Oval Office meeting on December 18, 2020, which was attended by election deniers, including Powell and Michael Flynn, according to previous CNN reporting and testimony before the House Select Committee investigating January 6.\n\nIn the weeks after that meeting, gaining access to voting machines became a top priority for Trump allies seeking to overturn the election, as those closest to the former President thought it was the only way to actually prove there was widespread fraud, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nTrump’s inner circle was warned by several Republican lawmakers that without evidence of fraud, their plan to subvert the Electoral College would almost certainly fail, text messages obtained by the House Select Committee investigating the US Capitol attack show.\n\nPowell was among those who took the lead in the hunt for evidence of voter fraud, turning her attention to Coffee County in the days before January 6, emails produced as part of the civil suit and obtained by CNN show. Like Latham, Powell was in direct contact with members of the team that travelled to Coffee County and Powell appears to have hired them for the task, the emails show.\n\nAccording to the civil lawsuit, members of the team included Hall, the Atlanta bail bondsman who is seen on the surveillance footage being escorted into the Coffee County elections office by Latham.\n\nIn an audio recording obtained by CNN, Hall claims that he “chartered the jet to go down to Coffee County to have them inspect all of those computers.”\n\n“I went down there, we scanned every freaking ballot,” Hall says in the recording. Hall also suggests that the same group of people who orchestrated the breach in Coffee County also gained access to voting machines in Antrim County, Michigan weeks before.\n\n“The same people that went up to Michigan, OK, and did all that forensic stuff on the computers. And they sent their team down to Coffee County, Georgia, and they scanned all the equipment, imaged all the hard drives, and scanned every single ballot,” Hall says in the recording.\n\nMaggio was among those who was involved in both efforts, according to previously reported documents related to the inspection of voting systems in Antrim County and his own testimony in a civil court case related to the Coffee County breach.\n\nHall also claims that he and the team of individuals who traveled to Coffee County had permission from local elections officials to access the voting systems.\n\nEvidence of a coordinated plot\n\nIt’s unclear if federal authorities are investigating whether attempts to gain access to voting machines after the 2020 election were part of a coordinated, multi-state effort carried out by Trump allies. But state investigators in Georgia are examining the possibility of a broader plot.\n\nAnd investigators in Colorado and Michigan are sharing evidence they have collected about unauthorized breaches in those states with the FBI, according to multiple sources familiar with those investigations.\n\nEarlier this year, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson shared information with members of the House Select Committee, as well as Attorney General Merrick Garland, to assist in the investigation of whether pro-Trump operatives gained access to voting machines in Antrim County as part of a coordinated plot overseen by the former President’s legal team.\n\nSince then, evidence has emerged linking several people who gained access to voting systems in Antrim County to the breach in Coffee County – including Powell and Maggio.\n\nIn a recent court filing, Phil Waldron, a retired Army colonel who was deeply involved in efforts to overturn the election, claimed that a federal grand jury has been empaneled and that a team of federal prosecutors and FBI agents are “conducting a sweeping criminal investigation into those, among others, who have ‘worked in the cybersecurity space on election- and voting-related issues.”’\n\nThe filing came as part of Waldron’s months-long court fight with the House Select Committee investigating January 6, which has subpoenaed Waldron’s phone records. Waldron has argued that if the House Committee gets his phone records, they could end up in the hands of federal prosecutors that he says are also investigating efforts to obtain election data by seizing and tampering with voting machines.\n\nCNN previously reported that Waldron was part of the team that reviewed election data obtained from Antrim County, helped craft the draft executive orders for seizing voting machines and coordinated efforts to access voting systems in several states to bolster Trump’s claims about widespread election fraud.\n\nHe also testified during a December 2020 hearing on election fraud held by state lawmakers in Georgia and was introduced by Giuliani.\n\nA source familiar with Trump’s legal defense strategy expressed concern about the prospect of federal prosecutors targeting cyber investigators like Waldron, because they may attempt to flip them in order to bolster their potential case against the former President.\n\nOn August 25, Waldron and Powell were ordered to testify as part of the Fulton County District Attorney’s probe.\n\nIn a court filling, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis specifically notes that Powell can likely provide information about the breach in Coffee County as well as similar efforts in Michigan and Nevada related to voting machines.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Jason Morris", "Zachary Cohen", "Jason Morris"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/politics/trump-investigations-doj-analysis/index.html", "title": "A moment of truth is fast approaching for both Trump and the DOJ ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump is heading for a period of maximum legal and political risk over his role in the US Capitol insurrection and hoarding of classified documents that will collide with his efforts to electrify a low wattage 2024 White House bid.\n\nA quickening special counsel probe, now focusing on the alleged attempt to steal Georgia’s election, the climax of the House January 6 committee and a new trial of pro-Trump Oath Keepers extremists underscore the breadth of attempts to secure accountability over one of the darkest days in modern American history. These new signs of a net possibly closing around Trump and his allies come a month after voters sent a signal of disapproval with his obsession over the 2020 election by repudiating many midterm candidates in swing states who bought his claims of voter fraud.\n\nBut each sign that once slow burning efforts to work through the trauma of the post-election period are heating up brings a parallel warning that the future threat to truth and democracy remains acute. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance – a key force in the incoming GOP House majority that is likely to try to shut down or obstruct investigations into Trump – is embroiled in yet another controversy over the insurrection.\n\nThe Georgia Republican said that if she had her way, the mob that smashed into the Capitol would have been armed. She then rebuffed White House condemnations of her comments by insisting she was joking. This came days after the ex-president stepped up his voter fraud falsehoods by demanding the termination of the Constitution in a sign of how his potential second term might unfold if he wins the 2024 election and returns to the White House.\n\nIt is remarkable how tight a hold Trump’s unprecedented attempt to overturn a presidential election still has on Washington politics – even if many Americans are more concerned with feeding their families and paying rent amid raging inflation. And Trump’s campaign of lies is having a damaging impact. Even after Republicans won the House last month, a new CNN/SSRS poll published Monday found that only 34% of Republican-aligned adults are even somewhat confident that elections reflect the will of the people – down from 43% in October.\n\nAn accelerating investigation\n\nThe ex-president has not yet been charged in either probe and there is so far no indication that he will be. But the sense that Trump is approaching a moment of maximum legal peril is being driven both by signs of an increasingly aggressive investigation by special counsel Jack Smith and the realities of a calendar that offers limited time for any potential prosecutions before the 2024 campaign is in full swing. Trump’s already questionable hopes of winning a national election, meanwhile, could absorb new blows with the unveiling of the January 6 committee’s final report next week and its possible criminal referrals to the Department of Justice.\n\nCNN reported Sunday that Smith is speeding ahead on twin probes into Trump’s role in an effort to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power in 2020 and his apparently haphazard storage of classified documents at his Florida residence and resort. It emerged Monday that Smith’s team subpoenaed Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was on the other end of the then-president’s phone call designed to convince him to “find” sufficient votes to overturn Joe Biden’s win in the Peach State in 2020. Smith has also issued a flurry of grand jury subpoenas since Thanksgiving, including to ex-Trump adviser Stephen Miller and two former White legal counsels.\n\nRyan Goodman, a professor of law at NYU, interpreted the subpoena sent to Raffensperger as another sign of Smith picking up momentum.\n\n“This thing is ramping up very steadily and at great pace compared to what was happening before,” Goodman told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday.\n\n“It’s been over 700 days since the Washington Post published the full hour audio … of that highly incriminating phone call – 700 days for the DOJ to finally get around to subpoena him. When does it happen? Under Jack Smith.”\n\nGoodman also suggested that Trump’s legal team was guilty of wishful thinking if they believed that Smith’s appointment after a period spent abroad meant he was less likely to be influenced by the politicized aftermath of the January 6 attack and that a fresh mind would lean against indictments.\n\nPreet Bharara, a former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday that Smith’s appointment and his assembling of a high-powered team of experienced prosecutors represented bad news for Trump.\n\n“I don’t think they would’ve left their former positions, both in government and private practice, unless there was a serious possibility that the Justice Department was on a path to charge. And I think it’ll happen in a month,” he said.\n\nOf the two investigations, legal experts say the one regarding classified documents may move ahead the fastest after several failed attempts by Trump in court to delay it. A judge on Monday formally dismissed Trump’s case challenging the Mar-a-Lago evidence collection and in which she had appointed a special master. That gives the Justice Department full access to tens of thousands of records and other items found among documents marked as classified in Trump’s beach club and private office.\n\nTrump is being investigated over possible violations of the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice. The ex-president claims the FBI search of his property at Mar-a-Lago in August is an example of political persecution designed to stop him winning the White House again and maintains that he is entitled to the documents despite the fact that presidents are supposed to send such material to the National Archives and Records Administration when they leave office.\n\nThe DOJ faces fateful choices\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has vowed that no one is above the law and that investigations will go where the evidence leads. But the reality of the legal process means that any trials would take considerable time to prepare and conduct. The prospect of a prosecution of a former president and current presidential candidate is so politically explosive that it would be optimal for any proceedings to take place well before the climax of the 2024 White House race.\n\n“We’re now coming up against a timeframe in which it is a challenge to finish either case, if it is brought, to finish it before the election,” said CNN legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers on “Newsroom” on Monday.\n\n“So, I think they will bring a case on the documents side, if they can, as soon as they can,” Rodgers said, adding that any case on January 6 would probably take more time.\n\nIf a moment of truth is approaching for Trump, the same can be said of Garland and the DOJ. Any decision to charge the former president in either case is bound to trigger a furious political chain reaction. Given that the ex-president’s movement has already shown it sees violence as a legitimate tool to express a political grievance, things could get especially dangerous.\n\nWhile Smith is following legal procedures, the political context makes it even more incumbent on the DOJ to demonstrate to Americans that it had no choice, for instance, to mount an unprecedented search at an ex-president’s home.\n\nTrump has already tried to use claims that justice is being weaponized against him as rocket fuel for his 2024 presidential bid. And while the law, and not politics, is Garland’s stated business, any potential prosecution of Trump must balance the national interest and the precedent that would be set if a commander in chief were to get away with attempting to overthrow an election.\n\nThe former president’s conduct is sure to face more withering scrutiny with the final report of the House January 6 committee, which wants to make its case for posterity before it is likely expunged by the incoming House GOP majority next year.\n\nThe committee has created a damning pattern of Trump’s conduct, and has repeatedly warned that he poses a clear and present danger to democracy.\n\nGiven its tone and direction, it would be something of a surprise if the panel did not recommend the House refer Trump, among other aides, to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution when it wraps up. Such a step would be merely symbolic, however, as the committee has no power to level charges itself. And the DOJ is not compelled to act on any recommendations. Its own investigations would have to resolve the question of whether professional prosecutors agreed with the conclusions of Congress acting in its constitutional oversight role.\n\nOne consideration to bear in mind is that the committee’s highly choreographed televised hearings did not include any cross examination of witnesses, so it’s hard to tell how some of the most incriminating testimony about Trump’s behavior would hold up under the far higher evidentiary standard required in a court of law. Still, the report – and transcripts of its depositions expected to be sent to the DOJ – could be useful in fleshing out any criminal case by the special counsel, and in preparing the public for the possibility of any move by Smith to charge Trump.\n\nThat’s yet another reason why the turn of the year and the early months of 2023 are beginning to look like a moment of reckoning for both Trump and those who are investigating him.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/28/politics/trump-blindsided-january-6-hearing/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump aides left speechless by Cassidy Hutchinson ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAides to former President Donald Trump were left speechless amid the first half of Cassidy Hutchinson’s testimony on Tuesday, acknowledging to CNN that her testimony was “a bombshell” with potentially huge repercussions for Trump.\n\nTrump was already bracing for an explosive day of testimony from Hutchinson, who previously told the House select committee that the former President approved of rioters chanting violent threats against Vice President Mike Pence on January 6, 2021.\n\n“This is a bombshell. It’s stunning. It’s shocking. The story about ‘The Beast’ – I don’t have words. It’s just stunning,” said one Trump adviser, referring to the presidential limousine.\n\n“This paints a picture of Trump completely unhinged and completely losing all control which, for his base, they think of him as someone who is in command at all times. This completely flies in the face of that,” the adviser added.\n\nThe Trump adviser, who was in a group text chat with several other Trump aides and allies as the hearing played out, said that “no one is taking this lightly.”\n\n“For the first time since the hearings started, no one is dismissing this,” the adviser said.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Trump spokeswoman Liz Harrington sought to dismiss the stunned reactions from some allies of the former President.\n\n“The only thing ‘stunning’ is that the Unselect Committee would run with such easily refutable and ridiculous falsehoods that are laughable on their face,” Harrington said.\n\nAnother Trump ally told CNN the testimony from Hutchinson, a former top aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, would seal Meadows’ fate as “persona non grata” to the former President.\n\n“This is one of the reasons [Trump] is furious with Meadows. He was already iced out but now he will be persona non grata,” this person said.\n\nThe startling revelations from Hutchinson’s testimony about Trump’s erratic behavior and state of mind on January 6 could make it easier for Republican presidential hopefuls to challenge the former President in a primary should he run, the Trump ally added.\n\n“This is basically a campaign commercial for (Florida Gov.) Ron DeSantis 2024,” said the Trump ally.\n\nTrump claims he hardly knows Hutchinson\n\nTrump, as he often does with aides and allies with whom he was once close but later turned against him, claimed on Tuesday that he “hardly know[s]” Hutchinson and personally rejected a request she made to join his post-presidency staff at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n“When she requested to go with certain others of my team to Florida after my having served a full term in office, I personally turned her request down,” Trump said on Truth Social during Hutchinson’s live testimony.\n\nTrump attempted to cast Hutchinson’s testimony on Tuesday as revenge, claiming she was “very upset and angry that I didn’t want her” at his Palm Beach residence.\n\nThe former President’s attempt to distance himself from Hutchinson, whom he described as “bad news” on Tuesday, came after the committee showed renderings of the West Wing to demonstrate just how close she was to the Oval Office as an assistant to Meadows. Multiple former White House aides also publicly vouched for Hutchinson’s proximity to Trump and his chief of staff before and during her appearance on Tuesday.\n\n“Anyone downplaying Cassidy Hutchinson’s role or her access in the West Wing either doesn’t understand how the Trump [White House] worked or is attempting to discredit her because they’re scared of how damning this testimony is,” former White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews tweeted.\n\nIn response to this, one former White House aide said, “Everyone high up at the (White House) knew her. And even if Trump didn’t know her name, he most certainly recognized her. She traveled on (Air Force One) with Mark for every trip.” Additionally, this former aide told CNN that Tuesday’s testimony was 100% believable given what the aide had experienced while working in the Trump White House.\n\nThe most surprising episode to some aides so far was when Hutchinson recounted an incident she testified to hearing about secondhand from Tony Ornato, a Secret Service agent who also served as White House deputy chief of staff, where Trump allegedly tried to lunge for the steering wheel of the presidential vehicle so he could be driven to the Capitol on January 6. Following her testimony, a Secret Service official familiar with the matter told CNN that Ornato denies telling Hutchinson the former President had grabbed the wheel or assaulted an agent on his detail. This official said the agency notified the committee Tuesday afternoon that it will make Ornato and Bobby Engel, another agent who was on Trump’s detail on January 6, available to testify under oath. As previously reported by CNN, both agents are prepared to testify that neither incident inside the presidential vehicle occurred.\n\nUS Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement Tuesday that the agency planned “to respond on the record to the Committee regarding the new allegations surfaced in” Hutchinson’s testimony.\n\nTrump allies and the former President quickly latched on to the news that Ornato and Engel were prepared to deny the incident under oath as part of their efforts to discredit Hutchinson’s testimony – and it appeared to be working to change perspectives inside the former President’s orbit. One of the Trump advisers who was initially left speechless by Hutchinson’s appearance on Tuesday later told CNN that Ornato’s and Engel’s willingness to dispute her testimony “completely changed” his own view and “the dynamic of the hearings.”\n\n“They are probably risking their careers. Decorated careers,” the adviser said.\n\nTrump was nervous about testimony\n\nEx-aide was backstage with Trump at his Jan. 6 rally. Here's what she heard him say 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump has previously denied reporting on Hutchinson’s leaked testimony, claiming on his Truth Social platform earlier this month that he “never said, or even thought of saying, ‘Hang Mike Pence.’”\n\n“This is either a made up story by somebody looking to become a star, or fake news!” he wrote at the time.\n\nBut a person close to Trump said he was nervous about Tuesday’s hearing, which features live testimony from Hutchinson. Prior to the committee’s announcement on Monday, this person said Trump was feeling triumphant amid back-to-back Supreme Court decisions protecting a right to conceal carry a gun and ending the constitutional right to abortion.\n\n“He definitely wasn’t expecting a twist like this,” said the person close to Trump.\n\nThe former President and his allies are planning to cast Hutchinson as a junior aide who had little influence inside the West Wing, despite her proximity to both the then-President and his then-chief of staff. Hutchinson served in the Office of Legislative Affairs prior to becoming a top aide to Meadows and was an eyewitness to several key episodes leading up to January 6, in addition to witnessing some of Trump’s real-time reactions that day.\n\nTrump was specifically concerned about what Hutchinson could say about his state of mind and response to the rioters on January 6, said a second person close to him.\n\nMeadows on high alert\n\nHutchinson’s proximity to Meadows placed the former White House chief of staff on high alert ahead of Tuesday’s hearing.\n\nHutchinson “operated like an executive assistant to him,” said a person familiar with their relationship and her insight into his day-to-day schedule, conversations, and interactions with Trump is unrivaled.\n\n“I think the committee has held their fire on Meadows so far but today’s going to be a Meadows day,” the person said.\n\nMeadows personally promoted Hutchinson from the White House Office of Legislative Affairs to his West Wing office, where this person said “she was given enormous access and enormous visibility” into his relationship with Trump and several top GOP lawmakers.\n\nA second person familiar with the matter said Hutchinson received zero support from Meadows as she became entangled in the January 6 committee’s investigation but has remained in touch with some of his other aides.\n\nNow, Meadows and his allies are worried that could come back to haunt him.\n\nThey are watching Tuesday’s hearing closely to see what new information Hutchinson reveals in her sworn testimony, said the second source, who noted that Meadows is specifically concerned that her appearance could further strain his relationship with Trump.\n\nTrump has privately complained to allies in recent months about text messages that Meadows turned over to the House panel before halting his cooperation, and a book Meadows wrote that contained startling new details about the severity of Trump’s battle with Covid-19 also angered the former president.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting Wednesday.", "authors": ["Gaborr Pamela Brown", "Pamela Brown"], "publish_date": "2022/06/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/10/15/town-halls-al-roker-katie-couric-megyn-kelly-trump-biden/3673336001/", "title": "Trump town hall moderator Savannah Guthrie sparks celeb reaction", "text": "President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden's competing town halls Thursday evening left many media pundits split.\n\n\"Well that happened,\" MSNBC's Rachel Maddow said. \"That was a strange replacement for what was otherwise supposed to be the second presidential debate of this general election season.\"\n\nBoth candidates participated in televised town halls (Trump on NBC and Biden on ABC) after the Commission on Presidential Debates cancelled the second of three presidential debates, a town-hall format featuring questions from voters originally scheduled for Thursday in Miami.\n\nCelebrities and television personalities were forced to jump between channels to hear from the candidates.

I was scrolling through my feed. Someone who was a friend had this video of the two of them with the like Snapchat thing … like dog ears.” Harry said: “I was like, who is that?”\n\nMeghan said she looked through his feed, before the pair got each other’s numbers.\n\nTheir first date in Soho\n\nHarry turned up late to the pair’s first date in Soho, London, in July 2016.\n\nMeghan said: “You were late and I couldn’t understand why he would be late. But he kept texting saying, ‘I’m in traffic, I’m so sorry.’”\n\nHarry recalled: “I was panicking, I was freaking out. I started sweating.” Unaware of this, Meghan began to doubt that the date would go anywhere, thinking he might have an “ego.”\n\nBut when he eventually showed up he was profusely apologetic, which Meghan described as “so sweet,” adding: “You were genuinely so embarrassed.”\n\nHarry described their relationship as a \"love story.\" From Netflix\n\nMeghan added: “He was just so fun. Just so refreshingly fun and that was the thing we were like childlike together.”\n\nThey arranged to meet again the following night.\n\n“That’s when it hit me,” Harry said. “This girl, this woman, is amazing. She’s everything I’ve been looking for.”\n\nTrip to Botswana\n\nThe couple described how their relationship was cemented in Africa, when Meghan traveled to join Harry on a visit to Botswana in August 2016 – having only met him twice before.\n\n“We had to get to know each other before the rest of the world and before the media joined in,” said Harry.\n\nThey spoke of living in close quarters with the bare minimum and how they were still so unsure of how the relationship would develop.\n\nRelentless media attention\n\nHarry spoke at length about the media’s ever present role in his family life, starting with footage taken outside the hospital following his birth.\n\nOf the ongoing attention throughout his childhood, he said: “The majority of my memories are of being swamped by paparazzi.”\n\nHe recalled learning as a young child how to handle the attention, saying: “Within the family, within the system, the advice that’s always given is ‘don’t react. Don’t feed into it.’”\n\nHarry spoke candidly about growing up in the royal family. Netflix\n\n“My mum did such a good job in trying to protect us. She took it upon herself to basically confront these people.”\n\nFootage of family ski holidays was included to highlight this. In one clip, Harry is seen alongside his brother Prince William and cousins Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie as they are made to pose for the crowd of photographers, in an unwritten agreement that would ultimately allow them privacy later in the holiday. But that was followed by another more intrusive clip which led to his mother confronting the photographer.\n\n‘Pain and suffering’ of women marrying into royal family\n\nHarry brought up the now discredited 1995 Panorama interview with his mother, Princess Diana. While he acknowledged that she had been “deceived,” he said that she had spoken “the truth.”\n\nHe said: “My mother was harassed throughout her life with my dad but after they separated the harassment went to new levels.”\n\nThe “moment she left the institution” left her “completely exposed,” he said.\n\nGrowing up, he witnessed “pain and suffering of women marrying into this institution.” He added: “What happened to my mum … I didn’t want history to repeat itself.”\n\nFitting ‘the mold’\n\nIn a telling section on his experience of other royal marriages, Harry said: “I think for so many people in the family, especially the men, there can be a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit the mold, as opposed to somebody who you perhaps are destined to be with.\n\n“The difference between making decisions with your head or your heart. And my mum certainly made most of her decisions, if not all of them, from her heart. And I am my mother’s son.”\n\nMeghan’s comparison with Diana\n\nHarry spoke about ways Meghan is similar to his mother, Diana, who died when he was 12 years old.\n\n“So much of what Meghan is and how she is is so similar to my mum. She has the same compassion, she has the same empathy, she has the same confidence, she has this warmth about her,” said Harry.\n\n“I accept that there will be people around the world who fundamentally disagree with what I’ve done and how I’ve done it. But I knew that I had to do everything I could to protect my family, especially after what happened to my mum.”\n\nDoria Ragland\n\nIn her first extensive public comments, Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland spoke about her first time meeting Harry, as well as her fears for her safety and regrets as a parent. She also described the last five years as “challenging.”\n\n“He was 6’1”, a handsome man with red hair, really great manners. He was just really nice. And they looked really happy together. Yeah, like he was the one,” she said.\n\nDescribing the early years of her daughter’s childhood, Ragland – who is African American – recalled repeatedly being asked if she was the nanny as her daughter’s skin was lighter.\n\nHer mother said: “As a parent, in hindsight I would absolutely like to go back and have that very real conversation about how the world sees you.”\n\nWhen Meghan began to face negative media attention, Ragland recalled telling her daughter “this is about race,” with Meghan replying: “Mommy, I don’t want to hear that.”\n\nRacial undertones\n\nAfter news of their relationship broke, Meghan recalled how quickly she became the focus of photographers and the media.\n\nThe royal family regarded such intrusion almost as a workplace hazard, according to Harry.\n\nMeghan's life changed almost over night after she started dating the prince. Netflix\n\n“As far as a lot of the family were concerned, everything that she was being put through, they had been put through as well,” Harry said.\n\n“So it was almost like a rite of passage. Some of the members of the family were like ‘right, but my wife had to go through that, so why should your girlfriend be treated any differently? Why should you get special treatment? Why should she be protected?’ I said the difference here is the race element.”\n\nFormalities, and meeting William and Catherine\n\nMeghan recalled meeting Prince William and his wife Catherine over dinner.\n\nOblivious to royal protocol, she said she was “barefoot” and wearing ripped jeans at the time. She described herself as a “hugger,” but said that this can be “jarring” for some British people.\n\n“I guess I started to understand very quickly that the formality on the outside carried through on the inside,” she said. “That formality carries over on both sides, and that was surprising to me.”\n\nFirst meeting with the Queen\n\nHarry said that his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was the first senior member of the royal family to meet Meghan.\n\nMeghan recalled being told that she would have to curtsy, while Harry said: “How do you explain that you bow to your grandmother? And that you all need to curtsy. Especially to an American. That’s weird.”\n\nHe went on to say that members of his family were “incredibly impressed,” though were uncertain about the difference in their backgrounds and thought that her being a Hollywood actress meant “this won’t last.”\n\n“The actress thing was the biggest problem, funnily enough,” said Meghan. “There was a big idea of what that looks like from the UK standpoint. Hollywood – it was very easy for them to typecast that.”\n\nRoyal family’s ‘unconscious bias’\n\nIn contrast to Meghan’s experiences growing up mixed race, Harry said that there was a “huge level” of unconscious bias in the royal family.\n\n“The thing with unconscious bias is actually no one’s fault, but once it’s been pointed out or identified within yourself, you then need to make it right,” he said.\n\nHarry even addressed the time when he wore a Nazi uniform to a private party in 2005, saying it was one of the “biggest mistakes” of his life, adding that he felt “so ashamed afterwards.”\n\nThe Markle family\n\nThe duchess discussed her estrangement from her father following a controversy over whether he staged a series of paparazzi style photographs in the lead up to their 2018 wedding.\n\nHarry described the situation with his father-in-law as “incredibly sad.”\n\n“I shouldered that because if Meg wasn’t with me then her dad would still be her dad,” he said.\n\nMeghan opened up about her half-sister Samantha Markle, who she said she hadn’t seen since her early twenties but who frequently spoke of her in the media.\n\nMeghan said: “I don’t know your middle name.

Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nSports Illustrated this week rolled out its annual swimsuit issue, with this year’s edition highlighting body diversity and incorporating buzzwords like “inclusive” and “powerful” to describe the women depicted.\n\nThe photo spreads featured Asian American recording artist Yumi Nu, whose pictures generated a backlash from men angered by the fact that she is a plus-sized woman. It also included Kelly Hughes, a model with a visible c-section scar, as well as 74-year-old Maye Musk, mother of business magnate Elon Musk and the oldest cover model to ever grace the magazine.\n\nAlso included in the issue is a photo spread featuring five WNBA players: Sue Bird, Nneka Ogwumike, Breanna Stewart, DiDi Richards and Te’a Cooper. It marks the first time athletes from the professional women’s basketball league appear in SI’s swimsuit issue, a move the magazine called “unprecedented,” “history-making” and “radical.”\n\nFrankie de la Cretaz Delia M. Harrington\n\nBut while in theory their inclusion could be seen as progress, the glam shot aesthetics of the photos – and the WNBA’s language promoting the pictures – feels like a step backwards for the league’s image and branding.\n\nThe WNBA promoted the shoot last week in a tweet which read “we can do both [fire emoji].”\n\nWhat was meant by “both” wasn’t clear, but it’s not hard to conclude that they meant that players can be both “athletic” and “feminine” – two things that often are wrongly assumed to be at odds.\n\nThe photo seems jarring: All five players in the picture have been glammed up in a way that seems inconsistent with their usual off-the-court self-presentation. That’s particularly true for the out queer players in the group, Bird (typically femme-leaning, but unfussy) and Stewart (who favors more of a soft butch aesthetic).\n\nNot only does that framing buy into century-old anxieties around women’s gender roles and presentation, but it’s a bizarre misstep for a league that has grown, since its inception, in terms of letting their players embrace a more diverse range of gender expressions.\n\nBird said in a statement posted online by the magazine that posing for the picture allowed the players to put the diversity of the league on full display – and show just how far the WNBA has come in terms of representation.\n\n“We represent a variety of things: of course women, women of color, members of the LGBTQIA2+ community and much more,” Bird said of the players’ involvement.\n\nUS female athletes' fight for equal pay (2021) 03:28 - Source: CNN\n\n“The [swimsuit] issue for so many years has been iconic and has represented a lot for women. Now you are seeing an evolution in what that can mean and what that can look like, and I think the WNBA players being a part of that is what makes it special. There is no better group of women to showcase that evolution.”\n\nOther players quoted in the same SI statement suggested that the photo spread afforded them visibility to help advance other causes: Stewart said she hoped to promote the league’s social justice initiatives and Ogwumike highlighted the strength of the league’s players’ union.\n\nStill, it’s unsettling to look at the photos of these women – who are generally seen as not conforming to societal expectations and standards around women’s beauty – being featured in a magazine issue known for objectifying women. It’s hard to view it as “evolution” in any way.\n\nIt’s also difficult to see how posing in swimwear brings meaningful attention to the initiatives that Stewart and Ogwumike hope to spotlight. Rather than showcasing its progress, the images seem to be a throwback to the league’s early, less enlightened days.\n\nWhen the WNBA began in the late 1990s, its marketing replicated contradictory ideas around how women athletes should look. Players were sometimes photographed in swimsuits or encouraged to wear makeup and dresses. There were league-sanctioned makeup classes for rookies.\n\nAnd while straight players’ families were highlighted, there was rarely ever mention made of the significant others of players whose partners might not be men.\n\nIt was a part of a perpetual attempt to appeal to the cisgender, heterosexual male gaze – because, after all, why else would men watch women’s sports except to ogle at the athletes on screen? And it tapped into debunked, antiquated and even ludicrous ideas that sports make women masculine and even somehow interfere with their fertility.\n\nPlayers have taken control of their public images in recent years, thanks in large part to the rise of social media and the ability of athletes to create their own brands and aesthetics through their platforms. The league sometimes seemed to be following the players’ lead in allowing them more room for self-expression: The featured player heading into the 2022 WNBA draft, for instance, was Destanni Henderson, whose draft day outfit was a sea foam green suit and matching Yankees hat.\n\nWNBA All-Stars (l. to r.) Kym Hampton; Rebecca Lobo; Vickie Johnson and Theresa Weatherspoon, of the New York Liberty, look at video at the NBA Store on Fifth Ave., where they met fans. New York Daily News Archive/Getty Images\n\nNevertheless, more often than not it’s the conventionally attired, conventionally attractive (read thin, White, feminine) women who get the league’s focus, media attention and sponsorship dollars. A study of coverage of the 2020 season showed that White players receive almost twice as much coverage as Black players, despite the fact that the league is 80% Black.\n\n“In [women’s basketball], you gottah be the best player, best looking, most marketable, most IG followers, just to sit at the endorsement table,” Connecticut Sun player and WNBA MVP Jonquel Jones tweeted earlier this year. “Not to mention me being a black lesbian woman. Lord the seats disappearing from the table as I speak.”\n\nDespite the fact that the league sometimes falls short on issues of race and gender inclusivity, SI apparently feels that including WNBA players in its swimsuit issue can only help it appear more inclusive, less emblematic of oppressive and unrealistic beauty standards for women and embracing of values that are relevant to 2022.\n\nBut that’s nearly impossible: The swimsuit issue is a holdover from an earlier century. It feels oddly archaic alongside Sports Illustrated’s often excellent coverage of women and trans athletes (Full disclosure: I have written for the publication).\n\nJewell Loyd #24 of the Seattle Storm drives to the basket against the Las Vegas Aces on May 15, 2021. Stephen Brashear/NBAE/Getty Images\n\nI’m also left to wonder why the WNBA felt it would help its brand to be associated with an antiquated annual tradition that has women’s objectification at its roots.\n\nAnd as long as SI says it is aiming to expand the representation of women on its pages, it should try steering away from the traditional femininity that is often the only aesthetic allowed to be promoted.\n\n“I love Sports Illustrated’s attempt to be more inclusive and amplify women in the W,” Connecticut Sun player Courtney Williams said on Twitter.\n\n“At the same time though it would of been raw to see a sleek lil sports bra & some shorts swaggin’. There’s more than one way to look sexy, and I hope in the future we can tap into that.”\n\nThe decision to market these athletes as exclusively hyperfeminine – whether made by the magazine or the league – isn’t just regressive. In a league that is largely made up of queer women, it sends a message that’s outright queerphobic.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThere are plenty of feminine queer women, but queer womanhood is much more expansive than that.

Not for LeBron James. STVM coach Dru Joyce II reflects on pupil's rise\n\nDid you know LeBron broke a record Kareem Abdul-Jabbar set in 1984 before James' birth at Akron City Hospital?\n\nA Cavaliers legend wants to celebrate James a la the team's 2016 championship parade\n\nAs the number of reporters waiting to ask LeBron James postgame questions ballooned to about 20 during his junior high school season at St. Vincent-St. Mary, a decision was made to streamline interviews by holding news conferences.\n\n\"When we traveled around the country, there were some reporters that didn't want to believe that he was that great,\" STVM boys basketball coach Dru Joyce II recently told the Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\n\"There were some that thought that he was catered to, and they came at him like that. He handled it much better than most teenagers would.\"\n\nDuring that same season, a 17-year-old James appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the title \"The Chosen One\" and the following caption: \"High school junior LeBron James would be an NBA lottery pick right now.\" The magazine's publish date of Feb. 18, 2002, came roughly 16 months before the Cavaliers drafted James first overall.\n\n\"When the Sports Illustrated thing happened, those are high expectations, but I always believed from those years in high school that he had the shoulders to handle it,\" Joyce said. \"He was a unique person who could handle all that's been put on him.\"\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nOPINION:LeBron and Kareem took different paths to meet expectations and become icons\n\nINSIDE THE RECORD:LeBron James has captured the scoring title. We visualized every shot.\n\nGRATITUDE:LeBron cries, gives thanks, drops f-bomb after passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\n\nNEWSLETTER:Sign up to get the latest sports stories and news sent to your inbox\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable aspect of James' legacy as a superstar athlete and international icon is how he never allowed an unfathomable amount of hype to derail his NBA career.\n\nJames, 38, didn't just meet expectations. He shattered them like a glass backboard victimized by a ferocious slam dunk.\n\nThe resume includes four championships – in 2020 with the Los Angeles Lakers, 2016 with the Cavaliers and 2012-13 with the Miami Heat – four regular-season Most Valuable Player awards, four NBA Finals MVPs and 19 All-Star selections.\n\nAnd on Tuesday night, James added the NBA's all-time scoring record to the long list of achievements he has compiled in his 20 seasons. He surpassed Hall of Fame center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 38,387 career points, scoring 38 in the Lakers' 133-130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.\n\nJames entered the game needing 36 points to break the record. He reached the total by making a turnaround jump shot with 10.9 seconds left in the third quarter, and the game was halted to commemorate the occasion. Abdul-Jabbar handed a ball to James, then they exchanged a handshake and a hug on the court.\n\nSpeaking into a microphone, James thanked fans, Abdul-Jabbar, family, friends and other supporters. Swept up in the emotion, James let an f-bomb slip at the end of his brief speech.\n\n\"We should have a parade downtown for him because the NBA has been around a long time, and it's a heck of a goal to accomplish,\" Cavaliers legend and longtime Northeast Ohio resident Larry Nance Sr. said. \"The best fans are here. They all love LeBron. We all do, and we've watched him do so many great things like (spearhead the development of the I Promise School in Akron). We're all so proud of him, and we're going to celebrate because he's ours.\n\n\"He's Ohio's, and we're going to celebrate just like we won a championship.\"\n\nJames had already become the NBA's all-time leader in combined regular-season and playoff points. He eclipsed Abdul-Jabbar in the joint category on Feb. 12, 2022.\n\nBut now James is professional basketball's undisputed scoring champion. He has the most points in NBA history in the regular season (38,390), the playoffs (7,631) and the regular season and playoffs added together (46,021).\n\n\"In my book, he's already the greatest,\" said New Orleans Pelicans forward and Akron native Larry Nance Jr., who played with James when they were members of the Cavaliers during the 2017-18 season. \"He's the greatest player I've ever seen and I think the greatest player who ever touched the court.\"\n\nReasons to be skeptical\n\nAkron native and former NBA player Jerome Lane Sr. admitted he didn't believe all of this would come to fruition for James.\n\nLane is a former STVM star whose jersey hangs alongside LeBron's in the high school gymnasium named after James. Lane attended all of the Irish's state championship games during the James era and thought the hysteria surrounding the phenom would be detrimental when he reached the NBA.\n\n\"For him to start off his career with the weight they put on his neck,\" Lane said, \"I mean, I just can't believe he survived.\n\n\"I'm really going to be honest. I just thought they just threw too much stuff at him at one time for him to bear. I just thought he was going have a mental breakdown. Then when he fought through it, he came out smelling like roses.\"\n\nThe buzz surrounding James reached the national stage – especially with STVM playing in several other states – yet people from Akron knew about it on a deeper level.\n\nThe vast majority of the STVM home games during LeBron's junior and senior seasons were moved to the University of Akron's Rhodes Arena to accommodate larger crowds. During his final high school season (2002-03), the Irish's games could be purchased by Northeast Ohio residents through pay-per-view. Two games were televised on ESPN2.\n\nMeanwhile, shoe companies Nike and Adidas were courting James for endorsement deals, with Reebok entering the fray shortly before the NBA Draft. The seven-year contract James eventually signed with Nike before he had ever played a minute for the Cavaliers was worth $90 million.\n\n\"He was the league's face at 18, and he took that (expletive) on like it was nothing – like a champ,\" Lane said. \"That feat right there is unbelievable. I think that feat right there is more unbelievable than him breaking the scoring record.\"\n\nJoyce explained a key to James overcoming the pressure heaped upon him at a young age could be found in his support system on the STVM roster.\n\nJoyce first coached James as a 10-year-old AAU player. The coach's oldest son, Dru Joyce III, and Sian Cotton were members of the same AAU team. They would later unite with Willie McGee and Romeo Travis to form STVM's \"Fab Five\" with James as the headliner. Those former STVM standouts attended Tuesday's game along with other loved ones of James.\n\n\"What a lot of people don't realize is the significance of his friends and his teammates because they kept him grounded for those years,\" Joyce said. \"He was never treated differently by me or any of those close friends on the team. We recognized he was the best player, but we also recognized you can't do anything without us. He recognized he can't do anything without the team.\n\n\"When I see him play today and I see him make the pass when others say he should have been more selfish and taken that shot, that just does my heart good. Because that's how we brought him up – to understand that the game is five on five, and you've got to trust your teammates, and they've got to trust you to make it work.\"\n\nEvolution of LeBron James\n\nIn an interview last month with ESPN, James said sitting atop the scoring throne had never been a goal of his because he's always been \"a pass-first guy.\" Last week, James moved into the fourth spot on the NBA's all-time assists list.\n\nHowever, LeBron's game has also changed with time. The 6-foot-9 James is more of a post presence nowadays than the wingman he had been for years.\n\n\"He's continued to figure out ways to get better and sustain a high level of play,” said Pelicans guard CJ McCollum, who is also a Canton, Ohio native. \"Obviously, his jump shot has improved since his younger years, and his athleticism is still there after 20 years. It's crazy.\n\n\"But I think his basketball IQ, his ability to manipulate a game, make the players around him better and almost be a coach on the floor is impressive. For him to sustain that level of play for so long just shows you how great he truly is and how much he takes care of his body and does the little things to make sure he gets the best out of himself.\"\n\nJames' career regular-season averages are 27.2 points on 50.5% shooting from the field, 7.5 rebounds and 7.3 assists per game. He's still dominant this season, scoring 30 points, grabbing 8.5 rebounds and dishing out 7.1 assists a game.\n\n\"First, he used to just drive a lot, and then he picked up a little jumper. Now he picked up 3s,\" Nance Sr. said. \"He just evolved his game and got better each year, and that's the sign of a superstar — to be able to look at my weaknesses and develop them and make myself better. I've seen him play with pretty much a broken right hand and still average 28. I mean, he just doesn't take no for an answer. He's going to figure out how to do it, and he's one of the most unstoppable people I've ever seen.\"\n\nThe determination of James caused Joyce to chuckle when he reflected on his former pupil insisting the scoring record wasn't a target.\n\n\"This has just happened, but it's just happened because of his desire to be the best,\" said Joyce, who has led STVM to seven state titles as a head coach. \"That just kind of goes along with the territory. You can't be the best and not score the ball.\n\n\"I used to tell him, 'Hey, you speak your reality into existence. Don't be afraid to say what you believe, and then you've got to work at it. But you can't be afraid to say 'I want to be the greatest.' He said it, and he understands that saying it isn't enough. There's work involved, and his work ethic is one of the best ever.\"\n\nCavaliers forward Cedi Osman witnessed the work ethic as a rookie in Cleveland during the 2017-18 season, James' last in his second stint with his hometown NBA team.\n\n\"He would be the first one coming into the gym and the last one leaving,\" Osman said. \"He's a great example.\"\n\nKareem's record\n\nA 19-time All Star and six-time NBA champion, Abdul-Jabbar set the career regular-season scoring record in his 15th season when he passed Wilt Chamberlain on April 5, 1984, nearly nine months before James was born.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar played five more seasons and retired in 1989 at the age of 42. He logged 20 seasons — six with the Milwaukee Bucks and his last 14 with the Lakers — and 1,560 regular-season games.\n\nIt took James 1,410 regular-season games to pass Abdul-Jabbar, whose career averages were 24.6 points on 55.9% shooting from the field, 11.2 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game.\n\nNance Sr. and Lane played against Abdul-Jabbar and encountered his signature offensive move.\n\n\"Kareem's skyhook is the prettiest shot I've ever seen,\" said Nance Sr., who added Abdul-Jabbar was a \"classy\" opponent and among his favorite players. \"He could shoot that thing from 15 feet out, just like a jump shot.\n\n\"I had a jump hook. I don't think anybody could throw it as smooth and pretty as Kareem. I definitely tried to pick up on a hook because, to me, it's one of the most dominant shots in the history of the NBA that nobody could really block. You've seen guys try to throw hooks, but nothing like his.\"\n\nLane called the 7-2 Abdul-Jabbar \"very physical\" and \"strong as hell.\" At 6-6, Lane said, \"No way I was getting near that skyhook. All I could do is once he did the skyhook is block him out and hope he missed.\"\n\nPlenty of players who have tried to guard James will have stories to tell for generations, too.\n\n\"Even his rookie year, he was killing it, and he's killing it now,\" Osman said. \"I think every year, he just got better. On the level he plays right now, it's unbelievable. He's a great inspiration.\"\n\nLane wonders whether James will be knocked out of the No. 1 spot on the all-time scoring list, considering he appears to have several years of elite production left.\n\n\"He's going to add on so much that it's going to be really hard to get,\" Lane said.\n\nNo matter how it shakes out, no one can deny James has lived up to his billing and then some.\n\n\"It's unbelievable. If you wrote it in a book, it'd be like, 'Nah, it's too corny. I can't read that,'\" Nance Jr. said. \"The dude is incredible. The things he's had to overcome and the way he's given back to the community all while doing it with an unscathed resume and just being the utmost role model is to be commended.\n\n\"I don't think it's talked about enough, but the dude is as good off the court as he is on, and we know how good he is on, so that's something to be said. It was an honor of my career getting to play with him.\"\n\nNow Nance Jr. is among those who can say they shared a court with the new scoring king.\n\nNate Ulrich can be reached at nulrich@thebeaconjournal.com.

Jones\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDressed to kill in a jumpsuit and hip-rolling to Teknomile’s Duros on the L train, plus-size model Philomena Kwao, 26, is the ultimate carefree black girl. And at a statuesque 5’10, with cheekbones crafted by the deities of West Africa and the meanest TWA this side of the Atlantic, the British Ghanaian beauty is also the perfect canvas — a canvas that is finally getting its golden debut in Sports Illustrated.\n\nAs part of #SwimSexy — a new campaign launched by plus-size swimwear retailer Swimsuits For All — Kwao appeared in the 2016 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue alongside SI Swimsuit cover star Ashley Graham, 28, and model Nicola Griffin, 56. The striking ad marked a watershed moment for the magazine, which appears to finally be recognizing not just plus-size women but plus-size women across the axes of race and age.\n\n“It was perfect,” Kwao said of the shoot, highlighting the choice of the bold, gold bikini in particular. “You know, plus-sized women have been told for so long to cover up. Whether it’s with a one-piece, a tankini, a bikini with a skirt, high-waisted things, we’re always told to hide these things that society calls flaws... Swimsuits For All has taken the bikini — which for so many years has been the reserve of tall, slim, white young women — and they’ve made it accessible.”\n\n\"And if I, as a woman of size, of color, of any age, want to feel empowered in wearing a bikini, I can,\" she continued. \"I also just celebrate the fact that it’s even in Sports Illustrated ... they’re showing various women all around the world that actually no, there isn’t one kind of beauty. There isn’t one form or mold you have to fit into.”\n\nKwao confesses it’s a lesson she learned the hard way.\n\nThough Kwao has modeled for roughly four years now and credits her career for helping boster her self-confidence, she admits that hegemonic beauty ideals made her feel insecure growing up — so much so that she used lightening soaps in hopes of more closely resembling the fairer-skinned women exalted on TV.\n\n\"When I was in my teenage years, I used to watch a lot of music videos. I saw lots of Beyoncés, I saw Mya, I saw Rihanna.\"\n\n\"It was always about lighter (women). Even at school or at home, even in my country – I was born and raised in London but my heritage traces back to Ghana — it’s just always seen as an extra step to your beauty: Being of a fairer tone.”\n\nWhile Kwao has since come to embrace the skin she’s in and has made inroads as a dark-skinned, plus-size model — appearing in campaigns for the Beth Ditto Collection, Addition Elle, Torrid and now, Swimsuits For All — she contends that racial and, specifically, skin tone diversity remain an issue, even in the seemingly radical world of plus-size fashion.\n\n“When celebrating size, when celebrating different shapes, I still feel like different women from different backgrounds have been excluded from that,” she said, referencing the disproportionate ratio of white and fairer-skinned plus-size models.\n\n“I think the fashion industry and the media industry in general have a responsibility to make sure that they celebrate the rich differences in all our backgrounds to make sure we don’t fall into the trap of reducing beauty to one specific mold,\" she said. \"And that’s why, again, I think the Swimsuits For All campaign has been so powerful because they used me.\"\n\n\"They used me. I have natural hair. I have a dark skin tone. I’m a plus-size woman.\"\n\nThe implication, of course, is that Kwao isn't the standard. But she expresses hope that more models like her will be cast and will help others to see \"their black is beautiful, too.\"\n\nNicola Griffin on being the oldest model in the Sports Illustrated swim issue\n\nRonda Rousey, Ashley Graham cover historic Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/01/30/swimsuit-issue-paulina-porizkova-returns-bret-michaels-kid-debuts/2725774002/", "title": "SI Swimsuit Issue will feature Paulina Porizkova, Bret Michaels' 18 ...", "text": "The 2019 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue will feature a new celebrity kid model and a familiar face whose body is every bit as impressive as the teens and 20-year-olds posing along with her.\n\n\"I’m am in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit as just one of the core girls (not a special insert) at the age of nearly 54,\" announced veteran supermodel Paulina Porizkova, who was not afraid to show as much skin as women 30 years her junior.\n\nAt the other end of the age spectrum is Raine Michaels, the 18-year-old daughter of Poison singer and reality star Bret Michaels.

It was on my bucket list.\"\n\nSoon, she is going to need a much deeper \"bucket.\"\n\nAfter all, this is the little girl who, at 15, became the youngest surfer — male or female — to qualify for the major surfing tour. At 16, she earned Rookie of the Year honors and by 17 she already was winning the historic $100,000 in the 2019 season opener in Australia, the first equal prize money awarded to men and women on the prime circuit.\n\nAfter cashing in on another $100,000 payday, she finished second in the 2019 world rankings to earn a spot for Team USA in the Olympics (with No. 1 Carissa Moore).\n\nIn between all that, a huge sand sculpture reflecting her surfing ability was erected in front of the world's largest surf shop, Ron Jon, in Cocoa Beach; she passed her driver's license test; and she graduated from high school by way of virtual learning.\n\nThen this came along.\n\n\"I remember when we got word; my manager (Mike \"Snips\" Parsons) — who's also my coach — got an email ... we were driving back from having surfed. I think we just looked at each other ... I was so stoked.\"\n\nIt took two flights from California to reach the tropical paradise. And it was special.\n\n\"Me and my mom (Sarah) went and we had so much fun,\" said Marks, who now spends most of her time at her family's primary home in Orange County, Calif. \"We really had a good time.\"\n\nThe three-day stay included dinner at \"the most beautiful house\" and she said the entire crew was so special, especially photographer James Macari.\n\n\"We all had our own day, on different parts of the islands,\" Marks said.\n\nHer shoot day — the final model among \"what was it, like 50 girls?\" — began with a 3 a.m. wake-up call. Thirty minutes later, the makeup and wardrobe process began. She changed in and out of swimsuits during the day in a cabana set up on the beach.\n\nSand often was wiped off her body with a big glove, \"like a mitt, but it wouldn't take off the makeup underneath.\"\n\nThe shoot lasted until after sunset.\n\n\"And we got waves somehow,\" said Marks, who took a couple of her own surfboards along for the trip. Some of her stunning photographs included underwater shots as she paddled in the crystal clear Atlantic off the coral islands.\n\nAlso in the year's edition are world-class surfers Courtney Conlogue and Malia Manuel.\n\nOther athletes who have graced the pages of the popular issue, now \"read\" by an estimated 63 million sets of eyes, have been soccer star Alex Morgan, tennis standout Caroline Wozniacki and UCF fighter/WWF wrestler Ronda Rousey.\n\nThis year's magazine, like in recent years, includes plus-sized women and even the oldest model in the 56-year history of swimsuit editions, fittingly, 56-year-old Kathy Jacobs, from Calabasas, Calif.\n\n\"The coolest thing is they (Sports Illustrated) support so many diverse women and body types, and it's cool to represent that,\" said the 5-foot-4 Marks, who some say has the looks of a young Jennifer Aniston.\n\nMarks, whose guilty pleasure is Goldfish crackers, finds it difficult to describe her physical features in just one word.\n\n\"Let's just say, I'm built more like a woman and definitely not a stick,\" she said, laughing. \"I have curves, more of a very strong body with a lot of muscle, and curvy. It's just awkward to explain.\"\n\nShe said she vividly remembers when those \"curves\" came to be.\n\n\"For me, I remember at 15, I started to grow into it from a little girl to a woman ... one day I woke up, looked in the mirror and it was like, 'Whoa!' \"\n\nIn a recent interview with Red Bull, she said there were instant, harsh critiques of her body, which first offended her, especially when she knows she's performing in bikinis on a global scope.\n\n\"Absolutely, now I feel that need to embrace my body,\" she said. \"Being only 18 now, it's hard to be confident in your own skin no matter what your body looks like.\"\n\nGrowing up, she has admired several women for their beauty. Among them South African model Candice Swanepoel, whom she describes as \"gorgeous;\" also athletes Lindsey Vonn and Simone Biles, who recently landed on the cover of Vogue, and whom she also calls \"inspiring.\"\n\nMarks is in select Sports Illustrated company.

The 2021 season is planned to begin in late November in Hawaii.\n\nSince becoming, er, a supermodel, she has noticed some differences.\n\n\"People coming up on the beach and talking about modeling ... hey, I'm forever a surfer,\" she said.\n\nSo, now that she's crossed the Sports Illustrated gig off her bucket list, what's next?\n\nSashaying down the runway with giant wings as a Victoria's Secret model, perhaps?\n\n\"I hope so!\" she said. \"Now that would be insane.\"\n\nSpoken like a true supermodel.\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n• Elle Macpherson holds the record for most swimsuit issue covers, with five.\n\n• Germany's Babette March was the magazine's first cover model, in 1964.\n\n• The youngest \"model\" honor actually goes to Christie Brinkley's daughter, Alexa Ray Joel, who was 3 in 1989 when she appeared with her mom in one cute pose.\n\nContact Grossman at 321-242-3676 or hgrossman@floridatoday.com.

He'd learned the second part the hard way.\n\nThey were blue gel capsules. He never forgot that detail. Over the previous four days, the former Michigan State football star had taken roughly 10 of them a day, well below his normal dosage, which nearly reached triple digits during his heyday.\n\nA family doctor prescribed them. He was happy to oblige when Mandarich told him he would soon be entering rehab.\n\nIt was 9 a.m. His biscuits and gravy had yet to make it to the table. His medicine, dissolving inside an empty stomach, was starting to do its job. His shakes were subsiding, the crippling stomach cramps fading. His mind was beginning to drift back into a familiar euphoric fog as he sank into a booth inside a mid-Michigan Big Boy restaurant.\n\nIt was the last time Mandarich used.\n\nHe had 60 pills stored safely inside an orange bottle in his pocket. And he did the unthinkable. He walked to the restroom, locked the door behind him and poured the contents into the toilet. A week before — heck, an hour before — it would’ve been Mandarich’s worst nightmare.\n\nBut it was time. His life was in ruins.\n\nThe capsules dissolved before his eyes.\n\nSix years prior, in 1989, he was the No. 2 selection in the NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers and the highest paid offensive lineman in league history. He branded himself as a bad boy. His play backed up his preening, and the reputation he reveled in was built thrashing defensive linemen and linebackers during his five-year run in East Lansing.\n\n“I had the world in the palm of my hands,” Mandarich said, shaking his head.\n\nThen reality set in.\n\nMandarich was a liability in pass protection. At MSU, a run-heavy attack, he mowed down defensive fronts. In the NFL, he was exposed.\n\nHe started only 15 career games in Green Bay, all coming during the 1991 season. He had gone from a much-ballyhooed prospect to a career backup.\n\nAnd there was a good reason, if you ask Mandarich.\n\n\"I wasn't sober one day in Green Bay,' he claims.\n\nAfter a pitiful, drug-and-alcohol riddled four-year stint with the Packers, it was all over. He was released. No other teams were calling for his services.\n\nThe hype he once enjoyed turned into a punchline he didn’t think he deserved. He was 26 and out of football.\n\nThe worst, it turns out, was yet to come.\n\nBy 1993, the only time Mandarich left the couch was when he wanted to scam a pharmacy out of Vicodin, Percocet, OxyContin or the drug it all started with, Stadol, among others. He chased that initial high for years to no avail.\n\nHe grew tired of the life, and himself.\n\nThat day in 1995, after paying for his breakfast and saying goodbye to his longtime girlfriend, Amber, who was also headed to treatment, he reluctantly walked through the electric, sliding doors of a drug-rehab facility in Brighton.\n\nHe was defeated, a junkie. His dignity gone.\n\n“I made the conscious decision to quit,” he said. “Life had become unmanageable. I felt like such a pathetic loser.”\n\nThe date was March 23, 1995. He hasn't touched a pill or an alcoholic drink since.\n\nAt home behind the lens\n\nRocked back in a black office chair inside his dimly lit office in suburban Phoenix, Mandarich, now 51, cracks open a slender, silver can. He leans forward and speaks into the recorder.\n\n“That was a sugar-free Red Bull, not a beer, for the record.” He chuckled. “This might be worse than beer.”\n\nMandarich’s office is a storefront at the end of a strip mall on the trendy side of Scottsdale. It’s a prime location but still hidden from the world. The shades are drawn.\n\nIt’s 72 degrees outside in mid-December. That’s one of the reasons Mandarich relocated here from his hometown of Oakville, Ontario, just outside of Toronto. The main attraction, however, is the stunning landscapes just outside these doors, a collision of red cliffs, Saguaro cactus and thin desert air.\n\nIt’s a photographer’s playground.\n\nMandarich left behind a six-figure career running his family golf course in Canada because he loves shooting photos in the Southwest. He didn’t know one person in the valley before he jumped in his car to make the 3,600-mile move 14 years ago. He still works off a green card.\n\nIt was a risky move, he admits, especially for a hobby.\n\n“No, I wasn’t miserable, but I wasn’t happy,” he said. “This is what I am going to do. I hammered out $40,000 the first year here. I had a mortgage, but I was (expletive) happy.\"\n\nMORE MSU FOOTBALL FEATURES FROM CODY TUCKER:\n\n* He was once known for his off-the-field antics.

His forearms are covered in faded tattoos and a week-old beard wraps around a confident smile.\n\nHis 120-pound, brown Newfoundland, Medo, sleeps in a large black cage in the corner of the studio. The name is Croatian for “bear.” Mandarich still loves Guns ‘n’ Roses. Their songs were his go-to tunes at the Powerhouse Gym in East Lansing when he was in college. That, he said, will never change.\n\nEach wall in his large studio office features one of his photos. He loves the purity of photography, but excels in the creative editing process, bringing photos to life by adding different backgrounds and setting extreme scenes.\n\nOne of his favorite pieces is a shirtless, weathered man with a bushy white goatee. The finished product shows the man standing on a rocky beach with a stormy ocean scene in the background. In reality, the man is a local welder and a friend. He was sitting on a trunk inside Mandarich's studio with a fan blowing his long white hair when the photo was shot. The rest was done in Photoshop.\n\nMandarich likes to call it photography on steroids.\n\nCoverboy curse\n\nFrom the distance of three decades, the photo of Mandarich that graced the cover of Sports Illustrated in the spring of 1989 looks like a caricature of his brash arrogance. Shirtless, muscle-bound and wearing a black ballcap backward, Mandarich snarls as he glares into the lens. The cover line reads, “The incredible bulk.”\n\nHe was 22 then. The magazine cover was his chance to gloat to the entire country, he said. He thought it would vault his stock in the upcoming NFL Draft. The national magazine claimed he was “the best offensive line prospect ever.”\n\nIt worked to his advantage. He received the money and the fame.\n\nBut that cover dredges up different emotions for Mandarich now.\n\nHe failed in Green Bay. He was such a mess, he claims he practiced with a loaded syringe of painkillers in his jock strap. His poor performance revealed cracks in the facade. It also gave Mandarich a moniker he likely will never shake.\n\nIn November of 1992, Sports Illustrated put the nail in his professional football coffin with a cover entitled “The NFL’s incredible bust.”\n\nIt didn’t help that Future Hall of Famers Barry Sanders, Derrick Thomas and Deion Sanders were drafted after him.\n\nAlan Veingrad was the Packers’ starting right tackle when Mandarich was drafted. He was so sure that the 6-foot-6, 315-pound genetic freak from MSU was going to replace him on the line, he said he stayed in a hotel during the entire 1989 campaign in fear that he would be released.\n\nVeingrad said the hype surrounding Mandarich grabbed the attention of the entire locker room. So did his lack of production.\n\n“I kind of scratched my head, as well as my other teammates, around Tony’s career,” Veingrad said. “I couldn’t put my finger on it. I knew something was going on, but I couldn’t tell you what it was.”\n\nVeingrad, who still calls Mandarich his “claim to fame,” learned many years later, after reading Mandarich’s biography, “My Dirty Little Secrets — Steroids, Alcohol & God,” just how dire the times were for his former teammate.\n\n“It all came to light,” Veingrad said. “I wasn’t shocked to read that book. I was thrilled when I read it, and even more thrilled that he cleaned himself up and went on to resurrect himself with the Colts.”\n\nThat infamous Sports Illustrated cover serves as a humble reminder for Mandarich. Surprisingly, it has little to do with becoming a bust or what his NFL career was supposed to be.\n\nInstead, it piqued his interest in a hobby he always wanted to pursue.\n\nIt's the reason he sequesters himself inside this photo studio for another day of trial and error.\n\nThe day of that photo shoot, Mandarich became fascinated with the exposure and natural lighting of the photo itself. When he looks at that photo of himself, he doesn’t think about a summer in Los Angeles he spent lifting weights with professional bodybuilders on Venice Beach. His mind goes to the angle and what he would do differently.\n\nNot much, he says.\n\n“I don’t know if it could be better,” he says with a grin.\n\nNFL scouts and sportswriters used to say the same thing about him.\n\nState of steroids\n\nJack Ebling covered the Spartans for the Lansing State Journal from 1978 to 2003. He witnessed all but one of Mandarich's collegiate games.\n\nEbling recalled the first time he laid eyes on Mandarich, a lanky, 6-foot-5, 255-pound player without a position and the least-heralded recruit in the 1984 class. Former MSU assistant Nick Saban brought Mandarich to East Lansing. He was a project. He redshirted his first season. Ebling thought he would eventually play tight end.\n\nA few short years later, he would develop into the greatest run blocker in Big Ten history.\n\n“He is one of my favorite athletes of all-time,” said Ebling, who frequently has Mandarich as a guest on his local radio show. “I thought he was always fun to be around. He never dodged (the media), in fact, he sought us out. He was popular with his teammates, and he performed. He played big in big games.”\n\nOne of those MSU teammates was running back Blake Ezor.\n\nEzor, who played for the Spartans from 1986 to 1989, amassed 2,450 yards rushing behind Mandarich and the Spartans’ offensive line, including a career-high 1,496 yards and 11 touchdowns in 1988.\n\nThe first time he met Mandarich, it was the last day of freshman two-a-days and the upperclassmen had come to watch a much-anticipated race to see who the fastest player on the team was. In the end, that honor belonged to Ezor. The big offensive tackle took notice.\n\n“He grabbed me and hoisted me up,” Ezor laughed. “We were close.”\n\nEzor said Mandarich took him under his wing and even invited him to become his lifting partner. The two would hit local gyms instead of using the school’s weight room.\n\n“We would go work out there because it was showing off in the public,” he said.\n\nEzor said Mandarich was notorious for his humor on and off the field. He recalled times in the huddle that he would ask where the parties were going to be that night, and once told Ezor that he wanted to throw him into the student section after a touchdown so he could crowd surf.\n\nMandarich also had his intense side.\n\n“My goal was to (expletive) up Andre Rison’s Achilles by taking a defensive player downfield so far that I would block him into Rison. I’d tell him, ‘Watch your heels ‘cause this guy is going to be laying on them.' There were times I would. He’d see me out of the corner of his eye, and he would laugh.”\n\nRumors started to circulate during the 1986 season that Mandarich’s enhanced, 22-inch muscles might not be a product of hard work, but steroids. He vehemently denied the accusations until his book was published in 2009, the 20th anniversary of when he was drafted.\n\nIn Mandarich’s book, he talked about beating a drug test before the Rose Bowl in 1987. He said he used clean urine and taped a rubber hose and a squeaky toy for a dog down his back, capping it off with a piece of bubble gum.\n\nIt worked.\n\nEzor remembers that well.\n\n“Tony was so strong and fast,” Ezor said. “Steroids can get you there, but you still have to have ability. He had ability. He didn’t just shoot himself with a shot and become huge and fast. You have to work for that. He had better routine than our weight coach.”\n\nEbling called Mandarich’s steroid use “the worst kept secret at MSU.”\n\nBut the lying ate at Mandarich.\n\n“Fans would say stuff like, (expletive) people who think you are on steroids,” Mandarich recalled. “if you are going to call a spade a spade — and I’ll be the first to call myself a spade — lying all those years at MSU gives you guilt and shame. The next day, I stuck a needle in my ass.\n\n“I just beat the system.”\n\nThe comeback\n\nWhen Mandarich was an 11-year-old altar boy in Canada, he wrote a note to himself.\n\n“I’m going to play in the NFL.”\n\nEleven days into rehab in 1995, surrounded by other addicts, he made a mental note.\n\n“I am never using again.”\n\n“There was about 40 of us standing outside,” he said. “It was cold out, and we were all using tobacco. We were sharing stories among ourselves. No matter who they were — politicians, everyone — the pain was the same. The shame, guilt and remorse. My eyes were burning from the cigarette smoke, and I just sat up on the edge of my bed and was laughing. I mean, I was actually laughing. It was the first time in 10 years. I hadn’t laughed without a needle in my arm or a beer.\n\n“I thought, there are other sick (expletives) out there like me.”\n\nHolly Mandarich is Tony’s oldest daughter. She is 27 and a graphic designer in Vail, Colorado.\n\nShe was too young to remember the broken man or the player who didn’t live up to the billing. Occasionally someone will put two and two together when they hear her last name. She has heard the stories. She said her dad is very transparent, even with her.\n\n“It’s weird, because I understand the trials, tribulations in life, but hearing about it just makes me realize how much of just another human being he is,” Holly said. “His problems and the things were heightened because of media and his following. Really, it’s just another human struggling.”\n\nMandarich gives motivational speeches at local schools and to local churches and men’s groups. He has a cautionary tale. His goal is to lay out the facts and hope people don’t make the same mistakes he did.\n\nHe talks about his immigrant parents who fled communist Yugoslavia with one suitcase in search of a better life that led them to Canada.\n\nHe talks about his older brother, John, who played football at Kent State and became Tony's legal guardian so he could play high school football in the U.S. In 1993, John died of skin cancer. Tony wasn’t there. He was picking up painkillers. And when he did spend time with his brother in the hospital, the gravity of the situation didn't stick. Instead, jealousy came over Mandarich — his brother was receiving unlimited morphine.It wasn't fair, at the time.\n\nThat’s why the word “bust” doesn’t mean all that much to him. He lost himself. He forgot where he came from.\n\nMandarich got a second chance in 1996. The Indianapolis Colts took a flier on him. There, he produced for three seasons.\n\n“The biggest difference between Indy and Green Bay is I went to Indy and I shut up and I worked hard,” Mandarich said.\n\nThat lesson wasn't lost on his daughter.\n\n“One thing that has stuck with me is, I can have anything if I try hard enough,\" Holly Mandarich said. \"That applies in every situation, whether it’s getting sober or trying to get a degree.”\n\nEbling compares Mandarich’s journey to the movie \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" He had to fight, break out and crawl through miles of waste to get where he is today.\n\n“It’s tremendous,” he said. “Eventually, he saw the light.”\n\nAt one point in Mandarich’s life, he thought he would die drunk, high and alone. He came to terms with that reality. Numerous attempts to quit faltered. His will was broken.\n\nThen, he made a decision.\n\n“A nurse said to me, I want you to know that your best thinking got you here,” Mandarich recalled. “...She’s right. All of my grand plans have failed. They said, 'We have the answers if you listen,' and it hit me like a Louisville slugger. It made me take a step back. I didn’t have the answers.\n\n“I am so lucky I’m alive.”\n\nContact Cody Tucker at (517) 377-1070 or cjtucker@lsj.com and follow him on Twitter @CodyTucker_LSJ.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/25"}]}

Daniel Kim/The Seattle Times/AP In pictures: Winter storm impacts the US Prev Next\n\nIn all, more than 200 million people in the US were under wind chill alerts from the Canadian border to the Mexican border and from Washington state to Florida, with below-zero wind chills expected in the Southeast by Friday. Other winter weather alerts are in effect for blizzard conditions, ice, snow as well as flooding.\n\n“The National Weather Service’s Watch Warning graphic depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” the agency said Thursday.\n\nRecord cold Christmas Eve for many\n\nNotably, parts of Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming have already seen wind chills below minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the past two days.\n\nThe entire state of Texas was seeing temperatures below freezing by early Friday afternoon, according to weather observations from around the state.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned residents about the “epic, statewide hazard” of winter weather.\n\n“I called it a kitchen sink storm because it is throwing everything at us but the kitchen sink,” Hochul said at a press conference Friday afternoon. “We’ve had ice, flooding, snow, freezing temperatures, and everything that mother nature could wallop at us this weekend.”\n\nFor Brian Trzeciak, the storm was “living up to the warnings” at his home in Hamburg, New York. Buffalo’s airport, just to the north, reported zero visibility shortly after noon on Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions, frigid temperatures, and the waves are like what you would see during a hurricane,” he told CNN.\n\nHe and his family decided to cancel their Christmas plans because of the dangers from the storm.\n\n“My mother lives about 30 minutes away and so does my sister and her family, in the other direction,” he said. “We always get together for Christmas Eve and Christmas, but we’re all hunkering down in our houses until it all stops on Monday.”\n\nDriving bans are in place in Erie, Genesee, Niagara and Orleans counties in Western New York because of whiteout conditions.\n\nAs many as 250 people could be stranded in their cars in Erie County in a situation that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said put first responders at unnecessary risk. Brown told CNN Friday night that forecasts call for 36 to 48 inches of snow. The area has had wind gusts of 79 mph.\n\nMany will experience a cold holiday unlike any other: Atlanta, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Tallahassee, Florida, are all forecast to have their coldest high temperature ever recorded on December 24, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nWashington DC is forecast to see its second coldest Christmas Eve, only behind 1989. In New York, it will be the coldest Christmas Eve since 1906. Chicago is expecting temperatures to rebound above zero, but will still experience its coldest Christmas Eve since 1983.\n\nMuch of Florida will experience the peak of their cold on Christmas Day. It will be coldest Christmas Day since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nStorm expected to become ‘bomb cyclone’\n\nCars drive in whiteout conditions in Orchard Park, New York on Friday. Mark Mulville/The Buffalo News/AP\n\nOn Friday, the storm unleashed more heavy snow and blizzard conditions, particularly in the Midwest.\n\nAs it treks east across the country, the storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone,” a rapidly strengthening storm which drops 24 millibars of pressure within 24 hours. The storm’s pressure was forecast to match that of a Category 2 hurricane as it moved into the Great Lakes on Friday morning.\n\nGovernors in at least 13 states, including Georgia and North Carolina in the South, have implemented emergency measures to respond to the storm. Declarations of a state of emergency in several states have included the activation of National Guard units.\n\nMore than 5,500 Friday flights have already been canceled as of 9:30 p.m. ET, after nearly 2,700 cancellations on Thursday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.\n\n• It will remain very cold: Friday will bring record-low temperatures in large swaths of the US, including from the Lower Mississippi Valley, northeastward into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and stretching across large sections of the east from the Southeast, through the Southern to Central Appalachians and into the mid-Atlantic, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n• Dangerous wind chills: The plummeting temperatures will be accompanied by high winds, which will create dangerous wind chills across nearly all the central to eastern US.\n\n• Blizzard warnings: The Upper Midwest will see frigid temperatures, heavy snow and high winds. The warning applies to parts of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Michigan. Buffalo, New York, will go under a blizzard warning Friday morning. Such warnings go in effect when snow and wind of 35 mph will reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile for at least three hours.\n\n• Whiteout conditions: Blizzard conditions may exist even if snowfall stops, because high winds can pick up snow already on the ground and cause low visibility.\n\nSeparate storm system in Pacific Northwest\n\nA separate storm system is bringing heavy mixed precipitation to the Pacific Northwest on Friday.\n\nA winter storm warning is in effect for western Washington, including Seattle, until 7 p.m. PST Friday. Additional snowfall of up to 2 inches is possible and ice accumulations could reach a quarter of an inch. Precipitation will begin as snow and transition to sleet/freezing rain and then finally to rain. More power outages are likely and travel will be made very difficult.\n\nThe ice caused the closure of runways at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where nearly half of flights going into and out of the airport were canceled, according to FlightAware. Further, all express services for Sound Transit, a regional transportation network in the Seattle metro area, were suspended Friday due to the icy conditions.\n\nA winter storm warning is also in effect for northeastern Oregon, including Portland, from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST. Total snow and sleet accumulations of up to one inch and ice accumulations of .2 to .4 inches is likely as well as winds gusting to 55 mph. Wind chills as low as zero are possible, and frostbite is possible on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nOne of the biggest dangers of the massive winter storm besides heavy snow and blizzard conditions is the rapid drop in temperatures over a short period of time. The air will continue to get and feel colder, especially during night hours.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Ray Sanchez Eric Levenson", "Aya Elamroussi", "Ray Sanchez", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2021/05/13/arizona-is-depleting-groundwater-in-many-areas-researchers-warn/5059471001/", "title": "Arizona is depleting groundwater in many areas, researchers warn", "text": "In 1980, Arizona began regulating groundwater in the state’s largest cities and suburbs under a landmark law that called for most of these areas to achieve an overarching goal by 2025: a long-term balance between the amount of water pumped from the ground and the amount seeping back underground to replenish aquifers.\n\nForty-one years later, the state’s latest data shows most of the areas where groundwater is managed remain far from achieving a long-term balance, a goal known as “safe yield.” Groundwater is still overpumped in most of the state’s “active-management areas,” or AMAs. And in many places, aquifer levels continue to decline.\n\nIn a new report, researchers at Arizona State University warn that groundwater has been seriously overallocated under the current laws, allowing for unsustainable pumping that threatens the state’s water future. They say the state’s leaders urgently need to reform Arizona’s groundwater rules to safeguard these finite reserves and prevent aquifers from continuing to drop.\n\n“While 'safe yield' was intended to be sort of a substitute for sustainable groundwater use, that's not the way it has played out,” said Kathleen Ferris, a senior research fellow at ASU’s Kyl Center for Water Policy. “We aren't really sustainably using our groundwater, and we have got to figure out a way to do that, or I don't see a really bright future in the long term.”\n\nFerris and coauthor Sarah Porter, the Kyl Center’s director, said in their report that Arizona is overdue for new strategies to move toward sustainability and put the state’s groundwater house in order, especially in areas where aquifers are rapidly declining.\n\nIn many parts of the desert Southwest, the water that’s stored underground in aquifers soaked into the land thousands of years ago. And these ancient water reserves are being depleted as wells pump from aquifers to supply farmlands and desert cities.\n\nArizona also uses water from the Salt and Verde rivers, and from the Colorado River, delivered via the Central Arizona Project Canal. For years, Colorado River water has flowed into a network of basins, where the water has soaked down to recharge aquifers.\n\nBut more than two decades of hotter, drier conditions amplified by climate change have eroded the flow of the Colorado River and pushed the Southwest to the brink of shortages, shrinking the amount of water that’s available to offset pumping and replenish groundwater.\n\nFerris, a lawyer, helped draft the state’s 1980 Groundwater Management Act and later became director of the state Department of Water Resources. In the years since, she’s seen how the conservation requirements under that law have helped manage demands for water in Arizona cities. But she sees major weaknesses in the law, as well as rules that were subsequently adopted, and says the state doesn’t have adequate measures in place to sustain its groundwater for future generations.\n\n“Doing this report has sort of been breaking my heart,” Ferris told The Arizona Republic in an interview. “Because we can't allocate all our groundwater away and pump it all in a hundred years and just say, ‘OK, let's all move on.’ And I feel that's sort of the road we're starting to go down.”\n\nIf Arizona doesn’t stop now, “put some brakes on” and start to look at groundwater in a more sophisticated way, she said, at some point soon in the coming years, “it will be very bad here.”\n\nFormer Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who signed the 1980 groundwater act into law and later became U.S. Interior secretary, said the report provides a “really good analysis of where we stand and what it is that needs to be done.” By detailing the problems of groundwater overdraft in the managed areas, Babbitt said, it shows Arizona needs to bring its 41-year-old groundwater law “up to date.”\n\n“We've made a lot of progress, but what this report points out is that we haven't gone far enough, because we are still overdrafting groundwater,” Babbitt said. “I believe it is the most important issue facing Arizona today and that the future of our state very much depends on legislative action, which is way overdue.”\n\nRead the report: The Myth of Safe-yield: Pursuing the Goal of Safe-yield Isn't Saving Our Groundwater\n\nArizona in overdraft\n\nAt a basic level, according to Ferris and Porter, the overarching problem is that current laws allow too much groundwater to be pumped, which isn’t sustainable in the long run.\n\nThey wrote in their 58-page report that groundwater has been overallocated in the managed areas, that differing interpretations have muddled the goal of safe yield, and that conservation won’t be enough to achieve the goal as the situation now stands.\n\nThey also pointed out other weaknesses in the rules that have become obstacles to curbing declines in groundwater. Under the 1980 law, farmers who had been using wells in previous years were given “grandfathered rights” to continue relying on groundwater. Many of those farms, now interspersed with subdivisions and shopping malls, continue to pump large quantities.\n\nOther problems stem from geographic differences within each managed area. When the law created the five AMAs around Phoenix, Tucson, Prescott, and Santa Cruz and Pinal counties, the goal of safe yield was established for most of those areas, except Pinal. But because surface water is available in some places and not others, portions of the areas have seen chronic declines in water levels — a problem that managers of water agencies call “hydrologic disconnect.”\n\nIn the Phoenix AMA, for example, state data mapped by the Kyl Center shows groundwater levels in wells declined in parts of the area between 1998 and 2018, with drops ranging from a few feet to 67 feet, while water levels increased in other areas. Ferris and Porter said because the managed areas encompass multiple groundwater subbasins, even achieving an overall balance between pumping and recharge wouldn’t prevent dropping water levels.\n\nFor these reasons, they said, pursuing the goal of safe yield isn’t saving Arizona’s groundwater. They titled their report “The Myth of Safe-Yield.”\n\nThey included a table from a presentation by the Arizona Department of Water Resources that lists estimates of groundwater overdraft in a single year in the Phoenix, Prescott and Santa Cruz AMAs. The state’s numbers in those areas show a lot more water is being pumped each year than is going back into the ground with natural runoff and artificial recharge.\n\nThe Phoenix area recorded a large negative balance, more than 151,000 acre-feet of water, or 16% of total groundwater demand.\n\nThe Tucson area was described as being “at or around” safe yield but “unlikely” to remain there under a Colorado River shortage.\n\nWith the river now approaching an official shortage for the first time, Arizona is preparing for cutbacks next year. Initially, the cuts will reduce the amount flowing through the CAP Canal to farmlands in Pinal County.\n\nThe federal Bureau of Reclamation is expected to declare the shortage in August as the levels of Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, continue to drop. Ferris drew a parallel between the declining reservoir and the declining groundwater in Arizona.\n\n“If we could see the groundwater aquifers that serve as our underground reservoirs, many of them would be showing similar signs of stress as groundwater levels fall, the aquifers collapse, land subsides, and minerals and pollutants concentrate in the diminished supply that is left,” Ferris wrote in her preface. “If we could see that with our own eyes, perhaps we would understand, as we do with Lake Mead, the need to better manage the use of these finite water supplies.”\n\nAn analysis of state water-level data by The Arizona Republic in 2019 revealed major declines in aquifers in rural areas where large farms have expanded and there are no rules limiting pumping. The analysis also showed that in more than half the subbasins in the mostly urban managed areas, average water levels have declined since the 1980s even with imported surface water and restrictions on groundwater pumping.\n\nWhen aquifer levels decline, well owners and water suppliers must deal with higher pumping costs to pull water from greater depths.\n\nExcessive pumping has also altered the landscape in parts of Arizona and other Western states. When aquifer levels drop, the ground may sink to fill the spaces left underground. The sinking ground can leave fissures that damage roads, canals and other infrastructure, and crack the foundations of buildings.\n\nAnother issue is water quality. As groundwater levels drop, the concentrations of contaminants in the water can increase, requiring costly treatment.\n\nFerris and Porter cited a long list of problems with Arizona’s system of groundwater regulation that go beyond the original 1980 law. The Legislature in 1993 enacted changes that established the Central Arizona Groundwater Replenishment District and cleared the way for expanding development in areas that rely entirely on groundwater.\n\nThat change “made it possible to rely on groundwater as a 100-year assured water supply for new residential growth, even if pumping that groundwater depletes the usable supply underlying that growth,” Ferris and Porter wrote. And while the Groundwater Replenishment District is charged with securing surface water to make up for most of the pumping, it’s “not required to put water back in the ground in all of the areas where the groundwater is withdrawn.”\n\nThe state Department of Water Resources adopted new rules in 1995 that enabled new development to occur with calculations of an “assured water supply” based on allowing for groundwater to be pumped from depths of up to 1,000 feet underground in the Phoenix, Tucson and Prescott areas, and from as much as 1,100 feet underground in the Pinal area.\n\nThose thresholds are arbitrary, Ferris and Porter said, and far too deep.\n\n“The potential consequences of allowing so much groundwater to be withdrawn from depths of up to 1,100 feet below land surface should be every bit as concerning as falling Lake Mead water levels,” they wrote. “As groundwater levels decline, the availability of this resource for the future is severely reduced, and like the over-allocated Colorado River, Arizona's groundwater supplies are already over-committed in some areas.”\n\nA 'hidden crisis':Millions of wells are at risk of running dry, scientists find\n\nThey listed areas where problems have emerged, such as Pinal County, where in 2019 state water officials said their latest data showed insufficient groundwater available to meet expected demands, revealing a future shortfall that has brought new growth to a standstill.\n\nThey also cited parts of the West Valley, such as groundwater-dependent Buckeye, where city officials are grappling with questions of how to secure enough water to support their plans for growth.\n\nAnother overcommitted area is the Hassayampa subbasin in the Phoenix AMA, Ferris said.\n\n“Because of all the growth that's planned there, it cannot grow on groundwater. It will be a disaster,” she said.\n\nWhat's to change:Arizona has tried to safeguard groundwater beneath its big cities. But things are about to change\n\n'A house of cards'\n\nTheir findings build on an earlier 2019 report in which Ferris and Porter warned that there likely won't be enough water available from the Central Arizona Project in the long term to replenish the groundwater used by all of proliferating development that is planned in Arizona.\n\nThey voiced concerns that the Groundwater Replenishment District “will not be able to acquire the vast amounts of water needed to meet all of its expected future replenishment obligations.”\n\nAnd already, so much groundwater has been allocated, Ferris said, that “it's almost incomprehensible to me to figure out what in the world is going on with that and how that would ever be sustainable.”\n\nPlanning for future development on groundwater alone simply isn’t a secure long-term water supply, Ferris said.\n\n“It's kind of a house of cards,” Ferris said. “We aren't requiring a forward-looking acquisition of water… to make sure that those developments that go forward will actually have that groundwater replenished.”\n\n'Megadrought' in the West:Climate change is hitting the Colorado River 'incredibly hard'\n\nThey cited state figures detailing these concerns. They noted that Arizona has banked about 11 million acre-feet of surface water in aquifers since the mid-1990s. State officials have estimated that in the Phoenix AMA, about 84.5 million acre-feet of groundwater exists down to a depth of 1,000 feet, though some of this water may not be recoverable.\n\nThe Department of Water Resources has allocated at least 42 million acre-feet of groundwater over 100 years under its approvals, called “assured water supply determinations,” in the Hassayampa and Salt River Valley subbasins of the Phoenix AMA, according to the report. This “alarming quantity,” they said, does not include other groundwater pumping for cities, farms and industries that aren’t required to replenish the groundwater they use.\n\nState officials acknowledged in the latest management plan for the Phoenix AMA that the amount of groundwater that’s allowed to be pumped under grandfathered rights \"far exceeds the amount of groundwater available for pumping under safe-yield conditions.\"\n\n“It has been clear for at least 20 years that unreplenished pumping is the Achilles heel of the ability to reach safe-yield,” Ferris and Porter wrote.\n\nThe population of the Phoenix metropolitan area, meanwhile, continues to grow and is projected to increase by another million people over the next decade, putting greater strains on the water supplies.\n\n“Clearly, the same amount of water cannot be stretched to meet the needs of current customers and one million more,” they said.\n\nAfter four decades of groundwater regulation, they said, “there is no real prospect of any AMA sustaining a long-term balance between annual withdrawals and recharge.”\n\nThis leaves many areas vulnerable to declining water levels. And while overpumping threatens to exhaust aquifers, they wrote, pressures are growing on supplies of surface water due to what many scientists describe as a 21-year “megadrought” and the long-term “aridification” of the West — a drying trend that seems likely to persist with climate change.\n\n“Too much groundwater has been pumped to ignore these issues any longer,” Ferris and Porter wrote. “If Arizona is to prosper into the next century, our focus needs to turn to what is essential for our future — the preservation of our groundwater and our increasingly fragile aquifers. Our own survival is at stake.”\n\nPotential solutions\n\nFerris and Porter offered a list of recommendations to move toward sustainable groundwater management in Arizona’s urban areas. Some of their proposals include:\n\nAddressing long-term “grandfathered” groundwater rights by adopting measures such as a required 5% pumping reduction, a \"mined groundwater\" fee or a maximum allowable rate of groundwater declines.\n\nConsidering ways of encouraging new urban development on agricultural lands in managed areas, which would reduce water use.\n\nOffering incentives to encourage industrial water users to switch from groundwater to other supplies, such as treated wastewater, and taking away the Department of Water Resources’ authority to issue new permits for industries to pump groundwater.\n\nChanging the AMA-wide goal of safe yield to instead prevent “the chronic decline of groundwater levels in each subbasin.”\n\nBudgeting more funding for the Department of Water Resources to manage groundwater at a more local level.\n\nRequiring the department to release data annually detailing trends in each managed area.\n\nRequiring the department to prepare an updated hydrologic model for each subbasin “to determine the amount of groundwater in storage and the acceptable depth to which groundwater may be withdrawn.”\n\nTightening rules to require the Department of Water Resources to deny an application for a “certificate of assured water supply” for a new subdivision in the Phoenix, Tucson or Pinal areas if the proposed development is located in a subbasin where there is no site available to replenish groundwater.\n\nIn 2019, groundwater accounted for about 40% of water use in the area served by the CAP Canal. But as Colorado River water becomes less available, Ferris and Porter said, these areas will depend more and more on groundwater, which will become even more vital as a “savings account” for the future.\n\n“We can't address what's happening with the Colorado River and then just pump the hell out of our aquifers,” Ferris said during a meeting with The Republic’s Editorial Board.\n\nIn a separate interview with The Republic, Ferris and Porter said the state needs to take a more holistic approach, considering the effects of climate change alongside the problems of declining aquifers.\n\nIn considering future development, Porter said, what’s needed is “water-managed growth.”\n\n“We need to make sure that we are actively addressing water resilience challenges so that people are not vulnerable down the road,” Porter said.\n\nOver the past two years, a state-appointed committee has been meeting regularly to discuss groundwater management in the AMAs after 2025, when the fifth and final management period ends under the existing groundwater law. It’s one of four committee formed by Gov. Doug Ducey’s Water Augmentation, Innovation and Conservation Council.\n\nBeyond those talks, Ferris and Porter said, tackling the worsening groundwater problems — both in the regulated areas and in unregulated rural areas — will require bold action by state leaders.\n\nLately, however, Republican leaders in the Legislature have been backing very different ideas.\n\nThe state Senate this week passed a measure, introduced by Rep. Tim Dunn, R-Yuma, urging Congress to fund a study examining the idea of building a pipeline to carry floodwaters from the Mississippi River all the way to the Colorado River. The Legislature endorsed the idea with a 54-6 vote in the House and a 23-7 vote in the Senate.\n\n“It is never going to happen,” Ferris said.\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation already studied the idea and others like it in a 2012 study of water supply and demand in the Colorado River Basin, Ferris said. “It was rejected as not economically or environmentally feasible.”\n\nRather than chasing “unrealistic” ideas, Ferris said, the Legislature ought to be working on real solutions to address the continuing depletion of Arizona’s groundwater.\n\nRead the report\n\nThe Myth of Safe-yield: Pursuing the Goal of Safe-yield Isn't Saving Our Groundwater: https://morrisoninstitute.asu.edu/myth_of_safe_yield\n\nIan James covers water, climate change and the environment for The Arizona Republic.

But amid a prolonged megadrought that has depleted water resources across the Southwest, the need to save every drop has intensified in Southern Nevada.\n\nLas Vegas knows the stakes are high, and it isn’t gambling on Mother Nature to solve its water problems.\n\nInstead, the city is betting on extreme water-saving measures to keep the taps flowing. Here’s how it intends to win.\n\nBet 1: Banning mega-pools\n\nA home with a swimming pool abuts the desert on the edge of the Las Vegas Valley. John Locher/AP\n\nLas Vegans are no longer allowed to build giant swimming pools or spas at single-family homes.\n\nThe Southern Nevada Water Authority says there’s been a proliferation of giant pools – some larger than 3,000 square feet – in recent years. The new building code limits new pools to no more than 600 square feet – a move the Las Vegas Valley Water District says will save more than 32 million gallons of water over the next decade. The average pool size in southern Nevada is 470 square feet.\n\nThe idea was to prevent people from building pools that were more like “water features” at some homes, rather than recreational swimming pools, said Bronson Mack, public outreach officer for the Water Authority, which manages water resources for 2.2 million people including Las Vegas.\n\n“A lot of these more affluent homes, they’re not even occupied year-round,” Mack told CNN. “And yet they have all of this water in their backyard.”\n\nBet 2: Reclaiming all indoor water for reuse\n\nThe \"bathtub rings\" are seen around Lake Mead, a sign of how far the water level has dropped. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMost of the Water Authority’s conservation efforts focus on outdoor water. But indoor water can be recycled.\n\n“Water that we used indoors all gets reclaimed,” Mack said. “We treat that water to clean water standards, then return it to Lake Mead, our primary water source. Every gallon that we return to Lake Mead allows us to take another gallon out of the lake without counting against our limited water allocation.”\n\nAccording to the Water Authority, only 10% of its water comes from local groundwater. The other 90% comes from the Colorado River’s Lake Mead, the largest man-made reservoir in the country, which continues to fall to record lows. In April, the Water Authority had to decommission one of the original intake valves in the lake because the water level had fallen so low.\n\nAnd in August, the federal government enacted a Tier 2 shortage, which will limit the amount of water southern Nevada can pull from Lake Mead beginning in January by about 8.1 billion gallons a year.\n\nYet, on the Las Vegas Strip, glasses of water may still be served to restaurant customers since all that water will be recycled.\n\n“Even if you don’t drink that glass of water … they’re going to dump that down the drain, and all of that water gets reclaimed,” Mack said, noting this practice began in the 1950s. “That dish is going to go through the dishwasher – all of the dishwasher water gets reclaimed and recycled back to Lake Mead.”\n\nBet 3: Keeping the Vegas Strip water-savvy\n\nThe Bellagio fountain is an iconic feature of Las Vegas. It can lose up to 48 gallons of water per square foot per year due to evaporation alone. L.E. Baskow/AP\n\nAs for the Strip, the economic engine of southern Nevada, Mack said the region’s resort, casino and hotel sector is not as water-wasteful as it seems, despite its reputation for excess.\n\nMack said it only uses 5% of the community’s total water supply, while also making up its largest employment base, supporting some 40 million visitors a year.\n\nThere are also limitations on swimming pool size for the resorts based on the number of hotel rooms and guests they serve.\n\n“We could turn on every shower and every sink in every hotel room on the Las Vegas Strip, and it wouldn’t increase the amount of water we deplete from the Colorado River because all of that gets cycled back through our wastewater system, gets treated and returned to Lake Mead,” Mack explained.\n\nAs for the Las Vegas strip’s iconic fountains? They lose a lot of water to evaporation. According to the Water Authority, the fountain at the Bellagio is fed from a privately owned groundwater well and doesn’t use water from the Colorado River. But it estimates those outdoor water features can lose 48 gallons of water per square foot a year to evaporation – in a place where every drop counts.\n\nThe canals in the Venetian Resort recirculate their water, which does come from Colorado River. However, since the water is used indoors it can be reclaimed, Mack said.\n\nAs the climate crisis intensifies and water resources decline, the Las Vegas Valley Water District is considering a ban on all new ornamental water features at resort hotels, unless the feature is completely indoors and supplied by a privately owned water source.\n\nBet 4: Tearing out ‘nonfunctional’ grass\n\nLas Vegas has removed more than 200 million square feet of grass, incuding in residential front yards. Roger Kisby/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nGrass has been a major focus for conservation efforts in Las Vegas – especially grass that tends to be “nonfunctional,” or is merely ornamental, on medians, in front of commercial buildings and even in front yards.\n\nSince April, the Las Vegas Valley Water District has banned grass and spray-irrigation systems at all new properties. Schools, parks and cemeteries are exempt. Single-family homes built after 2003 are prohibited from having grass in front yards and limited on how much they can have in side and back yards.\n\n“We have removed more than 200 million square feet of grass from this valley, but there’s still about that much grass that remains,” Mack said.\n\nWhile getting rid of grass has been more widely embraced by homeowners, businesses have been slower to adapt. However, in 2021 the Nevada legislature passed a law that bans irrigating nonfunctional grass with water from the Colorado River.\n\nSNWA estimates the grass law will ultimately save 10% of its total water supply.\n\n“That’s more water than is consumed by the entire Las Vegas Strip,” Mack said, explaining that it takes 73 gallons of water per square foot every year to keep grass alive in the Mojave Desert. But drip-irrigated and drought-tolerant landscaping only requires 18 gallons per square foot a year.\n\nWatering grass “is the least efficient way” we can use water, Mack said.\n\nBet 5: Strict irrigation schedules year-round\n\nThe Water Authority also has a rotating watering schedule based on the time of the year.\n\nAs of September 1, outdoor watering is limited to three assigned days a week for the fall. On November 1, the winter schedule drops to one day a week before going back to three days for the spring, beginning March 1.\n\nIn the summer months, watering is permitted six days a week starting May 1, but never during the hottest time of day – between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. – when the water is prone to evaporation in the desert heat.\n\nWatering is always scheduled by neighborhood and is never permitted on Sunday.\n\nBet 6: Identifying water wasters\n\nSince everyone in a community is on the same watering schedule, it makes it easy to identify the people and businesses flouting the rules.\n\nThe Water Authority has water waste investigators who will contact property owners, highlight the waste and give them a chance to fix the issue. If the problem isn’t addressed, the owners will be fined, starting at $80 and then doubling for every subsequent violation.\n\nMack said there’s still water waste happening daily, but the water authority has enforced these rules for about a decade.\n\n“We had to be early adopters of that kind of activity,” Mack said.\n\nBet 7: Taking advantage of Mother Nature\n\nPeople navigate the rainy walkways at the Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas during a storm in late July. L.E. Baskow/AP\n\nWhen Mother Nature makes it rain, Las Vegas goes all in.\n\nThis summer, Las Vegas was hit with a couple of monsoonal rain storms that helped ease some of the region’s drought, but also left incredible damage in their wake. It only took a couple inches of rain for water to pour into casinos on the Strip.\n\nMuch of that storm water gets funneled into the Las Vegas Wash which flows out to Lake Mead. But even though it was a lot of water all at once, Lake Mead is huge, and it may only increase the lake level by fractions of an inch, Mack said.\n\nWhat’s most important when it does rain in the Las Vegas Valley, Mack explained, is getting customers to shut their irrigation off.\n\nDuring one week of extreme rain in August, the community turned off its irrigation systems and some of its air conditioning systems, which also use water.\n\n“That collectively saved about 250 million gallons of water,” Mack said. “Saving water is desert living and we are in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Our community has been a city in the desert and now we are finally becoming a desert city.”", "authors": ["Stephanie Elam"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/29/nightmare-roof-fire-starting-drones-pennywise-jeep-news-around-states/40468927/", "title": "'Nightmare' roof, fire-starting drones: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: An animal expert says fencing erected by the Alabama Department of Transportation is helping to protect an endangered turtle species. University of South Alabama herpetologist David Nelson tells AL.com the number of Alabama red-bellied turtles killed on the Mobile Bay Causeway dropped by more than 80% after fencing went up alongside it in 2008. In 2001, Nelson counted 580 Alabama red-bellies that were killed while crossing the causeway. Most of those were females traveling to or from nest sites or hatchlings. Transportation officials have also put up signs during the turtle’s peak nesting and hatching seasons that encourage drivers to be cautious.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Opponents of petroleum drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are preparing for a response to a possible petroleum lease sale. The Interior Department hopes to conduct a lease sale by the end of the year. More than 30 groups have joined the Arctic Refuge Defense Campaign, which is a coalition dedicated to protecting the refuge that provides breeding habitat to polar bears, migratory birds and the Porcupine Caribou Herd shared with Canada. Campaign director Desiree Sorenson-Groves says the environmental review for the sale was rushed and has flaws and will be challenged in court. Her group is also warning potential bidders that companies will face damage to their reputations if they bid on leases within the refuge because it will harm polar bears and other Arctic species.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A new report by an Arizona State University think tank questions whether the state can find enough water to replenish aquifers for pumping to new homes in fast-growing suburban areas without access to Colorado River water. The Arizona Daily Star reports that the Kyl Center for Water Policy report also suggests that the state revamp a landmark 1980 setting current policy on groundwater management. The report warns that some suburbs of Tucson and Phoenix will struggle to find enough water to keep growing without damaging underground aquifers by overpumping. According to the report, the result could be land subsidence, including ground fissures, lower water quality and even the possibility of wells drying up.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A woman woke up to find that her trailer filled with rare and ancient fossils, including dinosaur eggs that are 70 million-year-old dinosaur eggs, was gone. The trailer was taken late last month after Rodger Perkins, Gwynn Shafer and Paul Yumlu packed fossils in it for this month’s Greater Little Rock Gem, Mineral and Jewelry Show, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Perkins says the trailer had skulls of the perchoerus, a piglike mammal that is one of the rarest of fossils; the doglike cynodictis; the marine reptile keichousaurus; and a pair of baby rabbits that died nearly 15 million years ago. He says the fossils were worth nearly $20,000. Perkins doubts that whoever stole the trailer knew what was inside but says the thieves likely know how expensive the fossils are because they had price tags on them.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Clarita: Freshman Rep. Katie Hill, a rising Democratic star in the House, announced her resignation amid an ethics probe, saying explicit private photos of her with a campaign staffer had been “weaponized” by her husband and political operatives. The California Democrat, 32, had been hand-picked for a coveted leadership seat. But in recent days, compromising photos of Hill and purported text messages from her to a campaign staffer surfaced online in a right-wing publication and a British tabloid. The House ethics committee had launched an investigation into whether Hill had an inappropriate relationship with an aide in her congressional office, prohibited under House rules. Hill, one of the few openly bisexual women in Congress, has vowed to fight a “smear” campaign waged by a husband she called abusive.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: Planning is in the works to build a new Veterans Affairs clinic that will give veterans in northern Colorado better access to health care. The Cheyenne Veterans Affairs Health Care System announced that the Loveland clinic is expected to open by the winter of 2022. VA spokesman Sam House tells the Loveland Reporter-Herald that more than half of the population that is served in the Cheyenne system area comes from northern Colorado. House says the facility will more than double the space of the current Loveland and Fort Collins clinics combined and serve more than 200 veterans a day. Construction should start by next summer and take two years to complete. When the new facility opens in 2022, the VA will close its Fort Collins clinic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Haddam: Hundreds of acres in eastern Connecticut are in the process of being acquired by the state to expand existing parks and wildlife conservation areas, but thousands more need to be attained or protected in order to meet a fast-approaching goal of protecting 21% of Connecticut land as open space by 2023. Eric Hammerling, executive director of the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, says the state still has “a ways to go” and hopes officials will keep pushing to reach the goal. Last week, Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney announced $560,000 in federal funds to protect more than 400 acres in eastern Connecticut, including nearly 100 acres that will be added to the Devil’s Hopyard State Park in East Haddam.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state’s only NASCAR racetrack continues to shrink. Reflecting waning attendance nationwide for the popular motor sport, Dover International Speedway, also known as the Monster Mile, will reduce seating at its grandstands to 54,000 from 83,000. It is at least the third time that track owner Dover Motor Sports has removed thousands of seats at the facility in the past decade. Prior to 2009, capacity stood at 135,000. Rebuilding the grandstand with fewer seats will cost the publicly traded company $1.5 million. The project is underway and is scheduled to be complete before the racetrack’s spring NASCAR event.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Smithsonian’s National Zoo has announced the birth of one lesser kudu and the death of another. The Washington Post reports the male calf was born Oct. 14, just weeks after his grandmother died. Citing a news release, news outlets report the zoo says the healthy calf may make his public debut this fall. The calf was born to a kudu named Rogue, who was the daughter of a kudu named Shirley. The 9-year-old Shirley died late last month after what the zoo described as complications during the birthing process. Her calf was stillborn. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says the lesser kudu is a type of antelope considered to be “near threatened,” with a declining wild population of about 100,000.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Homeless people living with HIV now have secure locations in the city where they can store their expensive medications. Through the IDEA Exchange, patients can store their medicine in lockers at a converted shipping container office. They also can choose to have social workers deliver small quantities of the medicine to them. The program is run by the University of Miami. Prescriptions are paid for by Medicaid or a federal drug assistance program for low-income people living with HIV. Storing medication for the homeless has long been encouraged by public health experts. Washington, D.C., New York, Boston and other cities offer similar services. University of Miami physician Hansel Tookes, who directs the Miami program, says the initiative began in 2018 after an HIV outbreak among the city’s homeless.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The National Park Service says crews will spend several months cleaning out years of accumulating storm debris and dead wood around a Civil War-era fort on the Georgia coast. Fort Pulaski National Monument east of Savannah still has a large debris pile left over from the passing of hurricanes Matthew and Irma, as well as a tornado, in 2016 and 2017. Dead and damaged trees remain in the woods outside the fort. The Park Service says in a news release that a cleanup project will remove the debris and dead wood to reduce wildfire risks. Work began in October and is expected to continue until spring. Officials say the work may require temporary closure of some areas of the park outside Fort Pulaski.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Researchers have found the majority of plastic marine debris washing up on the state’s shores is from abroad. The Star-Advertiser reports the study conducted at Hawaii Pacific University revealed that pollution from north and east island beaches is washing ashore where there are fewer residents and tourists. Researchers say it is possible the debris swept in from as far as 3,000 miles away from the coasts of Asia, as well as the Americas. Researchers say more than 4,600 pieces of plastic debris were collected for the study from three sea surface areas, three seafloor dive sites and 11 shorelines. Researchers say based on weathering and chemical composition, the debris could tell experts where it came from and how it got to island shores.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials have made it more difficult for young transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificates despite a U.S. court ruling that appears to ban such obstacles. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare released comments from the public last week on a temporary rule requiring people younger than 18 to get approval from medical or mental health professionals before requesting the change. Many of the comments said they wanted the conservative state to go back to banning all gender changes on birth certificates. A federal judge ruled last year that an Idaho law barring transgender people from changing their birth certificates violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Health and Welfare’s board of directors complied with the order and changed the state’s rules last year. But this May, the board approved the temporary rule requiring anyone under 18 to get approval before requesting the change.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker is endorsing legislation that would allow college athletes in the state to make money from endorsements. During a Sunday interview on WGN-Radio, Pritzker said college athletes deserve the same opportunity as everyone else to earn compensation based on the use of their name and their image and likeness. Democratic state Rep. Emanuel Welch of Hillside has introduced legislation that would put Illinois in line with California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law this year allowing athletes at the state’s universities to use their names and likenesses to make money. The law also bans schools from kicking athletes off the team if they get paid. Illinois House Republican leader Jim Durkin of Western Springs said Sunday that he would urge his GOP colleagues to oppose Welch’s proposed legislation.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state will change the vendor of its teacher licensing exams following complaints about low pass rates under the current program. Test administrator ETS will replace Pearson starting in September 2021. The move comes after Republican state Sen. Jean Leising of Oldenburg introduced legislation this year requiring the state to adopt a national teacher licensing program to replace Pearson’s, which customizes exams to Indiana standards. The Tribune-Star reports Leising says the change will help address the state’s teacher shortage. Some people have said Pearson’s exams are too difficult. Tim McRoberts, associate executive director of the Indiana Association of School Principals, says Pearson doesn’t provide adequate study materials, which makes it difficult for students to prepare. He says there’s no doubt testing changes could be helpful.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: An eastern Iowa school district has secured federal grant funding to monitor students’ social media accounts for possible warning signs that students might harm themselves or their peers. The Iowa City Community School District received the grant from the U.S. Department of Justice. A portion of the $187,000 grant is earmarked to contract with a company that will scan social media posts. It’s part of a districtwide push to improve safety across the school district. School officials have not yet determined what all the monitoring will entail. School officials note that the district already has the right to look at the emails and Google Drive accounts of students who are using district technology.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kris Kobach has acknowledged in a diversion agreement that he failed to properly supervise his staff while representing himself as the then-Kansas secretary of state during federal court proceedings. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the confidential agreement resolves complaints made to the Kansas Disciplinary Administrator’s Office about Kobach’s conduct in a voter registration case. Details of the findings aren’t disclosed under Kansas rules, but a public notice of the agreement says Kobach stipulates he didn’t properly supervise lawyers and non-lawyers during the litigation. The lawsuit involved a challenge to a Kansas law requiring voters to show proof of citizenship to register to vote. The disciplinary administrator’s office says there was no finding of dishonest conduct by Kobach, who is seeking the Republican nomination for an open U.S. Senate seat.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Pennywise the clown has returned to terrorize Derby City, and he’s driving a 2005 Jeep Wrangler. The monster at the heart of the new “It: Chapter Two” film and the shape-shifting villain of Stephen King’s classic horror novel now sits in the driver’s seat next to Andrew Johnson, the owner of a modified SUV with a passenger-side steering wheel and a whole collection of creepy props and decals. The Louisville resident and self-employed auto mechanic has spent the past six years dressing up his two SUVs to fit certain themes. The “It” Jeep, though, has been his biggest hit yet. It has decals with popular phrases and references to the movie. It has theatrical blood sprayed across its white exterior – “if it gets wet,” Johnson says, “it actually drips.” It has two arms pulling poor Georgie’s yellow rain jacket into the Jeep’s grill. And it has a 6-foot-3 clown with glowing eyes and trademark red balloons in the driver’s seat.\n\nLouisiana\n\nCameron: What used to be Louisiana’s largest state wildlife refuge is celebrating its centennial. The Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge was 86,000 acres when the land was bought in 1914 and donated to the state in December 1919. Officials say it’s now down to about 71,500 acres. That’s about a 17% loss. The southwest Louisiana refuge has been a site for research to reduce coastal erosion, such as finding ways to build stone breakwaters light enough not to sink in the soft silt near what remains of the shore. There’s also been a great deal of wildlife research, including studies that helped alligators and bald eagles get off the endangered list. Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Jack Montoucet describes the refuge as a giant outdoor laboratory.\n\nMaine\n\nGeorgetown: An environmental group is working with shellfish farmers to grow more of a species of clam it thinks can better stand up to predators that have plagued the state’s harvest of bivalves. Seafood lovers have sought Maine’s softshell clams for decades, but the state’s harvesters are collecting fewer of those clams, in part because of the spread of crabs and worms that prey on them. Massachusetts-based group Manomet thinks the answer might lie in the aquaculture of quahogs, which are a harder species of clam associated more with Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The group is working with four shellfish farmers to grow quahogs in Maine and study the results. The federal government’s NOAA Sea Grant has taken notice and provided $65,000 to give the project a boost.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The State Department of Education has responded to concerns about Holocaust instruction by announcing plans to enhance and expand how it’s taught. A statement released by the department says the changes include teaching middle schoolers about anti-Semitism and strengthening Holocaust education for high schoolers. News outlets report advocates and elected officials had raised concerns about state curriculum guidelines. Baltimore Jewish Council executive director Howard Libit says the council thought the guidelines didn’t do enough to ensure students learn about the Holocaust. State Superintendent Karen B. Salmon said in the statement that the education department plans to provide teachers with tools to help them teach the Holocaust with confidence.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Worcester Polytechnic Institute has received a five-year, nearly $1.9 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to develop a robotic system to detect and monitor prostate cancer. Grant recipient Haichong Zhang, a biomedical engineer at the school, says his surgical imaging robot will be safer and more accurate than current tests, including ultrasounds and biopsies. Zhang tells The Telegram & Gazette he wants to create a minimally invasive, easily accessible and cost-effective way to better detect prostate cancer, which will affect one-fifth of all men at some point in their lives. Zhang is working on the project with Gregory Fischer, a professor of robotics and mechanical engineering at WPI.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A local museum will begin charging patrons from outside the Motor City area an admissions fee for the first time in seven years to remedy an increasing budget deficit. The Detroit News reports that the Detroit Historical Museum will charge adults $10, while seniors, students, active-duty military and first responders will pay $8. Children ages 6 to 17 will pay $6. Museum executive director Elana Rugh says the museum lost $297,000 in 2018. The museum’s 2019 operating budget is about $4.5 million. Residents of Detroit, Highland Park and Hamtramck will be able to enter at no cost. Detroit historian Ken Coleman says he worries the fee will prevent low-income people from other places from visiting the museum.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Clergy and immigration activists are trying to remove the name of a revered bishop from a federal building where hundreds of deportation orders are issued every year, calling the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown an affront to his memory. The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling houses the Minneapolis-area offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. It’s named for the first Episcopal bishop of Minnesota, who persuaded President Abraham Lincoln to pardon most of the 303 Dakota Indians sentenced to death after the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862, though 38 were still hanged in the largest mass execution in U.S. history. Now the Episcopal Church in Minnesota, the Minnesota Council of Churches and others want Whipple’s name taken off the building – or the eviction of ICE and its immigration courts. They’re planning a vigil and news conference outside it Tuesday to launch the “What Would Whipple Do?” campaign. They’ll also call on the Legislature to declare Minnesota a sanctuary state.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Phil Bryant says the state’s cash reserves are at their highest level ever. The Republican said Friday that the state Department of Finance and Administration has transferred just over $205 million into the state rainy day fund. The money was the unspent surplus for state government for the budget year that ended June 30. With the transfer, the rainy day fund has hit its limit, by law, of $554.8 million. Bryant said on Twitter that the amount of money in the fund is “the most in Mississippi’s history.” Republicans who lead the budget-writing process in the Legislature say conservative spending practices led to the surplus that filled the rainy day fund. Critics say Mississippi government is underfunding education, health care and other core services.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A state panel wants a test track for an ultra-high-speed Hyperloop system to be built in the Show-Me State. The group of elected officials and business leaders made the recommendation Monday as part of a study commissioned by the House speaker. Hyperloop technology involves a tubular track through which a train-like pod carries passengers at speeds of more than 600 mph. Advocates want to connect Kansas City to St. Louis with the high-speed system. The report says Missouri first would need to apply to be the site for a roughly 15-mile test track that could cost between $300 million and $500 million. The estimated cost to build a full hyperloop system across Missouri ranges from $30 million to $40 million per mile, or about $7.3 billion to $10.4 billion total.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: National Weather Service meteorologists say snowfall in the state has broken a 35-year-old record. Through Monday afternoon, more than 35 inches of snow has been recorded in Great Falls in September and October. Scientists say the amount sets a record for the timeframe beginning July 1, blasting past the previous record of 18.1 inches in 1984. Meteorologists say that is well over half of the 60 inches that routinely falls during an entire snow season. Meteorologists say snow is expected to continue with record-breaking cold through mid-November. Scientists say the average temperature in October has been 40.3 degrees, about 5.9 degrees below normal. Scientists say residents should be prepared as current weather continues to behave more like December or January.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: University of Nebraska-Lincoln researchers have launched a university-backed startup company to help prevent and fight wildfires with drones. The university on Monday announced the new business venture, Drone Amplified, which is headed by Carrick Detweiler, an associate professor of computer science and engineering. The company’s drone-mounted technology carries chemical spheres the size of pingpong balls. At the press of a button, the spheres ignite, intentionally sparking small fires to burn vegetation and deprive incoming wildfires of potential fuel. The drones can also be equipped with thermal cameras to help spot hotspots, and they can be used in situations that are unsafe for manned aircraft, such as low-visibility nighttime operations. University researchers tested the technology in 2016 with a controlled fire at the Homestead National Monument of America near Beatrice.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A developer who grew up going to the Huntridge Theater is poised to get city approval to buy the shuttered former movie house in central Las Vegas, renovate its damaged roof and convert it to an arts hub. J Dapper tells the Las Vegas Sun the architecture won’t change, but the building dating to 1943 could be converted into a concert venue, a performance auditorium or a community arts space. Dapper says he also hopes to put restaurants, condominiums or office space on the 4-acre parcel at Charleston Boulevard and Maryland Parkway to make the venture more profitable. Dapper needs city approval because the property has been listed since 1993 on the National Register of Historic Places. A City Council vote is scheduled Nov. 6.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: New Hampshire Attorney General Gordon MacDonald is telling residents to be aware of scammers targeting personal information through the use of popular phone-based word games, such as Words with Friends. The game’s app is downloaded for players to take turns building words in a crossword-style fashion, similar to Scrabble. Authorities say scammers use the app’s communication function to ask users questions to gain personal information that’s used to exploit the individual. They say scammers also try to seek a personal or romantic connection and urge the user to send gift cards, money and valuable property. Scammers also will send harmful links and ask users to switch to other platforms that make it easier for the scammer to access the user’s personal information. Authorities say players should only communicate with people known to them.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: Jersey rock royalty was onstage Sunday night in the state’s musical cradle as rocker Jon Bon Jovi brought crooner Southside Johnny Lyon with him into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. The two rockers played a duet at Asbury Park’s Convention Hall, where both had performed many times on their way up from Jersey shore local bar bands to worldwide stars. Pop rock band The Smithereens was also inducted this year. In the performing arts category, Jason Alexander, who played George Costanza on “Seinfeld,” made the cut. Inductees in the category of arts and letters included “Jaws” author Peter Benchley, longtime Star-Ledger sports columnist Jerry Izenberg, “Game of Thrones” author George R. R. Martin and photographer Timothy White.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State wildlife officials are rejoining direct efforts to manage endangered Mexican gray wolf populations in cooperation with the federal government and counterparts including Arizona. The New Mexico State Game Commission voted unanimously with one absence Friday to become a cooperating agency in the recovery program after leaving a pact in 2011. Wildlife Division Chief Stewart Liley says the agreement will make New Mexico a lead player in the program with greater discretion over management decisions amid concern among ranchers about livestock falling prey to wolves. The Mexican wolf is the rarest subspecies of gray wolf in North America and has struggled since releases into the wild in 1998. Surveys show at least 131 in the wild in the southern mountain ranges of New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The eastern hellbender will get more protection and the bald eagle and peregrine falcon will get less under proposed changes to New York’s list of endangered and threatened species. The Department of Environmental Conservation is proposing removal of 19 species from the state’s endangered and threatened list. Those species including the bald eagle and peregrine falcon show significant population growth, making them no longer threatened. There are now 390 pairs of breeding bald eagles in New York, compared to one pair when they were listed as endangered in 1973. The agency is proposing to add 18 other species as threatened or endangered. They include several species of freshwater mussels, the common nighthawk and the eastern hellbender salamander. Public comments on the list proposals are being taken until Dec. 24.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Parts of the state’s textile, agricultural and railroad past have been recognized as national historic places, a designation that can help preserve them. The state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources said in a news release that seven North Carolina properties have been added to the National Register of Historic Places. They include Caromount Mills in Rocky Mount; Sanford Tobacco Co. redrying plant and warehouse in Sanford; Carolina and Northwestern Railway freight depot in Lenoir; and Taylorsville Milling Co. roller mill in Taylorsville. Also added to the list were the T. Austin and Ernestine L. Finch house in Thomasville; the Gem Theatre in Kannapolis; and the Bunyan S. and Edith W. Womble house in Winston-Salem. Federal and state incentives are created to help preserve National Register places.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWillow City: Wildlife officials say a state game warden escaped serious injuries when he was attacked by a bull moose. Game & Fish Department Chief Game Warden Robert Timian tells KFGO radio that District Game Warden Jonathan Toftland was in the Willow City area Wednesday to investigate a report of an injured or sick bull moose. As Toftland approached the animal, it stood up and charged him, knocking him to the ground. The moose was killed. Timian says the outcome could have been “far worse” and credits help from others who were in the area for helping Toftland. The game warden was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital and released. Timian says investigators are trying to determine if the bull moose was sick.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Some state lawmakers say they hope to prevent numerous vehicle crashes by gradually installing rumble strips down the center of some roads. Ohio Rep. Timothy E. Ginter, a Salem Republican, is chief sponsor of a bill to require the state Department of Transportation to add rumble strips on all undivided, two-way highways with speed limits higher than 45 mph. The Dayton Daily News reports the House passed the bill unanimously in June, and the Senate Transportation Committee held a hearing on it last week. State Highway Patrol data shows more than 500 people have died in the past five years due to drivers crossing over the center of undivided Ohio highways. The Federal Highway Administration says rumble strips have reduced rural two-lane road crashes by about 45% nationwide.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group trying to prevent partisan gerrymandering of Oklahoma’s legislative and congressional districts is seeking a public vote on whether to create a new bipartisan commission to redraw district boundaries. A group that includes the president of the Oklahoma League of Women Voters and Let’s Fix This, an organization aimed at helping Oklahomans engage politically, filed its petition Monday with the Oklahoma Secretary of State’s Office. The group is seeking to gather enough signatures to place the proposed constitutional amendment on a statewide ballot. Under the plan, the power to draw both legislative and federal congressional districts would be transferred from the Legislature to a bipartisan commission. The commission would include an equal number of Republicans, Democrats and representatives unaffiliated with either party selected by a group of retired judges.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: A group of wine industry interests in the state have formed a new trade group. The Eugene Register-Guard reports the new coalition is called the Oregon Wine Council, and it has an agenda that differs from the Oregon Wine Association. Members of the new group earlier this year opposed wine legislation they viewed as anti-competitive. They claim to represent the interests of the entire state. Board member Sam Tannahill says the majority of large, taxpaying wine growers as well as many of small producers around the state don’t have a say in how their tax money is spent. A board member of the Oregon Wine Association, Justin King, says the argument that his organization is made up of selfish people from one area of the state is patently false.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: The front of a city bus was up in the air Monday after a sinkhole opened under it during rush hour downtown. The Port Authority of Allegheny County says only the driver and one passenger were aboard the bus when it plunged into the hole. The passenger was taken to a hospital for a minor injury Monday, and the driver was not injured. The agency tweeted that the bus was at a red light when the street gave way, and the rear half plunged into the hole. A photo shows the front of the bus pitched into the air and the front wheels of a car that was behind it dangling over the sinkhole’s edge. A tow truck was brought in late Monday to remove the bus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The governor and public school superintendents are trying to raise awareness about the importance of regularly reading to children. “SUPERS Read,” a statewide reading event, began Monday and continues through Nov. 8. Superintendents and other guest readers will read to infants and toddlers enrolled in local child care and Early Head Start programs. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo and education leaders will kick off the event Monday at the Children’s Workshop in Warren. Raimondo also plans to unveil an updated website that makes accessing state programs for young children and families more straightforward. The Rhode Island Association for the Education of Young Children, United Way of Rhode Island and Rhode Island KIDS COUNT organized the reading celebration to highlight the importance of reading to children to promote school readiness.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The director of the state’s prisons says his agency will begin classifying inmates by their behavior behind bars, not the crime they committed. Corrections Director Bryan Stirling says the reclassification could reduce the number of maximum-security inmates by 4,000. There are currently about 7,000 inmates in maximum security in South Carolina prisons. Stirling told The Post and Courier of Charleston moving inmates from maximum security will let them move in prison more freely, take more classes and go on work-release programs. They also can become eligible for parole quicker. To get out of maximum security, prison officials say inmates must not be in gangs and must follow the rules. Stirling says consolidating maximum security will allow his chronically short staff to concentrate on the worst behaved inmates.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Entrance and camping fees to state parks will likely cost more next year. The South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission has approved fee increases for 2020. An annual state park pass will be $36, an increase of $6. A day pass will be $8, a $2 increase. Camping fees for prime sites will increase $5 to $26, and preferred sites will increase from $19 to $23. The commission says a wet spring made 10% of campsites temporarily unavailable this year, and revenue is down by $1.9 million compared to last year. And it’s estimated that repairs to campsites, roads and boat ramps damaged by flooding will cost $8 million. The Rapid City Journal says the fee increases still need approval from the Legislature’s Interim Rules Committee.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A psychiatrist whose license was suspended last year for using riding crops on patients may now lose her license again over allegations that she violated her professional probation. The state Board of Medical Examiners says Dr. Valerie Augustus didn’t participate in therapy sessions or reimburse the state $50,000 for the cost of the case. The newspaper recently obtained new charges the state Department of Health filed against Augustus last month, accusing her of misconduct and violating a board order. The board has said the 57-year-old Christian Psychiatric Services operator used a crop or whip on at least 10 patients. Augustus appealed the ruling, saying the whipping was done jokingly. A hearing is set for January.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Houston Police Department has unveiled a new crime lab in a move to accelerate service and shed its scandal-ridden past linked to a backlog of rape kits. Police and city officials several years ago started the process of untangling the lab from the department and into an independent agency, the Houston Forensic Science Center. In 2014, the department transferred management of its crime lab to the center even though the physical lab remained in the Police Department’s downtown headquarters. The Houston Chronicle reports that authorities said the new facility was revealed last week and features state-of-the-art labs, ventilation systems and a consolidated design. The center’s president, Dr. Peter Stout, says the 83,000-square-foot space will serve as a model for the rest of the U.S.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A college professor has completed a massive project decorating the exterior of his house in an elaborate Halloween tribute to Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion and the “Nightmare Before Christmas.” Dixie State University professor Josh Pedersen studied more than 200 images of the attraction to model the design as close to the original as possible. He started by creating digital plans for an intricate pattern along his roofline, then printed the design using a large-format laser printer available at a university Makerspace. Once the pattern was cut out and attached to a base, he added 168 electric candles and 66 fake pumpkins. Many people pitched in to help with the installation, which took about a week. Pedersen says he’s wanted to do the project for years.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: The Vermont National Guard has received 14 noise complaints since the first two F-35 fighter planes arrived at the Burlington International Airport last month. Capt. Mike Arcovitch, whose office tracks noise complaints, says the complaints came from eight people, and two were anonymous. The F-35s are louder than the F-16s the guard used to fly. He says officials had expected more noise complaints when the new jets started flying from the South Burlington airport that is home to the Vermont Air National Guard. The guard took delivery last month of the first two of what will be 20 F-35s, all due in the state by summer. Arcovitch says the guard used to receive noise complaints about the F-16s as well, but he did not have a comparison.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State health regulators are asking lawmakers to greenlight a licensing system for music therapy. The Daily Press reports that regulators want to set credentialing standards for therapists as well as set up a system for the state to look into any complaints. Music therapy is used to help people with various medical conditions develop everything from language skills to motor coordination. It can provide a drug-free way to regulate moods in people with depression or foster socialization in those with limited means of communication. It gained popularity in veterans’ hospitals in World War II as doctors became interested in music’s ability to heal soldiers with both physical and mental problems.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An anti-tax activist is again bringing a $30 car-tab initiative to voters that would cut a major source of funding for transportation projects across the state. Sponsored by Tim Eyman, Initiative 976 would lower most taxes paid through annual vehicle registration to $30 and largely revoke the authority of state and local governments to add taxes and fees without voter approval. The measure would also repeal taxes and fees already in place, a move the state Office of Financial Management says could cost the state and local governments more than $4 billion in revenue over the next six years. Eyman says the November ballot measure is a chance for voters to tell their government that they voted years ago for $30 car tabs, and they meant it.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBluefield: Officials have pulled off a creative rescue of a malnourished German shepherd that was stuck in a dam. The Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports an animal control officer said the dog had probably been trapped in the Ada dam for several days before the rescue. The effort began Friday afternoon when a 911 call came in for an injured and skinny dog in the spillway. But rescuers couldn’t get into the dam, and its tall, steep walls made it impossible for the dog to climb out. So officials used a rope to lower a trap baited with food into the spillway. After about 2 1/ 2 hours, the dog finally went into the trap, and the rescue workers brought him to a shelter. There, they named him Lucky.\n\nWisconsin\n\nJanesville: Former House Speaker Paul Ryan has launched a new nonprofit organization he says will be focused on fighting poverty, increasing economic opportunities and advancing evidence-based public policies. Ryan announced the launch of the American Idea Foundation on Monday. He moved more than $7 million from his congressional account into the nonprofit when he announced its formation earlier this year. The foundation will be based in Ryan’s hometown, Janesville, though he moved his family to Maryland this year. Ryan decided against seeking re-election last year, ending his 20-year career in the House. The Republican from Janesville has kept a mostly low profile since then.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The Federal Communications Commission is expected to provide $12.1 million to expand broadband coverage to rural parts of the state over the next decade. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports three companies are expected to receive funds to extend service to more than 4,700 homes and businesses lacking high-speed internet access. The FCC says Inventive Wireless of Nebraska, Tri County Telephone and Union Telephone will receive funding. Officials say service will be expanded in seven counties: Albany, Big Horn, Niobrara, Park, Platte, Sublette and Uinta. A Wyoming State Broadband Program survey of more than 2,400 residents found 26.9% of respondents lacked reliable broadband.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/07/09/las-vegas-fountains-of-bellagio-hotel-casino-how-it-works-behind-scenes/1478575001/", "title": "Behind the scenes at the Fountains of Bellagio in Las Vegas with the ...", "text": "LAS VEGAS – Beneath the Bellagio is a secret cavern where the wrench turners dwell.\n\nGear grease and layers of strong sunblock cover the workers in this unseen section of the Las Vegas resort. On the job, some wear protective eye goggles and gloves, repairing circuit boards or sandblasting barnacles growing on the arms of machines built to shoot water streams 25 stories in the air.\n\nOthers slip into wet suits and sink into the 22 million gallons of water in a manmade lake that's become their office in search of strange items lost to the deep.\n\nThis behind-the-scenes slice of the Strip goes by another name.\n\n\"The Batcave,\" says the 51-year-old engineer leading the crew of 29 mechanics and divers that maintain the Fountains of Bellagio – a world-renowned water attraction approaching a quarter million shows and counting.\n\nMuch like comic book hero Batman's waterfall hideaway, few know the whereabouts of the Bellagio batcave – down an elevator and past several back-of-house hallways most tourists never see.\n\nBut the USA Today Network got a recent peek inside to learn about the people who make the waterworks work – the crew that keeps alive a vital piece of the Sin City experience.\n\nAn unexpected dive into the deep\n\nLoni Singer is a guy you might not recognize on the street, but he’s played many behind-the-curtain roles at memorable Las Vegas stops.\n\nA Vegas resident since 1980, when his family moved here from Los Angeles, Singer had many gigs along the Strip before landing his dream job – lead engineer at the Bellagio fountains.\n\n“I’ve been busy a lot of years,” said Singer, a former pyro technician who has hit the road with touring rock bands like AC/DC and the Rolling Stones.\n\nHe got his start in backstage work in the Army. He had an interest in operating heavy equipment, but there were no jobs like that open at the time, so he instead learned how to maintain heavy equipment ­– like scissor lifts that allow workers to climb great heights with heavy loads.\n\nA Desert Storm veteran by the time he left the military, Singer landed a job with a company that put him backstage at the famous Siegfried and Roy show at the Mirage.\n\nHe soon made connections that would move him closer to the water.\n\n“One of the production managers would see me every day, and I would come over there, and I made friends,” Singer said. \"He told me they’re going to build this really cool attraction at Treasure Island that used pirate boats that actually moved with hydraulic cylinders and pulley systems – and would I be interested in interviewing?”\n\nSinger clinched the gig with a soon-to-be sellout show called the “Battle of Buccaneer Bay” – a position he would hold for seven years. It’s a turning point the tradesman never forgot.\n\n“I got a seven dollar raise the day I signed,” Singer said of the life-changing pay bump. “I was so excited.”\n\nIn 1997, MGM moved Singer to the Bellagio, where crews had built a lake that had not yet been filled. It’s been more than two decades since Singer moved, and he’s still in the batcave.\n\nHere, no day is typical. A 10-hour shift might mean repairing equipment in the shop, chasing out wildlife or retrieving items lost or tossed – like the big catfish someone set free one time – in the water.\n\nWhat makes the Bellagio Fountains work?\n\nUnder the 22 millions gallons of water known as Lake Como are four types of water shooting devices, each playing a big role in every Fountains of Bellagio production.\n\n• Oarsmen: The machines that spray water in a movable stream 77 feet into air. The moving stream makes the water move like it is dancing. One of the 208 oarsman in the lake packs the power to push 140 gallons per minute.\n\n• Mini-shooters, super-shooters and extreme-shooters: The machines that shoot water 100 feet, 240 feet and 460 feet into the air, respectively. In the lake are 798 mini-shooters, 198 super-shooters and 16 extreme-shooters.\n\nHere's a breakdown of those components in the fountain:\n\nComputers and buttons in a crow’s nest control room in the Bellagio that overlooks the water control more than 1,200 machines.\n\nTo reach the shooters and oarsman, divers float on a barge carrying the tools they need to work on the devices. Water temperatures in the winter drop as low as 50 degrees and in the summer hover around 85 degrees.\n\nBut it’s not the water the divers that make divers worry. It’s the sun.\n\n\"This is mild,\" said a diver named Peter Buckley, his face covered in a heavy white cream. \"When I go hardcore – it sounds crazy – but I use Burt's beeswax diaper rash [cream] because it does not come off. At all.\"\n\nA gig earning a paycheck underwater may seem out of place in the middle of the desert – and the depths of Bellagio's lake is far from Shangri-La for the divers here. But to some of the crew, before there was this job there was a dream of one like it.\n\n“I grew up as a kid watching ‘Sea Hunt’ and ‘Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea’ and all that stuff,” said Mark Renner, a 62-year-old diver.\n\nRenner spent the first half of his life in the landlocked town of New Philadelphia, Ohio. A career as an industrial switch operator led him to Las Vegas, where a pair of layoffs followed. Stranded in Las Vegas, an idea struck him, a seed from a youth spent watching seafaring adventures on television.\n\n“Of all places, I thought, ‘Well, I can find someplace to dive out here,’\" Renner said, \"and I learned how to dive and loved it.\"\n\nLost and found\n\nIf there's one good bet in Las Vegas, it's this: A tourist will get too close to the edge and drop something in the Bellagio's water.\n\n“You don’t even want to mention all the stuff we found in our lake over the years – anything from a wedding ring to full sets of people’s clothing,” Renner said. “Lots of cell phones, car keys, room keys, a little of everything.”\n\nA filtration system helps the divers bucket two tons of coins out of the lake every year – money that's donated to charity.\n\n\"I can't give you an exact number,\" Singer said, \"but it's a lot.\"\n\nIn an installment of James Corden's signature \"Carpool Karaoke,\" he and Celine Dion started to sing \"My Heart Will Go On\" from \"Titanic\" before Corden decided his Range Rover wasn't a big-enough setting.\n\nThe scene cut to the duo on a makeshift bow of a ship in front of the fountains. Eventually, Dion dropped a fake Heart of the Ocean necklace into the water.\n\n\"We actually found the jewel they dropped,\" Singer said. \"It was really nice to actually see Celine Dion before she retired, which was kinda cool. She was super cool lady – gave me a fist bump.\"\n\nUnexpected guests\n\nAt 5 a.m., when the door the bat cave door opens at the shores of the lake, there's usually a flock of visitors waiting to snag a bite to eat.\n\nDucks – and lots of them, hungry and floating under the sun.\n\n“They come in and out,” Singer said. “They come in my office. We used to have 80 at one time. We had a former manager that liked to feed them.\"\n\nYou might think the bulk of duck snackage means stray potato chips or a torn-off corners of a sandwich tossed in the water, but it's a little more exotic than that.\n\n\"We gave them Koi food,\" Singer said. \"It's protein-based, but they eat anything – popcorn.\"\n\nEventually, bat cave employees had to stop feeding the ducks.\n\n\"They become kind of a nuisance,\" Singer said. \"But we let them co-exist with us.\"\n\nWhile the fountain waters are considered the lake of the Las Vegas Strip, you won't find any fish here – unless, of course, someone releases one.\n\n\"Someone threw a catfish in one time, but we got it out,\" Singer said. \"I couldn't believe it. Between that and the few people who might fall in the water occasionally, that doesn't happen.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/14/china-us-countries-that-produce-the-most-co-2-emissions/39548763/", "title": "25 Countries That Produce the Most CO2 Emissions – 24/7 Wall St.", "text": "Thomas C. Frohlich and Liz Blossom\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nDespite long-standing warnings of a climate emergency as well as efforts by some nations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the worldwide use of fossil fuels – and with it global greenhouse gas emissions – grew last year.\n\nA number of potential disaster scenarios caused by climate change remain well documented. And yet, increasing demand for coal, oil, and natural gas drove the increase in GHG emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nTo determine the countries emitting the most CO2, 24/7 Wall St. ranked countries based on territorial emissions – millions of metric tons of carbon emitted from fossil fuels and cement production within a country's borders – in 2017 published by the Global Carbon Project 2018. This report and our analysis focuses only on fossil fuel-generated CO2 emissions, the single most important greenhouse gas and by far the largest contributor to anthropogenic warming.\n\nClimate refugee crises:They're happening right now. Here's how you can help\n\nCement, in particular, and natural resources extraction and processing in general, contribute massively to CO2 emissions. A recent report found that the majority of carbon emissions are created by such processes, even before any fuel is burned.\n\nResource extraction has more than tripled since 1970 and continues to accelerate, even though the population has only doubled in that time, according to the United Nations’ Global Resources Outlook 2019. Perhaps it is no surprise that the countries emitting the most CO2 are also often among the countries that control the world’s oil.\n\n25. Malaysia\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 254.6 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 8.1 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 241.9%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 34.3 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 31.6 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $26,824\n\nMalaysia has experienced tremendous economic growth in the last four decades, moving rapidly from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy. This expansion has meant more factories, automobiles, and power plants, all of which enormously escalated energy demands.\n\nThat demand has pushed Malaysia's CO2 emissions to 254.58 million metric tons, or 8.1 metric tons per person in 2017, a 241.9% rise over 25 years.\n\nAt the end of 2017, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak set a target of a 45% reduction from 2005 emissions levels by 2030, and for the country to be carbon neutral by 2050. Emissions, however, continue to rise as Malaysia finds itself unable to make the larger efforts needed to wean itself off fossil fuels, particularly cheap – but dirty – coal.\n\n24. Taiwan\n\n• C2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 271.5 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 11.5 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 89.4%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): Not available\n\n• Population (2017): 23.5 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): Not available\n\nMost of the countries emitting the most CO2 are also among the top emitters on a per capita basis, and Taiwan is no exception. The 271.53 million metric tons of CO2 from fossil fuels, or about 11.5 metric tons per person, are each in the highest 25 for countries worldwide.\n\nTaiwan is attempting to move away from nuclear power, a zero emission source of energy but one with many other issues – environmental and otherwise. In doing so, however, the nation has increased its dependency on coal, failing to move forward with alternative energy technology.\n\n23. Spain\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 281.4 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 6.0 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 12.4%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 37.2 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 46.6 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $34,269\n\nThough it has a much larger GDP than Taiwan and twice the population, Spain's CO2 output is only slightly higher. CO2 emissions from Spain have fallen since their peak in 2005, but they are up by 12.4% compared to 1992. Spain's CO2 emissions ranked ninth in 2017 out of the 51 European and Central Asian countries examined.\n\nThe country's recently-elected Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is determined to make Spain a leader in GHG emissions reductions within the European Union and has proposed a plan that would end the burning of fossil fuels by 2050.\n\n22. Kazakhstan\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 292.6 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 16.2 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 25.6%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 71.4 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 18.0 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $24,079\n\nKazakhstan's carbon dioxide output is immense, particularly relative to its population, with a per capita emission rate of 16.2 metric tons in 2017. Carbon emissions from the country's energy sector amount to 85% of its annual GHG emissions, but the country has been slow to act on the need to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and put alternative energy sources in place. Instead, it is focused on updating its coal plants and creating more natural gas plant capacity, carrying its reliance on fossil fuels into the future.\n\n21. Poland\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 326.6 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 8.6 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: -10.2%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 65.1 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 38.0 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $27,344\n\nThough Poland reduced its carbon output by 10.2% between 1992 and 2017, the country's CO2 emissions are the 21st largest in the world and sixth largest in Europe.\n\nPoland has not shown a great deal of enthusiasm for climate measures. A law that took effect in 2016 may be discouraging the development of wind energy and. In climate negotiations, Poland has put forth a set of priorities above climate policy, including reducing poverty and hunger and increasing energy security. Still, because of its heavy historical dependence on coal, there are clear paths to carbon reduction in Poland as coal is phased out.\n\n20. Thailand\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 330.84 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 4.8 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 206.1%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 106.5 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 69.0 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $16,279\n\nThailand's GDP quadrupled and its CO2 emissions tripled between 1992 and 2017. Thailand's energy production from coal expanded by 31.6% between 2006 and 2016 – even as it made a major shift to natural gas.\n\nThailand has announced in the last few years aggressive goals in reducing its carbon output. Most recently, the country said it will reduce its GHG emissions by 20% by 2030 through increased alternative energy production and improved mass transit.\n\n19. Italy\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 355.45 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 5.9 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: -19.1%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 35.2 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 60.5 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $35,343\n\nItaly's carbon dioxide emissions peaked in 2004 at 495.5 million metric tons, and then declined to 348.5 million metric tons in 2014. While Italy's CO2 emissions ticked up in 2017, they were down 19.1% from 1992.\n\nThe country reduced its GHG emissions by significantly increasing renewable sources of energy. Between 2006 and 2016, Italy's energy generation from renewable sources rose 17.0% annually from 3.4 million to 15.5 million tons of oil equivalent.\n\n18. France\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 356.3 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 5.3 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: -14.9%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 81.2 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 67.1 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $38,808\n\nFrance and Spain have similar levels of per capita emissions, though France has a higher GDP per capita. Because of France's reliance on nuclear power over the past 40 years, it has produced relatively low, and declining, CO2 emissions. Close to 80% of electricity produced in France comes from nuclear power, the highest such share of any country in the world.\n\nIn recent years, France has also reduced its carbon footprint with a strong move toward renewable energy. According to British Petroleum's (BP) June 2018 Statistics Review of World Energy, energy generation in France from renewable sources rose by 19.9% a year between 2006 and 2016.\n\n17. United Kingdom\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 384.7 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 5.8 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: -35.2%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 59.0 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 66.0 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $39,884\n\nWhile the United Kingdom ranks among the top emitters of carbon, it has significantly reduced its carbon emissions – by about 35% between 1992 and 2017. Only a few countries in the world can claim any reduction at all, and most of them not nearly the reduction that the U.K. has managed.\n\nThe biggest reason for the U.K.'s success in reducing its carbon output is the country's phasing out of coal-fired power in favor of natural gas and renewables. Other factors include improved energy efficiency from both the residential sector and industry.\n\n16. Australia\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 413.1 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 16.8 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 45.0%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 125.6 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 24.6 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $44,643\n\nWith less than half the population of Great Britain, Australia also had less than half the carbon emissions of the U.K. in 1992. By 2017, the relative carbon output shifted dramatically, with Australia emitting more than the U.K. as Britain reduced its use of fossil fuels.\n\nOver the last decade, Australia's emissions from energy production have leveled off, but emissions from industrial and transportation sources have increased significantly. Though Australia has added to its renewable energy resources, it is still planning a new coal-fired power plant and may have a difficult time meeting its Paris Agreement obligations.\n\n15. Turkey\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 447.9 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 5.5 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 181.6%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 78.9 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 80.7 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $25,135\n\nTurkey greatly increased its CO2 emissions over the 25 years through 2017, from 159.1 million metric tons to 447.9 million metric tons – an increase of 181.6%. This is only partially explained by the significant increase in population – a nearly 45% population growth between 1992 and 2017. Economic growth in Turkey has also contributed to growing CO2 emissions, with the economy tripling in size over the last two decades.\n\nThe country, however, is heavily reliant on coal for energy. Its lack of a clear target or cohesive plan for greenhouse gas reduction is one roadblock to its entry into the EU.\n\n14. South Africa\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 456.3 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 8.0 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 51.6%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 63.2 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 56.7 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $12,294\n\nSouth Africa has had a similar percentage population growth as Turkey but with a much smaller increase in CO2 emissions, partly due to a slowing economy. Like Turkey, it is heavily reliant on coal for its energy, but last August new President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a plan to close 35 of the country's 42 coal plants by 2050 and shift to natural gas and renewable energy. Even considering South Africa's social problems, particularly poverty and inequality, Climate Action Tracker (CAT), a consortium of research organizations tracking worldwide progress on climate action, has criticized the plan as \"highly insufficient\" for meeting the country's Paris Agreement goals.\n\n13. Brazil\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 476.1 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 2.3 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 118.0%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 477.1 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 209.3 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $14,137\n\nBrazil's greenhouse gas emission sources are very different from other high emission countries. In 2015, the country produced 61.8% of its electricity from hydroelectric sources, which while down from 92.4% in 1992, was still among the highest such shares of any country in the world. While hydroelectric sources contribute less to CO2 emissions than other sources, Brazil's CO2 emissions still rose by 118% over the 25 years through 2017. The country also has a massive output of methane – a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2.\n\nThe country's large spikes in total GHG emissions are the result of the agricultural sector and the loss of forested land, which functions as a \"carbon sink,\" absorbing CO2. While polls show that most Brazilians are concerned about climate change, the current administration appears to be deferential to agriculture interests and uninclined to curb deforestation. Deforestation of the Amazon climbed by 29% in 2016, resulting in nearly 2 million acres lost.\n\n12. Indonesia\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 486.8 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 1.8 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 139.0%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 223.3 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 264.0 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $11,189\n\nIndonesia looks a lot like Brazil and South Africa in its level of CO2 emissions, but its population is nearly the size of both countries' populations combined. All three countries have relatively low GDP per capita. But while Indonesia has the lowest GDP per capita of the three nations, its economy grew twice as fast between 1992 and 2017. This can provide some explanation for its greater increase in emissions during that time period than the other two countries.\n\nIndonesia's economy is likely to become even more carbon intensive with its growing middle class, automobile use, and energy demands, and with the government's focus on more coal-fired power plants instead of renewables.\n\n11. Mexico\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 490.3 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 3.8 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 46.7%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 116.7 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 129.2 million\n\n• DP per capita (2017): $17,331\n\nMexico emits about the same amount of carbon as Indonesia but with half the population. Until recently, Mexico had set aggressive climate change goals and had been on a path toward carbon reduction and cleaner energy. Today, the country's politics are moving it in a direction more in line with that of Indonesia, with renewable energy planning replaced with a comprehensive upgrading of aging fossil fuel plants and a heavy reliance on coal.\n\n10. Canada\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 572.8 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 15.6 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 22.2%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 106.8 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 36.7 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $44,018\n\nOut of the 25 top CO2 emitters, Canada has close to the highest per capita carbon emission rate at 15.6 metric tons. Largely to blame for this ignominious status is its huge landmass and dispersed population as well as the country's extreme temperatures – Canadians live energy-intensive lives. While some progress has been made in the development of renewable energy resources – which have nearly quadrupled since 2007 to the equivalent of 10 million tons of oil – efforts to curb CO2 have been undermined by huge subsidies to the coal and oil and gas industries, amounting to $3.3 billion annually, according to Environmental Defence, a Canadian environmental advocacy organization.\n\nThough the government insists Canada is on track to meet its Paris Agreement goal of reducing carbon emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030, projections show the country is behind.\n\n9. South Korea\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 616.1 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 12.0 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 118.3%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 32.6 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 51.5 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $35,938\n\nSouth Korea is responsible for 1.7% of the global carbon output, though South Koreans make up only 0.7% of the global population. With its fast-growing economy, GDP more than tripled and CO2 emissions more than doubled between 1992 and 2017, with more cars on the road and a growing demand for energy for residential use.\n\nKorea has pledged to reduce its GHG output by 37% by 2030, but at the same time, it has built only a tiny amount of alternative energy infrastructure and is planning to construct 20 new coal plants in the next three years.\n\n8. Saudi Arabia\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 635.0 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 19.3 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 122.8%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 62.9 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 32.9 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $48,986\n\nBetween 1992 and 2017, the population and economy of Saudi Arabia nearly doubled. With this phenomenal growth came phenomenal CO2 emissions growth of 122.8% over thE 25 year period.\n\nAs the world's largest oil producer, it is not surprising that virtually all of the country's energy comes from oil and gas, with a miniscule amount of 0.1% in 2017 from renewables. While Saudi Arabia was seen by many in the early 1990s as taking an obstructionist position toward international climate negotiations and skepticism toward climate science, it signed the Paris climate agreement, with the caveat that its economy must not suffer an \"abnormal burden.\"\n\n7. Iran\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 672.3 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 8.3 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 196.2%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 121.3 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 81.2 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $18,983\n\nLike Saudi Arabia, Iran's population growth was fast, at nearly 40%, and in its GDP more than doubled from 1992 to 2017. This growth was accompanied by a similar increase in CO2 emissions. The similarities end here. Iran's GDP per capita is less than half that of Saudi Arabia, and it has been struggling under economic sanctions for many years. Also, unlike its neighbor across the Persian Gulf, Iran was an early signer of the Paris Agreement and has made pursuing a green economy a priority. It has pledged to slash emissions and reform its energy sector, having received promises from the EU for help with technology.\n\nClimate change has had a strong impact on Iran, which has faced numerous ecological problems tied to the climate emergency – from shrinking lakes and rivers to floods and droughts. Lake Urmia, the largest in the Middle East, may be completely dry in six to nine years.\n\n6. Germany\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 799.4 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 9.7 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: -17.3%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 55.7 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 82.7 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $45,446\n\nGermany is showing progress in carbon reduction, having lowered its output by over 17% between 1992 and 2016. The country also has the most aggressive plan for further reductions than any other EU nation. While many climate scientists argue for the continuation, and even expansion, of nuclear power because of its zero emissions, Germany is phasing out its nuclear plants. While CO2 emissions from most countries on this list have increased substantially between 1992 and 2017, Germany's CO2 emissions declined by 17.3% over that period.\n\nThe country, however, is still heavily dependent on coal – and most of its plants burn lignite, the dirtiest coal. In 2015, Germany generated 44.3% of its electricity from coal sources.\n\n5. Japan\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 1,205.1 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 9.5 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 2.4%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 39.0 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 126.8 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $39,011\n\nJapan's CO2 emissions peaked in the three years following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, reaching 1,314 million metric tons of CO2 in 2013. Emissions have since been reduced to pre-2011 levels as the country has increased its use of renewables – now about 5% of its energy mix. Still, Japan is heavily reliant on oil and is criticized for its promotion of coal and technology to reduce CO2 emissions from coal.\n\n4. Russian Federation\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 1,692.8 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 11.7 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: -15.1%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 545.8 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 144.5 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $24,790\n\nCoal remains one of the world's largest sources of energy production. Approximately 40% of electricity produced worldwide came from coal sources in 2015. Russia is somewhat of an exception, relying heavily over the past 25 years on natural gas for electricity production – gas was the source of roughly half of the country's electricity production in both 1992 and 2015. The nation's coal production, however, has also surged over the same period. Russia is the sixth largest coal-producing nation in the world, and coal production has risen by 70% since the late 1990s to 373 million metric tons in 2015. According to the nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project's Carbon Majors Database, the growth has been driven largely by the coal industry's expansion into Southwest Siberia, where the Kuznetsk coal basin is located.\n\nRussia's population is 2.8% smaller than it was 25 years ago, one of only two countries on this list to report a population decline since 1992. This could partially account for the 15.1% reduction in overall CO2 emissions from Russia.\n\n3. India\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 2,466.8 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 1.8 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 253.0%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 636.4 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 1.34 billion\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $6,514\n\nAs is generally the case in the countries emitting the most CO2, a small group of companies accounts for a huge portion of emissions in India. Notably, state-owned Coal India alone emitted the equivalent of just over 1 billion metric tons of CO2 in 2015, or 2.4% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions. This has placed the company among the world's five corporations emitting the most CO2, according to the Carbon Majors Database.\n\nWhile many of the world's large national CO2 emitters have in recent decades reduced their reliance on coal as a source of electricity, India's coal usage has risen – from 68% of electricity production in 1992 to 75% in 2015.\n\n2. USA\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 5,269.5 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 16.2 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 1.8%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 499.8 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 325.1 million\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $54,471\n\nThe United States was the world's largest national CO2 emitter until 2006, when China surpassed U.S. emissions that year of 6,019 million metric tons of CO2. And while U.S. emissions have declined since, China's emissions have steadily increased.\n\nU.S. electricity production from coal sources has dropped in recent decades, from over half in 1992 to about a third of electricity production in 2015. At the same time, however, the United States has become the world's largest producer of crude oil and significantly ramped up natural gas production and usage – though natural gas use results in relatively less CO2 emissions, the methane output during its production and destructive extraction techniques are by no means more environmentally friendly. Over the 25-year period through 2015, U.S. electricity production from natural gas sources grew from 13.1% to 31.9% of total electricity generated. In 2012, the latest data year, nearly 500 million metric tons of methane, a far more harmful GHG, was emitted by the United States, the fourth highest amount of countries on this list.\n\n1. China\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 9,838.8 million metric tons\n\n• CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 7.1 metric tons\n\n• Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 270.3%\n\n• Methane emissions (2012): 1,752.3 million metric tons (CO2e)\n\n• Population (2017): 1.39 billion\n\n• GDP per capita (2017): $15,309\n\nWith the world's largest population and for decades one of the fastest growing economies, China is far and away the world's top CO2 emitter. Close to 10,000 million metric tons of CO2 from burning fossil fuel were emitted by the superpower in 2017. On a per capita basis, China's CO2 emissions of 7.1 metric tons per person trail that of most countries on this list but still rank in the top 50 worldwide.\n\nDriving China's CO2 emissions is the nation's massive coal production. China's generation of electricity from coal has dropped slightly from 75% in 1992 to 70% in 2015. Still, overall coal production has tripled since 2000 to nearly 4,000 million metric tons – approximately half of all global coal production.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The fewer there are, the less sorbet streaks across the horizon.\n\nSo, when dusk settles in amid myriad white puffs, I jump in my car with my camera to race the sun to the West.\n\nJagged peaks line the distance as I wind around bends and turn down the static that blares from the radio. Boulders stand stoic in spite of their imperfections. Sometimes, I pull over to capture the beams of light illuminating their crooked edges. And still the sun sets.\n\nHere’s the thing about this journey – there is no destination. When the golden moment comes, I pull into a ditch on the side of the road and venture out to find Joshua trees forming black silhouettes against the watercolors seeping upwards into the sky. My shutter flits to preserve the instant before it’s gone, but more often than not, I find myself kneeling down in the dirt to take in the sight without the lens. There’s something wild about reveling in the nip of wayward winds as the sun melts into the horizon.\n\nPoet Arthur Chapman once wrote, “Out where the world is in the making, where fewer hearts in despair are aching, that’s where the West begins.”\n\nWherever you are in the desert, you can watch dusk fade into dust.\n\nFor centuries, locals and visitors alike have searched these peaks and valleys. Those of us who come face to face with the elements emerge with a tale.\n\nThree years ago, I asked our community to share those stories. Since September 2016, DESERT magazine has published responses submitted by artists from Palm Springs to Joshua Tree and beyond.\n\nThese are “the ways in which we seek – and find – beauty in the desert.”\n\nHere’s to simply showing up.\n\nKristin Scharkey, Editor\n\nkscharkey@gannett.com\n\nIt’s 1980 and I’m 9 years old, walking down Palm Canyon at dusk with my grandfather. He’ll only live another five years. A heart attack will kill him – his fourth, or maybe his third, since I’m not sure if the story of him having a heart attack while catching a marlin is actually true – so this is borrowed time, which is probably why he’s smoking a cigar. “Don’t tell your nana,” he says, lighting up.\n\nIt’s fall and everything is reddish-gold: gaudy baubles in their jewelry store display cases. Brake lights from cruising Cadillacs refracting out from store windows, painting the sidewalk brilliant. Even Morrie Geyer – proprietor of Morrie Geyer Menswear, standing outside his shop in a scalloped shirt opened halfway to his belly-button, his tan chest exposed – seems to glow. Or maybe that’s the life-sized mannequin of Morrie. It’s hard to remember the difference all these years later. You ever saw a person standing next to a mannequin of themselves, well, it distorts reality.\n\n“Have you heard from your dad?” my grandfather asks. I tell him I haven’t. He takes a puff from his cigar, let’s it go from his mouth. “When was the last time?”\n\n“I don’t know,” I say. “My birthday?”\n\nWe linger in front of See’s Candies, across the street from Bullock’s. The sweet smell of chocolate and confection rises around us, but then it’s been like that the entire time we’ve been walking, Palm Canyon seemingly filled with candy stores, men in the front windows spreading out fudge, their aprons smeared. Teenage girls stepping out to give you a sample, and it’s like magic, candy from nowhere, and free.\n\n“Well,” my grandfather says, “I’m right here. If you want to talk about something, just talk about it with me.” He gazes down, forces a smile, which makes him look like my mom. They have the same lips. This morning they got into a screaming fight, she stormed out of the condo, spent the day by the pool, smoking, my grandfather’s last words hanging between them: If I gave you a dime, you’d spend a dollar. “You understand? Man-to-man, Man.” A pause, the street moving fast around us now, lights, snippets of conversations, the roar of a muscle car, a breeze that feels like winter ... or maybe none of these things, just a boy and an old man on the street. “We should get some lollipops,” he says, and we go into the store. “Get whatever you want and whatever your sister would want. Buy the whole store if you want.”\n\nHere’s the thing about beauty: It doesn’t need to be physical. It doesn’t even need to be emotional. It can be a moment of simple kindness that you forget about entirely, until one day you’re stopped on Palm Canyon, a street you hardly drive down anymore, because you live across town.\n\nYou know how that goes.\n\nYou hardly get west of Bob Hope during season.\n\nYou look at the people crowding the sidewalk, something to watch while you wait for the light to change. To get on with your life. Get off this street. All this traffic. All these tourists. But then you see a boy in front of See’s and you remember yourself, standing right there, so long ago that you’re closer in age today to your grandfather than your childhood self. And it’s all you can do not to run out into the street to find your grandfather, too. To tell him you heard him, that you still hear him, on beautiful fall days, at dusk, in the smoke of a stranger’s cigar, always when you least expect it, like driving through the city of your past or waiting for some distant golden future.\n\nTod Goldberg is the New York Times best-selling author of more than a dozen books, including the novels “The House of Secrets,” which he co-authored with New York Times best-selling author Brad Meltzer and “Gangsterland,” a Hammett Prize finalist.

Not the chosen solitude where it’s 78 degrees at the start of summer, the air is perfect, the sun a soft lemon. It’s the kind of solitude that leaves you stranded. The air is heavy and the rain hasn’t lifted for days. The streets, which in a different light run silver, today are rivers of mud and all is a murk of gray. A lingering rain has soaked the fire logs. They burn smoke. There are four cartons of eggs in the refrigerator, half expired, along with a bag of old apples.\n\nOn days like this I would drive. But I’ve been without my pickup truck, a winter heartbreak. The drive would lift the solitude, the unchosen kind. It’s a freedom unmeasured. And one unmeasured freedom I’ll share with you. There’s a lookout on the 15, high in the San Bernardino Forest. In the valley below, a freight train comes through, diverting and romantic. The first time I saw it I pulled over. The train was long and winding and rolled cautiously downward. I watched and thought of its countless journeys, each a tale. The moon shone bright on the valley and I, a speck in those mountains all around me, wanted to throw my hands up and be lifted like a child. The train vanished into cottoned layers of fog. It was time to go home. I took the backroads to Highway 247 and then through Johnson Valley.\n\nEach time I’d drive to the outlook to see the train in the valley, it would somehow be there faithfully, a familiar anticipation, the kind that fulfills a seeking heart. It made my heart remember an anticipation of a different kind. A time I put on a dress and a faux fur stole and went out to a concert hall to hear the strings, at the hopes a companion might be there, and he was, on the other side of the crowd waiting for me.\n\nAnd what else is beauty but an anticipation, a symphony in our hearts.\n\nOn this morning, the morning of expired apples and mud rivers, sometime around three o’clock in a dream, a train appeared at my door hovering in its own steam. I heard the gardenia branches thrashing against my window and saw the train waiting there. It was a lustrous black metal, with passenger benches of shining leather.\n\nI was tired and disoriented. I got out of bed, my feet cold on the winter floor. Putting on my hooded robe draped over the bedpost, I walked through the door and stepped onto the train. We glided past the creosote bushes through the desert down through Morongo Valley and up to Tahquitz Peak where I stepped off, and walked through the pines, kindling under my bare feet. I turned to see if the train was still there. And perhaps I awoke.\n\nRecovering from illness at her mother’s farmhouse in Pennsylvania in 2012, Mercy read the Hemingway letters.

With its kinks and curves it reaches out with divine secrets. It summons us with whisper and warning.\n\nIt makes us feel foolish and weak as it stands solid and reliable. It humbles us with its simplicity and complexity, with its beauty and Draconian texture.\n\nThe Joshua tree, it will outlive us all and never have to check its Instagram account…\n\nSerene to some, but others could not take the quiet, the calm, the dead air that the desert delivers. Can your ego survive the silent treatment? Because the desert has questions. Who are you? What is your purpose?\n\nSolitude and silence beckon and insist that you face the man in the mirror and peel back the layers.\n\nIf you do find yourself looking for some chatter, there is no shortage of prismatic personalities.\n\nThe cast of characters one has the propensity to stumble upon out here could turn Wonderbread into pumpernickel, enriching your soul or scaring you away with peculiar peril.\n\nWe’ve got shamans and shaman wanna-be’s, cowboys and cowboy wanna-be’s, hippies, hipsters, yuppies and tricksters.\n\nWe’ve got stoners, prophets, tourists and hermits, ex-movie stars, new movie stars, rock stars and rock climbers. Filmmakers, drug takers, Marines, witches, bikers and city slickers looking to invest in the latest desert trend; selling spirituality to the lost, the hungry, and the full.\n\nAnd then, there’s the hawk. Can we talk about the hawk with its wings majestic and wide, soaring over our petty chaos and inflamed importance? Its only worry but to find its next meal, it flies freely over sacred land, taking in miles of beauty each day. The coyote, the rattler, the scorpion, the rabbit, just to name a few others that inhabit this arid sand-land with us.\n\nAs creepy crawly as some of these creatures may be, I’ve learned to honor, respect and enjoy them in their natural environment.\n\nYou can’t talk about the desert without commenting on the cosmos… The vast and unexplainable speckled sky. Constellations so clear and the moon like a floating mystic kite. Its power surges and permeates your soul on a starry night. The swirly sunsets of port-wine cheese melt into the western hemisphere as we all grab our phones to capture and behold. The murky and moody shades of blue that don’t even exist in a box of Crayola display themselves in a sorrowful soliloquy. What better place to contemplate the universe and the meaning of life than under the Mojave moon?\n\nThere is one question I have consistently been asked by out-of-towners over the years with much bewilderment: “What do you do here?” And it’s funny because I have never been at a loss for something to do. It’s quality not quantity out here in these parts.\n\nWherever you are, there you are; and where is that exactly?

It took 25 years of living in the Coachella Valley for me to be drawn into the mystic, spiritual beauty of the desert landscape.\n\nThe awakening was more than what my eyes could see. It was an out of body experience, a feeling that hit an emotional nerve, like a familiar song on the radio that brings back good childhood memories. I felt sensitive and emotional, and I silently cried.\n\nIt began in the summer of 2017, assigned to an investigative story in Joshua Tree. Missing hikers. The twists and turns, like a Law & Order episode, were constant. I was in the high desert for secret meetings and interviews, early mornings, and weekends. My seasoned reporter instincts kept me coming back for more. Or, was it the need to see the high desert sunrise? The calm across the desert? The individual Joshua trees backlit by the perfect light of the rising sun? Breathtaking, leaving a gulp in my throat every time. For me, the beauty of the desert includes the people. Their stories, their seemingly self-confidence to be themselves and find a home and life where others only see sand.\n\nThe hikers were found dead. A murder/suicide. An emotional ride for me as I got to know the father of the male hiker and the group of people who showed up every week to help him find his son. We now share a bond, brought together by tragedy.\n\nTragedy with a backdrop of truly amazing beauty, so heavenly, something more than who we are. My eyes have been open all along the way, but I only began to see the true beauty of the desert in the summer of 2017.\n\nKaren Devine is an award-winning television journalist and investigative reporter for KESQ News Channel 3, the ABC affiliate and Fox in the Coachella Valley.

I would spin the globe as fast as I could and stop it with my finger. Wherever my finger would land, I declared that I would travel there one day. My little game was the precursor to the bucket list concept. Since my finger mostly stopped in the middle of an ocean, I had to spin and spin until I hit some land. One time, I spun the globe so hard that it orbited out of its contraption onto the floor. I retrieved the globe like a basketball player readying to take a foul shot — one hand on the North Pole and the other on Antarctica. Antarctica subsequently went onto my bucket list.\n\nAfter becoming an adult, I no longer left my travel inspirations to chance. I informed myself the old-school way — by reading. I read adventure stories and pondered over travel magazines and maps.\n\nIn 1966, Francine, my best friend and I, were standing in front of Whisky A Go Go in Hollywood. Two guys drove up in a convertible. One of the guys asked if we wanted to go to Palm Springs for the weekend. I eagerly responded with a yes! There were no mothers around to tell us otherwise. I had never heard of Palm Springs, but I did wonder if it was some place magical since these guys were leaving the excitement of Hollywood even if just for a weekend. I presumed that this Palm Springs must be the place to be. Well, Francine put a damper on this notion. “We-are-not-going-anywhere-with-these-guys,” she said in a motherly tone. I recovered after a fleeting moment of disappointment when I soon realized that I could just add Palm Springs to my travel list.\n\nI finally made it to Palm Springs — the first time in 1974 just to see if it was really real, and the second time in 1992 when I came to stay. I have made a continent-full of scratch offs on my travel list. The desert surroundings mirror and even surpass some of the exotic destinations that I have traveled. If I want a little bit of the outback, I take to the Lykken Trail. If I want the Aegean Sea, I go to — you guessed it — the Salton Sea.\n\nThe desert provides a dramatic backdrop for which artists practicing all art forms can create and curate their craft. As a writer of experimental poetry, I find that the spirit of the desert and its landscape provide inspiration for a variety of literary genres, from science fiction to romance. or me, living in the desert is like being on a perpetual holiday.

Strong enough to hold my weight and the weight of another, their grayish-white trunks and branches lay barren of leaves all winter. Despite the harsh desert climate, they seem to still grow with little water.\n\nIt was last summer that it started. Laying in my hammock, I would feel water drop from the clear blue sky onto my warm skin.\n\nTiny droplets sprinkled my face and arms.\n\n“Do you feel it raining?” I’d ask a reclining hammock friend.\n\n“No. There are no clouds in the sky,” they’d reply.\n\nEvery time I felt a water droplet on my skin, I would rush to find it.\n\nBut it would cease to be there.\n\nAs the mysterious disappearing act continued in this way, I started to feel I was going mad.\n\nWeeks into spring this year, I went out to revisit the trees to discover they were bare. Despite having one of the wettest winters the desert has had in decades, the trees were not part of the super bloom. I hurried to water them immediately. Two days later, they sprouted their first leaves. Ecstatic, I lay in my hammock for the first time in a while.\n\nSoon, I felt a drop of water on my skin again. I gazed up at the sky, embraced by its radiating sunshine. Then, turning to look down at my arm, I saw it – a clear, tiny water droplet!\n\nI digested for just a moment that I had seen it with my own eyes. Admiring these two trees in wonderment, I asked myself how many lives have they lived before?\n\nThese magical raining trees – are they crying? If they are crying … is it from joy or sadness?\n\n“Which is it, oh magical trees?” I asked aloud.\n\n“What has happened to your spirits that have resulted you to communicate this way? As the wind rustles your branches and you sprout new leaves, is it growing pains? Is it the happiness of being alive?”\n\n“Will you tell me if I listen?”\n\nIn my blue striped hammock, I pray.\n\n“I will listen intently, and watch for your tears,\n\nFor you both have been my confidantes these past few years,\n\nYou saw me weep as well,\n\nBared witness to my struggle on a fateful day,\n\nThat it takes to heal and grow in the desert.\n\nYou saw me laugh ’til I couldn’t anymore,\n\nWhisked away as I read adventures through your branches.\n\nI will hear your story, just as I have told you mine.\n\nI will live inspired by your strength,\n\nLean into your supportive trunks,\n\nCherish it,\n\nFor there are so many stories your branches have to tell,\n\nAs they twist and turn throughout your life.\n\nAs you continue to thrive in the harshest of deserts.”\n\nLauren Bright resides in Morongo Valley. She considers her loves to be writing, dancing and painting. Also, she has a cat named Cat.\n\n“Desert time” was a concept I heard often before finally moving to the desert. I understand that it means things just take longer here. The plants and trees grow slower. People’s lives move slower. I heard it is hard to get things happening because, well, “desert time.” I thought, “I have been living in cities and working in fast-paced industries for 15 years. I am going to keep my usual pace.”\n\nLiving in the high desert for over one year now, I have lived through all the weather changes, the wildlife cycles. I have observed the subtleties of each season. I have experienced how the light changes throughout the year. I have been shocked at how the position of the sun varies so much from winter versus summer. In the winter, the light shines well into my living room on the south side of the house. In summer, the sun is so far north that it is on the other side of the house and doesn’t even shine into the living room at all.\n\nTime is funny here.\n\nIn the summer, it is easy to naturally wake up at or before sunrise. Get up and try to cram in as much as you can before the midday sun forces you indoors to a slow halt. The animals are out as well, to make the most of the morning. The roadrunners and gamble quails scurry around for snacks. Ground squirrels scramble from bush to bush to avoid becoming one. A nap in an air-conditioned space is the best way to avoid the afternoon heat. The hours from 1 to 6 p.m. are slow. Sluggish. The sun is relentless and I am convinced it will never drop below the mountains to the west. Five hours that last seemingly forever. As the sun is about to dip, but there is still light in the sky, turning on the stove or grill to cook dinner doesn’t seem so insane anymore. While cooking dinner, get some chores done before daylight is totally gone. Eat dinner al fresco. Take a walk around the neighborhood. The light on the plants then is magical. Saturated colors make everything look so rich. The bunnies come out to hop around and eat.\n\nIn the winter, days look beautiful from inside the house. The sun is shining, but finally not oppressive. Skies are clear and blue. But, go outside and the winds are maddening. They can last days, weeks. Everything around your house blows away unless it is heavy or bolted down. Our old aluminum windows rattle and shake all night. Will the Joshua tree finally uproot and fall over? Am I safe sleeping under a giant window of glass? Will the windows break and blow in? We pick up roof shingles around the yard after the big winds. Nature is slowly taking our house apart. The view is beautiful, but there are small opportunities of good working time. Then you race against daylight, because once the sun sets, it is pretty much time to be inside. Eat dinner and head to bed. Desert midnight is around 8 to 9 p.m.\n\nWe all know the desert is a place of extremes. Hot and cold. Dry weather and flash floods. Time is also an extreme here. There are days that fly by, when the sun time is short and you can never get enough done. Then there are those summer months that it seems will never end. You have cabin fever and wonder why the hell you moved to such an unsustainable environment.\n\nMy favorite days are the ones where I need to get to the studio to work, but I am so in awe of the beautiful landscape that I procrastinate by wandering around the land, checking on new blooms and plants. I know that I need to hurry up and get to work, but for some reason my instinct is to slow down and enjoy the scenery because, well, desert time.\n\nJanelle Pietrzak is a full-time weaver. After a lifetime of moving all around the country, she has settled in the high desert town of Yucca Valley where she owns a textile design studio and tiny shop called All Roads.\n\nAfter a long week of work, the last thing I wanted to do was get up from my couch. As I watched my Miami Dolphins squeeze out a last-second win, I could see the sun starting to cast a faint pink glow on the Little San Bernardino Mountains, and the weight of regret tugged at me.\n\nI’d told myself I would find a way to get outdoors that weekend, but with a bum ankle, a party Saturday night and the remnants of a hangover still lingering, I figured it might have to wait. The mountains and their hiking trails would still be there next Saturday.\n\nThen my gaze caught my Canon DSLR, almost forgotten in the corner of the room. It brought me back to the afternoon I first drove up the 10 freeway, and saw Mt. San Jacinto and its snow-covered tip two Februarys ago. My bookshelf, my TV, my kitchenware, my closet of clothes – once removed from a moving truck and carried into a room that felt so foreign then – now set the stage for a place that felt a little too much like a home I took for granted.\n\nI’d always promised my mom, who screeches for joy whenever she walks out of my apartment to see the mountains in the morning while visiting, that I’d never stop appreciating this indescribable place where I lucked into a job. So instead, I got up, quickly grabbed jeans and a long-sleeve shirt from my bedroom floor, snatched my Canon and my car keys, and hopped in my Ford Fusion to try and beat the sunset.\n\nDespite my heavy foot on the gas – screaming up Highway 62 as fast as other cars and traffic lights would allow – when the young woman at the gate to Joshua Tree National Park said, “Have a great day,” I worried I would leave disappointed.\n\nStill, I wove back and forth through the park and finally reached Keys View, taking the last parking spot as droves of people with their tripods had beaten me. Rather than try to shuffle between them, though, I struggled to find the unmarked rocky path up to Inspiration Point, nearly breaking into a dead sprint in my boots to cover the half-mile as quickly as my legs would move.\n\nAt the top, though the wind whipped and the couple sitting next to me snickered in between kisses and puffs of their blunt, it was the deepest quiet my ears had sensed in quite some time. As the big ball of light began to inch its way behind the towering mountains that create Palm Springs’ border, the click of my shutter broke the silence in the most pleasing way.\n\nTime was only defined by the dipping of the sun, the settling of the clouds, the ebbing and flowing of the reds, oranges and pinks of the sky, and the adjusting of the exposure on my camera. No Facebook notifications. No football scores. Just an unparalleled front seat to the greatest light show in Southern California.\n\nI was right. That trail, those mountains, the majestic sunset will be there tomorrow, next weekend, even next year, but I may not. And when I wake up in an urban high-rise apartment with towers of brick, metal and glass obstructing my view, I’ll regret those days and nights I put off adventure and beauty for another day.\n\nNathan Brown grew up in the freezing winters and humid summers of the Midwest, just north of Indianapolis in Indiana.

The invitation appeared the way all things do in the desert, by secret prayer, answered. The house was small: one room with sand-plastered walls painted magnolia, one wooden bed, one cane-backed plantation chair, and a large arched window.\n\nI accepted the invitation and spent afternoons curled on soft cotton, piled high, white with warmed patina. Protected by the sacred fronds, I’d drift in and out of daydreams and look out onto the desert.\n\nAt the end of the rows of date palms and ranches was a sea, neglected and forgotten, with waters of murky lavender that lapped onto powdered fish bones. Spellbound, after sleep, I would visit and stand on the sacred bones as the spun gold of the heavens faded.\n\nOne duskfall, I noticed across the sea on another shore, inklings of splendor and echoed lullabies. I wanted to be nearer, so I pushed a paint-chipped boat into the water, climbed in and without oars, trusted the sea’s current.\n\nI drifted across the wakes until I arrived at a row of quiet dwellings. Upon stepping out of my boat, I noticed a girl sound asleep. Hovering above her bed, her black hair fell like a waterfall. She slept in the looming twilight as the ruffled gauze of her faded apricot gown whisked the air.\n\nShe had been there all along on the opposite shore and had slept all winter. I kept my distance so as not to wake her. I wondered who loved her. And couldn’t help but imagine love must have sent her into such a peaceful sleep that she floated above her own piled cotton. She glowed in the sea’s reflection of the arriving moon.\n\nI left her sleeping and continued on. The ghostly sands blew onto the streets past the lonesome shacks.\n\nI heard a melody in the distance. A chanteuse sang through an open window. Her porcelain fingers plucked notes from the strings of a well-traveled guitar. She sang of her heartbeat just as I could feel mine. Strangers gathered around to listen to her words of sweet loss and heard her long after the singing. I fell asleep under a grand tamarisk tree in her yard and in the morning as I opened my eyes, its branches swam in the air, still lullabied.\n\nI walked to the sand to find my boat. The sea was now a shade of mint tsavorite. A poem set softly alight by the sun read: “I still love you.”\n\nMercè Clay wrote this in homage to the Bombay Beach Biennale 2019, and was especially inspired by installations “Loving, Loving” by Vera Sola, “Levitation” by Josèphine Wister Faure featuring gown by Heidi Merrick and “I Still Love You” by Olivia Steel.

So many people talking at me, the sound of dishes clanking and froth wands whistling at my regular coffee shop. Music playing at work. Class lectures. The sound of the dishwasher running. Somehow, even at the end of the day, when the lights are turned off and my phone’s across the room, I can still hear the electricity of the city humming through my walls and my pillow.\n\nAnd then it starts all over again.\n\nAlarm. Breakfast sizzling. Traffic honking. 8 hour lectures. People talking. Dishes clanking. Music playing. Washers going. Outlets humming. Alarm. Breakfast sizzling. Traffic honking. 8 hour lectures. People talking. Dishes clanking. Music playing. Washers going. Outlets humming.\n\nSilence.\n\nAnd I hold my breath, cause surely this is a dream.\n\nIt’s still...silent.\n\nAm I dreaming? I guess it’s not technically silent. But there’s no noise.\n\nI hear the wind whispering and the sand grinding beneath my feet. As if I were pinching salt between my fingers.\n\nI’m back to the infinite golden hills at sunset. No man or skyscraper in sight. The lands so empty, I feel my mind breathing just from the sight of it.\n\nStillness.\n\nAnd sadly it’s not a dream. But gladly it’s a memory. One from not too long ago.\n\nI know some people who feel abandoned in the desert. They feel alone and forgotten, forsaken and betrayed. Yet, how come I find rest in a stagnant, barren land.\n\nI once heard God sing a desert song.\n\nIt wasn’t what I expected.\n\nIt was one note. Held out for a long moment.

That kind of intentionality in art puts my soul at ease and my mind to sleep.\n\nI don’t live in the desert anymore.\n\nI live in a busy city, within a busy life with a lot of noise.

This woman meant well, I’m sure, but I didn’t plant the rosebushes.\n\nI did spend many hours in my rocking chair on my front porch, staring across the arroyo into the chaparral covering the neighboring mountain. I breathed in the air scented with pungent white sage, the spicy vanilla of the blooming redshank, and the patchouli-like stink of our tiny native wildflower whose name no one knows. I drew the desert air deep into my lungs and released it as slowly as I could. Seconds of breathing turned into hours which turned into days. Time passes slower in the desert, it seems. Time passes, but grief does not.\n\nEach loss carries its own means of navigation, but no promise that the next one – because one thing life can promise is that there will forever be a next loss until finally, restfully, we reach the ultimate one ourselves – but there is no promise that the next one will hurt any less. With each loss we learn to bear not only this one, but that one. That next one coming.\n\nWhen I was a little girl growing up in the Imperial Valley, 15 miles from the Mexican border, after every earthquake my family would drive into the desert and search for signs of damage. It was never hard to find.\n\nThere were rifts, fissures and ridges. There were fresh new cracks in the rocky sand whose soft edges crumbled into the tiny abyss when we stepped too near. The earth had changed. The face of the map had been re-drawn. One had to learn a new method of navigation, if, say, the road had shifted a few feet away. But the journey wasn’t over. The journey didn’t end because the road did.\n\nMy heart, my life, is a quake-damaged landscape with areas labeled ‘Here there be monsters,’ but I’ve learned not to avoid them. I explore those areas tentatively, offer a gentle stroke of recognition to the monsters I encounter, tell them they are welcomed to take up residence. My monsters are my battle scars, my mythological reminders that I fought and lost but yet live. I welcome them, each one, lovingly, because even the wildest beast may be tamed.\n\nThe desert sky is wide enough that I don’t need to plant a garden to reflect my losses. The dry wind bears it, each scent supports it. Ultimately, the space here may hold multitudes. Grief is a monster that never goes away. We carry him forever; but in time we learn to manage the weight of him. Just carrying him makes us stronger.\n\nSara Marchant received her Masters of Fine Arts in Creative Writing and Writing for the Performing Arts from the University of California, Riverside/Palm Desert.

I get up, change from my pajamas into a simple T-shirt, gym shorts and tiny tennis shoes. I’m 6 years old and I’m happy.\n\nMy mom, my sister and I drive to the entrance of the Sabas Nieves trail of the El Ávila Mountains in Caracas, Venezuela. I always get lazy at the start, but once we start going up the trail, the trees, the views of downtown Caracas and the promise of my favorite ice cream once we get back down keeps me going.\n\nHiking the Sabas Nieves trail was a weekend tradition back then. Years have passed, our family grew and traditions changed, but the memories of our hikes have always stayed in the back of my mind.\n\nIt’s been almost eight years since I left Venezuela and almost five years since I left my parents’ house in Texas for college. When I accepted an internship at The Desert Sun and relocated to Palm Springs almost two years ago, I knew nothing about the Coachella Valley. I had lived in the U.S. for six years and, having resided in Houston and Baton Rouge, I forgot that living in an area surrounded by mountains was a possibility.\n\nNow, Caracas and the Coachella Valley could not be more different. One’s a city within a valley in a tropical, humid area merely an hour from the Caribbean Sea, and the other is an arid, desert region with cactuses, intense heat in the summer and a whole lot of sand. But the first time I saw the San Jacinto Mountains along the desert cities, I remember feeling like I was back home.\n\nBut being far away from family and old friends, working hard and dealing with life’s ups and downs can be isolating. So, I hold on to old memories and make sure I create new ones by exploring the world I now found myself in.\n\nEvery Friday, I set my alarm for an early morning wake-up call, hit the snooze button about 10 times. I get up, change from my pajamas into a simple T-shirt, gym shorts and somewhat bigger tennis shoes. I pick up my friend at her house and we hike South Lykken Trail.\n\nWe talk about work, our lives, plans for future vacations and where we are going to have lunch when we’re done. Between admiring the recently revived plants (thank you rainy winter) and each other’s support, we make it to the top.\n\nAs I look at the valley from above, I think about my family and how they’re always with me even when we’re apart. I think about my friends and the many adventures we’ve gone on. I think about how lucky I am to have landed in a place like this and in that moment, even after the worst of weeks, I am happy.\n\nJose Bastidas is the food reporter and producer for The Desert Sun.

He first moved to the Coachella Valley when he accepted an internship at The Desert Sun in 2015.\n\nWhen I travel, I struggle to find time to sit back, enjoy, contemplate and observe my new surroundings sufficiently. Meticulously calibrated schedules sever my connection to my natural senses and leave me stressed out. It is no easier to find time to think and ponder at home.\n\nAs a recent resident of Palm Springs, I still enjoy some anonymity in public spaces where I can meditate uninterrupted (at least until a friend or neighbor greets me). Somehow I get energy from being in the presence of other people, especially those I don’t know. I can gather up their vibes, store them and feel revitalized enough to give them all back to others.\n\nI discovered this power in New York City, where I could walk among thousands of people, collecting energy like a squirrel collects acorns. In Florence, I would sit in the Piazza della Repubblica and absorb the history in every stone, monument and tower. At Leidseplein square in Amsterdam – filled with chairs and tables on a sunny, warm day – I imagined comedy and drama flowing from my fellow diners.\n\nOnce while sitting outside the Starbucks at the corner of Tahquitz and Palm Canyon, I realized I had found a similar space in Palm Springs. My local, public square is bounded by the Starbucks, the Welwood Murray Memorial Library, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and the empty space under construction where I hope the 22-foot-high statue of Marilyn Monroe will return. While the desert modernist grandeur of the library represents the sole architectural focal point, adding Marilyn across from the library could create the perfect architectural counterweight (as it once used to be).\n\nIn my square, like other European plazas, I can sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and a pastry while watching the downtown foot traffic. After finding the optimal seat for viewing, I savor the aroma and flavor of my brew, nosh a bit and enjoy the parade. If I am in a restless mood, my thoughts go to, “Oh, no! What is that he’s wearing?” But more often, I play games like “What country are they from?” or “Are they married or dating?”\n\nIf the passersby don’t grab my attention, there is sometimes a person at a nearby table whose life story I can fabricate. What to others may look like an ordinary tourist in my mind has become an international opera star trying to avoid the paparazzi, while the man behind her tries discreetly to take her photo with his phone. I might even play the role of a secret agent or slumming celebrity.\n\nThese moments alone are rarely guilt-free because there is always some other more productive use of my time. But for the small rental fee embodied in a purchased cup of coffee, a seat at my public square provides a welcome respite from my daily routine.\n\nDavid Kelly is a former banker, executive chef and lawyer who currently enjoys writing and performing his works at CONNECTED, Bohemian Café and The Desert Sun’s Coachella Valley Storytellers Project.

Benitez-Brown) is a Filipino-American artist, who splits his time between Quezon City and LA.\n\nHot weather is a regular part of life in the Coachella Valley.\n\nThis past summer, temperatures soared above 120 degrees; even during fall months, the heat often rises above 100, sometimes late into October. How can anyone live through this – months of triple-digit temperatures – let alone find beauty at this time of year, when, due to the understandable mass exodus of fair weather residents and tourists, it often feels like we’re living in a ghost town?\n\nLike many others, I hide behind dark curtains, holding a seemingly endless vigil of waiting for the sun to go down. When it does finally slide behind Mount San Jacinto and cover the valley with a long curtain of shade that begins in Palm Springs and slides across the desert floor to the Little San Bernardino Mountains, I venture outdoors to mostly empty roads.\n\nEven though temperatures often hover in the 90s or higher at this time of night, I emerge from my South Palm Desert condo to go on my daily walk. I wear my reflective, fluorescent green Nike tank top, the lightest shorts I have and a small backpack that holds my 2-liter CamelBak reservoir filled to the brim with water and a 1-liter water bottle, frozen solid.\n\nDuring my one-hour, 4-mile roundtrip walk, the water bottle will completely melt. As the sky darkens, I walk uphill along Highway 74, passing Silver Spur trailer park and Cahuilla Way. I steadily sip water and hold the frozen bottle alternately to the back of my neck, the front of my chest and under each arm, to help cool myself down.\n\nAs I begin to unwind, my senses tune in to the sound of raucous crickets hiding in the thick desert landscaping in front of Bighorn Golf Club. The rhythm of walking helps to ease the tension in my housebound muscles, and I start to breathe more easily. I get closer to the edge of the wild desert, to the curve in the road where Highway 74 begins to switchback up into the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument, and I look up at the dark sky and am astonished by the beautiful view of warm stars and a toenail of new moon. I feel the sudden rush of a connection to the deep magic of the desert, with its infinite possibilities and ancient history, and I sense the rustling of the palm tree oases I know are tucked into the canyons just beyond where I stand. I imagine a family of thirsty bighorn sheep picking their way down rocky cliffs to drink, and I’m overwhelmed with the understanding that this is a wild desert that few people truly know, evoked only during times of intense weather such as this.\n\nAnd then, I hear the yips of a pack of coyotes cascade down from Cahuilla Hills. When their cries fade into the darkness, I savor the silence, which now feels like a warm balm rather than loneliness.\n\nRuth Nolan is professor of English at College of the Desert.

She spends most of her time taking photographs, writing poetry, or wandering around the desert.\n\nEvery desert trip began with a quick stop off Highway 10 for date shakes and chili at Hadley’s. We’d sit at the counter beneath black and white signed photos of old Hollywood stars I was too young to recognize. Giant tour busses parked alongside the green and yellow building while tourists took a bathroom break or browsed the aisles of mixed nuts and novelties. This was our desert ritual that meant we were almost there…\n\nTurquoise waters sparkled against the stucco and concrete of a generic condominium complex pool, which overlooked a brilliant green golf course in Palm Springs. This is where my dad taught me how to swim.\n\nOverwatered lawns and manicured sidewalks encircled a royal blue manmade lake in La Quinta, where in the mud between the grass and concrete path, my cousins and I played with army green toy soldiers and mini plastic farm animals while my grandparents made sandwiches or went out for a round of tennis.\n\nA few years later my sister and I took the 10 on our own, to dance across the emerald green polo fields of Indio. We moved to the sounds of Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV On The Radio in little jean cut offs and big sunglasses under a cloudless sky.\n\nThe desert I seek now is not painted in such vivid greens and blues, after all my parents are divorced, my grandparents are long gone, and Coachella now costs half my paycheck to listen to bands I no longer know. So those desert memories are magic to me, as they capture the time when my family came together and actually shared meals. When adults and children spent just as much time playing as the other. The desert was our haven, where life was vivid and worries were none.\n\nToday I know how water is such a precious resource, how 330 acres of manicured lawns is unnatural, almost criminal, and how life’s worries will follow you wherever you go. But I still long for the desert, seeking the magic it carried for me before I knew magic was something to be sought after. I continue to come back here, not just to relive those memories that undoubtedly shaped who I am today, but to chase the desert’s brilliant sunsets, expansive horizons and magnificent super blooms. To look up at the sky and see stars I forgot were always there. To watch the sunrise because I want to – not because I have to on my way to an early work shift. To look out at a sea of dirt, dust and Joshua trees. To marvel at the blanket of yellow gold wildflowers across the desert floor. To sit in quiet, far from any reception or media, so that my mind can finally think for itself. To sip on a date shake while I recall the time I first learned to swim, or when I danced the night away beneath the desert sky, or when life was vivid and worries were none.\n\nNina Harada is a writer, actor and artist.

Nearly a year together means that we both know this. There is a certain irony then to the sun beating down on our exposed arms as we stand in a group of 20 or so listening to a woman as old as my grandmother explain the difference between alligator and Utah juniper. The average age of our cohort is not far off the age of our guide, and it’s becoming increasingly clear that this two-hour “nature hike” isn’t going to be leaving the parking lot. My Earth Day date idea, so good in theory, is rapidly seeming more like the opposite with each passing minute.\n\n“Want to go find a trail?” I ask under my breath so as not to offend our volunteer naturalist.\n\n“Yes please,” E. replies.\n\nJavelina Trail guides us deep into Red Rock State Park, following the path of an irrigation canal dug by the original homesteaders of this land. Along the way I spot a number of bushes and plants from our hour with the guide, making sure to repeat the names I’ve written down so that they don’t get lost like so many other things.\n\nSoaptree yucca. Wolfberry. Desert marigold.\n\nThe plants of a childhood spread out across the high deserts of Arizona and California, always present by never quite appreciated. Now I cling to their names like a free climber to a ledge, determined not to take for granted the landscape that dominates my life, waking and sleeping.\n\nI will admit I have an ulterior motive. Our early dates revolved around taking advantage of the natural beauty of Arizona. Somehow, despite living in a place renowned for its expansive landscape and access to nature, we seem to have lost the magic of those first explorations together. Our Sedona trip for me represents a lifeline back to that place where everything is new and each discovery together is a forking in the trail with no clear end in sight.\n\nWe pause at a rock wall on top of a ridge to take advantage of the shade provided by a ponderosa pine. It’s our first opportunity for conversation that doesn’t involve one of us having to stare at the back of the other. Our conversation, observed by the red and umber striped peaks of nearby Cathedral Rock, meanders in a way that is both pleasant and familiar. We talk about erosion and the nature of colors. We discuss how we would foster a sense of curiosity in our theoretical children by encouraging them to explore the natural world. We make plans for more hikes, more time away from our community, more intention in how we spend our time together.\n\nOn that lookout in the land of tourists and overpriced crystal shops, it becomes clear that this day was not a bad idea; it was exactly what we needed.\n\nA guitar plays.\n\nThe sound bounces off art-laden walls, filling the concert space.\n\nI sing an Indian folk song which wildly enters the sonic forest.\n\nOutside, the desert is quiet.\n\nJoshua Tree takes me as I am this cold night. Barren land makes space for me to croon in the language of my grandparents, “Kesariya Balam, padharo mhare des!” Oh my Beloved, come to my land!\n\nI drove into the desert in May of 2015, freshly divorced and hoping for the kind of redemption that breathing new air always seems to offer. As I passed a familiar, color-changing mountain, the cacophony of heartbreak rang in my ears, and I almost missed its message. The mountain’s message, that is. It came to me as two clear, sequential instructions:\n\n1. Write a poem, and\n\n2. Have courage\n\nI thought exactly what anyone would think: That’s a dumb, bossy mountain that clearly has no real-life experience. It’s never gone through a complex problem requiring a robust solution.\n\nI unloaded my car of the clothes and books I’d brought from Texas, and rested my head in my mother’s lap before doing the inevitable – Googling “local poetry reading.”\n\nThe next morning, I formulated a poem in my head while driving to an open mic. I ordered an organic brew and dribbled the words of the poem onto the back of the receipt.\n\nComing down from the creative high, I could smell the words. They reeked of having loved too much. They smacked of the sort of pining that remains popular in Bollywood films but is too buttery thick for my American sensibilities. Adding to its deficiencies, the poem had too many driving metaphors. I decided it couldn’t be released into the Universe, so I placed the whimpering piece in my back pocket. Without skipping a beat, the saucy mountain let out an “ahem!” for ignoring instruction No. 2.\n\nA couple of cloistered months later, I went to another open mic and did what I swore I wouldn’t do – I became that kind of poet and apotheosized both my lost relationship and my slowly fading identity. My ex-husband and I got the two-become-one-thing right, but in all the wrong ways. As he disappeared from my life, “I” disappeared from my life. Standing before several desert poets, I festered in the fury of all the avoidable mistakes we had made. They clapped for me. Smiled at me. Deflected from the smell of pity in the air by telling me they liked “this image” and “that simile.” They forgave me.\n\nThe barren desert wasn’t barren after all.\n\nMore than two years later, I’m under the balcony seats of a secluded concert venue, not far from the Joshua Forest.

A car was already marooned in the current, with its driver standing on the other side, waiting for some help.\n\nIf not for the harrowing possibility of being washed away, the day was as picturesque as they come. Migrating birds with white feathers and long legs wading through shimmering water, set against the backdrop of snow-topped mountains and a cobalt sky.\n\nI heard the water rushing over the hidden asphalt. The current carried rocks and vegetation, making a roar and muting the otherwise audible noise from people and engines. I was astounded by the force and speed of this impromptu river, crashing into civilization as residents were on their way to Target or the Post Office.\n\nI hear stories from people who were raised here, about a time when the whole valley would shut down while the wash crisscrossed every major artery of Palm Springs and the surrounding towns. I am learning the power of the Whitewater River and its distributaries, as well as its primary source, Mount San Gorgonio. Also known as Old Grayback, and part of the Transverse Ranges, its snowmelt feeds the river and its frenzied washes.\n\nIt’s not hard to be in awe of the dramatic changes we experience in the Coachella Valley. We live in this desert of opposites. Nature and technology. Cactus and rain cloud. Our senses are surrounded by beauty so raw, we are drawn to touch it. Engage with it. Immerse ourselves utterly and escape the digital rhythms of our lives. The harsh summers provide us with a Mother Nature so unforgiving, we are reminded of our tenuous hold on this planet. We witness the cycle of birth and death annually, as the rain and river give life, and the arid heat takes it away.\n\nI returned to the same spot today on Cathedral Canyon, hoping to see those white birds. The yellow grasses told me what I already suspected. Other than a rill no wider than three feet, the landscape was transformed back into a field.\n\nThat day by the wash will remain with me forever. Life was reinvigorated for a momentary season of excess and plenitude. Down here in the valley, the lizards, the saltbush and we humans are but passing through. Our inventions of conditioned air and roaming vehicles help us to survive, but I will always have respect for the power of wind, water and temperature.\n\nThey come for the winter, visitors from northern climes, and indeed it is sight to behold the nature that flourishes here. The mountain draws our eye to the sky. A netherworld of snow and cloud peers down on us as if from another time zone. Ancient and silent, the mountain’s silhouette is an elder. San Jacinto speaks to us in a language of memory, and we may listen freely, if we choose.\n\n“Remember this cycle of abundance and growth, of lack and conservation. Imprint it in your DNA.

I stood there numb to everything.\n\nNow, what? What about that loft we were going to get? Or the two children we imagined running in our backyard?\n\nSnapping out of my daze, I heard his voice shouting from downstairs, “Grab my bike off the mantle, will you?” The studio now looked like it did the day we arrived. Empty. Sunlight hit the wooden floors, and I closed the door before slipping the keys under. The smell of the panadería across the street whiffed into my nose as I took one more glance at the old man who waited to die on our street every day, smoking his last cigarette while notes of jazz filled the city. All of this ultimately became a part of me.\n\nBut this isn’t our story; it’s mine, and you’re just a part of it.\n\nI hauled everything I owned into my car, with my ex-lover’s bicycle attached to the roof. The fog eventually disappeared, the roads shifted from pavement to gravel and the heat seeped into my skin. Mountains on every corner replaced buildings, and we were back on 1-10 headed for the desert. The only noise you could hear was the clamoring of the wine glasses we bought together, the rattling of his bike and a loud, vast, open sound only the desert landscape can produce. Two summers ago, after a stint of city living and what seemed to be an enormous amount of young love, I found myself back at my childhood address. Seeing the windmills silhouetted against the mountainside, the comfort of home rushed into my body. The desert held a familiar scent – my grandmother’s Filipino cooking, soy sauce mixed in with vinegar, ginger and garlic simmering ever so slowly in a huge metal pot, along with the subtle smell of coconut bundled in banana leaves – and the feeling that everything was going to be alright. Or at least that was the sensation I craved.\n\nThere I was, unpacking everything in my parents’ garage. I’d left behind one of the best teaching jobs in Oakland and a life I thought I knew. On the evening of my return to the desert, the gradient of colors from the sunset melded into a fiery warmth that embraced my existence. Within that moment, I realized I needed to let all of it happen.\n\nExhausted from the drive, I went to the backyard and dug my feet into the earth. The damp grass felt good against my hot skin, and I wasn’t sure how to move forward or if I even could. As I looked up at the summer moon, my body knew this was the end of a relationship but the beginning of something new. Sometimes people, places and things happen because they help you arrive at your next destination. I never planned to move back here, but the desert chose me.\n\nMichelle Castillo is a writer, educator, community arts organizer and social activist based out of Palm Springs.

While the car is on. It’s 4:30 a.m. and I’m wondering if the McDonald’s in Baker is open 24 hours. I’m wondering if I’m up for whoever would be at a McDonald’s in Baker in 5 a.m. I’m gauging the drive to Tecopa and imagining, over and over, sinking into the hot mud of the spring. I lift my head into the cold air, hands still rubbing each other in the exhaust, and see the first light hit the white cross and then bleed out on the pink rocks. Mojave Desert Preserve, January.\n\nMy 9-year-old daughter scratches the ice on the inside of the SUV window, thrusting her hand out of the mass of her sleeping bag wrestled into a sitting position. Heart, she scratches. Smiley face. And then the dog’s name. We’re up.\n\nIn the next hour, she’ll watch the local college field trip cool older kids at White Cross Campground get up from their dozen tents and start packing for their day’s trek. She’ll get growled at by the dude in the remote back of the dispersed camping area who wants us to stay further than 200 yards from his motorhome. She’ll scramble through scree to find petroglyphs peeking through chia flowers. Until we are parked and drinking hot tea made on a burner in the back of the truck while the trains rush by, the conductor blasting the horn at her, at us, the only humans standing within a few miles, waving back at him, as he shoots past and sinks back into the desert.\n\nLater, after the dog barks at being left standing on the lava rocks as we crawl into a cave, after we carry the dog down the ladder into the lava tubes, stand in the cave a bit, and carry the fool dog back up, a guy says to her, watching the entire circus enterprise, “You should know, you have a really cool mom.” But I want to tell him, oh tell her anything at this age, she also thinks I’m a good singer and God knows that’s not true. But she also knows I just tossed her a cup in the back of the car and said pee here then. She knows there comes a moment in every night in every tent where I say enough, please stop talking. She is just now getting old enough to know all moms are not like me. If I get the balance just right, somewhere between tough love and gentle listener, that may in the end be said to be to my credit.\n\nIn the meantime, January in the cold desert still sounds good to her, so I haven’t broken her yet.\n\nLiving in the far southeastern end of the Coachella Valley was not always something I appreciated. Definitely not when I was a younger person. Growing up on the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indian Reservation in Thermal, the desolateness seemed to stunt my ability to dream. The vast open desert, agricultural fields and treacherous-looking mountains represented infinite emptiness at the time. I remember feeling so far away from anywhere, and believing that everything was happening someplace else.\n\nIn high school, my parents facilitated an interdistrict transfer for me to Palm Desert High. They believed I would receive a better education there. It was a different world from the community of Torres Martinez. Some of my fellow students had cars at ages 16 and 17 that were more fancy and expensive than those of our teachers. Life seemed privileged for a lot of my peers. But not for me and not for the young people I knew growing up. Our reservation and the surrounding rural community was, as it still remains, a place where many who live there work the hardest and also earn the least.\n\nExperiencing this proximity of poverty to extreme wealth in the desert was suffocating to me. Thus, as a teen, I could not wait to leave. Fortunately, my university education led me to schools in South Dakota, Humboldt County in Northern California and the Bay Area. All places of tremendous beauty. America’s vast great plains. The regal redwood forest. The state’s largest estuary. These journeys had the same origin and led me back to the same place, Torres Martinez. Each voyage away from home strengthened my appreciation for the reservation landscape. The distance from the rushing nature of city life now fosters my ability to think clearly.\n\nPeople often come to our area and see nothing but poverty and potential for expansion. But the reality is that Desert Cahuilla history, lifeways and culture have been there far longer than anything else. Those of us who were taught to can see the places relevant to our creation all around us. Everything, down to the natural colors of the earth, has meaning to us.\n\nIt’s clear that not everyone sees it this way. To some, our home area is a place where they can leave things they don’t want near them. Unwanted human waste, polluted water, old furniture and useless appliances are dumped in our homelands. Developers don’t see the wide open space as a sanctuary for free desert animals and plants to live, like my family does. Though the tribe has authority on what happens within our boundaries, there’s no regulating everything. Our quiet is encroached on weekends with the sound of bullets ringing out from sport hunters who are after the birds, as well as the incessant hum of cars from the nearby racetrack.\n\nThe proximity that once drove me away is coming even closer to my home. But now, it’s what keeps me around appreciating all that remains.\n\nTerria Smith is a tribal member of the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians.

The cultural significance and meaning of cannibalistic acts, however, have varied.\n\nAlthough the consumption of human flesh by other humans - also known as anthropophagy - has sometimes been a response to famine, the practice has often been symbolic or ritualistic. For the Aztecs, for example, “cannibalism was not motivated by starvation but by a belief that this was a way to commune with the gods”, anthropologist Bernard Ortiz de Montellano explained in a 1978 academic paper.\n\nThe Maori, meanwhile, are said to have eaten the flesh of opponents defeated in battle to warn off other enemies, while in Africa cannibalism has been linked to sorcery and beliefs that certain powers could be gained through the consumption of human flesh.\n\nAs recently as 2003, Fijians apologised to relatives of an English missionary killed and eaten in 1867. Historians believe the butchering of Reverend Thomas Baker “was likely ordered as part of a power play” between local chiefs in Nabutautau, on Fiji's main island of Vitu Levu, CNN reported following the apology.\n\nAccording to the news site, “folklore has it that Baker was killed after mistakenly touching a chief's head - a cultural taboo punishable by death. All that was left of Baker were the soles of his leather boots.”\n\nAnd when it’s not...\n\nAlthough countries including the UK and US do not have specific legislation against cannibalism, it is effectively outlawed under laws such as the 2004 Human Tissue Act, which covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland and legislates against the possession of human tissue without consent.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/17"}]}

It’s also almost certain that, on average, the next five years will be hotter than the last five.\n\nIn 2015, the chances of world temperatures temporarily exceeding 1.5C over the next five years were close to zero. Those odds have been inching up ever since as humans continue to emit greenhouse gas, primarily from the use of fossil fuels.\n\nScientists have warned that the world needs to limit global warming to 1.5C above the temperatures experienced before industrialization to avoid the more catastrophic effects of the climate crisis. In 2015, most of the world signed onto the Paris Agreement, aiming to limit temperature rise to 2C, but preferably 1.5C.\n\nThe world is already at least 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than it was before industrialization.\n\n“This study shows – with a high level of scientific skill – that we are getting measurably closer to temporarily reaching the lower target of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change,” WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas said in a statement accompanying the Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update.\n\n“The 1.5°C figure is not some random statistic,” he added. “It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet.”\n\nAn authoritative climate report published in February by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that some of the changes that could come as a result of the planet heating up by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius could be permanent – even if the planet does cool back down.\n\nEven at 1.5C, many of the world’s coral reefs will be wiped out, and permafrost in some places could reach a tipping point. Permafrost is “permanently” frozen ground that lies under much of the Arctic, keeping huge stores of carbon dioxide (CO2) locked away. As it melts in warmer temperatures, it releases CO2 and adds to climate change.\n\n“A single year of exceedance above 1.5°C does not mean we have breached the iconic threshold of the Paris Agreement,” said Leon Hermanson from the UK’s Met Office, which led the report, “but it does reveal that we are edging ever closer to a situation where 1.5 °C could be exceeded for an extended period.”\n\nWorkers use their helmets to pour water to cool themselves down as a heatwave rages in India Amit Dave/Reuters\n\nThe WMO report was published on the heels of heatwaves in India and Pakistan, which had experts questioning the ability for humans to survive in such high temperatures.\n\nIn the US, the largest manmade reservoir – Lake Mead – has seen water levels plunge to an unprecedented low over the last two months. Mead is a key source of water for millions of people across California, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nIn California, which is entirely in drought conditions, two of the state’s largest reservoirs — Shasta Lake and Lake Oroville — are at “critically low levels,” according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\nThe plummeting water levels at the lake are the result of a climate-change fueled megadrought in the American West. A study published by Nature Climate Change found the period from 2000 to 2021 was the driest in 1,200 years in the area.\n\n“For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise,” Taalas said.\n\n“And alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme. Arctic warming is disproportionately high and what happens in the Arctic affects all of us.”\n\nIce sheet and glacier melt in the Arctic will lead to accelerated sea level rise, which could be both irreversible for centuries and disastrous for the planet as the risks of extreme flooding increase.\n\nThe report highlights how fast humans are warming the planet, said Andrew King, a lecturer in Climate Science at the University of Melbourne.\n\n“Our greenhouse gas emissions are still at near-record highs and until we get emissions down to net-zero, we’re going to continue to see global warming,” he said.\n\nNet zero refers to a state where the world reduces its greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, and offsets any that are hard to avoid, whether through the use of technology or tree-planting to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nKing added: “If we fail to take that action we will have much worse heatwaves and bushfire conditions as well as coral reefs that have been decimated beyond recognition.”", "authors": ["Hannah Ryan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/13/world/climate-wmo-report-un-intl/index.html", "title": "UN chief says 'fossil fuel free-for-all' must end as report warns world ...", "text": "The impacts of climate change are “heading into uncharted territories of destruction,” UN Secretary General António Guterres warned on Tuesday on the release of a multi-agency scientific report reviewing the latest research on the subject.\n\nThe report, led by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), warns that the world is “going in the wrong direction” on climate change.\n\nWith greenhouse gas concentrations continuing to rise in the atmosphere and world leaders failing to adopt strategies to hold global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, the Earth is inching closer to dangerous climate tipping points, the United in Science report says.\n\nAlready, extreme weather events are more frequent and more intense.\n\n“Heatwaves in Europe. Colossal floods in Pakistan …There is nothing natural about the new scale of these disasters,” Guterres said in a video message.\n\n“The current fossil fuel free-for-all must end now. It is a recipe for permanent climate chaos and suffering,” he added.\n\nDespite a dip in emissions during coronavirus lockdowns, planet-warming emissions have since soared beyond pre-pandemic levels. Preliminary data reveal that global carbon dioxide emissions in the first half of this year were 1.2% higher than during the same period in 2019, the report finds.\n\nThe past seven years were the warmest on record.\n\nThe global average temperature has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average. And scientists expect the annual average could be anywhere between 1.1C and 1.7C warmer up to 2026 — meaning there’s a chance we could pass the 1.5C warming threshold in the next five years.\n\nThe report also said that the world was way off track in containing warming to 1.5C. Ambitions for emissions cuts by 2030 need to rise seven-fold to keep the goal in reach.\n\nBy the end of the century, without aggressive climate action, global warming is estimated to reach 2.8C.

Morgan watched his digital empire, including billions of his own fortune, evaporate in a death spiral that’s shaken the foundations of the trillion-dollar crypto industry.\n\nOn Thursday, Sam Bankman-Fried issued a mea culpa: “I f**ked up,” he wrote in a lengthy Twitter thread, apologizing to investors and customers of FTX, the exchange platform he founded in 2019. By Friday morning, FTX said Bankman-Fried had resigned as CEO and that the firm was filing for bankruptcy.\n\nFailures are not uncommon in the murky, largely unregulated world of crypto, but FTX is not your average crypto startup. Its near-collapse this week represents a potential turning point for an industry that many critics say has been given a pass for far too long.\n\nSo, what happened to FTX, and why is the entire crypto space freaking out about it? There are still a lot of uncertainties, but here’s what we know.\n\nFishy finances\n\nLast week, the crypto news website CoinDesk published an article based on a leaked financial document from Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund, Alameda Research.\n\nThe report suggested that Alameda’s business rested on shaky financial footing. Namely, that the bulk of its assets are held in FTT, a digital token minted by Alameda’s sister firm, FTX. That was a red flag for investors, as the companies were, on paper at least, separate. Alameda’s disproportionate holdings of the token, however, suggested the two were much more closely linked.\n\nOn Sunday, the CEO of Binance, FTX’s much larger rival, said his company was liquidating $580 million worth of FTX holdings. That set off a firestorm of draw downs that FTX didn’t have the cash to facilitate.\n\nRivals come together\n\nBy Monday, concerns about Alameda and FTX had bled into the broader crypto market. But Bankman-Fried was defiant, tweeting that FTX and its assets were “fine.” He also sparred with the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, whose tweet had fueled the run on FTX deposits.\n\nThere was clearly bad blood between the two, which is why it shocked the industry when the pair announced a tentative deal Tuesday for Binance to bail out FTX.\n\n“This afternoon, FTX asked for our help,” Zhao tweeted that afternoon, noting that there was a “significant liquidity crunch” at the company and that Binance would have to conduct corporate due diligence before going forward with any deal.\n\nAlmost immediately after getting a look at under the hood, though, Binance began to backtrack.\n\nMeanwhile, Bankman-Fried’s personal fortune also tumbled. According to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, Bankman-Fried’s net worth cratered 94% in a single day, from more than $15 billion to just under $1 billion — the biggest one-day loss ever clocked by the index. (The estimate of his wealth was based on the assumption that Binance would ultimately bail out FTX, where much of Bankman-Fried’s personal assets are held. Which means his net worth may have farther to fall.)\n\nThe flip-flop\n\nOn Wednesday, cryptocurrencies continued to slump as investor anxiety about the FTX bailout spread. Bitcoin and ether, the two most popular tokens, both hit their lowest level in two years.\n\nThe selloff deepened after media reports emerged that Binance was leaning toward walking away from the deal. Sure enough, on Wednesday afternoon, Zhao tweeted a withering assessment of FTX’s problems:\n\n“In the beginning, our hope was to be able to support FTX’s customers to provide liquidity, but the issues are beyond our control or ability to help.”\n\nHe also alluded to allegations of “mishandled funds” and investigations by US regulators.\n\nBinance was out. FTX’s best shot at a lifeline was gone.\n\nDamage control at FTX\n\nThe full extent of FTX’s financial problems aren’t yet known, but multiple reports say the firm is facing an $8 billion shortfall. Without a quick infusion of equity, Bankman-Fried reportedly told investors Thursday, the firm was facing bankruptcy.\n\nSince the Binance deal fell apart, Bankman-Fried has been scrambling to raise funds. On Thursday, tweeted that there were “a number of players” the firm was in talks with.\n\n“We’re spending the week doing everything we can to raise liquidity,” he wrote in his apology thread. “Every penny” of that, plus the remaining collateral, will go toward making users whole, followed by investors and employees.”\n\nHow did FTX fail?\n\nDespite its reputation as a dependable, low-risk investment portal, FTX’s business appears to have been built on a complex, extremely risky kind of leveraged trading.\n\nCustomers deposited their money to engage in crypto trading. But it appears that FTX instead took billions of dollars worth of that money and loaned it out to its sister firm, Alameda, to fund those high-risk bets, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nBloomberg columnist Matt Levine put it another way: “FTX took its customers’ money and traded it for a pile of magic beans, and now the beans are worthless.”\n\nAt the end of the day, FTX experienced the crypto equivalent of a classic bank run. Customers wanted their money out, and FTX didn’t have it.\n\nIn traditional finance, customers’ funds are protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits. The FDIC does not insure stocks or cryptocurrencies, however, leaving the fate of FTX’s customers and investors in question.\n\nOne of those investors was the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, which said it invested $95 million in both FTX International and its US entity “to gain small-scale exposure to an emerging area in the financial technology sector.” In a statement Thursday, the plan noted that any loss on its investment would have “limited impact” as it represents less than 0.05% of its total net assets.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nAfter a chaotic week, FTX filed for bankruptcy. In a statement, FTX said John Ray III has been appointed the new CEO and that many exchange employees are expected to stay on to run the firm as it goes through the Chapter 11 process.\n\nRay said bankruptcy protection will give FTX the chance to “assess its situation and develop a process to maximize recoveries for stakeholders.”\n\nRegulators are now swirling to investigate what went wrong at FTX, and some lawmakers are demanding a crackdown.\n\nSecurities regulators in the Bahamas, where FTX is based, froze some of the embattled exchange’s assets on Thursday. Both the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating FTX, according to the Wall Street Journal. (The DOJ declined to comment, and the SEC said it does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.)\n\nThe collapse of FTX is “a loud warning bell that cryptocurrencies can fail,” Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement on Thursday. “And just like we saw with over-the-counter derivatives that led to a financial crisis, these failures can have a ripple effect on consumers and other parts of our financial system.”", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/22/media/regal-cinemas-cineworld-possible-bankruptcy/index.html", "title": "Regal Cinemas: Cineworld says may file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThe owner of Regal Cinemas confirmed Monday that it was considering filing for bankruptcy but promised “business as usual” at it tries to shore up its finances.\n\nBritish company Cineworld Group said in a statement that a “voluntary Chapter 11 filing in the United States” was one of the options it was reviewing in an attempt to reduce its debt burden.\n\nMeanwhile, Cineworld and Regal theaters were open for “business as usual,” it added, and would remain so.\n\n“Cineworld would expect to maintain its operations in the ordinary course until and following any filing and ultimately to continue its business over the longer term with no significant impact upon its employees,” the company said in the statement issued in response to reports last week.\n\nShares in Cineworld crashed as much as 80% in London on Friday after the Wall Street Journal reported that the world’s second largest movie theater chain had spoken to lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis LLP to advise on the bankruptcy process in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nThe company’s stock fell another 20% Monday.

But a liquidity crunch last week forced FTX to halt withdrawals, leaving customers and investors in limbo. FTX reportedly used customer funds to prop up its sister hedge fund’s high-risk trading operation without permission, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nOn Friday, FTX and the hedge fund, Alameda Research, filed for bankruptcy.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York are now investigating the exchange’s collapse, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. And authorities in the Bahamas, where FTX is based, launched a criminal probe into the firm over the weekend.\n\nThe legal ramifications for FTX and its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, remain unclear. But as the exchange, once valued at more than $30 billlion, collapses, it looks increasingly likely that customers who handed their money over to FTX could be left holding the bag.\n\n“We just don’t know the extent of contagion,” said Howard Fischer, a partner at law firm Moses Singer and a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer. “The first ring of victims are the people who had assets held in FTX…They are probably not going to be made whole, or anywhere close to it.”\n\nThere are a few reasons for this.\n\nIn a traditional US bank failure, the government insures customer deposits, making them whole up to $250,000. But there simply is no mechanism for depositor insurance in the largely unregulated world of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn theory, FTX’s customers should get a cut of what’s left of the company’s assets at the end of the bankruptcy process. But so far, at least, it’s not clear how much will be left to disburse.\n\n“As far as I know, they have two assets — the goodwill value of the exchange and the value of their FTT coins,” said Eric Snyder, head of the bankruptcy department at the law firm Wilk Auslander. (Goodwill value refers to intangible assets like a brand’s reputation and intellectual property. And FTT coins, the crypto token issued by FTX, have lost more than 90% of their value over the past week.)\n\nIn bankruptcies, Snyder explains, there’s a fairly simple formula to figure out how much creditors — in this case, FTX depositors — will receive.\n\n“The numerator is the assets, the denominator’s liability. You divide one into the other, and the [result] is what everybody gets,” he said. “But if people are pulling out all the assets, then there’s not going to be much of a numerator.”\n\nHe added: “It’s very conceivable that the return will be minimal at best.”\n\nOf course, the suddenness of FTX’s downfall makes it a difficult case to assess this early on, lawyers say.\n\nNormally, companies would have weeks to prepare bankruptcy filings that disclose, among other things, an explanation of why the company sought Chapter 11 protection and what it aims to accomplish in bankruptcy court.\n\nDan Besikof, a partner at Loeb & Loeb who specializes in bankruptcy, says it’s too soon to say whether customers are going to get any money back.\n\n“All you can really do is guess from tweets where things stand,” he said. “And how customers recover their money might depend on a lot of different things, including which entity they hold the money through, what amount of the coins still remain.”\n\nThe FTX fallout has rattled the entire crypto industry, raising serious questions about the future of digital assets and the lack of global regulation.\n\nOn Monday, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of FTX competitor Binance, sought to reassure his audience of the sector’s legitimacy.\n\n“It’s obvious that people are jittery,” said Zhao, widely known as CZ, in a question-and-answer session on Twitter. “I want to say, short-term, it is painful. But I think this is actually good for the industry long-term.”\n\nThe giant crypto exchange briefly emerged as a lifeline for FTX before reversing course last week.\n\nZhao, whose tweet announcing Binance’s divestment in FTX helped fuel the smaller firm’s liquidity crisis, has denied having a “master plan” to expose FTX. Still, critics note the biggest, and perhaps only, winner in the downfall of FTX is none other than Zhao, now unquestionably the wealthiest and most influential player in digital asset trading.\n\n“As much as some people blame me for whistleblowing or poking the bubble, I apologize for that … I apologize for any turmoil that I caused. But I think any time, if there’s a problem, the earlier we reveal it, the better.”\n\n—CNN Business’ Matt Egan and Kara Scannell contributed to this article.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the law firm Loeb & Loeb.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/12/31/brands-that-disappeared-in-the-last-decade/43298485/", "title": "Big-name brands that disappeared in the last decade include ...", "text": "Grant Suneson\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nRunning a company is never easy, and 2020 was even more challenging, presenting business owners with an unprecedented set of circumstances. The COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions to the American economy, with the unemployment rate peaking at 14.7% in April. While unemployment dropped to 6.7% in November, it is still more than 3 percentage points higher than it was prior to the escalation of the pandemic.\n\nWith this economic crunch, many struggling companies were forced to seek bankruptcy protection or cease operations altogether. These businesses will join a list of once-prominent brands that, for one reason or another (long before the pandemic), lost profitability and shut down in the past 10 years.\n\nTo determine the brands that disappeared between 2011 and 2020, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed press releases, financial filings, and other news sources to find the major corporations that either went completely out of business or ceased the bulk of their operations.\n\nMinimum wage:Pay scale set to rise in 20 states, 32 localities as growing number adopt $15 an hour\n\nProduct recall:Target recalls 480,000 infants' rompers, swimsuits over choking, pinching concerns\n\nMany of the companies on this list failed to adapt to changing market forces and lost profits because of it. Retailers that were once successful saw online shopping cut into their sales, even before the pandemic required social distancing.\n\nThough virtually every business faced pandemic-related struggles, few sectors had a harder time getting through 2020 than restaurants. With restrictions on indoor dining and supply chain issues, as well as having to temporarily close due to local health measures, more than 100,000 eateries have closed their doors for good. According to the National Restaurant Association, these closures will affect around one out of every six restaurants in the country. Among these casualties are world famous restaurants all across the country. These are the saddest restaurant closings of 2020.\n\n1. Vine\n\n• Founded in: 2012\n\n• Type of business: Media\n\nVine was a short-lived but beloved video making app that took the internet by storm in the early 2010s. The app let users make six second videos that looped over and over, often to hilarious effect. Vine was purchased by Twitter in 2012 for $30 million as an easy way for users to shoot and share videos on the social media platform. Many other social media platforms began to offer video services similar to Vine's – specifically Instagram, which also gave creators a longer time limit on videos. Perhaps as a result, Vine usership plummeted, and Twitter discontinued the app in 2016.\n\n2. Pier 1 Imports\n\n• Founded in: 1962\n\n• Type of business: Home goods\n\nUnlike many of the other companies that folded in 2020, Pier 1 Imports was already on its way out long before the COVID-19 pandemic. The home goods retailer filed for bankruptcy in February, following nine straight quarters of declining sales. A few months later, Pier 1 decided to cease all operations and liquidate its assets.\n\n3. Borders\n\n• Founded in: 1971\n\n• Type of business: Retail, books\n\nAs Amazon expanded far beyond its initial aim of selling books through the internet, brick-and-mortar book sellers like Borders struggled to keep up. While Borders competitor Barnes and Noble launched its own eBook reader, Borders failed to adapt to shifts in customer preferences and went bankrupt in 2011. The company had nearly $1.3 billion in debt, exceeding the total value of its assets.\n\n4. The Weinstein Company\n\n• Founded in: 2005\n\n• Type of business: Entertainment\n\nAfter becoming successful in founding Miramax Films, Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob founded film studio The Weinstein Company in 2005. In 2017, the New York Times and The New Yorker magazine published accounts from numerous women accusing Weinstein of rape, sexual harrassment, and unprofessional conduct. Following these revelations, the company bearing Weinstein's name was in a public relations crisis. After an attempted sale fell through, The Weinstein Company declared bankruptcy in early 2018. Lantern Capital eventually won a bidding war for the assets of the company.\n\n5. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus\n\n• Founded in: 1884\n\n• Type of business: Entertainment\n\nFor nearly 150 years, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus traveled around the country to entertain the masses. Acquired by Feld Entertainment in 1967, the circus began losing its popularity over the past few decades – attendance has reportedly dropped by as much as 50% since the 1990s.\n\nAnimal rights activists continuously targeted the circus for its use of creatures like elephants in the show. Feld Entertainment's CEO also noted that audiences seemed to be abandoning the circus due to their shortening attention spans and expanding entertainment options. The high cost of moving the show from city to city eventually made the business model untenable. The circus act performed for the final time in 2017.\n\n6. Sports Authority\n\n• Founded in: 1987\n\n• Type of business: Retail, sports\n\nIn 2005, Sports Authority had $2.5 billion in sales across nearly 400 stores. The following year, the Colorado-based sporting goods retailer became a private company after a buyout by a private equity firm. Over the course of the next decade, Sports Authority faced stiff competition not just from online retailers, but also similar businesses like Dicks Sporting Goods. In March 2016, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It initially planned to keep most of its stores open, but eventually decided to shutter all locations. Later that year, Sports Authority's intellectual property was auctioned off for $15 million to its former competitor Dick's Sporting Goods.\n\n7. Theranos\n\n• Founded in: 2003\n\n• Type of business: Health care\n\nTheranos once appeared to be on the verge of revolutionizing the health care industry, but the entire operation turned out to be a sham. CEO Elizabeth Holmes claimed her company was creating a machine that could diagnose a wide range of diseases by analyzing a few drops of blood from a pricked finger. This promising idea earned Theranos a $9 billion valuation. It was later revealed that Theranos was simply testing customers' blood using standard testing devices from other companies. Holmes now faces up to 20 years in prison on nine counts of wire fraud and two conspiracy counts related to defrauding investors, doctors, and patients. The company was dissolved in 2018.\n\n8. Gawker\n\n• Founded in: 2003\n\n• Type of business: Media\n\nGawker was an incredibly popular gossip blog that spawned a media empire, including specialty sites like Jezebel, io9, Deadspin and Kotaku. It was also one of the most divisive sites on the internet, publishing revealing pieces, frequently outing public figures as gay – including tech billionaire Peter Thiel. Thiel eventually funded a violation of privacy lawsuit filed by pro wrestler Hulk Hogan after Gawker published a sex tape of Hogan without his or his partner's permission. Hogan, real name Terry Bollea, won a $140 million judgement in 2016, which was settled for $31 million. Gawker declared bankruptcy, and the company was put up for auction.\n\nUnivision acquired all the brands under the Gawker Media umbrella but shut down Gawker.com itself as the brand could have been a target of further lawsuits. Gawker.com was purchased by Bustle and planned to relaunch in 2019, but after a series of disagreements among staff and management, the relaunch was postponed and the staff laid off.\n\n9. Solyndra\n\n• Founded in: 2005\n\n• Type of business: Tech, solar panels\n\nSolar panel manufacturing company Solyndra was a Silicon Valley darling, raising about $1 billion in venture capital funds and getting a $535 million loan thanks to a U.S. Department of Energy green power initiative. When the company went out of business in 2011, it became the most well-financed flop in U.S. venture capital history. Even though it had $140 million in revenue, the influx of cheaper solar panels put Solyndra out of business in 2011.\n\n10. Dressbarn\n\n• Founded in: 1962\n\n• Type of business: Retail, clothing\n\nDressbarn was one of many companies that have suffered with the decline of the American mall. A staple at many large malls and shopping centers, Dressbarn offered professional women's clothing at hundreds of locations across the country. In 2019, the company announced it would close down all of its approximately 650 nationwide stores. Dressbarn's CFO said the company was not \"operating at an acceptable level of profitability in today's retail environment.\"\n\n11. A&P Supermarket\n\n• Founded in: 1859\n\n• Type of business: Grocery store\n\nA&P Supermarket disappeared in 2015 after more than 100 years in business as it could not compete with cheaper grocers like Walmart or higher-end chains like Whole Foods. A&P first went bankrupt in 2010, declaring $2.5 billion in assets and $3.2 billion in debt, before re-establishing itself as a private company two years later. The company again declared bankruptcy in 2015, this time shuttering or selling all of its locations.\n\n12. MoviePass\n\n• Founded in: 2011\n\n• Type of business: Entertainment\n\nMoviePass allowed users to pay a flat monthly fee to see as many movies as they wanted in theaters. According to MoviePass co-founder Stacy Spikes, its $9.95 price point was simply too low for the business model, which aimed to gain more revenue from the data it could glean from its customers. Spikes said parent company Helios and Matheson Analytics gained so many users after lowering the price, they refused to raise it.\n\nWith users seeing millions of dollars worth of movies each month on the company's dime, the model became unsustainable and Helios and Matheson was bleeding cash. The company began imposing restrictions, blacking out certain films, and gained a reputation for poor customer service, driving away users. Finally, in September 2019, MoviePass ceased operations. At one point in 2018, Helios and Matheson stock was worth over $2,000 per share. Now it is worth less than a penny.\n\n13. Modell's\n\n• Founded in:1889\n\n• Type of business: Sporting goods\n\nModell's was a large sporting goods chain that operated in the northeastern part of the country. After initially planning to shut down just 24 of its stores, the company filed for bankruptcy in February, before the pandemic, and announced plans to close all stores. Modell's executives blamed competition from big box stores and Amazon as well as warmer winters that cut into jacket sales for hurting sales and ultimately causing the stores to close.\n\n14. Teavana\n\n• Founded in: 1997\n\n• Type of business: Retail, tea\n\nStarbucks is the nation's leading coffee seller, and in 2012, the company decided to venture into tea, acquiring Teavana for about $620 million. Many Teavana stores were located in shopping malls, which have experienced a significant decline in foot traffic in recent years. Starbucks decided in 2017 to close all of Teavana's nearly 400 locations.\n\n15. Toys R Us\n\n• Founded in: 1957\n\n• Type of business: Retail, toys\n\nToys R Us was once a corporate juggernaut, controlling a quarter of the world's toy market with nearly 1,500 stores in the 1990s. The company's fortunes changed in the 21st century. Several private equity firms combined to take Toys R Us private in a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout deal in 2005. The company registered for an IPO in 2010 but withdrew the application in 2013 as sales have been declining. In 2017, Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy, with $5 billion worth of debt. The next year, the company announced plans to close all of its 800 or so remaining stores.\n\n16. Alta Motors\n\n• Founded in: 2010\n\n• Type of business: Vehicles, electric motorbikes\n\nEven as electric cars like Tesla have been taking off, one of the major players in electric motorbikes shut down operations in 2018. Alta Motors had expanded to more than 70 dealerships by 2018, but it failed to maintain a firm financial footing, even though sales had increased 50% in 2018 and reviewers and journalists seemed to be impressed with the product. A potential partnership with Harley-Davidson reportedly fell through, and the company ceased operations in 2018.\n\n17. Vertu\n\n• Founded in: 1998\n\n• Type of business: Tech, phones\n\nVertu was founded in 1998 by Nokia as a high-end luxury phone maker. Vertu phones were often covered in jewels and other precious metals, costing over $10,000 for even the most basic of models. Nokia spun it off in 2012 to a Swedish private equity group that paid over $200 million for Vertu in 2012. The phones were difficult to sell, in part because of the high price point, but also because the technology itself was inferior to other phones on the market. The company was struggling over the next few years, posting losses of more than $60 million in 2014. Vertu was sold to a Hong Kong-based fund in 2015, then to an exiled Turkish businessman in 2017. That year, it was revealed the company had over $130 million in debt, and it was liquidated.\n\n18. American Apparel\n\n• Founded in: 1989\n\n• Type of business: Retail, clothing\n\nOnce a shopping mall staple, there are no more physical American Apparel locations in any of America's malls. At its peak, the company was valued at over $1 billion, and once had over $600 million in sales. But the company filed for bankruptcy in 2015 after failing to turn a profit for six years. The clothing retailer would file for bankruptcy again just over a year later. American Apparel laid off employees and auctioned off its brand and equipment for just $88 million. It now operates as an online-only retailer.\n\n19. Compaq\n\n• Founded in: 1982\n\n• Type of business: Tech, computers\n\nCompaq was once one of the leading computer companies in America and the world overall. After its 1982 founding, the company had experienced tremendous growth, and by 1994, it controlled over 10% of the global computer marketplace. At its peak in 2000, Compaq was worth $40 billion. Yet competitors like Dell were able to eat up much of Compaq's market share by selling directly to customers and allowing customization, while Compaq had distribution deals with retailers like Best Buy and Circuit City. In 2002, Compaq was acquired by HP for $24 billion in a controversial and contentious merger. HP retired the Compaq name in 2013.\n\n20. Luby's\n\n• Founded in: 1947\n\n• Type of business: Restaurant\n\nLike many other restaurants, Luby's Cafeteria struggled with the COVID-19 pandemic. The eatery was particularly ill-suited to survive – its cafeteria-style serving made social distancing harder, and the restaurant chain had already been struggling financially for years. The company announced in September 2020 that all of its Luby's Cafeteria locations would close. Its parent company, Luby's Inc., said in December it would sell off all Fuddruckers locations to a franchisee before dissolving the company altogether.\n\n21. Pebble\n\n• Founded in: 2012\n\n• Type of business: Tech, wearables\n\nTech startup Pebble appeared poised for success after raising over $10 million on Kickstarter – then the most successful campaign of all time – to fund its early venture into smartwatches. While Apple was still focused on iPhones and iPods, Pebble's campaign proved people would be interested in wearable tech. Once Pebble watches hit the market, sales were solid and reviews were mostly positive.\n\nBy 2015, Pebble was valued at $740 million – but it would be out of business the following year as Apple released its own smartwatch. Pebble struggled with supply chain issues, while Apple Watches took up more and more of the smartwatch market share. Pebble was unable to compete and was sold to FitBit for less than $40 million.\n\n22. Jawbone\n\n• Founded in: 1999\n\n• Type of business: Tech, wearables\n\nJawbone is a classic case of a unique Silicon Valley phenomenon: \"death by overfunding.\" The wearable tech company, known for making Bluetooth headsets and speakers, was once worth billions of dollars, but only because of all the capital it raised and not necessarily because of its earning potential. The company raised about $900 million in funding, which boosted its peak valuation to $3.2 billion in 2014.\n\nBy 2017, Jawbone was facing lawsuits from vendors, who said the company owed them money, and the company entered liquidation. According to Reuters, only one other venture capital-supported startup, solar panel maker Solyndra, raised more capital than Jawbone, and it also went out of business.\n\n23. Palm\n\n• Founded in: 1992\n\n• Type of business: Tech, phones\n\nWell before smartphones, PDAs – personal digital assistants – were a must-have device. The company that manufactured them, Palm, rose in value quickly. In 1998, Palm had more than two-thirds of the world's PDA market. It had a massively successful IPO in 2000 when it was spun off from parent company 3Com, and like many tech companies of that era, Palm was riding the dotcom bubble that was about to burst. At its peak in 2000, Palm's valuation was more than $53 billion, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. Competitors like Sony began to eat into the PDA market, and once the tech bubble burst, Palm's stock price came crashing down. By 2009, Palm was bleeding cash, and it was acquired by HP for $1.2 billion in 2010. HP announced in 2011 it would no longer make Palm hardware and retired the brand.\n\n24. Henri Bendel\n\n• Founded in: 1895\n\n• Type of business: Retail, luxury\n\nOnce an iconic department store, Henri Bendel shuttered all of its remaining locations in 2019. In 2018, the brand operated at a $45 million loss. The luxury retailer, which was owned by L Brands, suffered the same fate as many other high-end stores. Many brick-and-mortar operations struggled to compete with online shopping, while industry analysts believe consumers have been spending less on luxury goods in favor of other purchases like phones and other tech.\n\n25. Blockbuster\n\n• Founded in: 1985\n\n• Type of business: Retail, entertainment\n\nEven before the advent and surging popularity of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, Blockbuster was struggling. The once-ubiquitous video rental store has been in decline since 2004, when it had 9,000 stores worldwide. Blockbuster now has just one location – in Bend, Oregon. The decision to abandon online service helped doom the company, which filed for bankruptcy in 2010.\n\n26. Lord & Taylor\n\n• Founded in: 1826\n\n• Type of business: Department store\n\nLord & Taylor, which opened in 1826, was considered the oldest department store in the country. It shut down largely due to COVID-19, but the store suffered from the same issues many department stores and retailers were facing even before the pandemic, including lower foot traffic and declining revenue as online shopping became more common. Lord & Taylor was sold to an investment firm in 2006 for $1.2 billion. In 2019, fashion rental company Le Tote bought it for around $71 million. The company began liquidating its stores in August.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Taking the helm in his place is John J. Ray III, the lawyer who oversaw the liquidation of Enron.\n\nSeveral employees are expected to stay on to run the company in Chapter 11.\n\n“I’m really sorry, again, that we ended up here,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a Twitter thread Friday. “Hopefully things can find a way to recover.”\n\nThe bankruptcy proceedings include FTX US, FTX’s crypto hedge fund Alameda and about 130 other sister companies.\n\nRay said bankruptcy protection will give FTX the chance to “assess its situation and develop a process to maximize recoveries for stakeholders.”\n\nIn its bankruptcy filing, FTX says it has between $10 billion and $50 billion of estimated liabilities and assets.\n\nThe bankruptcy serves two immediate functions, says Eric Snyder, a bankruptcy attorney with Wilk Auslander. It stops any further withdrawals from the exchange and creates a central place to examine all the claims.\n\n“One of the unknowns is where they’re going to get the funds to operate bankruptcy,” he said. “We don’t have an answer to that right now.”\n\nThe implosion of FTX, unthinkable just days ago, is shaking the crypto industry to its core. It was triggered by a run-on-the-bank-like crisis after serious questions were raised last week about the health of the FTX balance sheet.\n\nRegulators are now swirling to investigate what went wrong, and some lawmakers are demanding a crackdown.\n\nSecurities regulators in the Bahamas, where FTX.com is based, froze some of the embattled exchange’s assets on Thursday. FTX’s Japanese business was put into “close-only mode,” meaning users can only close out their positions, after regulators in that country ordered it to suspend operations.\n\nBoth the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating FTX, The Wall Street Journal reported. The DOJ declined to comment, and the SEC said it does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.\n\nBankman-Fried has been one of the faces of the crypto industry, amassing a fortune once totaling $25 billion that has since vanished. He was viewed as the crypto world’s white knight, stepping in to rescue struggling companies. FTX, backed by elite investors like BlackRock and Sequoia Capital, rapidly became one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world.\n\nFTX spent lavishly to reach endorsement deals with the likes of Gisele, Tom Brady and Steph Curry. The company’s logo and name are splashed on the home of the NBA’s Miami Heat and even on the logos of MLB umpires.\n\nThe implosion of FTX was preceded by the decision to lend billions of dollars’ worth of customer assets to fund risky bets by Alameda, the Journal reported on Thursday. Alameda now owes FTX a staggering $10 billion that the exchange had serious trouble raising, the paper said.\n\nIt’s not clear what comes next for Bankman-Fried, who has hired Paul Weiss attorney Martin Flumenbaum, a white-collar defense lawyer known for representing junk-bond trader Michael Milken.\n\n“FTX’s bankruptcy underscores crypto’s structural challenges around transparency and poor risk management that, time and again, have led to losses for investors,” said Monsur Hussain, senior director at Fitch Ratings.", "authors": ["Matt Egan Allison Morrow", "Matt Egan", "Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/media/2023/03/14/bally-sports-owner-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/11475131002/", "title": "Bally Sports owner files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy", "text": "Associated Press\n\nDiamond Sports Group, the largest owner of regional sports networks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday.

Those networks have the rights to 42 professional teams — 14 baseball, 16 NBA and 12 NHL.\n\nThe company said in a release Tuesday night that it expects to continue to operate during the bankruptcy process and that coverage of games should not be affected.\n\n\"Diamond Sports Group's bankruptcy declaration today is an unfortunate development that we have been expecting. Despite Diamond's economic situation, there is every expectation that they will continue televising all games they are committed to during the bankruptcy process,\" Major League Baseball said in a statement released Tuesday night. \"Major League Baseball is ready to produce and distribute games to fans in their local markets in the event Diamond or any other regional sports network is unable to do so as required by their agreement with our Clubs.\n\n\"Having streamed live games on MLB.TV for more than 20 years and producing live games for MLB Network since 2008, we have the experience and capabilities to deliver games to fans uninterrupted.

Over the long term, we will reimagine our distribution model to address the changing media climate and ultimately reach an ever larger number of fans.\"\n\nDiamond Sports also said it is negotiating a restructuring agreement with debt holders that will eliminate most of its debt. Under an agreement with creditors, it would become a separate company from Sinclair Broadcast Group.\n\n“DSG will continue broadcasting games and connecting fans across the country with the sports and teams they love,” Diamond Sports CEO David Preschlack said in a statement. “We look forward to working constructively with our team and league partners and all DSG stakeholders throughout this process and beyond.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/business/crypto-contagion-genesis-ftx-ctrp/index.html", "title": "Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen named in lawsuit against FTX ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe fallout from the spectacular implosion of crypto giant FTX has triggered a cascade of wide-reaching effects: It’s ensnared a number of celebrities who endorsed the now-bankrupt platform, and financial contagion is spreading across the vast crypto and digital-asset ecosystem.\n\nOn Wednesday, the lending arm of crypto brokerage Genesis suspended redemptions and new loan originations after an “abnormal” number of withdrawal requests that exceeded its current liquidity, citing market turmoil from the failure of FTX.\n\nGenesis said it was working with advisers “to explore all possible options,” adding that it would release a plan for the lending business next week. “We’re working tirelessly to identify the best solutions for the lending business, including among other things, sourcing new liquidity,” the company said.\n\nGenesis’ lending unit had about $2.8 billion in active loans in the third quarter, according to its website.\n\nThe suspension comes as the entire crypto industry is on edge following the unraveling of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange and Alameda Research hedge fund, both of which filed for bankruptcy late last week.\n\n“In the crypto world, the minute you see a company or firm announce ‘we’re temporarily halting withdrawals’ — yikes,” said Daniel Roberts, editor-in-chief of Decrypt Media, a crypto-focused news outlet. “You put them on death watch now … It’s unusual that someone says ‘we’re halting withdrawals’ and then they say, ‘OK, withdrawals back on, we’re good.’”\n\nThat “death watch” is not confined to Genesis.\n\nSoon after the company suspended withdrawals, one of its partners, Gemini — the crypto firm founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss — warned customers that redemptions under its Earn program would be delayed. Gemini said it was working with Genesis to help customers redeem funds from the program, which allowed customers to earn interest on crypto holdings. No other Gemini products or services were affected, the company said.\n\nMeanwhile another big player in the crypto space, BlockFi, halted withdrawals last week as FTX came unglued. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported BlockFi was preparing for a potential bankruptcy filing.\n\nOf course, major players in the crypto space are rushing to distinguish themselves from FTX and other firms that have gone bust in the past year as token prices have slumped.\n\nOne is Brian Armstrong, the CEO of publicly traded exchange Coinbase, who told CNN’s Julia Chatterly on Wednesday that even though the fallout is hurting the industry now, it may ultimately be a positive for companies like his.\n\n“Crypto is not going anywhere,” he said in an interview, which will air Thursday on First Move. “One bad player does not undermine the entire thing — similarly to how Bernie Madoff doesn’t cause us to question the entire traditional financial system.”\n\nLawsuit names Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, others\n\nAnd the legal headaches for Bankman-Fried, FTX’s founder who resigned as CEO last week, are piling up.\n\nOn Wednesday an FTX investor sued Bankman-Fried as well as several celebrities who have endorsed the platform, including Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen and Steph Curry. “The deceptive FTX platform maintained by the FTX entities was truly a house of cards,” the proposed class-action lawsuit states.\n\nHeavyweight lawyers Adam Moskowitz and David Boies filed the suit on behalf of an FTX customer, Edwin Garrison.\n\nMoskowitz, a Florida lawyer, is also behind a class-action suit against crypto broker Voyager Digital, which also filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.

Although the show has no official release date, the teaser trailer itself revealed a series of previously unseen photographs as well as footage of Meghan wiping away tears.\n\n‘Declaration of war’\n\nThe trailer’s release “could hardly have been timed for more explosive impact”, said Louis Chilton in The Independent. The appetiser for the “unprecedented new documentary” comes “just a day after the late Queen’s lady-in-waiting, Lady Susan Hussey, resigned from the palace over a racism scandal”.\n\nAnd it was only last year that the Duchess of Sussex told Oprah Winfrey in a two-hour TV interview that when she was pregnant with her first child Archie there had been “concerns and conversations” among unnamed members of the royal family “about how dark his skin might be when he was born”.\n\nDan Wootton, writing for Mail Online, described the 59-second “vile” Netflix trailer as a declaration of “all out war on the British Royal Family”.\n\nWootton also focused on the timing of the release, but instead claimed it was “specifically designed to derail William and Kate’s already troubled US tour”, the Prince and Princess of Wales having arrived in Boston on Wednesday for a three-day trip centred around William’s Earthshot Prize climate charity.\n\n“It’s confirmation that, despite the hopes of a grieving King Charles, the relationship with his youngest son and daughter-in-law is now forever smashed,” Wootton continued. He added that “there’s no going back after this full-throttled attack on the British monarchy” and called on the King to “go nuclear too by stripping his son and his wife of their royal titles”.\n\nWriting in The Times, Hilary Rose agreed with Wootton, sarcastically declaring the timing of the trailer release a “happy, scene-stealing coincidence”. Rose believes the Sussexes, while their true motivation is anyone’s guess, are attempting to “suck the oxygen out of every single thing the Waleses do between now and kingdom come”. She even admitted to feeling sorry for William and Kate despite their “lives of unimaginable wealth and privilege” for what William’s brother and his Hollywood wife are putting them through.\n\n‘Winning the battle but losing the war’\n\n“What were you both thinking?!” asked Paul Baldwin of the Sussexes in the Daily Express. Baldwin said that before the trailer’s release and in light of the Lady Hussey racism scandal, he had started to think that maybe Harry and Meghan “really were victims”. However, his sympathies have since waned with the release of what he described as a “toe-curling, truly bizarre promo-video”.\n\nIn the Daily Mail, Maureen Callahan concluded that while “Harry and Meghan are winning the battle” they are certainly “going to lose this war”. Callahan added that “it’s as if Harry and Meghan have nothing better to do than go through the royal schedule and figure out ways to screw the family over”.\n\nIn her conclusion, Callahan asserted that ultimately “these two have nothing new to say”. The couple will not win the attrition war they’re fighting with the royal family because “they exist only in opposition to the royals. They have nothing to offer.”\n\nWhile criticism of the Sussexes was plentiful across the mainstream media, the New York Post did highlight some support for Harry and Meghan, citing a tweet that argued “imagine being right that staff in the royal household are racist but no-one believed you”, in reference to the widely criticised comments from Lady Hussey.", "authors": ["Fred Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/09/28/prince-george-shark-tooth-malta-wants-david-attenborough-gift-returned/3565765001/", "title": "Prince George's shark tooth: Malta says he can keep Attenborough gift", "text": "Never mind!

And Maltese Prime Minister Robert Abela said “we should avoid creating unnecessary controversies” when asked about the flap.\n\nHerrera's initial remarks about reclaiming George's shark tooth were indeed controversial and embarrassing. Critics included the son of murdered Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, Matthew Galizia, who pointed out on Twitter that a “megalodon tooth costs $40 on eBay.

According to Hello!, the house has “a grand total of nine bedrooms and 16 bathrooms”, as well as a library, office, spa, gym, games room, cinema, wine cellar and five-car garage. A separate guest house also has two bedrooms and bathrooms. Cunningham said: “The kitchen is probably one of the coolest rooms in the house.

Great royal events in the United Kingdom are often a mix of old and new, and the commemoration and funeral of Queen Elizabeth II will be no exception. While there will be several strikingly new features, the seemingly traditional elements are not as old as they may appear. While some newer elements are revivals from the past. The modern history of royal occasions is one of innovation and tradition to preserve the monarchy’s popularity and relevance. Public service and the monarch’s ability to represent the whole nation have become the main themes. The organisation of public mourning for Elizabeth II, which began with her death on September 8 and will end after her funeral on September 19, is a huge national undertaking. However, the funerals of sovereigns have not always been public spectacles. Early commemorations Since the 18th century, all British monarchs were buried at Windsor and for a long period, funeral ceremonies took place within Windsor Castle. Changes began with the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. In part, this was in recognition of her long reign of 63 years. But it was also a culmination of efforts, noticeable at her jubilees in 1887 and 1897, to make the monarchy more public. This was to encourage greater popular attachment towards the royal family in a society which was becoming more democratic – and potentially more critical of an ancient and privileged institution. The day of Queen Victoria’s funeral was proclaimed a day of national mourning, during which all work ceased. This was done in the expectation that many people would attend memorial church services – which then was the chief means to express public grief and respect. Skip advert For the first time after a monarch’s death, the Church of England issued special commemorative services for use in all its local places of worship, and the leaders of most other religious communities in the United Kingdom also encouraged the organisation of local memorial services.\n\nEverywhere, church and chapel services were crowded. That Queen Victoria died at her home on the Isle of Wight created the opportunity for further mass demonstrations of grief, as her coffin, on its route to Windsor, was carried in a long and slow procession across London, through streets lined with huge crowds. Public processions have remained central to later funerals of monarchs, though now focused around Westminster. A public affair Following the deaths of Victoria’s successors, further measures were taken to involve the public. When Edward VII died in London in 1910, a public lying in state at Westminster Hall was introduced. His son, George V, insisted that access should be “democratic” and nearly 300,000 members of the public paid their respects by filing past the coffin. He also asked that all local memorial services on the day of the funeral begin at the same time as the service at Windsor, to create simultaneous national participation in the prayers of commemoration. For George V’s own funeral in 1936, the day of mourning was replaced by a national two-minute silence to avoid loss of work during a time of economic depression. The silence also linked the king’s death with the annual mass ritual of remembrance of the dead of the first world war. His lying in state was attended by over 750,000 people. Radio broadcasts created a vast audience for the public ceremonies, in a new form of mass participation. For the commemoration in 1952 of King George VI, who had achieved great public prominence during the second world war, two further additions were made. After the funeral at Windsor, a special remembrance service was held at St Paul’s Cathedral, attended by members of the government, parliament and other national leaders. The memorial services and funeral procession in London became the first royal events to be broadcast by television as well as radio. The commemoration of Queen Elizabeth II Many facets of royal commemorations since 1901 remain integral to the arrangements in 2022 but there are new elements. Skip advert Some of these features result from advances in television and electronic media, others are a tribute to an even longer reign than Queen Victoria’s. The state of the union of the United Kingdom has also influenced the plans that the civil service and Buckingham Palace have maintained and regularly revised since the 1930s for “the demise of the Crown” – known more recently under the code name “Operation London Bridge”.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/people/958668/who-are-camillas-new-queens-companions", "title": "Who are Camilla's new 'Queen's Companions'? | The Week UK", "text": "Camilla, the new Queen Consort, has broken with centuries of tradition and appointed six of her closest friends as “Queen’s Companions”, replacing the role of royal ladies-in-waiting.\n\nWhile their role will entail many of the same responsibilities as their predecessors, the symbolic move is being seen as part of a wider attempt by the new king and queen to streamline and modernise the royal household.\n\nWho are they?\n\nThe Times described the new “Queen’s Companions” as “six longstanding confidantes from the King and Queen’s inner circle”.\n\nThey include: Sarah Troughton, a cousin of the late Queen; Jane von Westenholz, the mother of the woman who introduced Prince Harry to Meghan Markle and wife of one of King Charles’s oldest friends; Fiona, the Marchioness of Lansdowne, an interior designer; Lady Katharine Brooke; Baroness Carlyn Chisholm, a non-affiliated peer; and Lady Sarah Keswick, whose husband, Sir Chips Keswick, retired as Arsenal football club chairman in 2020.\n\nSome of the women will make their first public appearance with Camilla at a Violence Against Women and Girls reception this week at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe ladies-in-waiting who worked for the late Queen, including her closest confidante Lady Susan Hussey, who is godmother to Prince William, as well as Mary Morrison and Dame Annabel Whitehead, will now be known as “ladies of the household” and help King Charles host events at Buckingham Palace.\n\nBuckingham Palace also announced that, as well as her private secretary and deputy private secretary, the Queen Consort has appointed her first equerry, Major Ollie Plunket, who will act as a personal assistant looking after her diary and accompanying her to official events.\n\nWhat will they do?\n\n“Ladies-in-waiting have been a mainstay of royal life going all the way back to the Middle Ages and are typically companions from aristocratic backgrounds, who assist the Queen with her duties, including attending events and replying to correspondence,” said Stylist magazine.\n\nWhile Sky News said it is “believed their duties will be similar to those carried out by the Queen’s ladies-in-waiting”, the role of the new companions will be “a more occasional and informal position, supporting the Queen Consort at official engagements and not involved in replying to letters or day-to-day planning”, reported the BBC’s royal correspondent Sean Coughlan.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/954473/queen-biggest-public-gaffes", "title": "The Queen's biggest public gaffes | The Week UK", "text": "The Queen has been caught on camera expressing her frustration at a lack of action on climate change from world leaders.\n\n“It’s really irritating when they talk but don’t do”, said the Queen, who was speaking with the Duchess of Cornwall and Elin Jones, presiding officer of the Senedd, after opening the Welsh parliament yesterday.\n\nWith Cop26 only a matter of weeks away, the monarch said she “still” had “no idea” who was coming to the climate conference in Glasgow.

D’Orsi said it had been “quite a testing time for me”, which the Queen confirmed she was aware of. D’Orsi said she felt the officials’ behaviour was “undiplomatic”, explaining that at one point they had “walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off”. “Extraordinary,” said the Queen. The spokesperson in Beijing was unaware “of any threats” to cancel the visit, The New York Times reported. The Queen’s comments came a day after the then prime minister David Cameron described Nigeria and Afghanistan’s governments as “fantastically corrupt”.\n\nBrexit bombshell On 8 March 2016, The Sun’s front page claimed “Queen backs Brexit”. The monarch had made “critical comments” about the EU on two separate occasions, according to the paper. It was alleged that the monarch “let rip” at Nick Clegg during a lunch at Windsor Castle, telling the former deputy prime minister “that she believed the EU was heading in the wrong direction”. The “stinging reprimand went on for ‘quite a while’”, according to the newspaper’s source, though Clegg said he had “absolutely no recollection of it”. The Sun said the Queen had “revealed her Eurosceptic feelings” on another occasion, telling a group of MPs gathered at Buckingham Palace: “I don’t understand Europe.” The comment was made with “quite some venom and emotion”, according to the source. The Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) later ruled that The Sun’s headline was “significantly misleading”, but editor Tony Gallagher maintained his belief that the paper had not made a mistake. “The sources were so impeccable that we had no choice but to run the story the way that we did,” Gallagher said on Radio 4’s Today programme. “I don’t think were I doing this again tomorrow I would act in any way differently whatsoever.”\n\nFront-page fallout A “rumbling row” between Margaret Thatcher and the Queen “burst into full public view” in July 1986, when The Sunday Times ran a front page with the headline: “Queen dismayed by ‘uncaring’ Thatcher”. Years later, the editor responsible for the splash, Andrew Neil, wrote in The Times that “newspapers had already hinted” at tensions between the two over sanctions against apartheid South Africa. But the report “went far beyond” that. “Palace officials closest to the Queen” had informed the paper of the monarch’s true feelings towards Thatcher. “Uncaring, confrontational and socially divisive”, were the words published by The Sunday Times. The Queen’s press secretary Michael Shea later “outed himself” as the source. Neil said he had “no doubt” that Shea was “reflecting the views of the Queen and other senior members of the royal family… spiced up with a bit of his own anti-Thatcher slant”. The press secretary was the ultimate victim of the report, resigning from his role at the palace the following year.\n\nWords of warning The Queen in 2014 told members of the public she hoped Scots would “think very carefully about the future” when placing their votes in the Scottish independence referendum. Though the monarch’s comments “did not directly express a view”, The Times said they would be “interpreted by some on the No side as a plea to Scots not to base their decision on fleeting arguments”. Politicians were warned “not to drag the Queen into the debate”, the newspaper continued. But David Cameron did just that when he inadvertently confirmed the “open secret” that the Queen was in the remain camp, said The Guardian. Cameron told the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg that the head of state had “purred down the line” when he called to tell her the referendum result. During an appearance on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, the prime minister later said he was “extremely sorry and very embarrassed” for his blunder.\n\nFamily footage The Sun broke what it described as an “important and interesting story” in July 2015 after obtaining footage from 1933 showing the Queen playing on the lawns of Balmoral with her mother and cousin, the future King Edward VIII. “The Queen Mother then raises her arm in the style of a Nazi salute and, after glancing towards her mother, the Queen mimics the gesture”, is how the BBC described the 17-second clip. Edward is also seen to make the salute. The “arresting, once private image” brought accusations of “a breach of privacy” from the Buckingham Palace and arguments of “national interest” from the publisher, said the broadcaster’s former royal correspondent Peter Hunt. The palace said it was “disappointing” that the film, supposedly from the Queen’s family archive, had “been obtained and exploited” by The Sun. The paper’s managing editor at the time told the BBC that the footage was a matter of “national, historical significance” from which “we shouldn’t shy away”. Should the clip have seen the light of day?", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/royals/960774/the-highlights-and-lowlights-from-kings-coronation-weekend", "title": "The highlights and lowlights from King's coronation weekend | The ...", "text": "“UK human rights groups have accused police of attacking civil liberties,” said the Financial Times , after the Metropolitan Police arrested 64 people, mainly “to prevent disruption” of the coronation.\n\n“Penny Mordaunt’s sword is the ‘Pippa Middleton’s Bum’ of the coronation,’”, journalist Caitlin Moran said .\n\nMordaunt wore a widely praised, custom-made teal dress and headband embroidered with the gold fern motif of the Privy Council, rather than the standard black-and-gold court dress. “Penny Mordaunt looks damn fine!” Labour MP Emily Thornberry tweeted . “The sword bearer steals the show.”\n\nIt was “one of the most spectacular consolation prizes of all time”, said Politico. Mordaunt was effectively sidelined from the great offices of state by former prime minister Liz Truss after losing to her in the race to become Tory leader.\n\nMany commented in awe at the stamina of Mordaunt, 50, as she carried the heavy sword upright in front of her for a significant period of time. “I’ve been doing some press-ups to train for that,” she told Times Radio . “We get to practise with some replicas which are weighted,” she added, saying that her military training had helped.\n\nThe former defence secretary and Conservative Party leadership candidate carried the “sword of state”, a 17th-century four-foot ceremonial weapon weighing eight pounds, according to Politico . She then exchanged it for the “sword of offering”, decorated with diamonds, emeralds and rubies.\n\nThe leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, became an unexpected star of the coronation after her performance as Lord President of the Council, the first woman ever to hold the role.\n\nAny national event with such pomp and ceremony will undoubtedly mean some mixed opinions. The Week takes a look at a few of the most cited highlights and lowlights over the weekend.\n\nMore than 20 million people in the UK tuned in to watch the ceremony on TV, according to CNN , and tens of thousands braved the rain to stand outside and see the newly crowned King appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe coronation of King Charles III took place to both fanfare and controversy on Saturday, battling high expectations and appalling weather to please the maximum number of subjects.\n\nThe Met confirmed that 52 of the arrests “related to concerns people were going to disrupt the event, and arrests included to prevent a breach of the peace and conspiracy to cause a public nuisance”.\n\nThe government had “pushed through new powers to prevent protests just days before the coronation”, added the Financial Times. The Public Order Act makes “certain types of disruptive protest a criminal offence” and gives police “the right to intervene to stop protests before they happen”, the paper added.\n\nSix members of the anti-monarchy group Republic were arrested. “There is no longer a right to peaceful protest in the UK,” its chief executive Graham Smith tweeted.\n\n“We regret that those six people arrested were unable to join the wider group of protesters in Trafalgar Square and elsewhere on the procession route,” the Met said last night. Bail for the six has since been cancelled and no further action will be taken.\n\nAmong those arrested were three volunteers from Westminster Council’s safety team, who were handing out rape alarms to women. Mic Wright, a journalist who spoke with the volunteers, wrote on Twitter: “The Met arrested members of the City of Westminster’s Night Safety team. They are volunteers. They were pulled last night at 2am and have been held for 14 hours. One of them came out of the station in tears. Police didn’t apologise.”\n\nThe Met said there was intelligence that some groups had planned to disrupt the procession with rape alarms. The three volunteers have since been given police bail.\n\nHighlight: music\n\nThe coronation was “a magnificent celebration of choral, orchestral and liturgical music-making”, said Classic FM.\n\nThe line-up featured pieces by Handel, Bach, Holst, Vaughan Williams and William Byrd, among others, new musical compositions based on the King’s favourite hymn, solo performances from Pretty Yende and Roderick Williams, and a coronation anthem written by Andrew Lloyd Webber: “Make a Joyful Noise”.\n\nIn a “historic first”, the entire coronation was recorded and released as an album on Saturday.\n\n“Music was almost constantly present,” said The Guardian, “treated as peripheral until it was needed to deliver on the grandest scale.”\n\nLowlight: weather\n\n“The crowning of Charles III in relentless rain followed a long tradition of wretched weather on coronation days that goes back centuries,” said The Times.\n\nThe weather was so bad that the planned military flypast over Buckingham Palace had to be scaled back.\n\nCharles “remained upbeat about the weather”, said the Daily Mirror. “I hope you don’t all get soaked,” he had reportedly told campers on The Mall on Friday. “Rain is a blessing… except for your camera!”\n\n“Royalty. Regalia. Rain. It’s what Britain does best,” said The Daily Telegraph. The London crowds “flatly refused to let the weather dampen the celebratory mood”, it said, “with good humour, stoicism, and a phalanx of sturdy umbrellas”.\n\nHighlight: Prince Louis’ facial expressions\n\n“Prince Louis may be known for his reputation of show stealing balcony antics at royal events,” said the Daily Mail, “and today was no different for the little royal.”\n\nThe third child of the Prince and Princess of Wales “couldn’t contain his excitement at Buckingham Palace as he gestured into the crowd”.\n\nThe five-year-old joined a number of other working royals on the balcony, with an enthusiastic double “jazz hand” wave. He was also filmed yawning during the ceremony.\n\n“What a cheeky little chap Prince Louis is, made me chuckle,” one spectator tweeted.\n\nLowlight: Mistimed carriage arrivals\n\nThe Diamond Jubilee State Coach, carrying King Charles and Queen Camilla, arrived at Westminster Abbey five minutes early. The two then had to wait in the carriage while the coach carrying the Prince and Princess of Wales caught up.\n\nThe king was seen on camera speaking to Camilla, with a seemingly disgruntled expression.

King Charles III takes the throne at an uncertain time for the British monarchy. Republicanism is on the rise, both in the UK and across the Commonwealth. Meanwhile the withdrawal of three family members from royal duties – the Duke and Duchess of Sussex by personal choice, and Prince Andrew by order of his late mother – has already changed the royal landscape in Britain. The new king meanwhile, has long made it clear that he envisages a “slimmed down” version of the Royal Family. Monarchy is rarely static, and over time the role of any monarchy will adapt to broader constitutional developments. To understand what to expect from the British monarchy in the years ahead, we may want to look to the other 43 countries that currently have a monarch as their head of state (15 of which share the British monarch). These can be loosely grouped into four categories: ceremonial, constitutional, strong and absolute. Ceremonial monarchs Some monarchies occupy a solely ceremonial role, with no scope for the monarch to exercise any form of decision-making power. The role of these monarchies is often strictly outlined in the constitution and is restricted to providing the necessary ceremonial formality decisions to take effect. The Japanese constitution states that: “The Emperor shall perform only such acts of state as are provided for in this Constitution and he shall not have powers related to government.” The emperor appoints the prime minister only after they have been chosen by the Diet (the Japanese legislature). Constitutional monarchies In theory, these monarchs have considerable political powers under their countries’ constitutions, but in practice, constitutional conventions and other rules considerably reduce the role of the monarch to a formality. For example, anyone reading the Danish constitution may get the impression that the monarch runs the country: they are given “the supreme authority in all the affairs of the Realm”. They not only appoint the prime minister, but decide the number of ministers and what each does. Skip advert\n\nIn practice, the monarch acts on the advice of the government of the day, with the role of the monarch heavily regulated by constitutional conventions. Given that during their reign, the monarch will have to deal with politicians from different parties, they must be politically impartial otherwise they risk being drawn in controversy. The UK currently has the same arrangement, where “cardinal convention” requires that the monarch acts on the advice of ministers. But beyond this, the monarch retains some key (albeit constrained) powers which they exercise. Take for example, the appointment (and in theory the dismissal of) the prime minister. Convention requires that the monarch appoints the MP who has the confidence of the House of Commons to lead the government. ‘Strong’ monarchies This is a variation of constitutional monarchies, typically found in small (or micro) states, such as Monaco and Liechtenstein. The constitution grants significant powers to the monarch, which they go on to exercise personally. In Monaco, executive power is exercised “by the highest authority of the Prince”, supported by a minister of state and six-member council of government who advises the prince. Legislation is enacted by national council, but the prince must also sign any legislation. The level of direct involvement of the monarch can be extensive, for example, the Prince of Monaco has the personal prerogative to decide who is to be granted citizenship of the micro-state. Absolute monarchies These include Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland and Brunei, which have monarchs who dominate the political life of their kingdoms. Another example is Saudi Arabia, where the king, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is also the prime minister, and appoints the council of ministers. The consultative assembly can propose laws, but the king chooses whether to enact them as a royal decree. Usually, the most important ministries are held by other members of the royal family. Of particular note is the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who exercises considerable executive power. He is widely seen as both reformer and authoritarian figure, ruthlessly repressing political dissent and corruption while also increasing other freedoms – for example, removing the ban on female drivers. Slimming down The British constitution has evolved from an absolute monarchy, under which the monarch enjoyed complete power over his “subjects”, to an arrangement by the Victorian era which writer Walter Bagehot famously called a “disguised republic”. The question now is whether that evolutionary process has ended. For clues as to what a “slimmed down”, less formal monarchy might be like, it is natural to look towards Europe.

But it does nothing to ...", "text": "Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt CNN —\n\nThe world has failed to reach an agreement to phase out fossil fuels after marathon UN climate talks were “stonewalled” by a number of oil-producing nations.\n\nNegotiators from nearly 200 countries at the COP27 UN climate summit in Egypt took the historic step of agreeing to set up a “loss and damage” fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters and agreed the globe needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half by 2030.\n\nThe recent devastating floods across Pakistan are just one example of the suffering caused or made worse by the climate crisis. Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe agreement also reaffirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nHowever, an attempt to address the biggest source of the planet warming emissions that are causing the climate crisis ended in a fiasco after a number of nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, blocked a key proposal to phase out all fossil fuels, not just coal.\n\n“It is more than frustrating to see overdue steps on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil energies being stonewalled by a number of large emitters and oil producers,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement.\n\nAddressing the summit early on Sunday morning, the European Union’s Climate Chief Frans Timmermans said the EU was “disappointed” with the final outcome of the summit.\n\n“What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet … we should have done much more,” Timmermans said.\n\nVictory for climate crisis victims\n\nThe agreement to help the world’s most vulnerable countries deal with loss and damage represents a breakthrough, however, in what has been a contentious negotiation process.\n\nIt marks the first time countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the United States and the EU, have agreed to establish a fund for nations vulnerable to climate disasters made worse by pollution disproportionately produced by wealthy, industrialized nations.\n\nNegotiators and non-governmental organizations observing the talks praised the deal as a significant achievement, after developing nations and small island countries banded together to amplify pressure.\n\n“The agreements made at COP27 are a win for our entire world,” Molwyn Joseph, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said in a statement. “We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve.”\n\nThe creation of the fund also became one of the key demands of activists attending the summit. Unlike in previous years, when huge protests and loud calls for action become part of the event, demonstrations were muted this year.\n\nProtests are rare and mostly illegal in Egypt and the Egyptian government put strict limits on protesters attending the conference.\n\nStill, the biggest protest of the summit saw hundreds of activists marching through the venue last weekend, demanding climate payments. On Friday, 10-year-old Ghanian activist Nakeeyat Dramani received a standing ovation in the plenary after calling on the delegates to “have a heart and do the math.”\n\nClimate activists staged a number of protests during the conference, demanding end of fossil fuels and climate finance. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe fund will focus on what can be done to support loss and damage resources, but it does not include liability or compensation provisions, a senior Biden administration official told CNN.\n\nReaching the agreement was not easy. The summit was originally scheduled to end on Friday, but went well into overtime with negotiators still trying to hammer out the details as the conference venue was being dismantled around them.\n\nThe US and other developed nations have long sought to avoid such provisions that could open them up to legal liability and lawsuits from other countries. And in previous public remarks, US Climate Envoy John Kerry had said loss and damage was not the same thing as climate reparations.\n\n“‘Reparations’ is not a word or a term that has been used in this context,” Kerry said on a recent call with reporters earlier this month. He added: “We have always said that it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate.”\n\nDetails on how the fund would operate remain murky. The text leaves a lot of questions on when it will be finalized and become operational, and how exactly it would be funded. The text also mentions a transitional committee that will help nail down those details, but doesn’t set specific future deadlines.\n\nAnd while climate experts celebrated the win, they also noted the uncertainty going forward.\n\n“This loss and damage fund will be a lifeline for poor families whose houses are destroyed, farmers whose fields are ruined, and islanders forced from their ancestral homes,” World Resources Institute CEO Ani Dasgupta said. “At the same time, developing countries are leaving Egypt without clear assurances about how the loss and damage fund will be overseen.”\n\nAn outcome on a fund came this year in large part because the G77 bloc of developing nations stayed unified, exerting increased leverage on loss and damage than in past years, climate experts said.\n\n“They needed to be together to force the conversation we’re having now,” Nisha Krishnan, resilience director for World Resources Institute Africa told reporters. “The coalition has held because of this conviction that we did need to stay together to deliver this – and to push the conversation.”\n\nFor many, the fund represents a hard-fought years-long victory, pushed over the finish line by the global attention given to climate disasters such as Pakistan’s devastating flooding this summer.\n\n“It was like a big buildup,” former US climate envoy Todd Stern told CNN. “This has been around for quite a while and it’s getting all the more aggravating to vulnerable countries because there’s still not a lot of money getting put into it. As we can see the actual disaster impacts of climate change are getting more and more intense.”\n\nThe EU's Frans Timmermans speaks to reporters during the summit. Thomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty Images\n\nText on 1.5 degrees remains\n\nGlobal scientists have for decades warned that warming must be limited to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels – a threshold that is fast-approaching as the planet’s average temperature has already climbed to around 1.1 degrees.\n\nBeyond 1.5 degrees, the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages will increase dramatically, scientists said in the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.\n\nBut while summit delegates affirmed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, climate experts expressed dismay about a lack of mention of fossil fuels, or the need to phase them down to keep global temperatures from rising. As it did last year at the Glasgow summit, the text calls for a phasedown of unabated coal power, and “phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies,” but does not go further to call for a phase-out of all fossil fuels, including oil and gas.\n\n“The influence of the fossil fuel industry was found across the board,” Laurence Tubiana, CEO European Climate Foundation, said in a statement. “The Egyptian Presidency has produced a text that clearly protects oil and gas petro-states and the fossil fuel industries. This trend cannot continue in the United Arab Emirates next year.”\n\nIt took some dramatic action to even hold onto the 1.5-degree number struck in Glasgow last year.\n\nOn Saturday, EU officials threatened to walk out of the meeting if the final agreement failed to endorse the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In a carefully choreographed news conference, Timmermans, flanked by a full line-up of ministers and other top officials from EU member states, said that “no deal is better than a bad deal.”\n\n“We do not want 1.5 Celsius to die here and today. That to us is completely unacceptable,” he said.\n\nThe talks were further complicated by the fact that Kerry, who was leading the US delegation, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. He continued to communicate with his team and his foreign counterparts by phone, but his physical absence was noticeable during the crunch time at the summit.\n\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry gestures toward his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the COP27 summit. Nariman El-Mofty/AP\n\nThe US and China resume climate talks\n\nAside from the final agreement, the summit brought several other significant developments including the resumption of formal climate talks between the US and China – the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters.\n\nAfter China froze climate negotiations between the two countries this summer, US President Joe Biden and China President Xi Jinping agreed to reestablish US-China communications when they met last week at the G20 summit in Bali, paving the way for Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua to meet again formally.\n\n“Without China, even if the US is … moving towards a 1.5-degree program, … if we don’t have China, nobody else can make … that goal,” Kerry told CNN last week.\n\nThe two sides met throughout the second week of COP, trying to pick up where they left off before China suspended the talks, according to a source familiar with the discussions. They were focused on specific action points, such as enhancing China’s plan to reduce emissions of methane – a powerful greenhouse gas – and their overall emissions target, the source said.\n\nUnlike last year, there was no big, joint climate announcement from the two countries. But the resumption of formal communication was seen as an encouraging sign.\n\nLi Shuo, a Beijing-based global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia said this COP “saw extensive exchanges between the two sides, led by Kerry and Xie.”\n\n“The challenge is they should do more than talk, [and] also need to lead,” Shuo said, adding the restarted formal dialogue “helps to prevent the worst outcome.”", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Ella Nilsen Rachel Ramirez", "Ivana Kottasová", "Ella Nilsen", "Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/china/china-protests-xinjiang-fire-shanghai-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China Covid: Protests erupt in unprecedented challenge to Xi ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday faced unprecedented dissent after thousands of demonstrators protested in cities across China over the weekend against his zero-Covid strategy – with some daring to openly call for his removal in the streets.\n\n“Step down, Xi Jinping!

When asked about protesters calling on Xi to step down, he replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”\n\nThough the protests made headlines in international media, Chinese state media carried stories and opinion pieces stressing the severity of the Covid outbreak and the need to persevere with methods to stamp it out.\n\n“Practices have proven that our Covid measures can stand the test of history, they are scientific and effective,” said an opinion piece published by the Xinhua news agency on Monday. “Perseverance prevails.”\n\nBut the challenge to zero-Covid posed by the spread of more contagious variants was underlined Monday when China reported 40,052 new local cases – the sixth consecutive day of record figures, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nNearly 4,000 of those infections were identified in Beijing, where – without referring to the protests – city authorities on Sunday banned blocking entrances to residential compounds under lockdown, adding that access must be granted to emergency services.\n\nProtests in Shanghai\n\nDemonstrators stand by protest signs in Shanghai, China, on Saturday, Nov. 26, 2022.

The protest gradually dispersed before dawn, the witness said.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, hundreds of Shanghai residents returned to the site to continue protesting despite a heavy police presence and road blocks.\n\nVideos showed hundreds of people at an intersection shouting “Release the people!” in a demand for the police to free detained demonstrators.\n\nCrowds shouting \"Release the people!\" in Shanghai. @whyyoutouzhele/Twitter\n\nThis time around, police adopted a more hardline approach, moving faster and more aggressively to make arrests and disperse the crowds.\n\nIn one video, a man holding a bundle of chrysanthemum gave a speech while walking on a pedestrian crossing, as a police officer tried to stop him.\n\n“We need to be braver!

A small crowd first gathered along the Liangma River for a vigil for the victims of the Xinjiang fire, before it grew in size and eventually marched down the city’s Third Ring Road.\n\nPeople chanted slogans against zero-Covid, voiced support for the detained protesters in Shanghai, and called for greater civil liberties. “We want freedom!

We don’t want emperors!” they shouted in a thinly veiled reference to Xi, who last month began a norm-shattering third term in office.\n\nProtesters hold up blank papers and chant slogans as they march in protest in Beijing on Sunday night.

Freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of arts, freedom of movement, personal freedoms. Give me back my freedom!” The crowd shouted.\n\nUniversity campuses\n\nAcross China, protests have also broken out on university campuses – which are particularly politically sensitive to the Communist Party, given the history of the student-led Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989.\n\nIn the early hours of Sunday morning, about 100 students gathered around a protest slogan painted on a wall at the prestigious Peking University in Beijing.

It was the third time since Tecpile's marriage to Veronica Montalvo that he left his country to work on a Wisconsin dairy farm.\n\nThe trip, more than 2,000 miles, is not uncommon among the families in and around Astacinga. The area has almost 7,000 people. Unemployment is in the double digits and virtually everyone – 96% – lives below the poverty level. Money sent from those working in the USA is one of the only ways to build solid new homes made of concrete.\n\nTecpile left five years ago and remains in Wisconsin. He works six days a week, about 10 hours a day at Rosenholm Dairy in Buffalo County. After work, he prepares dinner, takes a shower and, most evenings, calls home. Every two weeks, he heads to a grocery store in Arcadia and sends $300 to $500 to his family back in Mexico.\n\nTecpile and Montalvo want to finish a home they are building in Astacinga – get the bathroom and kitchen done, install a tile floor, paint the walls. They hope to start their own business someday.\n\nThat means for now, Megan will know her father only through the nightly calls and by browsing photos on her mother's cellphone.\n\n“There’s no other option,” Tecpile says.\n\nReliable numbers on immigrants working in the dairy industry are hard to come by. A national survey taken five years ago for the National Milk Producers Federation estimated the immigrant workforce at 51% of the total.\n\nWorkers in Wisconsin express little doubt immigrants account for a larger portion of the dairy industry workforce today. They don't work on just the biggest farms but also on operations that grew their herd beyond what a family can handle.\n\nWhile unemployment is low, many farmers fill openings by passing word to Mexican laborers on-site, then accept the new workers who show up without asking too many questions.\n\nSome farmers say they haven’t encountered a U.S.-born applicant in years.\n\nEntry-level jobs may pay $11 to $13 an hour and can include free – albeit modest – housing. The immigrants may have to work nights, milk hundreds of cows every shift, toil in the wind and snow. The job can be dangerous; not everyone makes it back to their family.\n\nImmigrants say the jobs are a ladder to a better life; farmers say the immigrants are the only means of affordable labor. So despite the rancor that surrounds national immigration policy, the workers keep coming and the farms keep hiring.\n\nIn dairy barns across Wisconsin, farmers and workers said there is a simple truth: Without the work of Latino immigrants – many, if not most, of them undocumented – the signature industry in America’s Dairyland would collapse.\n\nDairyland in Distress:Americans love soda, fancy water and fake milk. Can the dairy industry keep up?\n\nNew rivals:Wisconsin farmers helped hook world on dairy, but those customers are now competitors\n\nBeyond the USA:How Wisconsin trading partners Canada and Mexico survive\n\nFew Americans willing to do the work\n\nHiring immigrants caught on among Wisconsin dairy farms in the late 1990s and early 2000s, according to University of Wisconsin research.\n\nBeginning in 2004, the state increased its annual milk production every year, and beginning in 2009, it annually set records – streaks that continue to this day. In 2012, then-Gov. Scott Walker initiated an incentive program urging farmers to produce even more, in the belief that foreign markets could absorb the increase. This fall, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue essentially told family dairy farmers in Wisconsin: Get big or get out.\n\nAll of that increased production required new workers.\n\nJohn Rosenow says half of his Buffalo County farm’s 18 employees – including Tecpile – are from Mexico. He started hiring them in 1998 when he was having trouble finding local workers.\n\nHe recalls hiring a retired state trooper. Within days, the trooper walked up his driveway and said he was leaving because he couldn’t keep pace with the milking operation. The dairy farmer kept him on but moved him to a new job.\n\nRosenow made his first immigrant hire after seeing an ad from a Dallas recruiting company. It sent him a worker named Manuel, who knocked out 10 hours a day for 54 days straight. When Manuel left, Rosenow hired two more Mexican workers. Over time, other farmers asked him for help hiring immigrants.\n\nIn the past 10 to 15 years, he has probably had about 150 job candidates. Only two were American-born, and neither was willing to do what was necessary, he says. One didn’t want to work on Fridays or weekends.\n\nOmar Guerrero says his experiences are similar. During his time at Elkhart Lake’s Drake Dairy, the farm has received two job applications from American-born candidates. One lasted through an hour of training. The other didn’t really want the job; he just needed to claim he was searching for work to avoid losing food stamps.\n\nWhen Guerrero arrived in Wisconsin 22 years ago, he didn’t have any difficulties finding a dairy farm job. There were barely any Latinos then. Farmers would even pay bonuses – say, $500 – to workers who could recruit newcomers.\n\nGuerrero, now a citizen and settled with his family in the USA, started out as an undocumented immigrant, working as a milker, one of the toughest jobs on a dairy farm. At Drake Dairy, he learned more about the operation, took on new responsibilities and moved into management. Now he has a stake in the farm.\n\nHe is proud to have helped push the farm from 400 cows to 2,500. He says many of the workers are undocumented and only the ones who work outside with tractors are American-born. Across Wisconsin, he guesses, more than 90% of the immigrants in the dairy industry are undocumented.\n\nL.A. Auto Show:Land Rover Defender's return thrills off-road enthusiasts\n\nBlack Friday:How scammers use gift cards, hot toy deals to trick you\n\nPay an issue in attracting workers\n\nGuerrero says he does not have difficulty finding workers; he’s built up a network of connections.\n\nSome farms struggle to fill holes. They could compete for workers better if they raised wages, and some have gone to $14 and $15 an hour, Guerrero says. But for farms barely breaking even or losing money, increasing the payroll is prohibitive.\n\nHans Breitenmoser started to hire immigrant workers at his Merrill dairy farm 15 to 20 years ago. The farm had expanded beyond the point where his family could do the work by itself and the homegrown labor pool wasn’t there. The farm has 450 cows. Nine of the 12 hired workers are Latinos.\n\nBreitenmoser says most dairy farmers are used to the idea of workers not being born in the USA. His parents, after all, came from Switzerland.\n\nStarting pay on his farm is $12 and $13 an hour – a higher rate, he says, than what his farm really can afford. He acknowledges there's little vetting; hiring the first person through the door is better than being selective and ending up with no person at all.\n\n“I’ll hire them, and I’ll cross my fingers that they turn out to be a good employee,” he says.\n\nThe dairy farm that hired Blanca Hernández and her sister Guadalupe in 2006 had never hired anyone, much less Mexican workers. Hernández was told the owners didn’t trust foreigners, but they were unable to keep doing all the work by themselves. A nearby farmer vouched for immigrant workers. Hernández and her sister became the first employees.\n\nBy the time she took the job, Hernández had earned a law degree in Mexico and had worked once before in the USA. The law degree didn't lead to a job, and the work – low-wage jobs for a cleaning company, airplane parts factory and car wash in North Carolina – didn't allow her to save.\n\nShe left her hometown of Texhuacán and headed back across because her sister Guadalupe was going with her 4-year-old daughter. Crossing the border with a child is particularly dangerous; Hernández wanted to help. Once across, they made their way to Wisconsin, where Guadalupe's partner worked.\n\nHernández says the Durand farm owners who gave them jobs were surprised to see the sisters writing down the correct number of hours for their pay – at the time, $6.25 per hour.\n\nDuring their first days at the farm, the sisters cleaned the parlor in addition to milking 320 cows. The milk quality went up because the sisters were vigilant about cleanliness and sanitation.\n\n“If I’m going to be a street sweeper, I’m going to be a good street sweeper,\" Hernández says. \"If I’m going to be a teacher, I’m going to be a good teacher.”\n\nWhen the farm grew to 500 cows or more, Hernández said, she was working 14 hours a day with no days off.\n\nThe sisters told the farm owner they were returning to Texhuacán. By then, the owners had undergone a change of heart.\n\n“After four years, the boss wept,” Hernández says.\n\nImmigrants take on risky, difficult jobs\n\nDairy jobs are inherently risky.\n\nAt 6.1 injuries per 100 full-time employees in 2018, dairy workers at farms with more than 10 employees suffered higher odds of getting injured than workers in sawmills, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nationwide, that meant 6,500 injuries on those larger farms.\n\nFrom 2012 through 2017, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration increased inspections of dairy farms with more than 10 employees or a temporary labor camp. At least 51 Wisconsin dairy farms were found in violation of some safety regulations during this period, according to the OSHA data.\n\nMexican immigrants often work the most wearing jobs. A University of Wisconsin study in 2009 found that immigrants tended to be relegated to routine, lower-paid tasks such as milkers or pushers, who clean manure in the barns and bring the cows to the milking parlors. When the study was done, 62% of the immigrants in the dairy workforce held one of those two jobs; 16% of the American-born workers held them.\n\nDairy workers averaged 57 hours of work a week and fewer than five days off each month.\n\nIn New York state, according to a survey in 2014-15 of 88 immigrant dairy farmworkers – the majority working on farms with more than 500 cows – about half of the workers said they felt rushed on the job, and breaks could be as short as five minutes in a 12-hour workday.\n\nThe survey, conducted by the Workers’ Center of Central New York and the Worker Justice Center of New York, found that more than one-fourth of the workers had suffered wage theft and two-thirds had experienced one or more injuries on the job, most of those disclosing they suffered an injury so severe it required medical attention.\n\nJohn Peck, executive director of the Madison-based advocacy group Family Farm Defenders, says he would like Wisconsin to be a leader in socially responsible milk production, which would take into account paying workers better wages and paying farmers better prices, instead of measuring only the quality of the product.\n\n“Farmers are always struggling to find workers, especially if they are not paying people well,” he says. “But at the same time, there are farmers going bankrupt. So how can they afford to pay workers, if they are losing their farms?”\n\nPeck says consumers may fail to connect inexpensive milk at the store with inadequate pay for farmers, and with low-wage immigrant labor.\n\n“If you want a cheap food policy, that means that you’ll be exploiting workers,” he says. “And the workers that are going to be exploited are going to probably be undocumented immigrants.”\n\nLong, grueling hours\n\nSalvador Salas worked on several farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota. He has good memories of one owner who made breakfast for workers and a farm that offered $12 an hour and paid overtime, as required in Minnesota.\n\nThere also was a Wisconsin farm where he worked 11- and 12-hour split workdays without a single day off, even for Thanksgiving or Christmas, for four years. He says the farm owner rarely paid him for more than 10 hours a day, no matter how long he worked cleaning barns, herding cows, feeding calves, pushing feed, milking. He started at $7.25 an hour plus free housing. His wages topped out at $11 an hour.\n\n“When one needs to work, there’s no (such thing as) hard work,” says Salas, who was undocumented his entire time here.\n\nThe toughest times for Salas were the winters when it was freezing outside and he had to move tires off tarps covering mounds of feed.\n\n“That’s when it feels uglier,” he says. “When the wind is blowing and you are on top.”\n\nHe hurt his back working on the farm, he says, and told his boss about the accident – but never asked to see a doctor. He feared the farmer might think he was lying and wouldn't help him.\n\nSalas returned to Mexico early this year after more than six years on U.S. dairy farms. He was worn out and wanted to see his family.\n\nHe lives in Astacinga in a home he built by adding on to his father's home, using savings from the dairy work. A chiropractor helped alleviate his back pain.\n\nCouple's plans cut short\n\nAntonia Rodríguez worked in dairy longer than Salas. Her partner, Gerardo Nájera, says she used to take on 12-hour shifts before he was deported in 2012, and she had to cut back to care for their two U.S.-born children.\n\nHer sister, Consuelo, says she would tell Antonia that working at a dairy farm was too hard, a man’s job. But her sister had never been scared of work. At 53, undocumented and living with her two younger children in a trailer that needed repairs, Antonia kept working at Clarks Mills Dairy Farm in Reedsville.\n\n“As a mother, one has to work in whatever you can,” Consuelo says.\n\nThe last time the sisters talked on the phone, Antonia sounded weary. It was \"one of those times when one becomes sad – you miss your family, your parents, your siblings,” Consuelo says.\n\nNájera says the plan was for their younger kids to finish school in the USA and for Rodríguez to return one day to Ciudad Juárez. He was building their home, and she was sending money to finish it. She would tell him that she wanted to go back so they could be together.\n\nOne afternoon last March, the cows were not lined up properly at the milking parlor. Rodríguez walked up from the pit where workers attach milking machines to udders and onto a concrete pad where the cows lingered. She didn’t have a stick or any physical barrier between her and the cows.\n\nAs she tried to move them, a cow knocked her against a half wall. Other employees heard her scream, came to her aid and moved the animal away. Rodríguez was unconscious, and as the ambulance arrived at the hospital, her heart stopped and she died.\n\nThe autopsy found rib fractures and lacerations in her heart and left lung.\n\nOSHA fined the 800-cow farm, saying it didn’t ensure employees working with cows were protected from being struck and it didn't train workers to improve safety.\n\nFor that, and another unrelated violation, the farm was fined $15,155.\n\nRobert Goehring, co-owner of the farm, says Rodríguez had worked there since 2014, and he had personally trained her on how to move the animals. The OSHA representative said Goehring needed to train employees on animal behavior, which he says he hadn’t heard about.\n\nConsuelo Rodríguez is taking care of her sister's younger kids, 10 and 16, so they can finish high school in the USA. She set up a small altar at home for her sister, displaying her glasses, earrings and photos. She took it down because her nephew said it made him sad.\n\nThe children speak with their father regularly.\n\n“They say they are fine,” he says. “But one knows they aren’t.”\n\nLatino influence grows\n\nThe Rev. Matthew Sauer, pastor at the Manitowoc Cooperative Ministry, says that when he arrived in 2005, there were some Latino workers, but they weren’t very visible in the community. The Manitowoc School District had a 5% Hispanic enrollment.\n\nSauer noticed the immigrant population rising in 2010-11.\n\nIn the most recent school year, the school district had 14% Latino enrollment. In the city of Manitowoc, there are at least five Mexican restaurants, two with small attached grocery stores. In spring, a bull-riding rodeo attracted hundreds of Latinos, many of them from nearby dairy farms.\n\nManitowoc is among the 30 counties in the USA with the most dairy operations, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 2017 census.\n\nSauer says U.S.-born residents in the area have become more comfortable with the changing demographics. “Younger people are growing up with them, in their classes, which means that parents are meeting these cultures,” he says.\n\nThe story is similar in other rural Wisconsin communities. Though many Latino immigrants keep to themselves, their influence is unmistakable. Although many return to their hometowns, some settle in Wisconsin and start a family.\n\nIn Clark County, which ranks second in the USDA 2017 census, this month's historical society newsletter noted a recent quinceañera celebration. In Marathon County, which ranks fourth in the census, the Hispanic Soccer League, founded in 2002, changed its name to the Central Wisconsin Adult Soccer League to be more inclusive, and U.S.-born players have joined immigrants on the pitch.\n\nTrump election sparked worries\n\nWhen Donald Trump won the presidential election after campaigning to crack down on illegal immigration, many Wisconsin dairy workers were nervous. Some left their jobs; some left the state or the country. Most kept working, and the threats never materialized.\n\nApolonio Sánchez says he planned to leave for Canada if Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials started to launch raids close by. His boss on a 120-cow farm in the Alma area told him not to worry, that wouldn’t happen. He stayed.\n\nSánchez says there are still undocumented immigrants arriving to work on the farms. There have been ICE arrests, but nothing approaching a massive crackdown.\n\nPablo Cruz works on a farm with more than 1,500 cows in Kewaunee County. He says most of the workers are undocumented – not only from Mexico but more recently from Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nBreitenmoser, the farmer from Merrill, says the rhetoric against immigrants hasn’t been good for a dairy industry that relies on workers not born in the USA.\n\nIf all undocumented immigrants were to be deported, he says, “we would have dead cows piled up in our farms.”\n\nHe favors a process that would provide a path for undocumented immigrants to acquire legal status. “It’s disgusting that people are treating them like criminals for working their butts off,” he says.\n\nRosenow, the Buffalo County farmer, says everyone should understand the necessity of immigrants, but “I don’t see the solution happening very soon.”\n\nA push for path to residency\n\nThe American Dairy Coalition and the National Milk Producers Federation have pushed to get dairy farms access to foreign agricultural guest workers through a visa program that is limited to seasonal work, such as crop harvesting. Dairy farms can’t hire these guest workers for year-round work.\n\nThe American Dairy Coalition has supported replacing the guest worker program with one that would eliminate some worker protections, such as the requirement to pay a prevailing wage.\n\nWorkers advocate groups pushed for a path to permanent residency and citizenship, which the National Milk Producers Federation supported. The worker advocate groups resisted efforts to expand the guest worker program, saying it leaves workers in a position to be exploited. Under the program, if a worker doesn't do what an employer asks without complaint, the employer can fire the worker, which in general means the end of his or her visa.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Peck, with Family Farm Defenders, says undocumented immigrants are essential to the dairy economy and part of Wisconsin’s rural communities. “If they are so integral to our economy, why can’t they become citizens?” he asked.\n\nIn November, after months of negotiations that included agribusiness representatives and workers groups, 49 U.S. House members co-sponsored bipartisan legislation that would provide undocumented farmworkers and family members with a path to citizenship. It would allow dairy farms access to thousands of agricultural guest workers for year-round jobs and would dedicate an additional 40,000 green cards per year for agricultural workers.\n\nAgricultural employers could sponsor workers' getting green cards, and some seasonal guest workers could apply directly. The bill would create a pilot program with visas allowing workers to move freely among agricultural employers.\n\nThe bill would require agricultural employees to use the E-verify program to check whether immigrants are authorized to work. The bill has been referred to four House committees. If passed, it could face an uphill battle in the Senate.\n\nNo Wisconsin representative has co-sponsored the bill.\n\nBorder crossings more difficult\n\nTecpile says he would love to travel home, but there's no guarantee he could get back. Crossing the border on the way north is riskier and more expensive, he says. The smugglers, called coyotes, who guide and transport immigrants illegally ask for $8,000 or more.\n\nWhen Trump was elected, Tecpile says, he never thought of leaving. He knew American farmers need workers too much.\n\n“I didn’t pay attention,\" he says. \"I had to work.”\n\nIn Mexico, Montalvo, his wife, says it’s hard to be separated this long.\n\nMegan has never had a birthday party when she could hug her father. She wants him to take her to school. She wants him home.\n\n“Sometimes my daughter needs her dad, but he isn’t here,” Montalvo says. “She knows he is working.”\n\nTheir son Kevin, 16, says holidays and other special occasions are tough.\n\n“When all the family gathers, he isn’t here,” he says.\n\nMany of Kevin's friends, he says, also have parents working in the USA who stay away for five or six years at a time. He says he should go to Wisconsin, work on a dairy farm, be with his father and build \"a good future.\"\n\nHe isn’t afraid of trying to cross the border, an attempt that has left many migrants dead. His mother doesn’t want him to go yet. He is too young.\n\nMaybe, she says, he could try crossing after he turns 18.\n\nContributing: Andrew Mollica\n\nFor this story, reporter Maria Perez of the Journal Sentinel staff interviewed immigrants in Spanish, translated their words into English, then checked back with them to make sure the phrasing was correct.\n\nEmail her at maria.perez@jrn.com; follow her on Twitter: @mariajpsl.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/12/16/how-industrial-dairy-impacts-environment-family-farms/2648668001/", "title": "Industrial dairy impacts Wisconsin environment, family farms", "text": "ELLISVILLE, Wis. – Arlin Karnopp doesn’t drink the water in his house.\n\nTaped to the refrigerator is a sign that says, “Do Not Use.” He’s afraid his grandchildren will fill their cups from the ice dispenser on the door.\n\nSince 2015, results of his well tests show potentially harmful bacteria and nitrates. Karnopp blames manure spread by large dairy farms on a ridge next to his property.\n\n“Everything rolls downhill,” said Karnopp, 67, a retired over-the-road truck driver. He lives in dairy-intensive Kewaunee County, where cattle exceed people by about 5 to 1.\n\n“I’m very disgusted,\" he said. \"If we could only turn back the clock.”\n\nTurning it back even five years would take Karnopp to a time when Wisconsin boasted more than 10,000 farms – most of them small, family operations passed down for generations.\n\nSince then, a drawn-out assault of low milk prices has pummeled America's Dairyland. More than 2,700 Wisconsin dairy farms have gone out of business. Many more face tough decisions this winter as a poor fall harvest has led to soaring prices for cattle feed.\n\nDairy in distress:Americans love soda, fancy water and fake milk. Can the dairy industry keep up?\n\nDairy nonprofit pays leaders millions:Meanwhile, the farmers funding it go out of business\n\nDairy marketing:Dairy farmers, animal activists want to know how $900 million was spent\n\nLarge-scale dairy farming, however, is on a different trajectory. Concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, are growing rapidly and taking over an increasing share of the state’s milk production.\n\nOften referred to as industrial or mega-farms, they can house thousands of cows in massive metal buildings. Cows are milked three times a day in an operation that runs around the clock and tankers full of milk head in and out at all hours. Some newer industrial buildings run the length of a half-dozen football fields; farmers have been known to fly drones inside to get a bird's-eye view of their operations.\n\nThe average size of a Wisconsin dairy farm is about 150 cows. Farms qualify as CAFOs when their milk-producing herds reach 700.\n\nSuch large operations are a relatively new phenomenon in Wisconsin.\n\nThe number of these industrial dairy farms in the state has jumped 55% in less than a decade, to 279 farms, Department of Natural Resources figures show. Farms with 500 or more cows had 41% of the state's cow population in 2017, up from 3% in 1997, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nTheir massive milking operations, popularized in California, shatter the traditional model of Wisconsin farms. With so many cattle, they run the risk of contaminating groundwater and overwhelming lakes, rivers and streams with runoff pollution while making it harder for smaller farms to compete.\n\nThe question is whether Wisconsin is suited for dairy farming on a grand scale and whether dairy farming as we have known it has a future.\n\nThe coming decade could tell us.\n\nManure: beneficial and problematic\n\nManure has been a dependable and potent fertilizer for as long as cows have grazed the land.\n\nBut when it runs off a farm field or seeps into groundwater, manure pollutes. Bacteria and nitrates can poison drinking water, and too much phosphorus from manure and fertilizer can supercharge aquatic plant growth and upend water systems, eventually sucking out oxygen.\n\nDairy cows are veritable waste machines; on average they excrete nearly 17 gallons of manure and urine a day. While cities use sewage treatment systems to remove contaminants, most farmers store a mix of manure, urine and water in lagoons and typically spread it across crop fields in spring and fall.\n\nA single farm with 500 cows produces as much daily waste as South Milwaukee, based on Cornell University research.\n\nA 1,000-cow herd? Think of the 42,000 residents of Fond du Lac.\n\nThe largest Wisconsin CAFOs – those with 6,000 cows – generate as much manure and urine as 252,000 people, on par with Madison.\n\nThey are required to have six months of manure storage capacity and their owners must write plans detailing how and where they’ll spread their waste. Smaller farms are not required to use spreading plans. About 37% of the 9 million acres of Wisconsin cropland are covered by such plans, state figures show.\n\n“No question, CAFOs are more regulated,” said Jim VandenBrook, executive director of the Wisconsin Land and Water Conservation Association from 2012 to 2018 and a former state agriculture department regulator. “But we don’t have a handle on whether those practices are being followed because there is so little oversight on spreading.\"\n\nThe most extensive audit of spreading practices in recent years, done in 2017 by the DNR, found that more than a quarter of CAFO inspections turned up some violations of manure application requirements.\n\nIn August 2018, a lethal combination of manure spreading and heavy rains severely damaged miles of the Sheboygan River near Malone in Fond du Lac County. In just one 575-foot section, DNR employees found 40 dead northern pike – some as long as 30 inches, according to agency records. In a small offshoot of the river, scores of dead fish littered the surface where the last remaining oxygen would have been found.\n\nThe DNR alleges that Redtail Ridge Dairy, a large-scale farm, should not have been spreading manure with a rainstorm in the forecast and that the manure ultimately washed into public waters. The case has been referred to the state Justice Department for civil prosecution.\n\nThe farm’s owners, Joseph and Tyler Thome, said they believe other farms in the watershed also bore responsibility for the contamination, according to DNR documents.\n\nGeorge Miller, 71, owns land bordering the Sheboygan River.\n\n“The farms are getting so big and they have only so much room to put their manure on,\" he said. “We don’t like it, but we don’t feel there is much you can do.”\n\nKewaunee County water woes\n\nTucked under Door County, on the shore of Lake Michigan, Kewaunee County is riddled with pockets of shallow soil and fractured bedrock, called karst, that make groundwater more susceptible to contamination.\n\nIt’s also the home of 16 industrial farms – the third-highest amount among Wisconsin counties.\n\n“This model of massive animal incarceration in vulnerable areas is simply not a good model,” said Lee Luft, a county supervisor and one of a group of residents who pushed regulators for more controls on manure spreading in Kewaunee.\n\nThe county’s rivers that flow to Lake Michigan all fail to meet state water quality standards for phosphorus, which can trigger algae blooms that could imperil aquatic life.\n\nIn 2014, citizens and six environmental groups petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to investigate groundwater contamination, claiming the DNR under Republican Gov. Scott Walker had failed to use its regulatory powers over large farms to protect drinking water.\n\nLast year, after a lengthy public airing, the DNR mandated stricter manure spreading limits – the first in years – for a group of eastern Wisconsin counties, including Kewaunee.\n\n“I think in the karst areas, we just can’t continue to do what we are doing,” Davina Bonness, the county’s land and water director, told residents at a public meeting this fall.\n\nDuring spring and fall when manure hauling is the most active, her office fields three to five complaints a day about spreading.\n\nIn September, she said, county staff went door-to-door in a section of Lincoln Township to warn residents not to drink the water. Runoff from an industrial farm after a rain had been draining into sinkholes – a direct conduit to groundwater.\n\nNumerous studies in the county over the years have found widespread evidence of wells contaminated with bacteria.\n\nOne of the most recent – and the most authoritative, using DNA to trace the source of contamination – tied the problem to both cattle and septic systems, according to researchers from the U.S. Agricultural Research Service.\n\nThe same researchers have come to similar conclusions in Grant, Iowa and Lafayette counties in an ongoing study in southwestern Wisconsin. Waste from cattle, hogs and humans all turned up in drinking water.\n\n“I think that we need to accept and acknowledge our share of the problem,” said Don Niles, who milks 3,000 cows in Casco in Kewaunee County, a hotbed in the clash over industrial farms.\n\nNiles is a founder of Peninsula Pride Farms, which was formed in 2016 in Kewaunee and southern Door counties and is one of a growing number of farmer-led groups, including CAFOs, that are promoting conservation strategies in watersheds across the state.\n\n“We have to know and come to grips with the problem,\" he said. \"Clearly, we in agriculture are not the whole cause of water contamination. But we are a significant contributor.”\n\nMexican veterinarians recruited by farms:They're lured by animal scientist jobs, but end up milking and cleaning\n\nDairy workers:The industry would collapse without Latino immigrants, many undocumented\n\nTrading partners:How Canada and Mexico are surviving\n\nSitting at his kitchen table, Arlin Karnopp, the retired truck driver from Kewaunee, looks over his well tests. Dating back to 2015, they are a mixed bag. Sometimes the wells met state standards for drinking water; other times, they contained high levels of coliform bacteria and nitrates.\n\nThis year, for the first time in more than four decades on the land, he and his wife, Mary Lou, have contended with brown water flowing from their faucets.\n\nLast February, above-freezing temperatures sent snow and manure-laden soil into his yard, forming a large pond the color of coffee.\n\nThe industrial farm that spread the manure, Hall’s Calf Ranch, took issue with whether manure was in the water, according to DNR documents.\n\nBut agency records show water samples detected ammonia and phosphorus – both markers for manure. On Oct. 1, the DNR issued the farm a notice that it violated state manure handling requirements.\n\nThe irony: Karnopp’s father once owned the land and Karnopp remembers riding in a tractor doing the same chore.\n\n“But not like they do today,” he said. “There’s just so much of it, they don’t know what to do with it.”\n\nLarge-scale farms dominate milk production\n\nMore than half of the milk cows in the U.S. were on dairies with more than 1,000 cows as of 2017, according to the USDA's agricultural census. They accounted for 58% of the nation’s milk. Two decades earlier, those operations had less than 20% of the milk cows, according to USDA data.\n\nOn average, dairy farms with 2,000 or more cows have 12% lower feed costs and 20% lower operating costs – per hundred pounds of milk produced – than farms with 100 or 200 cows. The big farms also produce more milk per cow.\n\n“The large-scale operations are making a lot of milk, and they’re doing it efficiently at low cost. It does put a lot of pressure on some of the smaller, often multigeneration, farms,\" said Ben Laine, a dairy industry analyst with Rabo AgriFinance in St. Louis.\n\nThe largest concentration of big dairy farms was in California and Idaho, followed by Texas, according to U.S. farm census data.\n\nOne survival tactic used by smaller farms has been switching to organic dairying. At times, these farms have gotten twice the rate for their milk, which offsets the higher feed and other operating costs.\n\nEven in that niche, however, industrial farms quickly changed the business model.\n\nA handful of mega-sized dairies in the Southwest now produce more certified organic milk than all of Wisconsin’s 450 organic dairies combined.\n\nThe market is “oversupplied and competition is fierce,” said Adam Warthesen, government relations director for Organic Valley, of La Farge in Vernon County.\n\nCritics contend industrial farms get around rules calling for, among other things, a minimum amount of grazing time for cows in order for the milk to be certified organic.\n\nIt’s unfair competition, said Tom Schaub, an organic dairy farmer with 60 cows on Jewel View Farms, on the bluffs above the Mississippi River in La Crosse County.\n\nAs a result, many farmers have returned to conventional dairy farming, \"not because they didn’t believe in organics, it’s just the economics of it now,\" said Schaub, who is also president of Westby Cooperative Creamery in Westby. \"They have to be able to make their payments and support their farm.”\n\n'Corporate takeover of dairy production'\n\nAs industrial farms take over more of the milk production, they've been recognized for their ability to leverage their size and modernize dairying so that the U.S. can continue to compete in what has become a cutthroat international marketplace.\n\nOperators are managing around-the-clock operations, often with dozens of employees, including professional staff with college degrees in dairy science.\n\nEvery three weeks, a livestock nutritionist with a doctorate degree stops at Don Niles' farm and tweaks feed regimens to boost milk output. “I don’t get that kind of attention with my diet at home,” Niles said.\n\nStill, industrial farms can fail environmentally, sometimes with disastrous results.\n\nIn 2018, the second-largest dairy farm in Oregon folded, leaving behind a mountain of debt and 30 million gallons of manure and wastewater.\n\nThe 13,000-cow operation south of the Columbia River, near Boardman, opened in early 2017 and at one time had a permit for 30,000 animals. In less than two years it accumulated more than 200 environmental violations and nearly $200,000 in fines, the largest amount ever issued against a CAFO by the Oregon Department of Agriculture.\n\nState regulators sued to shut Lost Valley Farm down, saying it posed a threat to drinking water wells by allowing liquid manure to overflow from storage lagoons. Thousands of cattle and the farm were sold at auction.\n\n“If we have anything to say about it, there won’t be a new dairy operation there at all because we're seeking a moratorium on these new big farms until we can make sure we are protecting our water, our air and our family farmers,” said Amy van Saun, an attorney for the Center for Food Safety, an environmental group in Portland.\n\n\"There was definite mismanagement. But the problem with an operation that big is, when even something small goes wrong, it can have a big impact,\" she said.\n\nMost Wisconsin industrial farms are family-owned, although there are outside investors in some operations. Nationwide, it’s unclear whether corporate dairy interests have gained sufficient market strength yet to drive out the most efficient independent milk producers, said John Ikerd, professor emeritus of agricultural economics at the University of Missouri.\n\nBut dairy farmers cannot ignore the lessons of poultry and pork farms, Ikerd said, where small producers were forced out when food companies established their own operations, with thousands of chickens, turkeys and pigs.\n\n“We are now seeing a corporate takeover of dairy production, which is the last bastion of full-time, independent family farms in animal agriculture,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is the harsh reality now confronting smaller independent dairy farmers.”\n\nSome large retail chains are bottling their own milk and contracting directly with farmers to get it. In June 2018, Walmart opened a 250,000-square-foot processing plant near Fort Wayne, Indiana, acquiring milk from 30 farms in Indiana and Michigan. The plant was built to supply milk to hundreds of Walmart stores in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky.\n\nWalmart’s decision to build the plant was backed by millions of dollars in tax incentives from the State of Indiana and local officials seeking about 300 jobs in return.\n\n“This new plant is a perfect example of the kinds of efficiencies Walmart seeks in our supply chain to benefit our customers,” Tony Airoso, senior vice president of sourcing strategy said in a statement.\n\nBut it left about 100 dairy farmers for Dean Foods Co. without a milk buyer when Dean lost that part of Walmart’s business, according to industry analysts. In November, citing a continued decline in milk sales, Dean filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nDean \"had bigger, industrywide issues with the consumption of milk products. But the loss of the Walmart business was just another thing they didn’t need,” said Mark Stephenson, director of dairy policy analysis at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nFarms expand for different reasons\n\nIkerd spent much of his career promoting large expansions.\n\n“I supported this process because I thought it was going to make agriculture more efficient and it would be good for farmers and rural communities,\" he said.\n\nThen he changed his mind.\n\n\"It hasn't fed hungry people, it hasn't produced healthy foods and it hasn't supported independent family farms and rural communities,\" he added.\n\nScaling back the size of U.S. dairy farms isn’t the answer, said Tim Trotter, executive director of Wisconsin’s Dairy Business Association.\n\n“Decisions to expand are often made for reasons that have nothing to do with supply or demand,” Trotter said. “For example, a child coming home and wanting to buy into the farm. How would we accommodate these kinds of expansions?\n\nA veterinarian by training, Niles started his Kewaunee County dairy farm in 2001 with a business partner after a stint with agribusiness giant Monsanto Co. in California’s dairy-rich San Joaquin Valley.\n\n“People ask, ‘Why did they let the CAFOs in?’ ” Niles said. “In people’s minds, they think there was a migration of large farms from California or somewhere that came here and took over our dairy industry.”\n\nInstead, some farmers opted to grow to “keep their kids in the business, not milk cows twice a day for 40 years and take some vacations,” he said.\n\nHis partner was John Pagel, owner of 5,000-cow Pagel’s Ponderosa who died in a private plane crash in February 2018 in Indiana with his son-in-law and the pilot.\n\n“Best friend I ever had,” Niles said.\n\nWhen they first met in 1987, Pagel had 74 cows. Today, his family-run dairy churns out a line of cheeses and owns a farm-to-fork restaurant in downtown Green Bay.\n\nStocks swing on Trump tweets:How do you protect your 401(k) from the volatility?\n\nGrocery stores:These are the best ones in every state\n\nDisheartening message\n\nIn the 1970s, Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz famously told farmers to \"get big or get out\" and plant \"fence row to fence row.\" He championed industrial farming.\n\nThis fall at World Dairy Expo in Madison, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue drew sharp criticism for essentially reprising that message specifically to dairy farmers.\n\n“Now what we see, obviously, is economies of scale having happened in America – big get bigger and small go out,” Perdue said. \"With the capital needs and all the environmental regulations and everything else today, to survive milking 40, 50, 60 or even 100 cows – and that's what we've seen.\"\n\nThe message disheartened some family farmers.\n\n“I went to Madison feeling financially scared and emotionally depressed, but hopeful,\" said Paul Adams, who has a 500-cow organic dairy farm near Eleva in Trempealeau County. \"I came home feeling financially scared, emotionally depressed, unwanted and unneeded.\"\n\nBrittany Olson left her Barron County farm at 3 a.m. to make it to Madison for the speech.\n\n“To go through the effort to see the USDA secretary, only for him to say that small farms like ours likely have no future, made me feel like little more than a peasant in a system of modern-day feudalism,” Olson said.\n\nThe mindset that’s been pushed on farmers – to continually grow – is one reason for the overproduction that’s suppressed milk prices and forced people out of business, said Darin Von Ruden, a dairy farmer from Westby in Vernon County and president of Wisconsin Farmers Union.\n\n“We need to look at something that will benefit all of rural America, not just corporate rural America,” he said.\n\nNo 'one-size-fits-all way to farm'\n\nPerdue's message in part reflected the growing political voice that owners of larger farms have cultivated.\n\nOn Nov. 5, the Wisconsin Senate effectively fired Brad Pfaff, the agriculture secretary under Democratic Gov. Tony Evers – a move with no precedent in at least the last half-century. Although Pfaff was personally popular with many farm groups, the agriculture department had proposed rules that could have placed limits on farm expansions.\n\nThe Wisconsin Farmers Union backed the changes.\n\n“We felt very strongly that these modifications were long overdue after the tremendous changes we’ve seen in the agricultural industry and lots of concerns that have been expressed by people in rural communities,” said Kara O’Connor, the government relations director for the Wisconsin Farmers Union.\n\n“We have farms in Wisconsin now that are larger than anyone had ever contemplated in 2006 when this rule was first passed,” she said.\n\nBut representatives of CAFOs fiercely opposed the changes.\n\nCynthia Leitner, president of Wisconsin Dairy Alliance, said it's not fair to demonize big farms. The organization was formed in 2018 to represent CAFOs.\n\n\"There is no one-way, one-size-fits-all way to farm,\" she said.\n\nLeitner acknowledged that a glut of milk in the last five years has been brutal on dairy farmers.\n\nBut at the same time, Wisconsin cheese plants have brought in milk from other states because it was cheaper, even with transportation costs. Those plants could be looking for new suppliers when a $500 million processing facility under construction in St. Johns, Michigan, comes on line in late 2020. It is expected to siphon off much of the milk that has been coming to Wisconsin.\n\n\"The double-edge sword in this case is what happens if we cannot produce enough milk\" to make up for the loss, Leitner said. Her fear is that those Wisconsin processors will expand elsewhere.\n\n\"The fight should not be about big and small (farms). It should be about keeping Wisconsin dairy for future generations,\" she said.\n\nOrganic dairy farmer and Republican state Rep. Travis Tranel of Cuba City said he understands why CAFOs draw different reactions.\n\n\"At the end of the day, they can put a product on the shelf that is just as safe, just as nutritiously sound as anybody, if not more so, at a cheaper price,\" Tranel said.\n\nHe defended industrial farms' overall environmental track record but acknowledged there are unintended economic consequences. As small farms disappear, and local agribusinesses are consolidated, it's \"not good for our rural schools, it's not good for our rural churches, it's not good for our rural communities.\"\n\n'No one should have to go through what we went through'\n\nMany of those who live near industrial farms would argue the consequences go far beyond local spending.\n\nIn Juneau County, a lawsuit filed in November 2018 alleges that Central Sands Dairy, an industrial farm that milks more than 4,100 cows, and Wysocki Produce Farm Inc., a vegetable grower, knew that monitored wells showed high nitrate levels dating back to 2008 but failed to tell neighbors or state authorities.\n\nThe case is still being litigated and involves more than 300 plaintiffs – including a Nekoosa mother who lost a baby at 23 weeks to a severe birth defect.\n\nTim Huffcutt, a spokesman for Central Sands, declined to comment on the lawsuit. He noted, however, that a coalition of three farms, including Central Sands, has agreed to provide bottled water and, as of mid-November, had coordinated the installation of 48 water purification systems to homes with contaminated wells.\n\nNitrate has been associated with a condition called blue baby syndrome, which reduces the amount of oxygen in a baby’s blood.\n\n“They don’t turn blue, but grayish purple,” toxicologist Sarah Yang of the state Department of Health Services told a group of citizens this fall in Amherst at a meeting about high nitrate levels in Portage County.\n\nAccording to Yang, infants, pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant, are at the most risk from high nitrates. Some studies suggest it may cause birth defects, thyroid problems and colon cancer.\n\nThe EPA conducted its own groundwater investigation in a 30-square-mile area of Juneau County that included Central Sands in late April and early May 2018. It found that of 200 samples, 130 had nitrate levels higher than the drinking water standard. All were in locations where groundwater flowed from the direction of farm fields. Wisconsin’s nitrate standard in drinking water is 10 parts per million.\n\nA month later, officials in Juneau and Wood counties found that 42% of 104 residential wells exceeded the nitrate drinking water standard.\n\nCelina Stewart, one of the litigants in the lawsuit, has blogged about the anguish of losing a baby. She also has urged the DNR not to renew a five-year permit for Central Sands – something it has not yet done.\n\nIn her comments to the agency, Stewart said her well tests showed nitrate levels ranging from 15 parts per million to more than 40 parts per million and that she was only aware of the lower reading while pregnant.\n\n“No one should have to go through what we went through because of water,\" Stewart wrote. \"We should be able to go to our faucet and turn it on and safely drink water from our well and not worry about getting sick or dying.\"\n\nContributing: Andrew Mollica", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/03/17/coronavirus-how-countries-across-globe-responding-covid-19/5065867002/", "title": "Coronavirus: How countries across the globe are responding to ...", "text": "LONDON – Keep calm and carry on, said Britain, the country with the least restrictive coronavirus measures in Europe (before sharply altering course March 16 amid a new \"catastrophic\" warning about how many people could die). Batten down the hatches, says China, the nation that is not far from declaring total victory over the COVID-19 epidemic that swept its Hubei province. \"Test, test, test,\" says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization.\n\nAnd the United States? Which countries should it look to for guidance about how to combat a disease that's infected more than 740,000 worldwide and killed over 35,000?\n\nThe majority of global public health experts believe that countries need to act quickly and decisively to reduce what Robbert Muggah, a leading Brazil-based risk and security specialist, said \"represents the most significant threat to population health and political and economic stability in a generation.\" These measures include easy and efficient access to testing and results, rigorous contact tracing, consistent science-based messaging, quarantines and a genuine commitment to clamping down on socializing.\n\nTrump reacts to coronavirus:Mnuchin says proposal would inject 'a trillion dollars into the economy,' includes giving checks to Americans\n\n\"If you have a fire on your hands, we all know you have to stamp it out fast,\" said Nicholas Chater, a professor of behavioral science at Warwick Business School, in central England. \"There's no point thinking: 'Well, we don't want to put it out too soon.'\"\n\nBut Chater added that while scientists are learning more about COVID-19 every day, publics around the world will need to get used to something they don't like: uncertainty. \"It could be that we can hold this thing back. We just don't know. No amount of modeling can fix that problem,\" he said, noting that, with a vaccine potentially months or more away, scientists need time to understand the virus's genetics, how it mutates, transmission rates, the viability of cures and the experiences of different countries.\n\nStill, while it may be too early to draw definitive conclusions about how to respond to COVID-19, some countries have taken actions that have appeared to yield results, while others are struggling to contain and combat deepening public health crises.\n\nAustralia\n\nThe Australian government activated its emergency response to COVID-19 on February 27, designating it a global pandemic much earlier than the World Health Organization and any other advanced economy in the Group of Seven nations.\n\nMichael Wallach, a vaccines expert at the University of Technology Sydney, said that this enabled authorities there to quickly release emergency funding and tax breaks, and bought precious time for its hospitals to prepare for a potential flood of patients.\n\nAs of March 30, the death toll for the country stands at 17, with more than 4,300 confirmed cases. Everyone traveling to Australia must self-isolate for 14 days, whether or not they have had potential exposure to the new coronavirus.\n\nCOVID-19: Australian politician who met Ivanka Trump, Attorney General William Barr infected with coronavirus\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has closed Australia's borders.\n\nWallach said that Australia's early labeling of COVID-19 as a pandemic has been helpful for preparedness, but it also brought \"early panic,\" noting the country was among the first to see consumers stockpile toilet paper.\n\nBritain\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has acknowledged that Britain is facing its \"greatest public health crisis\" in decades. As of March 30, Britain's outbreak has lagged behind its European counterparts, with more than 19,500 infections and about 1,300 deaths.\n\nJohnson, who himself has tested positive, has conceded that \"many loved ones will die.\" Yet from the start he has also appeared to pursue a relatively laissez-faire, and controversial, policy based on the idea that, because COVID-19 will spread widely in society, the country's best bet will be to try to get to \"herd\" or majority immunity as quickly as possible. The thinking behind this is that it will protect the country in the long term if, as happened with the 1918 Spanish Flu, a highly fatal second wave of infections occurs at some point in the future.\n\nThe concept is not only a massive political gamble. Medical experts say evidence to support the theory won't be available until people who have the disease have recovered and been studied for months. It's also not clear how long any immunity would last. Infections could reoccur. Late on March 16, Johnson dramatically changed tactics after researchers at Imperial College London projected that around 250,000 people in Britain would die if \"chains of transmission\" for the virus weren't immediately slowed or broken.\n\nThe British government has now imposed a total lockdown, with only essential trips to supermarkets and for medicine, as well as exercise, permitted.\n\nGermany, France, Spain\n\nAuthorities in Germany adopted relatively strict measures early on, including closing all schools and day-care centers and banning gatherings.\n\nMuseums, movie theaters, gyms, swimming pools and nightclubs have also been temporarily shuttered. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also outlawed overnight stays in hotels unless absolutely \"necessary and expressly not for tourist purposes.\"\n\nThe measures introduced by Merkel follow an abrupt about-face for Germany's leader. For several weeks, she had argued for close coordination with fellow European Union member states to slow the spread of the virus. But amid a fast rise in the number of infections, Merkel closed Germany's borders with Austria, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Denmark. Germany has over 63,000 confirmed cases and 550 deaths, a relatively low figure that public health experts have been at pains to explain. Germany has undertaken a large amount of testing, has a higher-than-average number of critical care beds and is also one of the main European manufacturers of ventilators.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has also strongly limited movement in France. Only trips to the doctor and to food stores will be allowed. Macron also delayed elections. As of March 30, France had more than 40,174 cases of the virus, including 2,606 deaths. Spain, the most virus-infected nation after Italy and the U.S., has taken similar actions to France. It has more than 85,000 cases and 7,300 fatalities.\n\nIsrael\n\nMore than 4,300 people have been diagnosed in Israel, with the number quickly rising. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has closed Israel's borders to all foreigners.\n\nOn March 17, Netanyahu announced that the country's highly secretive Shin Bet internal security service would soon begin deploying its highly sophisticated counter-terrorism technology to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in Israel.\n\nThe agency’s capabilities are normally used to track Palestinian militants.\n\nIn a statement, Shin Bet head Nadav Argaman acknowledged that using these digital tools to keep track of sick Israeli citizens deviates from the agency's typical operations, but he said the goal was still in line with its overall mission of \"saving lives.\"\n\nNetanyahu said the technology had never been used before on civilians and would involve a certain degree of violation of privacy. He approved its use for 30 days.\n\nNetanyahu is self-isolating after a member of his staff tested positive.\n\nSweden\n\nUnlike its Scandinavian neighbors, Denmark and Norway, which have placed extensive restrictions on their borders and imposed broad-based lockdowns to stem the outbreak, Sweden has only closed some schools and largely kept restaurants and shops open.\n\nIt's a strategy that appears similar to Britain's, before Johnson did an abrupt about-face amid spiraling infections. As of March 30, Sweden recorded more than 4,000 cases and 146 deaths, compared to Denmark's 2,555 cases and 77 deaths, and Norway's 4,300 cases and 31 deaths. Denmark and Norway have similar populations of around 5 million; Sweden's is twice that.\n\n\"Sweden has gone mostly for voluntary measures because that’s how we’re used to working,\" said Anders Tegnell, an epidemiologist from Sweden's Public Health Agency, in a CNBC interview on March 30.\n\n\"And we have a long tradition that it works rather well.\"\n\nIran\n\nIran's authorities for days denied the risk the outbreak posed even as a high number of its lawmakers have fallen ill with the disease and it has also not spared top officials, including Iran's senior vice-president, Cabinet ministers, Revolutionary Guard members, health ministry officials and close aides to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe virus has killed 2,750 people amid over 42,000 cases, according to Iran's health ministry, although there are concerns the country may be either underreporting infections or simply not know the scale of its outbreak. Years of western sanctions have puts its health system under extreme strain and officials have been slow to enforce quarantines in some areas.\n\nMiddle East fallout:Nearly 10% of Iranian lawmakers infected with coronavirus\n\nKhamenei has issued a religious ruling, or fatwa, prohibiting \"unnecessary\" travel after earlier warning Iranians that \"millions\" could die if they don't start heeding travel restrictions and public health guidance, such as staying away from religious shrines.\n\nSources in Iran told USA TODAY that people in Iran have still been widely going about their business in public despite calls from the authorities for people to stay home.\n\nItaly\n\nItaly is only behind the U.S. as the epicenter of COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization. It has almost 98,000 infections and more than 11,000 deaths, the majority of them in its wealthy northern regions, where there are world-class hospitals.\n\nIntensive care beds and ventilators are in such short supply in some areas that the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care has drawn up guidelines for doctors about how to manage the crisis if the outbreak intensifies. Among the considerations: prioritizing treatment for those under the age of 80 who don't have any \"co-morbidities\" - underlying health conditions. With too many patients to care for, many needing life support machines, medical staff would need to effectively choose who lives and who dies. It's a form of triage medicine usually only seen in wartime.\n\nLife under coronavirus lockdown in Italy:My quarantine, a worried wait for a test result – and relief\n\nItaly has imposed a near-total lockdown on its citizens, with only supermarkets and drug stores open to the public. There are curfews and travel restrictions and its normally bustling piazzas and squares and historic sites are virtually empty.\n\nIt's too soon to tell if Italy's severe measures are working, although the rate of infections appears to be stabilizing.\n\nIn mid-March, an Italian citizen named Giovanni Locatelli shared Facebook footage comparing a Lombardy newspaper’s obituary section on Feb. 9, when it took up just one page, to a copy on March 13, when 10 pages were needed to commemorate the dead.\n\nSingapore\n\nFew countries battling the virus have been as successful as Singapore.\n\nIt has 879 cases and just 3 deaths and its rate of recoveries has outpaced infections.\n\nAccording to Michael Merson, director of the SingHealth Duke-NUS Global Health Institute and the Wolfgang Joklik Professor of Global Health at Duke University, the country has a number of factors that are hard to replicate: an excellent health system; strict virus testing, tracing and containment programs; a small population; and citizens who are largely accepting of what the government orders to them to do.\n\n\"There's strong government leadership, but also trust in the government,\" said Merson, who used to run the World Health Organization's anti-AIDS program. \"Every time a case is identified there is a very strong action plan to identify contacts. It's also very good at promoting hand-washing and keeping people at a safe distance from one another.\"\n\nMerson said Singapore has allowed businesses and some universities to stay open but with very strict guidelines about the size of gatherings (25 or under). \"They take prudent steps at prevention, but they haven't entirely shut the country down. They also have experience with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome, a much more deadly virus), which has given them some confidence with how to deal with coronavirus,\" he said.\n\nStill, worryingly, Singapore reported 35 news cases on March 30, the highest number it has reported in a single day.\n\nIt has now imposed 14-day quarantines for all arrivals into the country.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nMost of South Korea's infections are linked to a quasi-Christian sect.\n\nBut the Asian country has still become one of the countries hardest-hit by COVID-19 outside China, with more than 9,660 infections and at least 158 deaths.\n\nIt has also put in place a rigorous screening program, with more than 200,000 people tested, about 1 in every 250 people. Testing is fast (about 10 minutes) and free (the government pays) and the results are usually sent by text within 24 hours.\n\nSouth Korea was also among the first countries to roll out a drive-through testing center and it has a well-functioning virus-contact-tracing system.\n\nSouth Korea, like Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, is one of a number of places in Asia where authorities have appeared to have had some success \"flattening the curve,\" or potentially spreading out the number of its coronavirus cases over a longer period so that health systems can have time to mitigate the impact of the disease.\n\nBut Merson said that it's not clear how long countries can continue to \"flatten the curve\" and if COVID-19 will only roar back once current control measures are phased out.\n\n\"We need to watch closely what happens in China,\" he said, referring to its decision to start phasing in school openings and restart factories and businesses in some areas.\n\nChina\n\nDespite receiving early criticism for trying to cover up the outbreak, China has been able to turn the tide of an infection that is now rapidly spreading through the global population. It reported fewer than 31 new infections and 4 deaths on March 30, bringing its total number of cases to 81, 470, of which more than 75,700 patients have recovered.\n\nChina enacted sweeping measures that forced people inside for weeks, banned all forms of public gatherings and mobilized almost 20,000 medical staff from all over the country to Hubei. At the virus's peak, 120 million school kids were taught online.\n\nHuiyao Wang, a senior adviser to China's government, told USA TODAY in a phone interview from Beijing that the U.S. and other western nations need to do even more to combat COVID-19 than they are doing now, including more harsh restrictions.\n\n\"I worry that the economic impact may now cause more casualties than the virus itself,\" he said, adding that the during the worst of the outbreak authorities in China visited every single household in the affected areas, meticulously took temperatures and isolated the sick in large stadiums and other venues for observation and treatment.\n\n\"I understand that some of the Chinese experience can't be transferred, but since we have been dealing with this for months now they should take our advice,\" he said. referring to what he described as little high-level contact between the Trump administration and President Xi Jinping's government over the pandemic.\n\nIn fact, relations have appeared frosty in recent days.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has accused China of spreading \"disinformation and outlandish rumors\" and needed to stop blaming the U.S. for the spread of the disease first detected in China.

He has also declared a national emergency unleashing billions of dollars as part of a raft of measures aimed at bringing a roiling public health crisis – and a growing economic and financial one – under control. Trump has signed a $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package.\n\nTrump now appears to be taking COVID-19 seriously.\n\n\"If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus, and we are going to have a big celebration all together.

In Las Vegas, at least two people have died in flooding since last week in what has become the wettest monsoon season in a decade. In Texas, the National Hurricane Center is monitoring a disturbance that will bring thunderstorms and up to 6 inches of rain over the next few days, leading to potential flash flooding. While the rain has brought relief to some drought-stricken areas, experts say climate change is increasing the likelihood of extreme flooding and catastrophic disasters. Separately, a new study indicates a disastrous megaflood is coming to California in the next four decades – and experts say it would be unlike anything anyone alive today has ever experienced.\n\n2.

But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday, it was pretty easy to read between the lines of the Wyoming Republican’s answers.\n\n“I am working hard here in Wyoming to earn every vote,” Cheney said at one point. “But I will also say this. I’m not going to lie. I’m not going to say things that aren’t true about the election. My opponents are doing that, certainly simply for the purpose of getting elected.\n\n“If I have to choose between maintaining a seat in the House of Representatives or protecting the constitutional republic and ensuring the American people know the truth about Donald Trump, I’m going to choose the Constitution and the truth every single day,” she said at another.\n\nAsked by Tapper whether her service as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6 will have been worth it even if she loses next month, Cheney responded that it was “the single most important thing I have ever done professionally.”\n\nIf it sounds to you like Cheney is framing her August 16 primary for Wyoming’s at-large House seat as a sort of fait accompli, and as not the end of the story but as a part of a broader narrative, well, then, you are right.\n\nThe simple fact is that Cheney is very unlikely to beat Harriet Hageman in next month’s primary. Hageman has the support of former President Donald Trump, as well as a number of top Republicans including, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWhile Cheney has tried to recruit Democrats to cross party lines and support her – and some undoubtedly will – it’s hard to see that making a real difference in the outcome of the race in such an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nSimply put: Cheney looks likely to lose – and she knows it.\n\nWhat she also knows is that, at least in her mind, this isn’t the end of her political career.\n\nHere’s how Cheney answered a question from Tapper on whether she is interested in running for president in 2024:\n\n“I haven’t really – at this point, I have not made a decision about 2024. …\n\n“… But I do think, as we look towards the next presidential election, as I said, I believe that our nation stands on the edge of an abyss. And I do believe that we all have to really think very seriously about the dangers we face and the threats we face. And we have to elect serious candidates.”\n\nWhich tells you everything you need to know about Cheney and 2024. She isn’t an announced candidate. But when you hear a politician talking about the country “standing on the edge of an abyss” and the need to elect “serious candidates,” well, it doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out what’s going on there.\n\nThe real question seems to be then not whether Cheney runs – she sounded to all the world like that decision is mostly made – but rather whether she would have any sort of impact on the 2024 race.\n\nIf Cheney runs as a Republican, it will, undoubtedly, be a very tough road for her.\n\nTrump is the clear frontrunner in all polling conducted on the Republican presidential primary and seems very likely to run. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is widely seen as the only serious alternative to Trump at the moment – and he has positioned himself as a representative of Trumpism without Trump.\n\nThere is no potential candidate garnering any serious support in hypothetical 2024 primary polls who is running expressly against Trump and his four years in office. The Republicans, aside from Cheney, who are signaling an interest in running that sort of campaign – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan being perhaps the most prominent – barely register in polls.\n\nCould Cheney somehow coalesce the anti-Trump vote within the Republican Party? Sure. But even if she was to do so, there’s scant evidence that bloc of voters comprise anything close to a majority of likely Republican primary voters.\n\nThe other – and perhaps more plausible – path for Cheney is to run as an independent in 2024. Assuming Trump is the Republican nominee, such a candidacy could skim off enough votes to potentially hamstring the former President’s chances of winning. (Presumably Cheney, who is conservative on most issues, would appeal more to Republicans than Democrats.)\n\nEven under that scenario, however, Cheney would function as a spoiler – trying to keep Trump from the White House – rather than as a viable candidate to be president. Which, given what she told Tapper Sunday, might be enough for her.\n\n“I’m fighting hard, no matter what happens on August 16, I’m going to wake up on August 17 and continue to fight hard to ensure Donald Trump is never anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again,” said Cheney.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/politics/ron-desantis-migrants-marthas-vineyard-stunt/index.html", "title": "Ron DeSantis is getting *exactly* what he wanted | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn the 24 hours or so since Ron DeSantis sent two planes carrying migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, the move has dominated the political world. Every newspaper and cable channel is filled with thoughts about the move, with much of that opinion tilting toward outrage over the Florida Republican governor treating people like political pawns.\n\n“It’s outrageous,” New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez said of the move. “They lure people, like human traffickers lure people, onto buses and unknowing where they’re going to. They have no concern for – they supposedly are the advocates for human life. They have no concern for the lives of these people.”\n\nDeSantis couldn’t have scripted it any better politically.\n\nThe simple fact is that DeSantis made this Martha’s Vineyard gambit solely to draw attention to himself and his opposition to the border policies of the Biden administration. It was, to be frank, a stunt. And it’s not the first time he’s done something like this.\n\nConsider:\n\n* In the spring of 2022, DeSantis’ administration rejected 41% of proposed math textbooks because they were allegedly “indoctrinating” kids. “Some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core, and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students,” DeSantis said in a statement explaining the move.\n\n* At a press conference at the University of South Florida earlier this year, DeSantis scolded students for wearing masks while indoors. “You do not have to wear those masks,” he said. “I mean, please take them off. Honestly, it’s not doing anything. We’ve got to stop with this Covid theater. So if you want to wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous.”\n\n* DeSantis revoked Disney’s special self-governance status in Florida following the company’s criticism of the state’s passage of legislation that bans the discussion of gender and sexuality among young people in public schools. “You’re a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you’re going to marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state,” said DeSantis. “We view that as a provocation, and we’re going to fight back against that.”\n\nEach of these incidents drew national headlines. Each of them drew intense criticism from the left. And each of them drew equal amounts of praise from the conservative right.\n\nWhich is exactly how the Martha Vineyard’s stunt has played out. While DeSantis was blasted by Democrats, the right ran to defend him. “DeSantis was right to send migrants to Martha’s Vineyard. We need to bring border crisis to Democrats,” read an op-ed on Fox News’ website.\n\nFor DeSantis, the outrage – on both sides – is the point. He has built a political brand on the idea of standing up to what he views as political correctness and wokeness. (DeSantis signed a bill into law earlier this year designed to “protect Floridians from discrimination and woke indoctrination.”) In order to maintain and burnish that image, he has to do even more outrageous things – like the Martha’s Vineyard move.\n\nThe fact of the matter – whether you like DeSantis or not – is that his outrage machine is humming along. Largely riding his knack for stirring controversy, he has emerged by many measures as the second-most popular Republican in the country – behind only Donald Trump. He is regarded as a heavy favorite to win a second term over his Democratic opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist, in November. And he is widely regarded as the only candidate who could credibly challenge Trump in a 2024 Republican primary.\n\nWhich is somewhat ironic. Because, as Trump likes to remind anyone who asks, he helped make DeSantis by endorsing him in a primary fight in 2018. And DeSantis has quite clearly modeled his approach to politics off of the ripped-from-the-headlines strategy employed by Trump.\n\nIn fact, what DeSantis is offering Republican voters amounts to Trumpism without Trump. In DeSantis, you get all the anti-wokeness that Trump built a presidential campaign and presidency on, but just without some of the more embarrassing personal foibles and tics that the former President brings with him.\n\nAnd, just like Trump, covering DeSantis provides a significant challenge for the media as well. DeSantis wants – and even courts – the scorn of the mainstream media for gambits like the one in Martha’s Vineyard. He knows that the more negative attention he gets, the better liked he is among the Republican base and the more money he can raise for his future political endeavors.\n\nNot covering someone like DeSantis – the governor of a major state and someone with national ambitions – is out of the question. But how DeSantis – and his stunts – are covered is something that the media needs to think seriously on as we move closer to 2024.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/06/24/most-important-event-the-year-you-were-born/37164307/", "title": "The most important events from 1917 to 2017: WWI to Trump's election", "text": "Angelo Young and John Harrington\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nOver the past 100 years we’ve witnessed some of the most profound changes in human history.\n\nBetween wars, technological developments, progress in civil rights and breakthroughs in science and medicine, the old order that held back hundreds of millions of people has been swept away.\n\nCenturies-old empires crumbled as new ideologies – from communism to fascism – for better or worse found roots in many places of the world. Progressive human rights ideas also emerged and changed the world as women, blacks, and the LGBT community demanded, and often won, equal rights.

The legislation opens the way for Prohibition, which lasts from 1920 to 1933. The public flouts the law, which succeeds in enriching gangsters and contributing to the rise of organized crime.\n\n1920: Women's suffrage\n\n• Date: Aug. 26\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nThough the United States was founded under democratic principles, only a minority of its population (starting with white landowning males over the age of 21) could actually vote. But after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution is passed, women finally gain a voice and the right to cast their ballots.\n\nSports gambling:Why sports betting hasn't gone nationwide yet after Supreme Court ruling\n\n1921: Chinese Communists rise\n\n• Date: July 1\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nIn a prequel to the rise of Mao Zedong and Red China, the Chinese Communist Party is founded, and three weeks later it convenes its first National Congress that is attended by Mao. It would take another 28 years before the Republic of China becomes the People's Republic of China.\n\n1922: British Empire shrinks\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: London\n\nThe British Empire was at its peak toward the end of World War I, commanding a global population estimated to be as many as 570 million people, or about a fourth of the world's population at the time. The empire's size began to shrink in 1920, when Britain declared limited independence for Egypt, which leads to full independence two years later.\n\n1923: Great Kanto earthquake\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Tokyo, Yokohama, Japan\n\nThe Great Kanto earthquake, also known as the Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake, strikes the Japanese mainland at noon on Sept. 1, 1923, with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 people. The force of the temblor destroys hundreds of thousands of homes that either collapse or are engulfed in fire. The quake sets off a tsunami that reaches a height of almost 40 feet at Atami in the Sagami Gulf, killing 60 people there. The most significant outcome of the catastrophe is the rebuilt Tokyo that would become a modern metropolis.\n\n1924: From Lenin to Stalin\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: Moscow\n\nFollowing the death of Vladimir Lenin on Jan. 21, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, immediately begins a purge of political rivals. Some are simply moved to different positions, while others, like Leon Trotsky, the presumed successor to Lenin, are exiled. Stalin's paranoia grows as he takes control of the nation, and with it the level of violence and killing of anyone perceived to be a threat to his power and control.\n\n1925: Scopes monkey trial\n\n• Date: July 10\n\n• Location: Dayton, Tennessee\n\nAfter teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee high school, the state prosecutes science teacher John Thomas Scopes because state law prohibits such teaching as it runs counter to Biblical beliefs. The trial pits well-known Christian fundamentalist William Jennings Bryan against renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. The jury rules against Scopes, forcing him to pay a fine of $100 (about $1,460 in 2017 dollars). It would take another 43 years before the U.S. Supreme Court rules that laws punishing people for teaching evolution violate the First Amendment.\n\n1926: U.S. starts numbered highway system\n\n• Date: Nov. 11\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nIn a precursor to the modern interstate highway system, the federal government introduces a national highway numbering system in an effort to standardize roadways, especially local roads and trails with names unfamiliar to outsiders. The U.S. Numbered Highway System makes it easier for the growing number of car owners to figure out how to get from one city or town to the next and opens the way for the great American road-trip tradition.\n\n1927: Lindbergh nonstop to Paris\n\n• Date: May 21\n\n• Location: New York to Paris\n\nWhen the monoplane The Spirit of St. Louis touches down at Le Bourget Field in Paris on the evening of May 21, Charles Lindbergh becomes the person to fly over the Atlantic Ocean nonstop. Lindbergh would become one of the heroes of the age. His feat fires the imagination of aspiring aviators about the commercial possibilities of flight. Lindbergh would stay in the news, but for regrettable reasons. A strong advocate for American isolationism in the 1930s, he is criticized for his admiration of Nazi Germany's aircraft industry. Also, his son would be killed during a bungled kidnapping attempt in 1932.\n\n1928: Earhart crosses Atlantic\n\n• Date: June 17-18\n\n• Location: Wales\n\nAmelia Earhart becomes the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Wales, making her an American national heroine and feminist icon who would go on to set numerous aviation records. She would later set another record as the first person – man or woman – to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. Earhart and her co-pilot Fred Noonan would vanish over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Recent evidence has emerged indicating Earhart may have sent distress signals after surviving a crash, possibly on the remote Gardner Island in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\n1929: Wall Street crashes\n\n• Date: Oct. 24-29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe \"Roaring Twenties\" come to a halt on Black Tuesday in October 1929, when stocks take a nosedive, contributing to the Great Depression. Reasons for the worst economic downturn in American history include over-lending by weakly regulated banks, excessive stock price valuation, too many stocks purchased on margin, unrestrained exuberance that sends millions of people to convert their savings into stocks, tightening of the credit by the Federal Reserve and an agricultural drought.\n\n1930: Ho Chi Minh rises in Vietnam\n\n• Date: Feb. 2\n\n• Location: Hanoi\n\nIn an event that would have repercussions for U.S. foreign policy decades later, Vietnamese independence fighter Ho Chi Minh founds the Communist Party of Vietnam as part of his effort to oust French colonial occupiers. \"Uncle Ho,\" as he was known to his many supporters, was inspired by the Russian Bolsheviks, who oppose the Tsarist autocracy, seeing parallels between that struggle and the fight against the foreign occupiers of his country.\n\n1931: Empire State Building completed\n\n• Date: May 1\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nPresident Herbert Hoover inaugurates the completion of the Empire State Building on May Day. It becomes the tallest building of the iconic Manhattan skyline until the construction of the World Trade Center Towers are completed in 1973. Incredibly, the 86-story office building took only 13 months to build, with construction starting in March of the previous year.\n\n1932: Hitler becomes German\n\n• Date: Feb. 25\n\n• Location: Germany\n\nSeven years after Adolf Hitler renounces his Austrian citizenship, a fellow member of the Nazi Party gets him a low-level government job, which comes with automatic citizenship. This opens the way for him to run for office. Already a well-known party activist, it takes Hitler only two years from receiving his citizenship status to becoming the leader of Germany.\n\n1933: FDR elected\n\n• Date: March 12\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the Great Depression sending millions of Americans to soup kitchens and chasing whatever work they can find, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt begins his weekly \"Fireside Chats\" as Americans are eager for guidance and solace during those dark times. FDR's first radio talk explains to Americans in plain language why he ordered that banks would close temporarily at different time in different parts of the country. The purpose, he explains, is to curb panic rushes of withdrawals, which has been hurting efforts to stabilize the banking system.\n\n1934: Hitler consolidates power\n\n• Date: June 30\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nGermans, who had been suffering from a disastrous economic depression in 1929-30, begin to embrace the ideas of the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party – the Nazi Party. It becomes the largest party after the 1932 elections. In 1933, Adolf Hitler is appointed chancellor of Germany. After President Paul von Hindenburg dies in 1934, Hitler then purges members of his own party – the bloody Night of the Long Knives – with the help of Nazi storm troopers and becomes the unquestioned leader of Germany.\n\n1935: FDR launches New Deal\n\n• Date: Aug. 14\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nPresident Roosevelt, grappling with the Great Depression, signs into law his signature Social Security Act, a law that creates the country's first retirement security system. Earlier that year, as part of his \"New Deal\" policy, the president established the Works Progress Administration, a massive economic stimulus program, putting millions of Americans to work building the country's public infrastructure.\n\n1936: Owens flouts Nazis\n\n• Date: Aug. 3\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nAs the concept of racial purity and superiority dominates Germany in the 1930s, African-American sprinter Jesse Owens of Oakville, Alabama, shows them who is the master racer. During the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and under the gaze of Adolf Hitler, Owens wins four Olympic gold medals for the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints, the long jump, and the 100-meter relay.\n\nFrom Alaska to Florida:States with the biggest and smallest governments\n\n1937: UAW changes car industry\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Flint, Michigan\n\nNearly two years after the establishment of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), the union scores a major victory in Flint, Michigan. Workers at the General Motors Fisher Body Plant Number One lay down their tools and occupy the factory, demanding union representation, a fair minimum wage, safer working conditions, and not to outsource labor to non-union plants. Despite efforts by GM and local police to extricate them from the plant, including shutting off the heat, cutting off food supply, and attacks that leave 16 workers and 11 police officers injured, the strike lasts 44 days. The strike leads to an agreement between GM and the UAW, which includes a 5% pay raise and permission to talk in the lunchroom.\n\n1938: Anti-Semitism surges\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Germany, Austria, Sudetenland\n\nGrowing anti-Semitic scapegoating amid Germany's crippling economic conditions culminates in the Kristallnacht, or \"Night of Broken Glass,\" a pogrom sparked by a speech from German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Storm troopers and other Nazi groups are ordered to attack and destroy Jewish businesses, homes and houses of worship. In one night of attacks in Germany, Austria and the German-speaking area of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, dozens of Jews are killed and tens of thousands are rounded up and sent to concentration camps.\n\n1939: World War II starts\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Westerplatte, Poland\n\nUnder the cover of predawn darkness, a German battleship floats quietly into the center of Danzig Harbor and opens fire on a Polish stronghold in Westerplatte, the first shots of World War II. In the following weeks, Nazi forces, including 2,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft, would shatter Polish defenses and surround Warsaw, which surrenders 26 days after the Danzig Harbor attack.\n\n1940: McDonald's founded\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: San Bernardino, California\n\nBrothers Richard and Maurice McDonald open McDonald's Barbecue Restaurant, offering BBQ ribs, pork sandwiches and 23 other menu items. Eight years later, they would restructure their popular local business to focus on hamburgers, milkshakes and fountain sodas, emphasizing speed, a simple menu and low prices. In the 1950s, businessman Ray Kroc would buy out the brothers and grow McDonald's into what it is today – the world's largest restaurant chain.\n\n1941: Attack on Pearl Harbor\n\n• Date: Dec. 7\n\n• Location: Oahu, Hawaii\n\nKnowing the U.S. is gearing up to engage them in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II, Japan deploys a massive air attack on U.S. Navy ships parked at Pearl Harbor. The surprise assault by 353 Japanese aircraft leads to the deaths of 2,403 people, including 1,177 sailors aboard the ill-fated USS Arizona, one of 19 vessels that were damaged or destroyed in the attack. Nearly 330 aircraft were also damaged or destroyed. The United States declares war on Japan the next day and three days later against Germany and Italy.\n\n1942: GIs arrive in Europe\n\n• Date: Jan. 26\n\n• Location: Northern Ireland\n\nThe first U.S. troops destined to fight in Europe in the world's greatest war arrive in Northern Ireland. It is the beginning of a military buildup that would culminate in the invasion of France more than two years later. Before then, the United States was providing only material support to its ally across the Atlantic, while building up what President Roosevelt called the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" in anticipation for the inevitable entry of the United States into the war in Europe.\n\n1943: Invention of LSD\n\n• Date: April 19\n\n• Location: Basel, Switzerland\n\nSwiss chemist Albert Hoffman had been studying the potential medicinal value of lysergic compounds when he accidentally exposed himself to LSD-25, which he had created years earlier in his lab. This was the first LSD trip, a quarter-century before the counterculture endorses the hallucinogenic compound. Hoffman describes the \"not unpleasant\" experience as \"uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors.\" Hoffman takes a second dose and writes a paper about his discovery.

People live longer, eat better, have greater access to improved medical care and are freer to express their opinions and associate with whomever they want.\n\nThat optimism can be seen in population growth. Despite the two most devastating wars in human history, the world population has nearly tripled, from 1.9 billion to 7.5 billion, since 1917.\n\nOne hundred years is an eye blink in history, yet 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote in the United States. African-Americans were prevented from voting in the American South. Labor unions were in their infancy and were weak, and laws reforming child labor had yet to be passed by Congress. All that changed because of women’s suffrage, the inexorable march of civil rights and the strengthening labor unions.\n\nOne hundred years ago, a person anywhere in the world was more likely than not to be illiterate. And there was a good chance he or she was the subject of colonial rulers in South America, Africa and Asia. Two world wars would spell the end of imperial houses in Austria-Hungary, Germany and Russia, and weaken the grip of another, Great Britain. Independence movements sprouted in Europe, Africa and Asia, yearning for freedom and expressing national pride.\n\nNationalism had its dark side, though, with fascist governments ruling Italy and Germany. It would take a world war to remove their scourge. Another form of totalitarianism, communism, would dominate the USSR and Eastern Europe for several generations, as well as China and other countries in Asia, before the West would triumph over the Soviet Union and its allies in the Cold War.\n\nSpeaking of the Cold War, that conflict launched the space race and accelerated technological progress, hastening the use of personal computers and cell phones. These inventions have fundamentally changed our lives – from the way we communicate to the way we shop and socialize – and made billions of dollars for the companies that make them and their founders. These products and innovations are a major part of the culture today.\n\nTo determine the most important event the year you were born, 24/7 Wall St. drew on research materials and media sources to compile its list. Deciding the most important event in a given year by its nature is a subjective exercise. In reaching our decisions, we chose the event that had the most far-reaching impact and was not necessarily the most famous event in a given year.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Doug Ducey. The Republican governor, who has said he wants to do away with regulations on businesses, will have five days to sign it or veto it once it is transmitted to his office. If Ducey takes no action, the bill becomes law without his signature.\n\nDucey's office has made a practice of not commenting on pending legislation. But Ducey, during the 2014 campaign, told TheRepublic and azcentral.com that he was fine with the three-tier system of selling alcohol that this bill would upend.\n\nThe bill, Senate Bill 1381, had been pushed by the California-based industry group Free the Grapes.\n\nIt would delete an entire section of liquor laws that deal with wineries' ability to ship to consumers and would simplify the rules to essentially one requirement: Wineries would need a direct-shipping license from Arizona's liquor department. Wineries then could ship bottles directly to Arizona consumers.\n\nCurrent law allows only small wineries to ship directly to consumers. The law defines small wineries as those making less than 20,000 gallons a year.\n\nUnder current law, wineries larger than those can ship to a consumer only if the wine first passes through a distributor and a retailer. Some out-of-state wineries will go through these steps to ship wine to customers in Arizona. Others simply refuse to fill such orders.\n\nThe Arizona Wine Growers Association testified in favor of the bill. Two Arizona wineries, Page Springs Cellars and Arizona Stronghold, are close to exceeding the 20,000 gallon production cap. Others are close.\n\nThis bill would allow them to expand while still retaining the ability to ship directly to customers. Wineries, under the bill, would have to verify that purchasers are of legal age and that wine is paid for before it is shipped.\n\nThe measure had been sailing through the Legislature, but it stalled last week when it was held from a final House vote because a member wanted to amend it.\n\nThe amendment, offered by Rep. T.J. Shope, R-Coolidge, put restrictions on the amount of wine a resident could order each year. The original version of the bill set that limit at 12 cases per winery per year. The amendment phased that amount in over the next three years.\n\nBad feelings fermenting among some Arizona winemakers\n\nIn 2017, the limit would be six cases per winery per year; in 2018, that would rise to nine cases. In 2019, the limit would rise, and remain, at 12 cases per winery per year.\n\nThe amendment also added language that would require wineries to pay taxes on wine shipped and to post a bond to ensure they pay the proper amount of taxes. That bond requirement is waived for wineries that pay the proper amount for the preceding year.\n\nThe amended bill was sent back to the Senate on Wednesday. It passed the Senate on Thursday with only one no vote.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/24"}]}
