This will be the first state visit of the Biden-Harris administration,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during Monday’s press briefing.\n\nThe state visit, which will include a state dinner, “will underscore the deep and enduring relationship between the United States and France – our oldest ally,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\n“Our close relationship with France is founded on our shared democratic values, economic ties and defense and security cooperation. The leaders will discuss our continued close partnership on shared global challenges and areas of bilateral interest,” she added.\n\nBiden is holding his first state dinner more than halfway through his term in office – later than previous US presidents. Jean-Pierre acknowledged Monday that “Covid certainly has delayed many of the in-person events a president traditionally hosts at the White House,” but highlighted previous White House visits by world leaders earlier in Biden’s term.\n\nThe tradition of the White House state visit – which is typically a multi-day affair that entails formal ceremonies, meetings and a glitzy black tie dinner – has been dwindling.\n\nThe Trumps welcomed the Macrons for their administration’s first state dinner in 2018. Their second and final state visit took place in 2019, when the White House hosted then-Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Trumps were also slated to host the King and Queen of Spain in 2020 – an event that was postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic.\n\nMacron and Biden have spoken to one another several times since Biden took office in January 2021. Most recently, they met last week in New York as world leaders gathered for the United Nations General Assembly. The two discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine, Iran, the Indo-Pacific and challenges posed by China, according to the White House.\n\nBiden and Macron held their first formal meeting in June 2021 during the G7 Summit in England, walking away having relayed that they were on the same page. Macron heaped praise on Biden as being “part of the club” following a more fraught relationship with former US President Donald Trump.\n\nMacron, now in his second term, has emerged as the leading voice to advocate for the European Union. Since the warm G7 meeting, a number of global challenges have emerged, setting Macron up to distinguish himself on the world stage.\n\nA failed deal for France to produce nuclear-powered submarines for Australia caused a major international rift.\n\nIn September 2021, the French government recalled its ambassadors to the US and Australia for consultation in response to an announced national security partnership that would provide the US-produced submarines to Australia – abandoning a $90 billion existing deal with France to provide their submarines to the country.\n\nLater that fall, Biden admitted that his administration was “clumsy” in its handling of the deal, saying he was “under the impression that France had been informed long before that the deal was not going through.” And earlier this summer, France’s defense minister said the country aimed to rebuild its relationship with Australia.\n\nWestern leaders, including Biden and Macron, have broadly united in their opposition to combat Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine.\n\nFrance has also been a key player in negotiations to curb Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nPressed on Monday whether the decision to host France was about mending ties following some rifts earlier in Biden’s term, Jean-Pierre responded, “We deeply value our relationship with France. … We work closely with France on the full range of global challenges, as you all know, including the war in Ukraine. It is for these reasons that the President and first lady thought it was important to welcome this close and valued partner to the White House for their first state visit.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Jim Acosta", "Maegan Vazquez", "Jim Acosta"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/politics/biden-us-africa-leaders-summit/index.html", "title": "Biden welcomes African leaders for summit as China and Russia ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden welcomed nearly 50 leaders from Africa on Wednesday for a summit intended to reset Washington’s commitment to a region where China and Russia are also working to expand their influence.\n\n“When Africa succeeds, the United States succeeds. Quite frankly, the whole world succeeds as well,” Biden said during his first appearance at the multi-day US-Africa Leaders Summit, being held in Washington.\n\nThe gathering, coming nearly two years into Biden’s term, will focus on issues critical to the continent’s future, including climate change, public health and food security. Already, the administration has announced billions of dollars in economic aid and voiced support for a permanent seat at the Group of 20 for a representative from the African Union.\n\nIn his speech, Biden announced billions of dollars in new trade investments and an effort to help expand internet access on the continent, which the President said was necessary to boosting economic growth.\n\n“Improving Africa’s infrastructure is essential to our vision of building a stronger global economy that can better withstand the kinds of shocks that we’ve seen in the past few years,” Biden said during his remarks.\n\nLater this week, Biden is also expected to unveil plans to travel to the continent – he hasn’t visited Sub-Saharan Africa since taking office – and to appoint a new special representative for implementing the summit’s commitments.\n\nFollowing his speech Wednesday, Biden was hosting a small group of African leaders at the White House “for a discussion on upcoming presidential elections in 2023 in Africa and US support for free, fair and credible polls across the continent,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Monday, a sign of Biden’s focus on issues of democracy on the continent.\n\nFour nations’ leaders were excluded from the summit invite list following recent coups. But otherwise, all of the continents’ countries will be represented, including some with dire human rights records. The gathering is one of the largest collection of foreign leaders in Washington in recent years, and has led to traffic jams and tightened security for the dozens of motorcades and officials.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Biden will host the heads of delegation and their spouses for a dinner at the White House before kicking off Thursday’s program and closing the day “with a discussion on food security and food systems resilience” in Africa, which Sullivan said has been disproportionately affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe goal, according to senior administration officials, is to build more robust ties with African nations in the hopes of addressing the significant challenges the continent faces and to cultivate beneficial economic and security partnerships.\n\n“The United States is all in on Africa’s future,” Biden said in his speech.\n\nIt’s not the first time African leaders have heard a similar message from an American president. President Barack Obama held his own US-Africa Leaders Summit in 2014, complete with gala dinner under a tent on the White House South Lawn. He promised then to take action to help build more prosperity and security in Africa.\n\nBut his predecessor Donald Trump largely ignored Africa, never visiting the continent and even rudely disparaging certain African nations in a 2018 meeting as “shithole countries.”\n\nMeanwhile, other nations have made inroads on the continent. China has worked to grow trade relations with African nations and has developed major infrastructure projects there. Russia has expanded its military influence, including through mercenaries like the Wagner Group.\n\n“We see Russia continuing to peddle cheap weapons,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday at a summit session. “And also, we see Russia employing mercenaries across the continent, and that is destabilizing as well.”\n\nThose countries, along with the European Union and Turkey, have each held their own summits for African leaders in recent years.\n\nIn previewing this week’s US summit, American officials have been careful to avoid framing Africa as a pawn in a larger geopolitical strategy. Instead, they have sought to emphasize Biden’s interest in cultivating ties that would benefit both the US and Africa, and finding ways to harness the continent’s potential.\n\n“The Summit, just to take a step back, is rooted in the recognition that Africa is a key geopolitical player,” Sullivan said. “The continent will shape the future, not just of the African people, but also the world.”\n\nYet the creeping leverage that Beijing and Moscow have exerted in Africa is a source of growing concern in Washington, particularly amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some African nations have been wary of criticizing the invasion, even as they are burdened by its aftereffects, including global food shortages and high energy costs.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/12/01/joe-biden-emmanuel-macron-state-visit/10790838002/", "title": "Memorable moments from Emmanuel Macron's state visit to ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — When the French come calling, you aim to impress.\n\nWith pomp and pageantry, President Joe Biden welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, to the White House on Thursday for an official state visit and dinner — the first of Biden’s presidency.\n\nThe official reason for the French leader’s visit was to celebrate the historic bond between the two longtime allies and strategize about world affairs like Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\nBut the visit also comes after a diplomatic spat caused by a submarine partnership struck last year between the U.S., Australia, and Britain. The agreement cost the French its own submarine deal with the Aussies and dealt a serious blow to French national pride\n\nThat transatlantic tiff may not be forgotten, as far as the French are concerned, but Thursday was a day to focus on friendship and fraternité (brotherhood).\n\nHere are some memorable moments from Macron's visit:\n\nA 21-gun salute and a French kiss\n\nBiden and first lady Jill Biden strolled out of the White House and down a red carpet at 9:18 a.m. on the chilly, late-fall morning to await the arrival of the guests of honor. A minute later, the Macrons pulled up in a black stretch limo. The couples exchanged greetings — in true French fashion, Macron kissed Jill Biden on each cheek — and then the festivities began in earnest.\n\nThere was a military procession, a 21-gun salute, and a formal inspection of the troops. A band played “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the French national anthem, “La Marseillaise.” As the two world leaders waited to begin their remarks, the Army’s Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps — decked out in long red coats and white pants — paraded in front of the stage.\n\nAfterward, the presidents and their spouses headed to the Truman Balcony, where they waved to the crowd that had assembled on the South Lawn to watch the affair.\n\nThe war in Ukraine:Biden open to talks with Putin about ending Ukraine war as US, France show united front\n\nThe handshake(s)\n\nBody language can often reveal what people aren’t willing to say out loud. In this case, it just seemed to reinforce what Biden and Macron have said over and over again: They genuinely like each other.\n\nWhile Biden waited for his remarks to be translated into French, the two men clasped hands for several seconds. They shook hands again and shared a prolonged embrace after Macron finished speaking. Both times, a big smile stretched across the French leader’s face.\n\nThat’s a stark contrast to Macron’s awkward, white-knuckled handshake with former President Donald Trump at a NATO summit in Brussels in 2017. That handshake — which Macron reportedly practiced after watching videos of Trump’s technique — came across like a test of wills, with the French president seeming determined to demonstrate to the American president that he’d met his match in the transatlantic quest for dominance.\n\nGift exchange\n\nShowing up at a fancy affair empty-handed is très gauche (or as Americans would say, tacky). So naturally, the first families exchanged gifts.\n\nThe Bidens presented the Macrons with a custom mirror made of fallen wood from the White House grounds. The mirror, by an American furniture maker, is a reproduction of a looking glass from the White House collection that hangs in the West Wing.\n\nThe president gifted his French counterpart with a custom vinyl record collection of American musicians and an archival facsimile print of Thomas Edison’s 1877 Patent of the American Phonograph. Jill Biden gave Brigitte Macron a gold and emerald pendant necklace designed by a French-American designer.\n\nThe Macrons came bearing multiple gifts for their hosts, including a vinyl record and CD of the original soundtrack of director Claude Lelouch’s \"Un Homme et une femme,” the 1966 film the Bidens went to see on their first date.\n\nThe Bidens also got a cup from Christofle, a French manufacturer of fine silverware; a sweater from House St. James; and a watch from LIP Horlogerie. Jill Biden got copies of Gustave Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary” and Albert Camus’ “The Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, and Selected Essays.”\n\nFrench tiff:Macron, in Washington, slams Biden climate incentives as 'super aggressive' to French firms\n\nA constellation of guests\n\nThe Bidens and the Macrons weren’t the only big names at the state dinner. A constellation of stars from the world of politics, business, and entertainment scored an invitation to the glitzy soiree on the White House South Lawn.\n\nAmong the well-known attendees: Vice President Kamala Harris; actresses Jennifer Garner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Ariana DeBose; Apple CEO Tim Cook; cabinet secretaries Antony Blinken (secretary of state), Pete Buttigieg (transportation) and Lloyd Austin (defense); House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Republican who hopes to succeed her, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California; Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour; and musicians Jon Legend and Jon Batiste, who provided the night’s entertainment.\n\n\"It's going to be fire,\" Batiste promised reporters ahead of his performance.\n\nFrench fashion designer Christian Louboutin, who also made the cut, smiled when reporters asked how many of the night's guests might be wearing his fancy footwear.\n\n\"Let me check,\" he said.\n\nMoving on:Can U.S. and France move past tensions triggered by submarine deal? C'est possible.\n\nHaute cuisine, American style\n\nWhat do you feed the guests of honor when they happen to hail from the place that introduced the world to haute cuisine? If you’re the Bidens, you stuff them with American gastronomy.\n\nInside a heated pavilion on the South Lawn, more than 300 guests sat at a mix of square and rectangular tables with dark blue silk cloths, red candles, and arrangements of red, white and blue flowers, including white irises, the official flower of France.\n\nThey gorged on butter-poached Maine lobster, beef with shallot marmalade, and a selection of American cheeses. For dessert, there was orange chiffon cake with roasted pears — and in a nod to the French — crème fraiche ice cream.\n\n'Vive la France, and God bless America'\n\nIn the spirit of friendship, Biden and Macron saluted each other with a traditional toast of American sparkling wine.\n\nBiden noted that France was the United States' first ally and the first to fly an American flag after the Revolutionary War.\n\n“Vive la France, and God bless America,” he said, clinking glasses with the French leader.\n\nMacron stressed that the longtime relationship between the two countries “means a lot” to the French.\n\n“We come from the same values, principles,” he said, warning that those principles are now in jeopardy by people looking to reverse them.\n\nMichael Collins and Francesca Chambers cover the White House.

David Hoyle, the Dean of Westminster, at Westminster Abbey. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and Patricia Scotland, the Commonwealth Secretary General, read lessons. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby delivered a sermon. Toward the end of the service, the Last Post sounded before a two-minute silence was observed. The state funeral was brought to a conclusion by the Queen’s Piper, who played a Reveille, the National Anthem and a Lament.\n\nInvitations were sent over the weekend to the heads of state of countries with whom the United Kingdom has diplomatic relations. The list of leaders who attended the state funeral was long, and included leadership across the Commonwealth and around the world. Representatives of Syria, Russia, Belarus, Myanmar, Afghanistan and Venezuela were absent. For most nations with an invitation, attendance extended to the head of state plus a guest.\n\nFollowing Monday’s state funeral, the coffin will be conveyed from the hall to Wellington Arch before making its final journey out of London to Windsor. The Queen’s journey will end at St. George’s Chapel, within the grounds of Windsor Castle, where her coffin will be lowered into the Royal Vault below the chapel.\n\nBiden was one of the few world leaders to arrive in his own motorcade at the Queen’s funeral, but for the last 10 days, his aides have worked behind the scenes to ensure he had as small of a footprint as possible while she was laid to rest.\n\nA person familiar with the planning said the White House was very conscious about not making the trip about Biden, reviewing protocol closely in recent days as to avoid any missteps that could potentially distract from the funeral itself. Biden traveled with a smaller staff than is typical for an overseas visit, and his aides decided against scheduling even an informal meeting with Truss while in London.\n\nInstead, the only events on Biden’s schedule were those planned in coordination with the palace, the person said.\n\nMonday’s ceremonial events are the culmination of nearly two weeks of public arrangements, codenamed “Operation London Bridge.”\n\nPlans for the Queen’s funeral have been in place for years, allowing American advisers greater insight into precisely what will happen over the coming days as they make security arrangements. The White House said it received an invitation only for the President and first lady, making for a slimmed-down American footprint.\n\nSecurity in the British capital is at its highest level in memory as dozens of world leaders have convened over the weekend and into Monday to remember the late Queen, who met 13 sitting US presidents during her reign.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News last week, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said of the scale: “If you think about the London Marathon, the carnival, previous royal weddings, the Olympics – it’s all that in one.”\n\nBiden is scheduled to fly back to Washington on Monday afternoon after the funeral. During their brief visit to London, the President and first lady Jill Biden paid their respects to the Queen as she was lying in state, signed condolence books and attended a reception with other leaders and King Charles III.\n\nThe funeral takes place the same week world leaders are slated to convene for the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where Biden will hold his first bilateral meeting with Truss on Wednesday.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/french-president-state-dinner-white-house/index.html", "title": "The Bidens' first state dinner features butter-poached lobster with a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden hosted French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House on Thursday, using the very first state dinner of his presidency to shore up relations with a key American ally whose friendship has until recently been on the rocks.\n\nSources close to the planning described a super-sized event under a tent on the White House grounds, including not only the many Democrats clamoring for social time at the White House but also a number of officials and policy staffers interested in strengthening relations with France.\n\nIn his remarks celebrating ties between the two nations, Biden offered a toast to “the enduring alliance between France and United States,” calling the alliance “a partnership that’s marked by so many firsts.”\n\nThe two presidents raised glasses, with Biden saying, “Vive la France and God bless America.”\n\nThe moment takes on extra meaning because of how long the Bidens have waited to hold a state dinner – so long, in fact, that many Democrats worried they were squandering it as a valuable diplomatic tool.\n\nHear what Biden said about a potential meeting with Putin 02:29 - Source: CNN\n\nAdvisers to the president told CNN the dinner is part of the US effort to revitalize ties with France. It comes a year after the US announced a surprise US-Australia submarine partnership – upending France’s own submarine deal with Australia and infuriating French officials. The perilous relations are no small matter, given the array of major challenges facing the larger western alliance.\n\n“If you look at what’s going on in Ukraine, look at what’s going on in the Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China, France is really at the center of all those things,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications. “President Macron has been the dynamic leader inside the G7 … so the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits.”\n\nIn an early sign of that diplomacy, the Elysee confirmed to CNN on Thursday a series of gifts exchanged between the world leaders and their spouses.\n\nMacron gifted his US counterpart a centerpiece from French goldsmith and tableware house, Christofle, the Elysee said. The present, crafted in 2012, is a tribute to the French transatlantic liner, the “Normandie,” which sailed with a Christofle silverware collection in the interwar period, per the Elysee.\n\nBiden was also presented with a vinyl record and CD of the soundtrack of the film “A man and a woman,” directed by Frenchman Claude Lelouch. The Elysee described the gift as a “nod to the personal history of the Biden couple” as they watched the 1966 film during their first date. The film also won France’s highest film award, the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden received two French literary works: a copy of “Madame Bovary,” by Gustave Flaubert, as well as a collection of essays written by Albert Camus, per the Elysee.\n\nFinally, Biden received two gifts from the Elysee Palace gift shop, a watch from watchmaker LIP and a jumper from the French brand Saint James.\n\nButter-poached Maine lobster and calotte of beef, shallot marmalade, are seen at the White House during a media preview of the state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron. Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Sipa USA/AP\n\nThe dinner has domestic political overtones, as well. As the Bidens roll out the red carpet for Macron and his wife Brigitte, there’s word they have two more state dinners in the works along with several other social events to come. Several people with knowledge of White House planning and operations, who spoke to CNN for this story, confirmed this State Dinner will be one of several hosted by the Biden administration in upcoming months.\n\nIt may suggest, said those familiar with the thinking around future state dinners, Biden indeed wants to run for a second term, something he has said he intends to do, but a decision that also hinges on the consent and support of his wife and extended family.\n\n“These are intricate – and expensive – events,” said one of the people, who has worked in the White House, of state dinners. “If the administration is willing to sink budget dollars into them, there’s probably a larger strategy at play.”\n\nThe guest list for Biden’s first state dinner was big from the start, made extra-large to include all of the people who have missed out on key social time with the president due to Covid-19 restrictions. Having done the mental calculations months ago as planning began, said two people familiar with the dinner’s details, the East Wing, the West Wing, the State Department and the National Security Council’s lists ballooned.\n\nAmong those attending the state dinner were celebrities and musicians, as well as top lawmakers, according to a printout of guests from the White House. Stephen Colbert, Anna Wintour and John Legend were among the invitees to rub shoulders with the likes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nTwo guests of Macron – the head designers for fashion house Oscar de la Renta, Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia – confirmed to CNN that Jill Biden wore the luxury label at the dinner.\n\nGarcia said they collaborated with the first lady for about two months on the dress, getting her input on what she wanted for the look, which included “a sense of ease.”\n\nThis first State Dinner offered the opportunity to finally make amends to VIPs and diplomats, members of Congress and deep-pocketed donors. A decision was made to hold the dinner in a tent on the South Lawn, which would allow them to comfortably seat the more than 400 guests expected to attend. (The White House is referring to the tent as a “pavilion,” as it has clear panels on the sides.)\n\nAn indoor dinner in the State Dining Room is limited by space restrictions – only about 120 guests can be accommodated. The second and last Trump administration State Dinner, for Australia, was held in the Rose Garden, which could seat approximately 200 for a formal dinner.\n\n“We’ve always expected a larger guest list as it’s the first state dinner of the Biden Administration,” Vanessa Valdivia, Jill Biden’s press secretary, told CNN.\n\nA table is set during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe dinner for France was actually supposed to take place months prior, said the two people, but scheduling conflicts, including campaign trips for midterm elections, foreign travel and the wedding of Naomi Biden, meant the date was pushed back more than once. Thursday evening was ultimately where the schedules of several executive branch agencies landed with clear calendars.\n\nUnfortunately for the White House social offices and usher’s office, the final date also meant pulling off the ritual of holiday decorations and dozens of White House holiday parties in tandem with a debut State Dinner, something that has not been done before during a modern presidency. The White House calligraphers, kitchen staff, service teams and floral shop all worked to juggle the demands of overlapping, high-caliber events.\n\nAncillary kitchen space has been added with refrigeration units placed outside the White House kitchen area, as is usually the case for multiple or large social events, especially during the busy holiday party season where there can be as many as two or three receptions per day. (Three of the industrial-sized refrigerators outside earlier this week were labeled with the word “cheese,” in black magic marker – unclear whether for the French dinner, or holiday party nibbles.)\n\nFor the State Dinner, the Bidens have opted to use rental dishes, glasses, flatware, table accoutrements and linens. The venue, though on the White House grounds, does not allow for the official White House china services to be used for the dinner, said White House social secretary Carlos Elizondo. White House curators, who oversee the use of all items in the White House collection, do not count the temporarily installed tent as part of the campus – and thus the china of presidents’ past would not be part of the service.\n\nThe overall design and the floral arrangements were put together by an event planner, Jung Lee, and her company, Fete, a posh party design outfit favored by celebrities.\n\nA stage and dance floor was erected in the tent for the evening’s entertainment from singer Jon Batiste, a New Orleans native, a city Jill Biden said Wednesday is “shaped by both French and American culture.” The Macrons will visit New Orleans after Washington, before returning to France.\n\nWhite House Executive Chef Cris Comerford presents the menu during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe décor for the dinner was inspired by red, white and blue, the shared colors of the American and French flags, and “our common values: liberty and democracy, equality and fellowship,” said Biden at a preview of the table settings and menu.\n\nThe trick of a successful State Dinner format, says a former White House social secretary, is to seamlessly and organically combine elements from both the United States and the visiting country, an offering of hospitality on the side of a main course of diplomacy. But without being too hokey about it.\n\nThe flowers on the tables Thursday night were mostly roses; American Beauty varietals and Piano Roses, deep red blooms because, as Elizondo said, Emmanuel Macron likes the piano. French-made Champagne flutes were used for toasting, but filled with American sparkling wine. Tall candelabras holding blood-red candles are meant to mimic the Statue of Liberty, France’s gift to the United States. And so on.\n\nThe table setting is something the first lady has said is always her first consideration when hosting anyone for a meal, a memory from her childhood and her mother. “Even if we were only having fish sticks from the freezer, she always made our dinners feel special,” said Biden, who is expected to make remarks at the dinner.\n\n“The first lady has been involved since the beginning, it’s been important to her that the dinner reflects the warmth and approachable hospitality that the Bidens are known for,” Valdivia said.\n\nA person with knowledge of the first lady’s hands-on approach to the dinner said she was involved with all aspects of the planning, down to doing tastings of each dish and overseeing the seating chart, much like her immediate predecessor, Melania Trump, whose first state dinner also happened to be for the Macrons. Unlike the Trump dinner, the Bidens served caviar and butter-poached lobster for a first-course, Calotte of beef and watercress and sunchoke salad for the main. Trump went with goat cheese gateau with tomato jam, and a rack of lamb. Though the two dinners would share a dessert: crème fraiche ice cream.\n\nA table is set during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnother common thread with Biden’s immediate predecessor is the lack of a high number of state dinners by this time in his presidency. However, for much of it, Biden has not been able due to the pandemic to host parties. Trump had a third State Dinner in the works – for the King and Queen of Spain – but canceled it as the pandemic took hold around the world.\n\nBiden is also not as inclined socially to host big events at the White House, Covid-19 restrictions or not. The first couple has notably spent most weekends away from Washington in Delaware or Camp David, and as a closely bonded family, there are few occasions where guest lists for dinners expand beyond relatives.\n\nPrevious presidents have used the White House frequently to entertain, typically with a subtext, whether political or cultural. In recent history, Barack and Michelle Obama hosted birthday parties and music concerts, bringing together celebrities and politicians for fun-filled, late nights of elbow-rubbing and bonding. The Obamas’ State Dinner for then-French President Francois Hollande in 2014 brought a star-studded guest list that included Bradley Cooper, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Stephen Colbert and Elon Musk.\n\nSinger Mary J. Blige entertained at the dinner. By contrast, Trump’s two state dinners lacked bold-faced guests and headliners, as his political leanings were often antithetical from those of mainstream Hollywood. (For the Trump State Dinner for Macron, the Washington National Opera performed, which a guest told CNN was lovely, “but it wasn’t Beyonce.”)\n\nUS President Gerald Ford dances with Britain's Queen Elizabeth II during a state dinner in Washington, DC, in 1976.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images In pictures: White House state dinners Prev Next\n\nGoing back further, presidents accumulated State Dinners as a means to help soothe icy relationships, or build support on geopolitical crises.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, for example, continued to hold State Dinners during World War II, to pull in allies. Dwight Eisenhower in 1959 hosted Nikita Khrushchev, the first State Dinner for a Soviet leader, to help quell concerns of escalating nuclear tension. Jimmy Carter was not a big party guy – the State Dinners hosted by the president and Rosalyn Carter did not include hard liquor, just beer and wine – but he had held 33 State Dinners by this time in his tenure. After the signing of the Panama Canal treaties, Carter hosted one state dinner for 18 Latin American heads of state, according to data collected by the White House Historical Association.\n\nAs time went on, guest lists for the dinners routinely grew, observed by the orders for presidential china sets, which went from accommodating about 100 people, to the most recent official set for the Obamas, which accommodated 320 people. Biden, in other words, still has the time and the space to showcase the highest form of diplomacy this country can offer another world leader. And he intends to.\n\n“There are more being planned and in the works for the future,” said one of the people with knowledge of the larger Biden State Dinner strategy. “This is just the start.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/23/modi-indian-prime-ministers-state-visit/70343495007/", "title": "Modi: Five unusual moments from Indian prime minister's state visit", "text": "WASHINGTON – For nearly a decade, Narendra Modi wasn’t allowed to set foot in the United States.\n\nBut times, titles and political agendas change.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden welcomed Modi, the prime minister of India, to the White House on Thursday for a state visit filled with the kind of pomp and pageantry afforded only to the nation’s closest friends.\n\nStanding next to Modi on the White House South Lawn, Biden said he has long believed that the relationship between the United States and India will be “one of the defining relationships of the 21st century.”\n\nModi was denied a visa to enter the U.S. in 2005, when he was the chief minister of the Indian state of Gujarat, over accusations that he had failed to stop deadly riots against minority Muslims. But now that he’s the leader of the world’s largest democracy, the Biden administration has been embracing him more closely as it seeks to counter China’s global influence.\n\nGiven Modi’s history with the U.S., there were bound to be some unusual, and even awkward, moments during his state visit:\n\nPomp and pageantry:Here's why Democrats and Republicans welcome a visit from right-wing Indian PM Narendra Modi\n\nRed carpets and yellow yoga mats\n\nNot many state visits start with yoga.\n\nBut Modi not only walked the red carpet, he stretched out on a yellow yoga mat.\n\nModi, a yoga enthusiast, and roughly 1,000 other practitioners of the Hindu spiritual and aesthetic discipline demonstrated their technique on Wednesday, Day One of Modi’s four-day visit to the United States.\n\nThe 72-year-old grey-bearded prime minister took his place on a mat on the grassy North Lawn area outside the United Nations headquarters in New York. For the next half hour, he practiced breathing exercises, meditation, backbends and other poses.\n\n\"Namaste,\" he told the crowd before the exercises began.\n\nThe event was held in recognition of the International Day of Yoga, which Modi persuaded the U.N. to observe annually not long after he became India’s leader in 2014. This year’s event set a Guinness World Record for most nationalities – 135 – at a yoga session.\n\nModi’s message to his fellow yoga enthusiasts: \"Let's use the power of yoga, not only to be healthy, happy, but to be kind to ourselves and each other.”\n\nYoga diplomacy:Ahead of U.S. state visit, India's leader takes to his mat at the U.N.\n\nThe first lady and Modi take a field trip\n\nThe first couple of times the Bidens hosted a foreign dignitary for a state visit, Jill Biden arranged an outing with the leader’s spouse.\n\nShe took Brigitte Macron, wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, to the interactive Plant Word museum just a few blocks from the White House. Kim Keon Hee, wife of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, got a private tour of the National Gallery of Art.\n\nBut Modi’s spouse didn’t accompany him on the trip to Washington. What’s more, Joe Biden wasn’t in town for Modi’s arrival on Wednesday. He was traveling back to Washington from California, where he had been raising money for his reelection campaign.\n\nSo the first lady and the prime minister took a quick field trip to National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside Washington, to highlight workforce training programs.\n\nModi, who arrived late, missed a demonstration of a robot creating abstract art on paper and another showing how an underwater robot can be used to aid fishing. But in brief remarks, he said his government has established labs in schools to encourage young entrepreneurs.\n\nHis goal, he said, is to make this decade a “tech decade.”\n\nA plant-based feast\n\nThe night before the official state dinner, the Bidens hosted Modi for a private dinner at the White House, where they dined on a few of the president’s favorite foods, including pasta and ice cream.\n\nThe menu for the official state dinner on Thursday catered to Modi’s palate.\n\nModi is a vegetarian, so the 400 invited guests were served an entirely plant-based meal: A salad of marinated millet. Corn and compressed watermelon. Stuffed portobello mushrooms and saffron risotto. Strawberry shortcake infused with rose and cardamom.\n\nThe first lady enlisted the help of chef Nina Curtis, who specializes in plant-based cooking, to work with White House chefs to come up with the menu.\n\nGuests were given the option of adding fish to the main course.\n\nModi (finally) meets the press\n\nIt’s not unusual for Biden to hold a joint news conference with foreign leaders when they visit the White House.\n\nBut when Modi took the dais in the White House East Room on Thursday for a Q&A with Biden, it was a remarkable turn of events.\n\nModi, who tries to avoid unscripted moments and has presided over a steady decline in press freedom in his country, has never held a solo news conference and often avoids questions by deferring to others on stage with him.\n\nBiden and Modi each answered two questions – one from an Indian journalist who asked Modi about climate change, the other from a Wall Street Journal reporter who pressed him on human rights concerns. It was the first time Modi had fielded a question at a news conference since he came to power in 2014.\n\nThe news conference was a scaled-down affair compared with those usually held as part of a state visit. Even so, Modi’s advisers were far from thrilled with the idea. Administration officials advised his team that taking questions from the media was standard protocol for White House state visits.\n\nModi’s people finally relented and agreed to the news conference – but not until the day it was to be held.\n\n'No space for discrimination':India's leader claims government doesn't have a human rights problem\n\n'No space for discrimination' in India\n\nModi’s state visit infuriated human rights advocates who blame him for widespread attacks against India’s Muslims and other minorities.\n\nBiden’s administration has accused India’s government of participating in unlawful and arbitrary killings, restricting freedom of speech and allowing violence against religious, racial and ethnic minorities. A group of more than 70 lawmakers asked Biden in a letter Tuesday to raise the human rights concerns during Modi’s visit.\n\nBut during his joint news conference with Biden, Modi insisted there was no discrimination in India and argued that democracy is in India’s DNA.\n\n“Democracy is our spirit, democracy runs in our veins – we live democracy,” he said, speaking through an interpreter.\n\n“There's absolutely no space for discrimination,\" he insisted, which must have been news to his detractors.\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers and The Associated Press\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

Biden also clarified that Putin has not done so yet.\n\n“He’s just miscalculated across the board,” Biden said of Putin following his bilateral meeting in the Oval Office with the French president. “And so the question is … how does he get himself out of the circumstances in? I’m prepared, if he’s willing to talk, to find out what he’s willing to do, but I’ll only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. I’m not going to do it on my own.”\n\nMacron said that once Ukraine sets conditions for a peace agreement, he’s willing to speak with Putin. The French leader told ABC’s “Good Morning America” earlier Thursday that he intends to speak with the Russian president in the coming days.\n\nFirm US support, Macron also relayed, “is very important, not just for the Ukrainians … but for the stability of our world today. Because if we consider that we can abandon the country and abandon the full respect of these principles, it means that there is no possible stability in this world,” pledging France’s own increased military, economic, and humanitarian support.\n\nThe French president’s trip to the White House alongside his spouse, Brigitte Macron, marks their second time as the guests of honor for a state visit, having first done so during Donald Trump’s administration in 2018. Thursday’s agenda for Biden’s first state visit since taking office has been filled with formal fanfare, with a list of events intended to highlight the strength of the critical relationship between the US and its oldest ally.\n\nAt the start of the news conference, Biden called the US and France the “strongest partners and our most capable allies,” taking care to note that “Emmanuel has also become a friend, as well as President of that great country.”\n\nIn his opening remarks, Macron praised Biden for fulfilling campaign commitments linked to addressing international challenges, saying “we’re being able to re-engage with you.”\n\n“I can only tell you once again how pleased we were with your choices that very much matched your history and your campaign commitments. The fact that you’re back on international challenges such as health and climate – it is really a New Deal,” the French leader said.\n\nEarlier Thursday morning, the Macrons had stepped onto the South Lawn of the White House for an official arrival ceremony, where a long slate of top French and US officials as well as thousands of other attendees greeted them. The pomp-filled program included military honors, a 21-gun salute, both countries’ national anthems, a review of troops and remarks by both leaders.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Biden referred to the Macrons as “close friends,” remarking that it is a “genuine honor to host you for the first state visit of my administration and to celebrate the current strength and vitality between France and the United States of America.”\n\nFrance, Biden said, is the United States’ “oldest ally” and an “unwavering partner,” referencing the history of the relationship from Lafayette to the beaches of Normandy. He said the alliance will “grow stronger for decades to come.”\n\nMacron referenced common values of the US and France, referring to the nations as “sisters in the fight for freedom” and calling for their countries “to become brothers in arms once more” in the midst of Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Macrons’ return for another state visit also follows a dramatic bounce-back in US-French relations compared to just a year ago, when Macron took the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multi-billion dollar defense contract. The rift appears to largely be behind them, and Biden and Macron have deepened their ties even more over the last year in their united efforts to combat the war on Ukraine.\n\nElysée announced that Macron gave the president four gifts: a vinyl and CD of the soundtrack to the film the first couple saw on their first date – “Un Homme et une Femme”, a cup from the house Christofle symbolizing links between France and the US, a sweater from the House Saint James and a watch from LIP Horlogerie. He also gave the first lady copies of “Madame Bovary” and “The Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, and Selected Essays.” He gifted Vice President Kamala Harris a model of the Ariane 5 rocket – a reference to common interests on space shared by the US and France.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden and White House staff present the menu during a media preview ahead of the state dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe American president and first lady presented a custom mirror made of fallen wood from the White House grounds that’s a reproduction of a mirror that hangs in the West Wing, according to the White House. Additionally, the French president was gifted a custom vinyl collection of great American musicians along with “an archival facsimile print of Thomas Edison’s 1877 Patent of the American Phonograph,” the White House said. And the first lady gifted Mrs. Macron a pendant necklace designed by a French-American designer.\n\nAfter the official arrival ceremony at the White House, Biden and Macron began bilateral discussions for an Oval Office meeting which lasted just under three hours. Kicking off the meeting, Biden reiterated the importance of the alliance.\n\n“Things are changing rapidly, really rapidly. And it’s really important we stay in close communication. Doesn’t mean that every single solitary thing we agree on. That does mean we agree on almost everything,” he said, adding that they would work toward strengthening “security and prosperity.”\n\nMacron said the Russian invasion in Ukraine will be one of their main topics of discussion and that “sustainable peace” is about respecting sovereign nations.\n\n“We want to build peace and a sustainable peace means full respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine but at the same time a new architecture to make sure we have a sustainable peace in the long run,” Macron added.\n\nUS and French officials had not expected the visit to yield any major deliverables, but both sides see it as an opportunity for the two countries to deepen their partnership on a slew of global challenges. The two sides expected to advance working group discussions that were launched in the wake of last year’s submarine affair to step up cooperation on space, cyberspace and energy issues.\n\nIn a joint statement following their meeting, the two leaders “outlined a shared vision to strengthen security and increase prosperity worldwide, combat climate change, build greater resilience to its effects, and advance democratic values.”\n\nOf particular note, the two leaders wrote they “strongly condemn Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and stress that intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.”\n\nOn the Indo-Pacific, the two leaders pledge to “continue to coordinate on our concerns regarding China’s challenge to the rules-based international order, including respect for human rights, and to work together with China on important global issues like climate change.”\n\nThere are areas of disagreement that were expected to come up.\n\nOne of the biggest points of tension will be over billions of dollars in electric vehicle subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which applies only to those manufactured in North America. Macron has slammed the measure as protectionist and French officials said he intends to raise the issue in meetings with Biden and congressional leaders. During Thursday’s news conference, Biden confirmed that they discussed the matter in detail.\n\nHe said the US makes “no apologies” for the Inflation Reduction Act, but he admitted there were “some glitches” and changes that may need to be made to the law.\n\nMacron agreed with Biden and reiterated his belief that they’re going to “resynchronize” and said he was not searching for an exemption for his economy but to “discuss the consequences of this legislation.”\n\nIn their joint statement, the US and France said they “reaffirm their shared goal of accelerating the global green energy transition. They look forward to the work of the U.S.-EU Taskforce on the Inflation Reduction Act to further strengthen the U.S.-EU partnership on clean energy and climate through mutually beneficial ways.”\n\nFollowing their morning at the White House, Jill Biden and Brigitte Macron also visited Planet Word, a language-focused museum in Washington. President Macron also attended a lunch at the US State Department.\n\nThursday evening, the Macrons returned to the White House for the first state dinner of the Biden administration. French guests include film director Claude Lelouch, Louvre Museum Director Laurence des Cars and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, according to the French official.\n\nA White House list of state dinner attendees also included comedian Stephen Colbert, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, fashion designer Christian Louboutin, Laurene Powell Jobs, ABC’s Robin Roberts, musician John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, Vogue’s Anna Wintour, film director Baz Luhrmann, as well as actresses Jennifer Garner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Ariana DeBose. Biden family members, Cabinet members, politicians and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle – including Republicans Steve Scalise and Kevin McCarthy – were also on the list of attendees.

Some 54,246 Americans were killed in the conflict.\n\nThe Bidens and their guests strolled quietly through the memorial, which features 7-foot stainless steel statues of soldiers standing in patches of juniper bushes and polished granite strips symbolizing the rice paddies of Korea. They made no public remarks, but Yoon spoke of the visit during the White House arrival ceremony the next day.\n\n“Why did they sacrifice their lives for this faraway country and for the people they never met?” he asked of the Americans killed in the war. “That was for one noble cause: to defend freedom.”\n\nShow of force:US-South Korea military drills begin after North Korea submarine missile tests\n\nGifts for the South Korean guests\n\nWhen there’s a state visit, there are usually gifts.\n\nThe Bidens presented the South Koreans with a small, handcrafted table by an American furniture maker. Made of mahogany wood and inlaid with historical White House wood, the table was inspired by traditional Korean soban tables. The gift included a vase filled with handmade paper hibiscus and rose flowers by a Korean American artist and a brass plaque to commemorate the state visit.\n\nBiden also gave Yoon a shadow box set with custom and vintage baseball memorabilia.

In exchange, Yoon reaffirmed his nation's commitment that it would not develop its own nuclear weapons.\n\nThe so-called Washington Declaration is the centerpiece of the new initiatives on cybersecurity, economic investments and more that the leaders rolled out during Yoon’s visit.\n\nA State Dinner with South Korean flair\n\nThe main event for every state visit is the dinner, the most coveted diplomatic honor – and one reserved for the U.S.'s closest allies.\n\nNaturally, this one had a decidedly Korean flair.\n\nSome 200 invited guests walked by a screen evoking traditional Korean ink brush painting. Dining tables were decked out with 6-foot-tall centerpieces of blossoming cherry tree boughs intended to suggest Washington's Tidal Basin in the springtime or the streets of Jeju. The menu featured braised beef short ribs – an American take on galbi-jjim – served with butter bean grits, sorghum-glazed carrots and pine nuts.\n\nAt the start of the soirée, Biden and Yoon toasted each other. Biden raised a glass \"to our partnership, to our people, to possibilities\" and added, \"May we do it together for another 170 years.\"\n\nYoon brought a smile to Biden's face by paying homage to his Irish roots. Speaking through an interpreter, Yoon quoted an old Irish saying that goes: \"A good friend is like a four-leaf clover. Hard to find and lucky to have.\"\n\nRecord launch:North Korea has launched at least 84 missiles in 2022, more than in any other year\n\nBroadway tunes and 'American Pie'\n\nBroadway performers provided the evening’s entertainment, but Yoon stole the show with an impromptu rendition of “American Pie.”\n\nSingers Lea Salonga, Jessica Vosk and Norm Lewis closed out the dinner with a selection of numbers from Broadway hit shows, including “Funny Girl” and “Les Misérables.\" For their encore, they chose the Don McLean classic “American Pie” especially for Yoon.\n\nWhen they finished, Jill Biden pushed Yoon onto the stage. “We know this is one of your favorite songs,” Joe Biden said.\n\nYoon, still speaking through a translator, confirmed that the song was one of his favorites when he was in school. After a bit of coaxing from Biden, Yoon took the microphone and belted out the first few stanzas – in English. The crowd gave him a standing ovation.\n\nBiden, who said he had no idea Yoon could sing, joked that he was going to tap the South Korean crooner to provide the entertainment for the next state dinner. Then, he surprised Yoon with another gift: A guitar signed by McLean.\n\nWho scored a coveted dinner invitation?\n\nThe Bidens and the guests of honor weren’t the evening's only big names. Prominent figures from the world of politics, business and entertainment scored an invitation to the state dinner.\n\nActress Angelina Jolie, decked out in a white dress, brought her son Maddox. Broadway performer Salonga, one of the night’s entertainers, admitted to being nervous but said the experience “feels like being in a fairytale.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre twirled for the photographers as she made her entrance. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York showed up in a navy suit instead of the usual formal attire. \"This is as tux-ey as I get,\" he said.\n\nSnowboarder Chloe Kim, an Olympic gold medalist, didn’t wear her medal. “I don’t know where it is,” she admitted. She was nervous, she said, but was looking forward to the dinner. \"The food's gonna be really good,” she predicted.\n\nThe dinner came a day after Biden announced his reelection bid, adding to the buzz around the dinner for his Democratic guests.\n\nMichael Purzycki, the mayor of Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, offered to assist with campaigning, \"Any way he wants me to.\"\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

And the Pacific islands are a critical voice in shaping that future. And that’s why my administration has made it a priority to strengthen our partnership with your countries.”\n\nLater Thursday, Biden will host the Pacific leaders for dinner at the White House and participate in an official family photo. A senior administration official told foreign pool reporters who cover the White House that the leaders will also on Thursday meet with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of Congress, as well as business groups at the US Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe summit kicked off on Wednesday when Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed leaders at the State Department and took part in events with several senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Gina Raimondo and Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.\n\nWhile other presidents in the past have held summits with Pacific nations and the US, all Pacific Island countries have been invited to Washington for Biden’s summit. Leaders or representatives will be present from the Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Nauru and Vanuatu. Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General are attending as observers.\n\nOn Wednesday, amid a broad set of announcements about new commitments to the Pacific region, the White House said that “the United States has directly provided over $1.5 billion to support the Pacific Islands over the past decade and today has announced over $810 million in additional expanded programs.” The US will also recognize the Cook Islands and Niue.\n\nThe White House unveiled a nine-point declaration outlining the commitments, which focus on: supporting the US-Pacific partnership, building American capacity in the region, coordinating with allies and partners, climate, the economy, security and maritime cooperation, cyber security and connectivity, Covid-19 and health security and addressing war legacies.\n\nThe administration released a US-Pacific Island Strategy for the first time on Wednesday – a plan meant to complement the earlier release of the Indo-Pacific strategy.\n\nNotably, the strategy includes efforts to expand US diplomatic missions in the Pacific and commits to deploying additional personnel across the region. The strategy would also establish the first US envoy to the Pacific Island Forum and make several climate commitments, increasing the presence of Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Department of Defense in the area.\n\n“The purpose of this document is to make it obviously consistent with the goals and objectives of our larger framing. But this is specifically aimed at the concerns and the objectives in the Pacific as a whole,” a senior administration official previewing the summit said.\n\nThat official said that the summit is meant to address the most “daunting challenges of the Pacific” including on climate change, health concerns, education training, jobs, challenges associated with recovery from Covid-19 and overfishing. The White House has worked closely in the last months with Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Great Britain and others on these issues, the official added.\n\nThe Marshall Islands earlier this month suspended talks to renew its security partnership with the US, citing the longstanding impact of US nuclear testing in the area some 70 years ago.\n\nThe declaration unveiled on Thursday indicates that the US is “exploring (unexploded ordnance) assistance options for Kiribati and the Marshall Islands in late 2022 and maintains a Quick Reaction Force to support (unexploded ordnance) engagements across the Pacific at the request of host nation partners.”\n\nChina has been expanding its ties to countries in the Pacific Ocean in recent years, and Beijing signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands in April, promising cooperation in trade and education.\n\nNations including the US and Australia expressed concerns following the announcement, and the Chinese government has denied that the country will set up a military base on the Solomon Islands.\n\nDespite earlier reports suggesting the Solomon Islands would not sign onto the declaration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that the leaders involved in the summit have come “come together around a declaration of partnership between the US and the Pacific, one that shows that we have a shared vision for the future and a determination to build that future together.”\n\n“So I’m very pleased that we have this today, that we’ve agreed on it, and it will give us a road map for the work that we’re doing in the future,” he added.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/17/politics/white-house-easter-egg-roll-party-normalcy/index.html", "title": "The White House finally gets to throw a party | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nOn Monday the White House will become something it has yet to become while Joe and Jill Biden have been in residence: A party house.\n\nAt 6:45 a.m. ET, the first of what will ultimately be an anticipated 30,000 guests, who won tickets via a public lottery, will pour through the south gates and onto the lawn for the 142nd White House Easter Egg Roll.\n\n“Joe and I look forward to welcoming thousands of families to join us for this year’s White House Easter ‘EGGucation’ Roll!” the first lady tweeted Friday.\n\n“The Bidens are excited to open the People’s House back to the American people, after being closed to the general public because of the pandemic,” Jill Biden’s communications director, Elizabeth Alexander, told CNN, adding that preparation for the Easter Egg Roll has been months in the planning. The first lady chose the theme of “EGGucation,” a riff on her decades spent as a teacher.\n\n“The President and first lady will give remarks and kick off the egg rolling for the kids,” said Alexander, who added that Jill Biden will also read to kids at the Easter Egg Roll’s outdoor reading nook.\n\nThe day’s festivities are further evidence that life at the White House is slowly returning to a pre-pandemic version of normal, something that the Bidens have yet to experience.\n\nOn Friday, a limited schedule of White House tours resumed for the public, with tickets arranged via the visitors’ Congressional representative, and last weekend saw the return of the Spring White House Garden tours, which saw almost 30,000 ticketed members of the public over the two-day period. A White House official told CNN that, barring any significant shift in Covid-19 spikes or rising cases regionally or nationally, the hope is to build the tour schedules back up to a pre-pandemic norm of several days a week.\n\nA quieter White House\n\nBy this juncture in an administration, the White House has typically hosted two Easter Egg Rolls, a large Halloween trick-or-treat party, several significant dinners or luncheons for dignitaries, members of Congress, or other VIP leaders, as well as at least one State Dinner.\n\nDue to Covid-19, the Biden White House has been quiet.\n\n“We have worked hard over the past year to bring the White House to the American public through a variety of interactive and creative ways, on as many digital platforms as possible,” says Wayne Skinner, director of the White House Visitors Office. “But nothing can replace experiencing the history and the magic of the White House in person.”\n\nIt is Skinner’s team who has overseen and implemented the planning of the Easter Egg Roll, which is customary for the Visitors Office.\n\nThe basement-level floral workshop, run by chief White House floral designer Hediah “Roshan” Ghaffarian – who was hired by Michelle Obama in 2015 – has generally focused on day-to-day needs, such as keeping arrangements in many of the White House’s public and private room freshly rotated, says one person familiar with the operations.\n\nThe White House cooking team has also had a relative break from the mad hustle of preparing and serving hundreds of hot dinners for some of the most important guests in the world. The Chocolate Shop, one of several White House kitchens, is tasked with making and prepping the major centerpieces used when the President and first lady entertain.\n\n“It’s never ‘slow-slow,’ with nothing to do,” said a former White House official who worked closely with the White House staff and chief usher for several years to plan and oversee social events.\n\n“These are professionals who every day make food and desserts and snacks and buffets – anything that is needed. But there is a profound loss in the use of their skills, that there has not yet been entertaining needs that rise to the level of their talents,” says the person.\n\nPlans for a state dinner underway\n\nCNN has learned the plans for the first state dinner of the Biden administration are indeed underway, though it is unclear for which world leader the dinner will occur.\n\nThe former official familiar with the social activities of the White House adds a second state dinner is likely to follow quickly on the heels of the first. Alexander would not confirm the details of any upcoming state dinners, or their specific planning status, but she did say the Easter Egg Roll likely marks a jumping-off point for the resumption of such events.\n\n“The first family is looking forward to continuing to share the White House – with state dinners, celebrations, by commemorating parts of history that are coming up – events they haven’t been able to host because of the seriousness of the pandemic,” she said.\n\nStewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association – the non-profit, non-partisan organization established in 1961 by Jacqueline Kennedy to assist in the preservation and legacy of the White House – told CNN state dinners are much more than fancy dinner parties attended by celebrities and titans of industry.\n\n“State dinners often set the scene for much of the diplomatic work that an administration is trying to accomplish; they are strategic in the country that is hosted, right down to who is sitting next who in order to advance a dialogue about a certain topic,” said McLaurin.\n\nAs the global balance of power becomes more fragile, the lack of Biden state dinners, while not a crisis, have hamstrung the social, diplomatic dance done for decades behind the scenes at the White House.\n\n‘A sense of joy’\n\nHowever, McLaurin heralds the Easter Egg Roll, which is funded in full by the White House Historical Association, as a return to party normalcy.\n\n“As in regular years, the ceremonial wooden eggs – with colors selected by the first lady – are ready to go,” he said of the annual, signature eggs, which are individually hand-tooled each year by a company in Maine.\n\nHundreds of boxed sets of the commemorative eggs are sold ahead of the Easter Egg Roll by the White House Historical Association, with that money put towards the roll itself, as well as the organization’s myriad of educational programs, books and other outlets for preservation and public interest of the White House.\n\nLast year, although the Easter Egg Roll was canceled, there were wooden eggs made, but the bunny drawn on the side donned a surgical mask to mark the ongoing pandemic. This year’s eggs feature the Biden’s new pets – Willow the cat and Commander the German Shepherd puppy.\n\nThere is also a new egg color, “Biden Blue,” a rich, royal blue chosen by the first lady.\n\nFifty thousand real, hard-boiled eggs have also been prepped and readied for the stalwart egg activity: The race of kids holding an egg on a wooden spoon, with the hopes they can run fast and not drop and break their eggs. The former White House official familiar with social activities notes clean-up of the real eggs post-Egg Roll is thorough and imperative, or else the pungent smell of fetid eggs fills the air on the South Lawn.\n\nLike Biden, McLaurin says he is most excited to see the children who attend the Easter Egg Roll, and to watch their faces fill with fascination at being in the backyard of the house of the President.\n\n“A member of our board of directors, who is a native Washingtonian, said that as a child, his father used to come and sit outside the north gate of the White House the morning of the Easter Egg Roll, because adults in Washington wanted to go, but you had to have a kid to get in,” said McLaurin, recounting one of his favorite Easter Egg Roll fun facts. “These kids would rent themselves out to childless adults to go into the Egg Roll.”\n\nThere remains a healthy dose of hesitancy over whether the country is fully in the clear from the ravages of Covid-19, and the White House Visitors Office continues to monitor the latest guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and health officials, as well as regional case numbers. But continuing a tradition that has only been interrupted a handful of times since its inception in 1878 is worth the spilling of a few eggs and the chance to sip lemonade and eat snacks in the shadow of history.\n\nOnly one mystery remains: Alexander would not reveal the identity of which staff member will don the bunny suit and play the role of official White House Easter Bunny, a tradition that began with a staffer from Patricia Nixon’s East Wing.\n\n“There is a sense of joy to be able to share the White House again,” Alexander said.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/04/17"}]}

But thawing relations will ...", "text": "The setting: Alaska. The date: March 2021. The purpose: cooperation. The Biden administration was barely into its second month. These were the first high-level talks with China. Yet the tone was hostile.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken − who is visiting China on Sunday and Monday after a planned trip in February was abruptly canceled − said in blunt opening remarks as he glanced across the table in Anchorage to Yang Jiechi, a senior Chinese foreign policy official, that the U.S. aimed to \"discuss our deep concerns with actions by China.\" He then ticked off those concerns: Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyberattacks, economic coercion of U.S. allies. \"Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability,\" he said.\n\nYang shot back: \"The wars in this world are launched by some other countries,\" he argued, referring to the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. \"But for China, what we have asked for, for other countries, is to follow a path of peaceful development, and this is the purpose of our foreign policy.\"\n\nHe then settled into his theme. \"Many people within the United States actually have little confidence in the democracy of the United States,\" Yang said, adding that Black Americans were being \"slaughtered\" on U.S. streets. Washington had, in his view, no right to lecture China about human rights.\n\nGot an image problem?Buy a sports team or invest in a league like PGA-LIV. These Arab countries did\n\nAmerica's top diplomat Antony Blinken goes to China\n\nBlinken's trip to China marks the first visit to the country for a U.S. secretary of state in five years.\n\nSince that somewhat undiplomatic 2021 exchange between diplomats in Alaska, the U.S.-China relationship has continued to be dogged by tensions.\n\nThe U.S. shot down a weather ballon in February − the incident that nixed Blinken's trip that month − that the Biden Administration characterized as “part of a larger Chinese surveillance-balloon program.\" Last week, the White House confirmed that U.S. intelligence has been aware, since 2019, of a China spying base in Cuba. There have been tense encounters between American and Chinese navies in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\nWashington and Beijing have also feuded about the popular video-sharing app, TikTok, which is owned by China; the U.S. sees it as a security threat because of the potential to expose sensitive information about American users and the American government. And several U.S. states are weighing legislation that would ban Chinese citizens from buying U.S. real estate and companies, a move critics say could be discriminatory.\n\n\"We’re coming to Beijing with a realistic, confident approach and a sincere desire to manage our competition the most responsible way possible. We do hope at a minimum that we will achieve that goal, and we also do hope of course to make progress on a number of concrete issues,” Daniel Kritenbrink, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told reporters before Blinken's trip. \"It would be wise not to have expectations of a long list of deliverables because that’s not where we are, I think, in the bilateral relationship.\"\n\nIn one sign of how strained U.S.-China relations have gotten in recent years, though the COVID pandemic has also played a role, there are just 350 American students studying in China, down from 15,000 a decade ago, according to State Department figures. About 300,000 Chinese nationals are enrolled in higher education courses at U.S. colleges and China remains the top source of international students in the U.S., but these numbers too have been falling sharply in recent years, according to U.S. Embassy and Consulate figures.\n\nWhat's it going to take to improve U.S.-China relations?\n\nYet some American and Chinese experts, and at least one official, say that more, not less, civilian-to-civilian contact in the form of student exchanges, cultural link-ups and business cooperation is precisely what's needed to put relations between the two economic, technological and military superpowers on a better footing, and for them to thrive − not just relatively brief high-level contact between diplomats.\n\nYoung people from the U.S. and China “need to have a familiarity with each other,” Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China, said in an NBC interview last month in Beijing during an event aimed at students.\n\n“You want the two countries’ people to be talking to each other, and 20-year-olds probably do that best,” he said. “They achieve a degree of familiarity and expertise in a country that is lifelong.”\n\nWang Huiyao, a senior adviser to China's former Vice Premier Liu He who is also the director of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing tank think, said that both countries need to encourage more \"think tank visits, more people visits, more flights, to issue more visas, to socialize more − this will help change the mood.\"\n\nLyle Goldstein, runs the Asia program at Defense Priorities, a Washington think tank, agrees.\n\n\"U.S.-China trade continues to set records and a lot of Americans benefit from this,\" he said. \"Farmers in the Midwest are huge beneficiaries of Chinese demand for soybeans. China is hungry for resources and they know Americans deliver quality and efficiency. Americans continue to be technological leaders. Our universities are the top in the world. We need to work collaboratively. A lot of the discussion about decoupling has gone way too far.\"\n\nGoldstein recently returned from a trip to China in April, one of numerous over the course of his career.\n\nAn an expert in China's military, he said that while Beijing has been \"sobered a bit\" by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China's military is \"more or less ready (militarily) to (invade Taiwan) and waiting for the order.\"\n\nBiden has said the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion of the territory that Beijing views as part of China but which has been governed independently since 1949.\n\nBut Goldstein said that because that order has not yet come (and may never materialize), Blinken should use his trip to China to focus on areas where the U.S. and China can work together and overcome their differences: \"Engagement doesn't solve all problems. It's not going to turn China into a Jeffersonian democracy. But it can take the edges off (tensions) and hopefully help avoid a cataclysmic and catastrophic war.\"\n\nCan one country do the diplomatic tango?\n\nSome of this cooperation may be starting to ramp up.\n\nOn Friday, Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates became the latest high-profile American business leader to visit China since its border reopened after the pandemic. Elon Musk (Tesla and Twitter), Jamie Dimon (J.P. Morgan) and Tim Cook (Apple) have all travelled to the country this year for meetings with senior Chinese officials.\n\nThe U.S. and China have resumed formal talks about battling the climate emergency.\n\nLast month, President Joe Biden alluded to an imminent \"thaw\" in U.S.-China relations, though it now seems apparent he was likely referring to Blinken's visit, not substantive alterations to facts on the ground.\n\n\"The U.S., more than any other country I know, is a place where foreign affairs are undertaken by the people in various ways. This is nongovernment organizations, its business, media, universities and so forth,\" said Robert Sutter, a professor of international affairs and expert on U.S.-China relations at George Washington University.\n\n\"And they all have their own actions in foreign policy and the government doesn't control them. Democracies are inherently like this, of course, but the U.S. is sort of extreme in this regard. It's a feature of American history.\"\n\nHowever, Sutter said these dealings \"take two to tango.\"\n\nHe did not think China, which \"really controls its foreign policy,\" operated in the same way. \"They control and condition their people. So we have an issue here of trying to sustain these people-to-people contacts.\"\n\nWang, the adviser to China's former premier, raised another point.\n\n\"This moment (Blinken's trip) should have come when Biden won the election. Now the window seems pretty short to stabilize the relationship before the next U.S. election campaign and China-bashing heats up.\"\n\nMore:Suspected Chinese spies, disguised as tourists, tried to infiltrate Alaskan military bases", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/03/spy-balloon-china-civilian-airship-updates-reaction/11177611002/", "title": "Blinken postpones China trip amid spy balloon row; US officials ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed an imminent trip to China because a Chinese surveillance balloon drifting over the U.S. is a \"clear violation\" of sovereignty and international law, Biden administration officials said Friday.\n\nBlinken will reschedule the trip when conditions are right, officials said.\n\nAlthough the trip had not been officially announced, Blinken had been set to leave Friday night, a day after the Pentagon announced it had spotted what it identified as a spy balloon flying over the U.S.\n\nChina disputed that characterization, calling it a “civilian airship” that blew off course.\n\nLater Friday, the Pentagon acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America. \"We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,” Brig.

The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other issues.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction.\n\nAfter a three-hour meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in November, President Joe Biden said both countries share a responsibility to \"manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever to near conflict, and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation.\"\n\nXi responded that the world \"expects that China and the United States will properly handle the relationship.\"\n\nMaintaining a dialogue\n\nBlinken was set to travel to China as an outgrowth of Biden’s meeting with Xi.\n\nBoth leaders had agreed to get their teams together to try to restore some of the lines of communication. Beijing had suspended or canceled eight official military dialogues and cooperation channels with the U.S. after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., visited Taiwan in August.\n\nLast month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with her Chinese counterpart in Switzerland to work on repairing relations.\n\nBut senior State Department officials said it wouldn’t have been constructive for Blinken to go to China right now.

Today I feel a migrant worker,” FIFA chief Gianni Infantino said in a fiery tirade on Saturday, comparing his own plight as a redhead son of migrants to that of marginalized communities.\n\nHis ostensible empathy with Qatar was due to the barrage of criticism the nation has faced in Western media for hosting the tournament.\n\nBut it’s hypocritical of the West to be giving lessons in morality to others, he said.\n\nThose statements on the eve of the World Cup went viral, inviting much anger and ridicule. But to many Arabs and Muslims, they resonated strongly.\n\nUS actor Morgan Freeman (2nd L), Qatari singer Dana al-Fardan (2nd R), and Qatari YouTuber Ghanim al Muftah (R) perform during the Qatar 2022 World Cup opening ceremony on Sunday. Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOmar Alsaadi, a 21-year-old Qatari, told CNN that Infantino vocalized “from a Western point of view” what many of his compatriots have felt about being targets of racism.\n\nIn the run-up to the tournament, Western media coverage has been dominated by the controversies surrounding the event rather than the sport itself, including the Gulf nation’s treatment of migrant workers, its rules on LGBTQ people and its tight social restrictions. Britain’s public broadcaster, the BBC, refrained from airing the opening ceremony on television, opting instead to cover criticism of the host nation. The BBC said it did broadcast the ceremony on their video-on-demand service.\n\nThis year’s World Cup is certainly like no other before it. It is the first to be held in a Muslim country and Qatar has gone a long way to give the event a distinctly Arab and Muslim flavor.\n\nThe Bedouin-themed opening ceremony on Sunday began with a female singer donning a traditional burqa, a kind of face covering that has been banned in several European countries. It also cited a verse from the Quran about God creating humanity into “nations and tribes” so they can get to know each other.\n\nAccording to social media reports, some hotel rooms in the country offer visitors QR codes to learn about Islam, and Muslim volunteers have been teaching visitors about Islamic fashion.\n\nQatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), which is responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nBut in an earlier statement to CNN, the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nThe visibility of Islamic symbols in Qatar hasn’t escaped those attending. An on-air joke by a French journalist about the presence of “a lot of mosques” in the country caused outrage among Muslims on social media.\n\nWestern news outlets have also been accused of peddling stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims.\n\nThe Times of London on Monday said “Qataris are unaccustomed to seeing women in Western dress in their country” in a photo caption that was later deleted after being flagged on social media. Around 87% of the country’s population of 2.9 million is made up of expatriates, many of whom are Western.\n\n“I think that the Western media is biased because they don’t want to see an Arabic success, a Muslim success in the delivering and hosting of a global cup for football in a third [world country],” Najd Al-Mohanadi, a 20-year-old Qatari, told CNN.\n\nBut some in the Western media have spoken out against stereotyping and alleged biases. Ayman Mohyeldin, an MSNBC host who previously worked for Qatar’s Al Jazeera, said recent coverage of Qatar shows “the depths of Western prejudice, performative moral outrage and, perhaps most significantly, gross double standards.”\n\nThe Economist and the New York Times have also run articles defending Qatar’s right to host the tournament. The Times of London ran an essay saying criticism of Qatar was “laced with hypocrisy.”\n\n“I always question the timing [of the criticism], as migrants throughout the region endure poor living arrangements for meager pay, while also working under strenuous physical and mental conditions,” said Mira Al Hussein, a postdoctoral researcher from the UAE who is studying at Oxford University in England.\n\n“Scrutiny is overdue and it makes no sense to tie it to global events where virtue-signaling becomes deeply problematic,” Al Hussein told CNN.\n\n“Especially when it comes from non-NGO entities that are themselves embroiled in human rights violations within and across their borders.”\n\nJames Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Qatar, said that while some of the coverage around Qatar in the West has reinforced negative stereotypes about the Arab Muslim world, most of the criticism has been “fair and proportionate.”\n\n“It’s absolutely right to call out instances of that kind of coverage, but wrong to generalize from those examples to imply that all, or most, criticism is driven by racism,” he said.\n\nWorkers in the country continue to “face harsh, abusive working conditions and severe exploitation, with domestic and construction workers among those most at risk,” he said, adding that Qatar’s women and LGBTQ people “face serious discrimination and repression, both in law and practice.”\n\nCritics of Western media coverage of Qatar have countered that other countries with questionable human rights records didn’t receive such scrutiny when hosting global sporting events.\n\n“At the risk of engaging in whataboutism… Qatar’s human rights records, as poor as they may be, cannot possibly be more outrageous than other countries, such as Russia, China and Israel,” said Al Hussein. “Qatar is certainly not engaging in ethnic cleansing, nor are migrants living in concentration camps, despite the poor living conditions.”\n\nMaryam AlHajri, a Qatari researcher at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said some of the recent rhetoric around Qatar shows that some Western critics have been more concerned with feeding into an “orientalist discourse,” referring to language aimed at imposing Western worldviews, than human rights.\n\n“This should not be read as a justification to cease criticizing the migrant worker condition in Qatar,” she said. “Rather, it should be interpreted as an argument for the necessity to contextualize the migrant workers situation as part of a globalized economic order built on colonialism and racial capitalism.”\n\nShe noted however that some over-zealous defenders of the government on the Qatari side have neglected the country’s human rights shortcomings.\n\n“Many of the people defending Qatar are also using terrifyingly pro-government language,” she said, adding that it reaches a point that doesn’t help the cause of Qatar’s migrant workers.\n\n“The plight of migrant workers in places like the US or the UK does not take away from the fact that we have problems in Qatar,” AlHajri told CNN. “It shouldn’t be about whataboutism.”\n\nWith additional reporting from Mariam Dirar Alqasem in Doha\n\nIran protests\n\nCNN hears testimony from women who say they experienced sexual violence by Iranian regime 06:31 - Source: CNN\n\nSocial media videos have emerged allegedly showing Iranian security forces sexually assaulting female demonstrators on the streets.\n\nWith media access inside Iran severely constrained, CNN went to the region near Iraq’s border with Iran, interviewing eyewitnesses who’d left the country and verifying accounts from survivors and sources both in and outside Iran.\n\nThe covert testimonies revealed sexual assaults on male and female activists as a women-led uprising spreads throughout Iran.\n\nUS Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley on Tuesday tweeted it is “a reminder of what is at stake for the Iranian people - and of the lengths to which the regime will go in its futile attempt to silence dissent.”\n\nRead the article here.\n\nHere’s the latest on the protests in Iran:\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Tuesday that the rising number of protest-related deaths highlights the “critical” nature of the situation in the country. The UN said its sources had reported over 40 deaths “in mainly Kurdish cities in the past week.”\n\nForty foreign nationals “affiliated in riots” have been arrested in Iran since protests started in September, Iranian judiciary spokesperson Masood Satayshi said without revealing their nationalities.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday the US is taking steps to “push back against actions Iran is taking to repress its own people.”\n\nMobile internet was restored in Iran after a major disruption on Monday, according to internet watchdog NetBlocks, which said that cellular data was down for about 3.5 hours as security forces cracked down on protesters in the Kurdish region of Iran.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nSaudi Arabia produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history Tuesday, beating Lionel Messi’s Argentina 2-1 in an astonishing Group C match.\n\nMany had expected the South American team, ranked third in the world, unbeaten for three years and among the favorites to win the tournament, to sweep aside its opponent, ranked 48 places below it in the world rankings.\n\nWatch CNN’s Becky Anderson speak to celebrating fans of the Saudi team:\n\nAlso read:\n\nThe digest\n\nTeenage student dies in twin explosions in Jerusalem\n\nTwo explosions shook Jerusalem early Wednesday, killing one person and injuring 18 others in a suspected “combined terror attack,” according to an Israeli police spokesperson. The first explosion occurred at a bus station near the entrance of Jerusalem, killing a 16-year-old student at a Jewish seminary, his family told local media. The second explosion occurred almost half an hour later at the city’s Ramot junction. Initial investigations indicated that explosive devices were placed at both blast sites and a search is underway for suspects, the police spokesperson said.\n\nBackground: The attack brings the number of people killed on the Israeli side of the conflict to at least 29 this year. This year has also been the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since 2015.\n\nWhy it matters: Jerusalem has not seen a double bombing like this one in many years. Prime Minister Yair Lapid said after participating in a situation assessment with security officials that the incident was “different from what we have seen in recent years.” The explosions come after months of tensions in the occupied West Bank.\n\nRussia to build attack drones for Ukraine war with the help of Iran, intelligence assessment says\n\nIran and Russia have reached an agreement to begin the production of attack drones in Russia, according to a new intelligence assessment from a country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program. Iran is beginning to transfer blueprints and components for the drones to Russia after the initial agreement was struck earlier this month, said a source familiar with the assessment.\n\nBackground: US officials have said that Russia has received hundreds of drones from Tehran which have had a deadly effect in Ukraine. Earlier this month, the Iranian government acknowledged for the first time that it had sent a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhy it matters: The move would further cement the partnership between Tehran and Moscow and likely provoke significant anger from Ukraine and its western allies including the US. Sources explained that the goal is for Russia to produce thousands of new attack drones using Iranian components and blueprints.\n\nSaudi Arabia says it may take steps to balance market\n\nOil rose on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ was sticking with output cuts and could take further steps to balance the market, outweighing global recession worries and concern about China’s rising Covid-19 case numbers, Reuters reported. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Monday was also cited by state news agency SPA as denying a Wall Street Journal report that said OPEC was considering boosting output.\n\nBackground: The Wall Street Journal earlier on Monday reported an output increase of 500,000 barrels per day was under discussion for the next meeting of OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, on December 4. The report cited unidentified OPEC delegates. The report sent oil prices plunging by more than 5%.\n\nWhy it matters: The oil cartel last month cut production by 2 million barrels per day in an effort to stabilize the market “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.” The oil cut was made despite strong US pressure against it. Potential further cuts could exacerbate already tense relations between the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim Abbas Al Lawati", "Nadeen Ebrahim", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/12/energy/saudi-diplomat-opec-cut-intl/index.html", "title": "Saudis aren't weaponizing oil like Americans claim, top official says ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSaudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir said his country partnered with Russia to slash oil production in order to stabilize markets and denied that there were political motives behind the decision, which has enraged US leaders and sparked calls to rethink ties with Riyadh.\n\n“We’re trying to make sure we don’t have erratic swings in prices,” al-Jubeir, one of Saudi Arabia’s top diplomats, told CNN’s Becky Anderson on Wednesday. “Our track record has been clear – we have always worked assiduously to maintain stability in the oil markets.”\n\nLast week, OPEC+, the oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, agreed to slash production by 2 million barrels per day, twice as much as analysts had predicted, in the biggest cut since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe move came despite an intense pressure campaign from the United States, which had warned Arab allies that such a move would increase prices and help Russian President Vladimir Putin continue to fund his war in Ukraine. Experts also fear that continued high oil prices could make it more difficult for the US to tamp down inflation, which has already skyrocketed this year.\n\nAl-Jubeir, who is also the country’s climate minister, denied that there were any political motives to the decision and said the production cut was made to avoid major swings in the price of oil, which can affect consumers worldwide, and pointed to the fact that the price of oil has gone down since the reduction was announced last week.\n\n“Saudi Arabia is not siding with Russia,” he told CNN. “Saudi Arabia is taking the side of trying to ensure the stability of the oil markets.”\n\n“Saudi Arabia does not politicize oil. We don’t see oil as a weapon. We see oil as our commodity. Our objective is to bring stability to the oil market,” al-Jubeir said.\n\nUS President Joe Biden told CNN on Tuesday that Washington must now “rethink” its relationship with Riyadh following the cut. The decision was a particular affront for Biden because of his efforts over the summer to repair ties with Saudi Arabia, despite the kingdom’s woeful human rights record and the role of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Bin Salman denied involvement in the murder, which captured international headlines in part due to the lurid details of the killing.\n\n“I am in the process, when the House and Senate gets back, they’re going to have to – there’s going to be some consequences for what they’ve done with Russia,” Biden said.\n\nWatch the full exclusive interview with President Joe Biden 15:20 - Source: CNN\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Thursday that Washington had conveyed their intention to move forward with oil production cuts is a move “in the wrong direction.”\n\n“The Saudi Foreign Ministry can try to spin or deflect, but the facts are simple. The world is rallying behind Ukraine in combatting Russian aggression.” Kirby said. “In recent weeks, the Saudis conveyed to us – privately and publicly – their intention to reduce oil production, which they knew would increase Russian revenues and blunt the effectiveness of sanctions.\n\n“As the President has said, we are reevaluating our relationship with Saudi Arabia in light of these actions, and will continue to look for signs about where they stand,” Kirby said.\n\nKirby added that other OPEC nations privately disagreed with the decision to cut but felt “coerced” to fall in line. When asked about similar reports of discord within the cartel, al-Jubeir said he was not part of the internal discussions among OPEC+ members but pointed to the fact that the official vote was unanimous.\n\n“The bottom line is everyone agreed to it,” al-Jubeir said.\n\nOn Wednesday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden would examine all aspects of US ties with Saudi Arabia, including arms sales, as administration officials begin quiet discussions with members of Congress and congressional aides about how the US could impose consequences on the kingdom following the oil output cut.\n\n“There is a range of interests and values that are implicated in our relationship with that country,” Sullivan told reporters. “The President will examine all of that. But one question he’s going to ask is: Is the nature of the relationship serving the interest and values of the United States and what changes would make it better serve the interests and values?”\n\nSaudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman al-Saud said in an interview with Saudi TV earlier Wednesday that OPEC+ needed to be proactive as central banks in the West moved to tackle inflation with higher interest rates, a move that could raise prospects of a global recession, which could in turn reduce demand for oil and drive its price down. Cutting production would ensure a smaller supply of oil, keeping its price higher. While that would protect the Saudi economy by ensuring it receives a steady flow of income from oil sales, it would force consumers across the world to pay more for energy and gas, further fueling inflation.\n\nSaudi officials have insisted that the production cut is being done to protect the country’s economic interests. Because of its heavy dependence on oil revenues, the Saudi economy has a history of falling victim to boom and bust cycles in the oil market, where high prices bring in a flow of cash followed by downturns.\n\nIn the United States, however, the cut could have massive political ramifications ahead of next month’s midterm elections. After reaching highs over the summer, gas prices in the United States had been steadily decreasing, providing Biden and his top aides a potent talking point in the lead-up to the elections.\n\nBut a combination of factors, including rising demand and maintenance at some US refineries, has caused prices to begin ticking back up. The OPEC+ decision is likely to aggravate those factors.\n\nThe decision set off bipartisan fury in Washington when it was first announced last week. Saudi Arabia is now being accused of filling the Kremlin’s coffers with oil revenues just days after President Putin’s regime began carrying out large-scale missile attacks on civilian targets across Ukraine\n\n“What Saudi Arabia did to help Putin continue to wage his despicable, vicious war against Ukraine will long be remembered by Americans,” tweeted Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, on Friday.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on Wednesday called for immediate action on his bill that would stop US arm sales to Saudi Arabia.\n\n“The Saudis actions aid and abet a murderous and brutal criminal invasion by Russia,” Blumenthal said.\n\nWhen asked about growing calls in Washington to limit ties with Saudi Arabia, al-Jubeir said he hoped that such talk was motivated by domestic politics ahead of the midterms.\n\nAl-Jubeir said the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia remains “robust.”\n\n“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the US have had a very strong relationship for eight decades … and we look forward to this relationship continuing for the next eight decades,” he added.", "authors": ["Joshua Berlinger"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/11/biden-brokers-middle-east-deal-israel-lebanon-mediterranean/10469175002/", "title": "Biden: Middle East deal will boost gas extraction in Mediterranean ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – A maritime agreement the U.S. brokered between Israel and Lebanon will make the region more stable while boosting worldwide production of natural gas, President Joe Biden said Tuesday.\n\nIf the agreement is ratified, Lebanon could explore for natural gas in the Mediterranean, a development that could ease its energy and economic crisis.\n\nIsrael could continue to extract gas amid expected lower tensions with Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group, according to the White House.\n\nThe Biden administration hopes increased energy production can also help ease the global energy crunch caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe latest\n\nThe agreement is a major breakthrough in relations between Israel and Lebanon, which formally have been at war since Israel’s establishment in 1948.\n\nThe dispute over their shared maritime border goes back decades.\n\nU.S. efforts to negotiate an agreement began in the Obama administration and restarted about a year ago, according to a senior administration official who discussed the mediation on condition of anonymity.\n\nIsrael and Lebanon have agreed to a permanent maritime boundary.

Administration officials said they’re optimistic that will happen because it delivers “critical wins” for both sides.\n\nBut former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who hopes voters will return him to power in next month’s election, opposes the agreement and has vowed to cancel it if he wins.\n\nBecause there are no formal diplomatic relations between Israel and Lebanon, the deal is not a bilateral agreement but arranged through the United States. Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid and President Michel Aoun of Lebanon that the U.S. will help mediate any implementation disputes that arise, according to the administration's descriptions of Biden’s calls with the leaders Tuesday.\n\nTop takeaways\n\nThe White House described the agreement as an outgrowth of Biden’s attempts to foster a “more stable, prosperous, integrated” region in the Middle East.\n\nThe Lebanese, most of whom have less than two hours of electricity a day, must solve its energy crisis to have any hope for an economic recovery. While gas exploration will take time, Lebanon could benefit in the short term from foreign investment, the senior administration official said.\n\nAnd Israel needs security and stability in the eastern Mediterranean to continue to rely on those waters for most of its electricity and to be able to export energy, according to the White House.\n\nWhat they are saying\n\n“The agreement announced by both governments today will provide for the development of energy fields for the benefit of both countries, setting the stage for a more stable and prosperous region, and harnessing vital new energy resources for the world,” Biden said in a statement.\n\n“This is an historic achievement that will strengthen Israel’s security, inject billions into Israel’s economy, and ensure the stability of our northern border,” Lapid said in a statement.\n\n\"It might help create and strengthen the mutual deterrence between Israel and Hezbollah,\" Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies told The Associated Press.\n\n“I just have one question: what are the specific terms of the deal?

His administration also released an intelligence report last year that directly accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of orchestrating Khashoggi’s killing.\n\nBut officials say Biden, who is under immense pressure to crack down on Russia and lower domestic gas prices amid inflation that’s rising at the fastest pace since 1981, has set aside his moral outrage to pursue warmer relations with the Kingdom amid the dramatic global upheaval spurred by the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“Both sides have decided that for the sake of achieving peace and stability in the Middle East, we need to move past it,” said one senior US official, referring to Khashoggi’s murder. The Saudis, for their part, consider the Khashoggi case closed—and have made that clear to the US, officials said.\n\nThat doesn’t mean forgiving and forgetting, the sources noted. Biden, they said, does plan to raise Khashoggi’s murder directly with MBS, as the crown prince is known, when they meet as soon as next month. And some officials inside the administration still believe more should be done to hold MBS accountable for the crime. But the shift is now well underway after months of meetings in Riyadh between two of Biden’s top national security advisers, Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein, and Saudi officials, including MBS. And it is already sparking outrage, with Khashoggi’s fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, accusing Biden of losing his moral compass.\n\n“President Biden’s decision to meet MBS is horribly upsetting to me and supporters of freedom and justice everywhere,” she said in a statement to CNN.\n\nA human rights defender in Washington close to the administration, who was also a close friend of Khashoggi’s, told CNN that he believes moving on and doing nothing more to hold MBS accountable for Khashoggi’s killing will deal a huge blow to the prince’s opposition and Arab dissidents around the world.\n\n“The promise of accountability was the only check on this guy [MBS], now it’s gone,” he said. “When the President of the US goes to this murderer’s hometown to appease him, he’s not only glossing over his past heinous crimes with stunning impunity but enabling his future ones. It’s a wink-wink nudge-nudge to commit the next crime in a cleaner, less messy fashion.”\n\nUS officials told CNN that the decision to meet with MBS has been a tough pill to swallow for the President, who said in 2019 that Saudi Arabia had “no redeeming social value.” But they said the countries have agreed that the relationship cannot be held “hostage” by the murder, especially given how dramatically the world has changed since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nAmong the US’ most important foreign policy goals now is to isolate Russia politically and cut off funding for its war machine by banning Russian oil exports – two objectives that officials believe will be nearly impossible if Saudi Arabia is not on the US’ side, particularly when it comes to increasing oil production to try to stabilize global oil markets. The President and his senior national security advisers therefore believe that to “shun” Saudi Arabia over the murder of Khashoggi would be shortsighted.\n\nThe troubling economic trends, particularly when it comes to record high domestic gas prices and soaring inflation, have also come to dominate the priorities of the administration and shunted others aside, said a US official outside the White House.\n\n“I do think the desperation of the trajectory of the global economy is driving everything,” the official said. “They [the White House] are anxious, they are desperate.”\n\n“Their fear, and their anxiety, is making them throw principle out the door,” the official added. “The worst [economic] outcomes on this are really bad and would devastate any hopes the Democrats would have in November.”\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN en Español on Wednesday that the administration never sought to fully “rupture” US-Saudi relations, even after releasing the report last year that put MBS at the center of Khashoggi’s murder. But he said that the US would continue “to make sure that human rights is fully reflected in our foreign policy.”\n\nOil prices driving the reset\n\nBiden’s advisers have said openly that the need to increase oil production to stabilize prices is a key driver of the Saudi reset.\n\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday that “there is no doubt that Saudi Arabia has to account for what they did with Jamal Khashoggi.” But, she added, “there is also no question that we have to increase global [oil] supply. And OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, is at the head of the pack for that.”\n\nThere are of course things the Saudis want in return from the US, including a viable strategy for dealing with Iran – the Kingdom’s biggest regional enemy – as the US struggles to finalize a new nuclear deal. The Saudis also want security commitments, like the continued provision of missile defense systems, officials said.\n\nBut White House officials argue that Saudi Arabia has been working with the US in good faith over the last several months, which has made the White House more confident that a meeting between Biden and MBS will be fruitful.\n\nUS officials have repeatedly pointed to the fragile ceasefire in Yemen reached in April and the Saudi’s ouster of Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who was viewed by many officials in the region and in the US as an impediment to peace, as major diplomatic victories that would not have been possible without US engagement. The two-month-old ceasefire, which was extended last week, is the first between the warring Saudis and Houthis in six years.\n\n“I’m not going to change my view on human rights,” Biden said last week. “But as President of the United States, my job is to bring peace if I can. And that’s what I’m going to try to do.”\n\nWorking on a ‘significant agenda’\n\nA National Security Council spokesperson noted that the Khashoggi murder took place during the Trump administration, telling CNN that the US is “not looking past any conduct that took place before we entered office.” The spokesperson pointed to the sanctions the US has imposed on Saudi individuals believed to have been involved in Khashoggi’s murder and others implicated in human rights abuses.\n\nBut the spokesperson also said the US has “a significant agenda with Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the other countries of the Middle East. That agenda is focused on delivering results for the American people as well as ending wars and leading through diplomacy to bring stability to the Middle East region.”\n\nLast week’s agreement by OPEC+ to increase oil production by 200,000 barrels per day in July and August, a decision spearheaded by Saudi Arabia, was another show of good faith by the Saudis, officials believe. And with help from the United States, relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia are also slowly but steadily improving, officials noted – discussions are underway now, for example, to expand Israeli commercial planes’ access to Saudi airspace, the sources said. One regional official briefed on the discussions said Israel wants the Saudis to allow Israeli Arab Muslims to fly to the Kingdom for religious pilgrimages.\n\nIsrael has been pushing heavily for the Biden-MBS meeting to happen, multiple officials said. And underscoring the changing nature of the Israel-Saudi relationship, Biden is expected to make an extraordinarily rare flight directly from Tel Aviv to Riyadh on Air Force One while in the Middle East next month, according to two regional officials briefed on the plans.\n\nStill, those developments are unlikely to satisfy activists and American lawmakers who continue to call for further accountability and justice for Khashoggi.\n\n“The highest levels of the Saudi government, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are culpable in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, and there is no escaping that stark truth laid bare in the U.S. Intelligence Community’s 2021 public assessment,” top House lawmakers wrote in a letter to Biden earlier this week. “We must continue to insist on justice for this horrific crime.”", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Alex Marquardt", "Natasha Bertrand", "Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/06/state-of-the-union-biden-inflation-war-immigration-economy/11154261002/", "title": "State of the Union 2023: Biden to focus on war, immigration, inflation", "text": "WASHINGTON – A divided Congress.

The president will be in Wisconsin on Wednesday and Florida on Thursday.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nBiden devoted the first 11 minutes of last year’s hourlong address to supporting Ukraine, a rallying cry delivered just days after Russia’s invasion. The war probably will figure prominently this year as well. Biden will be speaking in the run-up to the one-year anniversary. And while Russia did not have the swift success many anticipated a year ago, the longer the fighting continues, the harder it will be for Biden to maintain support for Ukraine at home and abroad.\n\nMany GOP House members are calling for greater scrutiny – or even a curtailment -- of U.S. involvement. That reflects eroding support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents nationwide. The share of Republicans who say the U.S. gives too much aid to Ukraine has steadily increased since March, according to the Pew Research Center. Also, unlike at the start of the war, there’s now a wide partisan gap over whether Russia’s invasion of Ukraine poses a major threat to U.S. interests.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine:As Biden seeks to avoid wider war, delivery of M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine escalates conflict\n\nChinese spy balloon\n\nThe speech is a chance for Biden to respond to those who have criticized how he handled the suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States last week – and to send a public message to China.

Always eager to burnish his bipartisan bona fides, Biden is expected to highlight issues he has worked on with Republicans over the past two years, including a major infrastructure package in 2021.\n\nAfter the midterm elections, Biden said he was “ready to compromise with Republicans where it makes sense.” But he flatly ruled out fundamental changes to Social Security and Medicare, or compromising in other areas such as abortion rights, prescription drug costs and climate change.\n\nA new Congress with new priorities:What to know about Speaker McCarthy and the fate of Biden's agenda\n\nImmigration reform\n\nBiden called for immigration reform during last year’s State of the Union, telling lawmakers, “Let’s get it done once and for all.” It didn’t happen, so look for him to mention immigration again in this year’s address.\n\nJust last month, Biden traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border, where he heard pleas for help in addressing the migrant crisis. The number of migrants crossing the border – some lawfully seeking asylum, others entering illegally – has risen dramatically during his first two years in office. Republicans blame the surge on Biden’s border policies. Last week, the GOP-led House Judiciary Committee opened the first in a series of hearings it is calling “Biden’s border crisis.”\n\nBiden could use his speech to remind Americans of steps his administration has taken to the secure the border and to once again urge Congress to pass immigration reform.\n\nA legal morass:As Biden hunts for answers to migrant crisis, his policies are increasingly tied up in court\n\nInflation and the economy\n\nBiden celebrated when the government reported last month that inflation eased substantially for the third month in a row. “My economic plan is actually working,” he said. You can bet he'll emphasize that point again in Tuesday's address.\n\nIt’s not hard to see why. Fifty-four percent of Americans listed inflation and the economy as their No. 1 and No. 2 concerns in a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll in December. Americans have been struggling for nearly two years through a historic spike in inflation that has driven up the price of food, housing and energy. Though inflation seems to be cooling, fears that the country could slip into recession this year persist. Despite those concerns, the Labor Department reported Friday that employers added a booming 517,000 jobs in January, suggesting to some economists that inflation could continue to decline even while employers keep adding jobs.\n\nCoping with inflation:Even with a mild winter, more Americans struggle to pay their energy bills\n\nCrime and police brutality\n\nBiden devoted a substantial chunk of last year’s State of the Union to crime, gun control and policing, saying Americans should not have to choose “between safety and equal justice.” In the year since, a wave of mass shootings and high-profile cases involving allegations of police brutality has kept those issues in the public consciousness.\n\nBiden can point to bipartisan gun control legislation that he signed into law last summer as an example of the steps taken in the past year to keep guns away from dangerous people. The law, approved in the aftermath of a mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, was the largest gun control package passed in 30 years.\n\nAdvocates are now pushing Congress to revisit federal police accountability legislation after the brutal beating death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee. Five Memphis police officers have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes in connection to Nichols' death. Advocates also are urging Biden to again address police brutality in Tuesday’s speech. RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, the mother and stepfather of Nichols, are expected to attend the address.\n\nMareen Groppe and Michael Collins cover the White House.

In a preview of an expected reelection campaign announcement, he noted that the unemployment rate was at 50-year low while inflation has been easing.\n\n“We’ve been sent here to finish the job,” Biden said, invoking a phrase he used several times in his speech.\n\nBut the rancorous atmosphere in the House chamber telegraphed fights ahead, including over budget priorities and avoiding a catastrophic default on the nation’s debt.

Without it, nothing is,” he said.\n\nBiden introduced Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was violently attacked in their home by an intruder, saying the assailant was “unhinged by the Big Lie” that the election was stolen.\n\n“Here tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.

Turn more cancers from death sentences to treatable diseases. Provide more support for patients and their families.” The issue is also deeply personal to Biden, as one of his sons, Beau Biden, passed away due to brain cancer. “It’s personal to so many of us.”\n\nBiden also singled out Maurice and Kandice Barron, a pair of guests invited by First Lady Jill Biden. Their daughter, Ava Barron, was diagnosed with a form of kidney cancer when she was one year old. “She turns four next month,” Biden said to wide cheers from the audience. “They just found out Ava’s beating the odds and is on her way to being cured from cancer.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCancer treatment:New cancer therapy takes personalized medicine to a new level\n\nBiden says US stood up to China\n\nFacing Republicans who’ve accused him of being too soft on China, Biden said he responded clearly last week when a Chinese surveillance balloon floated over the United States.\n\nChina knows that if U.S. sovereignty is threatened, Americans will act to protect the country.\n\n“And we did,” Biden said, an apparent reference to his decision to shoot down the balloon.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nChinese spy balloon:Chinese spy balloon went over other US missile and nuclear weapons sites, lawmaker says\n\nBiden: Stop production, trafficking of fentanyl\n\nCiting Americans’ growing dependence on prescription drugs, Biden called for a major campaign to stop the production, sale and trafficking of fentanyl.\n\nBiden noted that fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.

Among them: expanding access to preschool and raising teacher pay.\n\nIn 2021, teachers made less than 77 cents on the dollar compared with other college graduates. Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000. While raising teacher pay has garnered the support of some Republicans, the American Teacher Act is unlikely to get far. In some states teachers make less than $50,000 on average.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nTeacher shortage:Amid crippling teacher shortages, some schools are turning to unorthodox solutions\n\nBiden urges lawmakers to protect abortion rights\n\nBiden called on lawmakers to “restore” abortion rights after the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v.

Tsay, who is in attendance, received a standing ovation from lawmakers as Biden acknowledged him.\n\n“He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well,” Biden said. “Ban assault weapons once and for all.”\n\nMass shootings typically lead lawmakers to call for such actions but it’s unlikely that a ban will pass in a divided Congress with many Republican lawmakers who have vowed that they will not waver on gun control.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\n'Still too high':Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin orders independent panel to study military suicide\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene yells at Biden multiple times\n\nRep.

Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table.

That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements. Sixty-two percent of Americans said Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or “little or nothing,\" in the same Washington Post-ABC News poll, while only 36% said he has accomplished \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat to watch for:The State of the Union is Tuesday: Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris chats with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ahead of speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris shook hands with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the two chatted, as they stood behind the rostrum waiting for Biden to enter the House chamber.\n\nThis will be the first State of the Union with McCarthy as speaker since Republicans took control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden heads to the Capitol\n\nBiden left the White House at 8:30 p.m. en route to the Capitol.

But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov.

Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders?

Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/20/middleeast/israel-government-dissolve-vote-intl/index.html", "title": "Israel set for possible fifth election in four years as PM Bennett ...", "text": "Jerusalem CNN —\n\nIsrael’s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has effectively called time on his premiership after just a year in the job.\n\nAlong with his key coalition ally Foreign Minister Yair Lapid – who now looks set to replace him as leader as early as next week – Bennett has agreed to submit a bill to dissolve parliament, which if passed would trigger a general election later this year.\n\nThe announcement followed weeks of mounting political uncertainty in Israel, but still came as a major surprise.\n\nA short statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said the move came “after attempts to stabilize the coalition had been exhausted.” A bill would be submitted to parliament at some point next week, the statement added.\n\nNaftali Bennett: What to know about Israel's new Prime Minister 02:33 - Source: CNN\n\nIf it is passed, Lapid will become the country’s fourteenth Prime Minister, in line with the original coalition agreement struck last year. It also means Israelis will be going to the polls for the fifth time in under four years.\n\nAmong the first items on Lapid’s agenda, assuming he does become leader, will be preparing for the visit of US President Joe Biden next month. A senior administration official said the President’s trip to the Middle East is still expected to go ahead despite the political shakeup in Israel.\n\n“We have a strategic relationship with Israel that goes beyond any one government. The President looks forward to the visit next month,” the White House official said.\n\nThe Bennett-Lapid government was sworn into office in June last year bringing an end to the premiership of Benjamin Netanyahu, which had lasted some twelve and a half years.\n\nMade up of no fewer than eight political parties, the coalition stretched right across the political spectrum, including for the first time an Arab party, led by Mansour Abbas.\n\nUnited in a desire to prevent Netanyahu – whose corruption trial had already begun in May 2020 – from remaining in power, the disparate coalition partners agreed to put their substantial differences to one side.\n\nIn November, it notched up a significant domestic achievement, passing a state budget for the first time in nearly four years.\n\nBut recent weeks have seen a number of coalition members either quitting, or threatening to quit, leaving the government without a majority in parliament to pass legislation.\n\nThe political impasse came to a head earlier this month, when a Knesset vote failed to uphold the application of Israeli criminal and civil law to Israelis in the occupied West Bank.\n\nAmong other things, the regulation, which comes up for renewal every five years, gives Israeli settlers the same rights as citizens in Israel, and is an article of faith for right-wing members of the coalition, including Prime Minister Bennett.\n\nBut two members of the coalition failed to support the bill, meaning it failed to pass. If parliament dissolves before July 1st, the regulation will remain in place until a new government is formed.\n\nSpeaking alongside Lapid on Monday evening, Bennett said their government had swept away what he called the bitterness and paralysis of the Netanyahu era, instead putting decency and trust back center stage.\n\n“In the last few weeks, we did everything we could to save this government. In our eyes, the continuation of its existence was in the national interest. Believe me, we looked under every rock. We didn’t do this for ourselves, but for our beautiful country, for you, the citizens of Israel.”\n\nFor his part, Lapid paid tribute to Bennett as a brave and innovative leader. And he appeared to offer a stark warning of the dangers posed by a return to the leadership of Netanyahu.\n\n“What we need to do today is go back to the concept of Israeli unity. Not to let dark forces tear us apart from within,” he said.\n\nNetanyahu, by contrast, was upbeat, saying the country was smiling after what he called an evening of great news.\n\n“After a determined struggle by the opposition in the Knesset, and great suffering by the public in Israel, it is clear to everyone that the most dismal government in the history of the country has ended.”\n\nNetanyahu and his supporters have been buoyed by the most recent opinion polls, which show his bloc of right-wing and religious parties performing strongly, though still not strongly enough to secure a majority in parliament.", "authors": ["Andrew Carey Amir Tal Hadas Gold", "Andrew Carey", "Amir Tal", "Hadas Gold"], "publish_date": "2022/06/20"}]}

In one case, the president's son will plead guilty to the tax charges, which allege willful failure to pay federal income tax. In another case, he agreed to enter a pretrial diversion agreement for the gun offense, in which he acknowledged unlawful possession of a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver, despite being addicted to drugs.\n\nThe Justice Department will recommend probation for tax charges, according to The Associated Press, based on an unnamed source. The diversion program could eventually lead to dismissal of the gun charge.\n\nWeiss asked the court − a judge has not yet been assigned − to set a date to formally process the plea agreements. Weiss began in 2018 with questions about taxes on overseas business deals, after his work in Ukraine and China drew federal scrutiny.\n\nBiden's lawyer, Christopher Clark, said his understanding is that the agreements resolve the five-year investigation.\n\n\"Hunter will take responsibility for two instances of misdemeanor failure to file tax payments when due pursuant to a plea agreement,\" Clark said. \"I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.\"\n\nBiden himself disclosed the inquiry in December 2020.\n\nAsked Tuesday if he had spoken with his son, President Biden said, \"I’m very proud of my son.\"\n\nThe White House has previously said the president hasn't discussed the investigation with Attorney General Merrick Garland or the Justice Department.\n\n“The President and First Lady love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life,\" Ian Sams, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement. \"We will have no further comment.”\n\nThe case has political implications. Former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have attacked Hunter Biden as a potentially bad influence on his father. Trump appointed Weiss. IRS agents say they were removed from the probe. Hunter Biden has sued a laptop repairman for allegedly distributing private personal information to Trump supporters and reporters.\n\nHere is what we know about the inquiry:\n\nWhat are the tax charges?\n\nOne of the court filings explained the basis for the tax charges against Hunter Biden.\n\nHe allegedly received more than $1.5 million in taxable income during 2017, when he lived in Washington, D.C., and owed the federal government more than $100,000, according to a court record. He was required to pay the tax by April 2018 but didn't, according to the document filed by Leo Wise and Derek Hines, two special assistant U.S. attorneys in Weiss's office.\n\nBiden again received more than $1.5 million in 2018 and failed to pay his taxes by April 2019, according to the document.\n\nIRS investigators recently removed from probe\n\nCongressional Republicans have questioned Biden's overseas business deals. A whistleblower at the Internal Revenue Service, which has been investigating Biden for potential tax violations, told lawmakers in May his entire team was removed from the probe, according to a letter from his lawyers obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nMark Lytle, the attorney for the IRS whistleblower, wrote to lawmakers that his client has information about a “failure to mitigate clear conflicts of interest in the ultimate disposition” of a criminal investigation related to Biden’s taxes and whether he made a false statement in connection with a gun purchase.\n\nThe letter said the IRS criminal supervisory special agent \"was informed that he and his entire investigative team are being removed from the ongoing and sensitive investigation of the high-profile, controversial subject about which our client sought to make whistleblower disclosures to Congress.\" The Justice Department informed the whistleblower about the change.\n\nAnother charge involves allegedly false statement when buying a gun\n\nAnother charge in Weiss's inquiry alleges Biden made a false statement on a federal form when he bought a gun in 2018.\n\nThe Gun Control Act prohibits drug users from possessing firearms. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled the ban applies to \"a conviction for use or possession of a controlled substance within the past year.\"\n\nBiden filled out a federal form when he bought a handgun in October 2018 in which he replied “no” to a question of whether he was “an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nBy his own account in his memoir “Beautiful Things,” Biden battled drug addiction and for periods during 2018 smoked crack “every 15 minutes.”\n\nBut Biden could potentiallly challenge the law under his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Supreme Court overturned a New York gun law in June 2022, in a decision that threatened a variety of firearms regulations.\n\nHow does Hunter Biden's laptop figure into the probe?\n\nA laptop became a focal point of congressional inquiries because it contained a trove of documents and pictures of Hunter Biden.\n\nWhen Trump raised questions about the laptop at a 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden initially replied that it was Russian disinformation. The laptop’s legitimacy has since been confirmed by CBS News and The Washington Post, but the contents remain under investigation.\n\nBiden drug addition:Hunter Biden's drug use back in public eye as criminal charges could be around the corner\n\nA computer repairman, John Paul Mac Isaac, gave the laptop information to the FBI after Hunter Biden failed to pick up the MacBook Pro following repairs in April 2019. Mac Isaac later gave a copy of the laptop's contents to Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who shared the material Trump's political supporters and with reporters.\n\nHunter Biden filed a claim in federal court alleging Mac Isaac violated his privacy, took part in a conspiracy and helped others invade his privacy. The filing was in response to a $1.5 million lawsuit for alleged defamation that the repairman filed in Delaware Superior Court against Biden, CNN, Politico and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. The case has been moved to U.S. District Court in Delaware.\n\nBiden became lightning rod for political conflict between father's administration and House GOP\n\nThe inquiry carried political implications from the start because of his father's ambition as a former vice president to return to the White House and because of clashes with congressional Republicans.\n\nHouse Republicans led by Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., have argued that Hunter Biden peddled influence on the administration through lucrative business deals and the sale of art. For example, the House Oversight and Accountability Committee released a report in March saying Hunter Biden and other relatives received $1.3 million from a business associate after he received a wire transfer from a Chinese company.\n\nBiden paternity case:How the Biden family name became latest wrinkle in Hunter Biden's paternity battle\n\nComer called the charges a \"slap on the wrist\" and said they reflect a \"two-tiered system of justice.\"\n\n\"Hunter Biden is getting away with a slap on the wrist when growing evidence uncovered by the House Oversight Committee reveals the Bidens engaged in a pattern of corruption, influence peddling, and possibly bribery,\" Comer said. \"These charges against Hunter Biden and sweetheart plea deal have no impact on the Oversight Committee’s investigation. We will not rest until the full extent of President Biden’s involvement in the family’s schemes are revealed.”\n\nTrump, who has been indicted on federal charges over classified documents and New York state charges over business records, said in a post on Truth Social the Justice Department gave Hunter Biden \"a mere 'traffic ticket.' Our system is BROKEN!\"\n\nThe White House has dismissed the inquiries into Hunter Biden’s business deals as hyperpartisan and politically motivated. Joe Biden has defended himself and his son from attacks by Trump since the 2020 campaign.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has told Congress that the department’s decisions in the case would not be politicized.\n\n“I stand by my testimony, and I refer you to the U.S. attorney for the District of Delaware, who is in charge of this case and capable of making any decisions that he feels are appropriate,” Garland said at an unrelated news conference May 2.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/columns/nate-monroe/2022/05/19/rep-corrine-brown-plea-deal-legacy-tax-fraud-jacksonville-florida/9804664002/", "title": "Corrine Brown's plea deal corrupts her legacy but doesn't define it", "text": "COMMENTARY | Ex-U.S. Rep.

Matt Gaetz, was sentenced Thursday to 11 years in prison by a federal judge in Florida.\n\nGreenberg, a former Seminole County tax collector, previously pleaded guilty to underage sex trafficking, wire fraud, stalking, identity theft, producing a fake ID card, and conspiring to defraud the US government. He has been in jail since early 2021 and will get some credit for time served.\n\n“I have never seen a defendant who has committed so many different types of crimes in such a relatively short period,” said district Judge Gregory Presnell, who has been on the federal bench for decades and has sentenced more than 1,000 defendants.\n\nPresnell did praise Greenberg’s cooperation against others allegedly involved in sex crimes and fraud schemes, saying the cooperation was “more than I’ve seen in 22 years.”\n\nAs part of his plea deal, Greenberg provided information to investigators about Gaetz related to the sex-trafficking probe, a source familiar with the case previously told CNN. Women who attended parties with Greenberg and Gaetz previously told CNN that they participated in sex parties near Orlando that featured local political figures, young women, Venmo payments, alcohol, and drugs.\n\nGaetz has denied ever paying for sex or having sex with a minor, and no charges have been filed against Gaetz.\n\nCNN reported in September that prosecutors recommended against an indictment, though senior Justice Department officials get to make the final call – and it’s unclear if that decision has been made.\n\nGreenberg lawyer wants others charged\n\nAfter the sentencing, Greenberg’s attorney Fritz Scheller said he was “disappointed” that the Justice Department hasn’t charged anyone else as part of the sex-trafficking investigation, which includes Gaetz.\n\nScheller previously said in court that Greenberg gave investigators information about seven or eight other men as it pertains to the illegal sexual contact with a minor.\n\n“We expect the federal government to take on the hard cases and not just the easy convictions,” Scheller said, urging prosecutors to “pursue others.”\n\n“That’s what they’re there for,” Scheller added, saying the Justice Department should hold “higher-level” figures accountable for the sake of democracy.\n\nScheller said he and Greenberg communicated “fairly recently … in the past few months” with prosecutors as part of his cooperation in the sex-trafficking investigation.\n\nGreenberg’s “brazen” crime spree\n\nAfter initially facing 33 counts, Greenberg pleaded guilty in May 2021 to six federal crimes.\n\nThe stalking charge was related to a hoax that Greenberg perpetuated against a teacher who ran against him in 2020, when he was running for re-election as Seminole County tax collector.\n\nAs part of his plea, Greenberg admitted sending letters to the teacher’s school, falsely accusing them of sexual misconduct with a student. He also tried to make the teacher look racist by making fake social media accounts under their name and posting inflammatory material.\n\nThe judge said this was “perhaps the most egregious” of Greenberg’s crimes and said it was “downright evil” to frame the teacher of sexual misconduct. Greenberg apologized to the teacher, Brian Beute, at Thursday’s hearing, and Beute told reporters later that he accepts the apology.\n\nGreenberg also successfully scammed the Small Business Administration of $430,000 in Covid-19 relief funds by bribing a federal official, according to court filings.\n\nThe wire fraud charge stemmed from Greenberg misusing hundreds of thousands of Florida taxpayer dollars to make personal cryptocurrency investments. He used government equipment to make fake ID cards, and abused his access to a DMV database on his first day in office, according to court filings.\n\n“To have a tax collector stealing the money he collects is truly outrageous,” Presnell said. “… All of us are victims of crimes where the public trust is abused.”\n\nHaggling over a prison term\n\nFor his crimes, Greenberg faced decades in prison, but his cooperation deal significantly shortened his punishment. The two sides debated how much credit Greenberg deserves for assisting the Justice Department, weighed against the severity of his offenses.\n\nScheller acknowledged that Greenberg’s crimes were “outrageous” and “brazen” but said they were “the result of an impaired mind,” because Greenberg has bipolar disorder and was on the incorrect medication.\n\nHe said Greenberg struggled with his self-worth since he was a child. After being elected tax collector, “he was using money and sex to get access to political circles” and that he “tried to ingratiate himself” with high-profile figures – which includes Gaetz, though Scheller did not name the congressman.\n\nProsecutor Roger Handberg, the US attorney for the Middle District of Florida, acknowledged Greenberg’s substantial and “sincere” cooperation with related investigations, which have led to several indictments and guilty pleas in connection with Greenberg’s fraud schemes.\n\nBut he also said Greenberg “could not be deterred” during this three-year crime spree between 2017 and 2020 and that Greenberg “placed his wants and needs first, above everything else.”\n\nThe judge ultimately accepted Handberg’s recommendation of an 11-year prison term.\n\nAs part of the sentence, Greenberg will need to register as a sex offender when he leaves prison. The judge said Greenberg “is not a pedophile” because the girl he paid for sex was nearly 18 years old.\n\nPublic apology from Greenberg\n\nWearing a dark blue jail uniform, Greenberg briefly spoke during the hearing to offer an apology.\n\n“Nothing that I say today could justify my actions,” Greenberg said. “…I feel such remorse for what I’ve done.”\n\nHe apologized to the unnamed minor that he paid to have sex with, as well as to Beute, the teacher that he framed. He also tried to make amends with his former constituents in Seminole County.\n\n“I let you down and I betrayed your trust,” Greenberg said.\n\nScheller, Greenberg’s attorney, said his client has lost everything, including his marriage and his kids. He said Greenberg’s parents cut him out of their will, and that Greenberg sold his home so he could pay back the money he stole from Seminole County and the Small Business Administration.\n\n“I can never make up for what I’ve done,” Greenberg said, addressing his family, who did not attend the hearing.", "authors": ["Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/05/11/ex-us-rep-corrine-brown-guilty-18-fraud-tax-charges/15754535007/", "title": "Ex-U.S. Rep.

Twelve jurors unanimously convicted her on 18 of 22 counts, a raft of crimes that also includes filing false tax returns in 2012 through 2014 and making false claims on income disclosure forms reported to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThose financial crimes could put Brown, 70, in prison for years or potentially the rest of her life.\n\nAfter the verdict, Brown left the federal courthouse in unusual silence and in locked arms with Bishop Rudolph McKissick Sr. — one of Brown’s closest friends and a leader at one of Jacksonville’s prominent black churches — while a mob of reporters shouted questions and a news helicopter hovered overhead. She got into the back seat of a black Mercedes S550.\n\nJames Smith III, Brown’s defense lawyer, said he will file motions in the coming weeks requesting a new trial. He said Brown respects the jury’s decision but disagrees with it. “This is just part one,” he said.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy Corrigan did not set a date for a sentencing hearing but said it would happen in about 90 days. Until then, Brown will remain free.\n\nThe remarkable unraveling of the 12-term former congresswoman — who in 1992 became one of the first black candidates elected to Congress from Florida since Reconstruction — was aided in large part by her former chief of staff, Ronnie Simmons, who set his 30-year relationship with Brown on fire after he decided in February to plead guilty and become the government’s star witness.\n\nSlideshow: Evidence shown in the trial of former Congresswoman Corrine Brown's fraud trial\n\nProsecutors called other witnesses with long ties to Brown — former aides, donors and heads of businesses, churches and nonprofits — some of whom seemed reluctant to appear in court. Brown still considers some of those witnesses friends, even after they gave testimony that would ultimately prove damning.\n\n“It wasn’t as complicated as it was difficult to be a prosecution witness [when] one of the most respected persons in my lifetime [was] the defendant,” said Nat Glover, president of Edward Waters College and a former Jacksonville sheriff. He told jurors that he found no records of Brown donating to the college, even though she claimed tens of thousands in donations on her tax records over several years.\n\n“I just found myself in a difficult place where I had to adjust to the reality of the situation. In other words, the reality of what the evidence showed,” Glover said.\n\nIn other cases, Brown’s relationship to former confidants remains less clear.\n\nFew represent that better than Von Alexander, a former public-relations professional and part-time staffer in Brown’s congressional office who handled many of the former congresswoman’s personal affairs for years. Alexander told jurors Brown repeatedly directed her to turn checks from the sham charity One Door for Education and other sources into cash that could be deposited into Brown’s personal Bank of America account.\n\nSince her indictment, Brown has been banned from speaking with Alexander.\n\nCORRINE DELIVERS\n\nBrown’s gambit to take the stand herself didn’t undo the damage caused by the government’s case. Her testimony was forceful, humorous and at one point explosively emotional. But it was also unfocused and often perplexing.\n\nHer personality has failed her few times in the past.\n\nUntil her indictment last year, Brown hadn’t lost an election since 1982. She gleefully enraged critics but always had unwavering support in her congressional district, which encompassed predominantly African-American neighborhoods from Jacksonville to Orlando.\n\nShe willed the Republican Party into submission after several failed attempts to field credible challengers against her. She earned a reputation among local elected leaders from both parties as an effective advocate in Washington, D.C. — the basis for the infamous campaign slogan slapped on Jacksonville billboards, “Corrine Delivers.”\n\nIn an ironic twist, Brown often claimed credit for securing the money that paid for the federal courthouse in downtown Jacksonville — the site where 12 jurors sealed her fate Thursday.\n\nBrown’s eagerness to exert influence over the city’s government agencies — particularly the Duval County School Board and the Jacksonville Transportation Authority — was so well known there was a cottage industry of for-hire consultants who could act as intermediaries with the congresswoman. Alexander was once one of those figures.\n\nThe ballot-style endorsement fliers she issued every election cycle — her “Quick Picks” — were legendary, and long a source of rumored, but unsubstantiated, corruption.\n\nUnder the weight of federal indictment — and running in a newly redrawn congressional district she unsuccessfully filed a legal challenge over — Brown lost re-election last year to U.S. Rep. Al Lawson of Tallahassee.\n\nPOLITICAL TREMORS\n\nThe downfall of such a towering figure will have a seismic effect on the region’s Democratic politics. Brown headed a substantial political machine and was the titular head of the party’s turnout efforts.\n\nState Sen. Audrey Gibson, who chairs the Duval Democratic Party, acknowledged the power vacuum.\n\n“I think there is a void right now without question because of all the activities she’d put together,” she said. “It has to be filled … she always said failure is not an option.”\n\nThe trial also wrapped Jacksonville City Councilman Reginald Gaffney into Brown’s misdeeds.\n\nFor jurors, Gaffney was a mysterious figure.\n\nHe heads organizations that prosecutors say were also sources of secret cash padding Brown’s pockets. Gaffney told the Times-Union he gave Brown money because he loved her like a mother, and an attorney representing Gaffney’s nonprofit said such giving is not illegal.\n\nBut jurors never heard from him. Prosecutors and Brown’s defense lawyer indicated they wanted to call him to testify. For unexplained reasons neither side ultimately called him.\n\nGaffney has not been charged with any crimes.\n\nTHE TRIAL\n\nThe government’s case cut at the heart of the working-class image the Democratic icon spent years cultivating.\n\nJurors were told Brown received $141,000 in untraceable cash over several years through sources including One Door for Education and her Friends of Corrine Brown campaign committee.\n\nAn FBI accountant testified Brown, who earned around $175,000 a year as a member of Congress with a pension from the Florida Legislature, spent an average of $1,438 per month more than her reported income.\n\nBrown couldn’t explain many of these deposits.\n\nSmith, Brown’s lawyer, tried to pin most of the blame on Simmons, who he presented to jurors as a charismatic but devious operator who preyed on women who came to trust him. Brown was simply another victim, he argued.\n\nSimmons’ one-time girlfriend — a Virginia woman named Carla Wiley — started One Door for Education with noble intentions in 2011. With Simmons’ help, it would anchor a criminal conspiracy the following year.\n\nThe charity billed itself as a scholarship fund, and under those auspices Brown raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the organization by tapping into her network of donors and political allies. Only nominal amounts went to actual charity.\n\nBrown, Simmons and Wiley got the rest.\n\nWith that cash, Simmons, who made about $168,030 a year, could afford to live in the Washington suburbs, own a boat (called the Black Diamond) and treat Wiley to expensive dinners and at least one Miami vacation.\n\nWiley pleaded guilty last year and admitted during Brown’s trial that she stole well north of $100,000 directly from One Door.\n\nMore than $300,000 paid for elaborate events held in Brown’s honor. Sometimes they took the form of annual receptions held the week of the Congressional Black Caucus’ yearly conference. The money paid for a luxury box at a Jaguars-Redskins game, and for a Beyonce concert.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, One Door cash financed a golf tournament at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach. Donors were told their checks would pay for scholarships and help local charities. No money did.\n\nProsecutors say donors wrote more than $800,000 worth of checks to One Door from 2012 through 2015.\n\nStill, Brown pleaded ignorance.\n\nShe didn’t know why Simmons was making regular $800 withdrawals from One Door’s bank account, then placing money into her own account.\n\nBrown said Alexander, her former aide, owed her money. But the former congresswoman didn’t know why those payments were coming from One Door checks or cash derived from other organizations that didn’t know their money was being put into in Brown’s pockets.\n\nThe Department of Justice says it knows why.\n\n“Former Congresswoman Brown chose greed and personal gain over the sacred trust given to her by the community that she served for many years,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen Muldrow in a statement. “These guilty verdicts underscore our office’s resolve in holding public officials at all levels of government accountable for their actions. In this case, former Congresswoman Brown stole money that was donated on the false promise of helping further the educational goals of underprivileged children.”\n\n‘WE DON’T GIVE A DAMN’\n\nFor Brown’s supporters, her convictions defy belief.\n\n“We love Corrine,” said Chris Richardson, who sat outside the courthouse Thursday with fellow activist Denise Hunt waiting to show support for Brown.\n\nSince Brown was indicted last year, they had been at a series of sign-waving demonstrations of support at the same area. There were no demonstrators Thursday, but Hunt said it was important to stand up for her.\n\nWhen Brown left the building surrounded by trusted friends, Hunt joined a ring of reporters and onlookers to yell her support, saying backers “don’t give a damn” about the convictions.\n\n“I never knew her to be about money. I always knew her to be about helping,” said former Jacksonville Mayor John Delaney.\n\nDelaney, a Republican and the retiring president of the University of North Florida, testified in Brown’s defense last week.\n\n“It’s hard to win in federal court, but I think she presented a plausible case for reasonable doubt, and I believed what she said,” he said.\n\n“To call someone a liar, thief, among other things, it was hard to read,” said Gibson, the state senator. “She is obviously the go-getter, go get ’em Corrine Brown. … What she believes in, she charges forward with that, galvanizing the community, standing up against injustice.”\n\nBrown could in theory be sentenced to decades in prison. Each fraud or conspiracy conviction carries a potential 20-year sentence, and each tax conviction three years. Hiding income could lead to another five-year sentence.\n\nBrown will likely lean on her legacy in hopes of getting a lighter sentence.\n\nGlover, the Edward Waters College president, said, “This is a sad day for me, personally. I think so much of Congresswoman Brown and her service to this community, and I would hope that all of that service, dedication and commitment to this community would somehow manifest itself in the judge’s deliberations.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/trump-organization-fraud-trial-verdict/index.html", "title": "Trump Organization found guilty on all counts of criminal tax fraud ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Manhattan jury has found two Trump Organization companies guilty on multiple charges of criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records connected to a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation for top executives.\n\nThe Trump Corp. and Trump Payroll Corp. were found guilty on all charges they faced.\n\nDonald Trump and his family were not charged in this case, but the former president was mentioned repeatedly during the trial by prosecutors about his connection to the benefits doled out to certain executives, including company-funded apartments, car leases and personal expenses.\n\nThe Trump Organization could face a maximum of $1.61 million in fines when sentenced in mid-January. The company is not at risk of being dismantled because there is no mechanism under New York law that would dissolve the company. However, a felony conviction could impact its ability to do business or obtain loans or contracts.\n\nThe guilty verdict comes as Trump is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors for his handling of classified documents, the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, and the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s business records and financial statements. He is also facing a $250 million civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general alleging he and his adult children were involved in a decade-long fraud. The attorney general is seeking to permanently bar them from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York state, among other penalties.\n\nTrump Org. attorneys said they plan to appeal.\n\n“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “The Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes. Today’s verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.”\n\nWhen asked on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday why charges weren’t brought against the former president, Bragg said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“This was a chapter in it. A case against the corporations,” Bragg said.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said Bragg’s approach has been vindicated.\n\n“Obviously, this is a setback for the Trump Org. – a major setback for the Trump Org. They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nHear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less.

With her hands held out, she quietly uttered these phrases repeatedly: \"I call on you every night ... I thank you, Lord.\"\n\nSnapp, a central figure in an ongoing federal corruption probe into the EAA, faces 37-46 months in prison under the terms of her plea deal — though her cooperation could get her a sentence of 20 months maximum.\n\nSnapp, who will be sentenced June 1, was ordered to pay $58,050 in restitution to the EAA, which had given her authority as principal to choose vendors for her schools. This, Snapp admitted, is where she abused her position by granting a contract for after-school tutoring services to a vendor her paid her money in exchange. The tutoring was provided at Denby and Mumford, where Snapp became principal in 2013.\n\nSnapp, who once drove a Maserati with a Gucci vanity plate, admitted the money from the vendor influenced her decision to give her the contract.\n\n\"I used the money for my own purposes,\" said Snapp, who also admitted she hid about half of her ill-gotten gains from the IRS.\n\nSnapp, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion, will also have to pay $26,000 in restitution to the IRS.\n\nWith the fate of the EAA still in limbo, Snapp was one of two women to shed some light today on how fraud and corruption ran through an agency that was supposed to help Detroit’s worst schools.\n\nThe other was businesswoman Glynis Thornton, the vendor charged with paying Snapp the bribe. The 58-year-old woman also pleaded guilty to bribery, admitting she secretly paid Snapp to secure the contract. She did this, she said, by funneling payments to Snapp through an independent contractor who was also in on the scheme.\n\n\"I gave bribery money to K.C. Wilbourn in exchange for a contract,\" Thornton said.\n\nThe judge asked her: \"You knew it was illegal?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered.\n\nThornton faces 24-30 months in prison, though prosecutors have said they would drop it to as low as 15 months maximum if her cooperation \"substantially assists in the prosecution of others.\" She also has been ordered to pay $58,050 in restitution to the EAA, though the EAA won't get two payments. Both Thornton and Wilbourn could work out a deal to pay the restitution together.\n\nThornton, whose 16-year-old company Making a Difference Everyday provided tutoring services at Denby and Kerby high schools, explained how the scheme worked: Thornton would give an independent contractor the bribe money for Snapp, that contractor would meet Snapp at a bank, give her the money, and keep some for herself.\n\n\"She wanted to make some money, as well,\" Thornton said of the independent contractor.\n\nThat person is Paulette Horton, who has been charged in the same case and has a plea hearing scheduled for Feb. 25.\n\nPrincipal's plea hearing postponed in corruption case\n\nSnapp previously admitted to the Free Press in exclusive interviews that she broke the law, including burying a student’s parent with school funds. But she committed crimes because — Snapp claimed — she wanted to help underprivileged people, and cutting corners became easy.\n\nIndicted ex-principal lands job helping poor in Detroit\n\nSnapp has long been the central figure in a yearslong federal corruption probe into the EAA, the state reform district established by Gov. Rick Snyder for the lowest-performing schools. The EAA oversees 15 schools in Detroit.\n\nSince starting up in 2012, the EAA has had a rocky existence. Enrollment has dropped from nearly 10,000 students during its first year to about 7,000 today. Achievement has lagged, and there have been controversies over spending.\n\nThe Free Press first reported in October that a sweeping federal corruption probe of the EAA began more than 16 months ago and is focused on current and former top officials as well as vendor payments. Snapp has been at the center of the scrutiny.\n\nSnapp was hailed as a turnaround specialist when she worked at Detroit Public Schools, first at Denby High and later at Mumford High. Both schools were part of the DPS before they were placed in the EAA in 2012.\n\nSnapp abruptly resigned from the EAA in November 2014 after federal agents raided her apartment in downtown Detroit. Six months later, the EAA received a letter from the FBI saying Snapp was under investigation.\n\nSnapp told the Free Press in October that she had agreed to a deal to plead guilty to bribery and tax evasion.

Weiss is one of a handful of appointees of former President Donald Trump who were kept on by the Biden administration because they were overseeing politically sensitive investigations.\n\nAdding to the pressure, Republicans in Congress have already announced that if they take over the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, they plan to launch new investigations and hold hearings to examine the conduct of Hunter Biden and others in the Biden family.\n\nAlso potentially in play are Justice Department guidelines governing politically sensitive investigations during an election year. Current and former Justice Department officials say there is an unwritten rule that prosecutors avoid bringing politically sensitive cases within 60 days of an election.\n\nSome current and former Justice officials have debated whether the rules necessarily apply in this instance since Joe Biden isn’t on the ballot in the midterms.\n\nA lawyer for Hunter Biden declined to comment. The US Attorney’s Office in Delaware declined to comment.\n\nHunter Biden has not been charged with any crimes and has previously denied any wrongdoing. His father is not being investigated as part of the probe of his son’s business activities, according to sources who have been briefed.\n\nNarrowing the focus\n\nThe Justice Department investigation initially focused on Hunter Biden’s financial and business activities in foreign countries dating to when Joe Biden was vice president. But investigators have examined a swath of broader conduct, including whether Hunter Biden and associates violated money laundering, campaign finance, tax and foreign lobbying laws, as well as whether Hunter Biden broke federal firearm and other regulations, multiple sources said.\n\nAs the investigation has entered its final stages, prosecutors have narrowed their focus to tax and gun-related charges, the people say.\n\nJustice officials have debated the strength of the case for months, and have held discussions about whether more work is needed before deciding on possible charges. Those discussions have involved investigators from the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation agency and prosecutors in Delaware and at Justice Department headquarters, CNN previously reported.\n\nHunter Biden has publicly discussed his own substance abuse struggles, and some Justice officials questioned whether his open discussions of his past drug use could potentially weaken their case should they bring one.\n\nSome officials have noted that Biden could argue he wasn’t aware of wrongdoing because he was on drugs, one source said. CNN has previously reported that some officials were concerned it could be a defense, but more recently, Justice officials have coalesced around the view that Biden’s own public accounts of his recovery show he was fully responsible for actions now under scrutiny, according to the person familiar with the discussions.\n\nIn the meetings, officials also discussed the timing of any possible indictment given the sensitivity of bringing a politically connected case close to an election, another person said.\n\nJustice Department memoranda advise prosecutors against bringing any cases or taking any overt investigative steps with the purpose of impacting an election or providing an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate.\n\nGarland issued a memo in May to prosecutors reiterating the department’s stance on election year sensitivities. The memo is one attorneys general send every election year, and generally advises prosecutors about avoiding making major investigative or charging decisions near an election to avoid the perception of partisan motives.\n\nIn 2018, the last year of congressional midterm elections, prosecutors with the US attorney’s office in Manhattan charged two politically sensitive cases in August: one against Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, and another against Chris Collins, then a Republican congressman and early Trump supporter who was up for reelection that year.\n\nIn both cases, prosecutors made their charging decisions with the elections in mind, people familiar with the cases said.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty that August to campaign finance, tax and other charges and completed a three-year prison sentence. Collins, who won his reelection while under indictment, later pleaded guilty and resigned his seat. Collins was sentenced to 26 months in prison but only served two months after he was pardoned by former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump Justice officials pushed back on a request by New York prosecutors to execute a search warrant on Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s personal attorneys, during the months around the 2020 election.

He said the agreement was for a five-month sentence to be followed by five years of probation. The judge warned Weisselberg if he does not meet all the conditions of the plea agreement, “I would be at liberty to impose any lawful sentence which in your case includes imprisonment from 5 to 15 years.”\n\nThe plea puts him at odds with the Trump Organization, where he worked for 40 years, and his testimony could damage the company, if it goes to trial on related tax charges as scheduled in October.\n\nNicholas Gravante Jr., the lead attorney for Weisselberg, said in a statement that Weisselberg is happy to put this decision behind him.\n\n“In one of the most difficult decisions of his life, Mr. Weisselberg decided to enter a plea of guilty today to put an end to this case and the years-long legal and personal nightmares it has caused for him and his family,” Gravante said. “Rather than risk the possibility of 15 years in prison, he has agreed to serve 100 days. We are glad to have this behind him.”\n\nIn a statement provided to CNN Thursday, a spokesperson for the Trump Organization said, “The two Trump companies that the Manhattan DA has been targeting, however, will not be taking a plea for the simple reason that they have done nothing wrong. As a result, we now look forward to having our day in court, which, quite interestingly, has been scheduled for October 24 – just days before the midterm elections.”\n\nThe statement went on to call Allen Weisselberg, “a fine and honorable man” who has been “harassed, persecuted and threatened by law enforcement, particularly the Manhattan District Attorney,” all in an effort to get the former President.\n\nWeisselberg has been fiercely loyal to the Trump family, having worked for them since 1973. Yet even by providing testimony against the company Weisselberg will not implicate any Trump family members, who were not accused of any wrongdoing. If the Trump Organization is convicted, it could be required to pay back taxes and fines, but no individual will go to prison.\n\n“Today Allen Weisselberg admitted in Court that he used his position at the Trump Organization to bilk taxpayers and enrich himself,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement. “This plea agreement directly implicates the Trump Organization in a wide range of criminal activity and requires Weisselberg to provide invaluable testimony in the upcoming trial against the corporation. Furthermore, thanks to the incredibly hard work and dedication of the team prosecuting this case, Weisselberg will spend time behind bars. We look forward to proving our case in court against the Trump Organization,” Bragg said.\n\nWeisselberg will likely serve at Rikers Island, New York City’s notorious jail. With credit given for good behavior, one-third of the sentence could be knocked off, meaning Weisselberg could end up serving about 100 days behind bars. None of the charges facing Weisselberg have mandatory incarceration but the most serious of the charges has a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass said during the hearing that if Weisselberg fails to meet all of the obligations, they will recommend a sentence in state prison.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney’s office announced the tax charges last summer as it put pressure on Weisselberg to cooperate against Trump in the wide-ranging investigation into whether the Trump Organization and its top executives provided misleading financial statements to obtain loans, insurance and tax benefits. No charges have been brought in that investigation, which prosecutors say is continuing.\n\nWeisselberg is not cooperating with New York prosecutors in that criminal investigation.\n\nThe guilty plea comes two months before Weisselberg was set to go to trial and one week after a New York state judge denied his motion to dismiss the indictment.\n\nRepresentatives for the Trump Organization have denied any wrongdoing. Trump has called the investigations politically motivated. No other executive was indicted in the tax case and Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump were not accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Trump Organization was charged with 10 counts and Weisselberg with 15 felony counts in connection with an alleged scheme stretching back to 2005 “to compensate Weisselberg and other Trump Organization executives in a manner that was “off the books.”\n\nThere are few people, including Weisselberg, who could explain how decisions were made in the Trump Organization, and his testimony will provide insights at trial.\n\nWeisselberg acknowledged Thursday that the scheme was carried out with Jeffrey McConney, the longtime controller of the Trump Organization.\n\nMcConney, who reported to Weisselberg, received immunity for his testimony before the grand jury, people familiar with the matter previously told CNN. He was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment.\n\nWeisselberg’s guilty plea comes during a dramatic legal period for Trump, who last week at a deposition in the New York attorney general’s civil investigation, asserted his Fifth Amendment right and declined to answer hundreds of questions about the Trump Organization’s financial statements.\n\nThat came two days after the FBI executed a search warrant on Trump’s private Mar-a-lago residence in Florida, as part of a criminal investigation into the handling of presidential records, including classified documents.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell"], "publish_date": "2022/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns/index.html", "title": "5 reasons Donald Trump really doesn't want his tax returns released ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story was originally published on October 31, 2022, and has been updated to reflect the latest developments.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court issued an order on Tuesday that clears the way for a House committee to obtain Donald Trump’s tax returns, seemingly putting an end to a years-long saga in which the former president fought the release of his returns.\n\nTrump broke with recent tradition for presidents and presidential candidates by refusing to release his past tax records, insisting that he was under audit and therefore could not release the returns. He can release them even while he’s under audit. He has also repeatedly insisted that tax returns provide little financial information. (This is also not true.)\n\nTrump’s repeated attempts to keep his tax returns private – over years – begs the simple question: Why? And there are several potential reasons that jump to mind:\n\n1) Trump may not be as rich as he says he is. Not long after Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015, he said he was worth upwards of $10 billion. Forbes estimated his net worth was less than half that that year. Trump appears to use outlandishly elevated claims of his wealth as proof positive he is smarter (and better) than most people. It’s uniquely possible that a release of his tax returns would take the air out of a balloon that Trump has been blowing up for much of his adult life.\n\n2) He may not pay (or hasn’t paid) his fair share of taxes, despite his claims that he pays “a lot.” We know, thanks to reporting from The New York Times, that Trump paid zero federal taxes in 11 of the 18 years of returns that the publication was able to obtain. And even in 2017, his first year as president, Trump paid just $750 in federal taxes – a paltry sum for someone as wealthy as he is. The Times estimated that “Trump has paid about $400 million less in combined federal income taxes than a very wealthy person who paid the average for that group each year.”\n\n3) The $73 million refund. We learned from the Times’ reporting that Trump applied for a $72.9 million tax refund in 2010. (He claimed large losses that were widely attributed at the time to the decline of his Atlantic City casinos.) The IRS started its audit of the refund in 2011, which was still ongoing as of 2020. It’s uniquely possible that Trump simply doesn’t want to have the refund issue brought back up, for fear he might be on the hook for the amount.\n\n4) Trump may have loans with foreign countries or individuals. We know, via congressional testimony from former Trump confidante Michael Cohen, that the former president was deeply involved in the potential construction of Trump Tower Moscow. And that Cohen lied about that involvement (and how long it stretched) to protect Trump. Donald Trump Jr. reportedly said at a 2008 real estate conference: “In terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. Say, in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo, and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”\n\n5) He might not donate much (or anything) to charity. Trump long used his charitable organization to feather his own nest and collect political chits rather than for any philanthropic purposes. (Trump shut down the charity in 2018.) It’s not at all clear how generous (if at all) Trump has been to other charities over the past few decades. While there is no requirement for wealthy individuals to make large charitable donations, many do. And so, it would be a decidedly bad look for Trump if it looked like his repeated claims of largesse donated to charity wound up being false.\n\nWhatever the reason – or reasons – it’s been clear for the last seven years that Trump is absolutely dead set on keeping his returns private. Which makes the Supreme Court’s move on Tuesday all the more important.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}]}

On average, 24 people were forced to flee each minute in 2015, the U.N. said.\n\nUN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said refugees also face increasing dangers.\n\n“At sea, a frightening number of refugees and migrants are dying each year; on land, people fleeing war are finding their way blocked by closed borders,\" Grandi said. \"Closing borders does not solve the problem.”\n\nThe report blames the booming refugee numbers in part on large numbers of refugees from places such as Somalia and Afghanistan, where wars have dragged on for decades.

An estimated 1 million people fled Syria and nearby nations through Turkey to Greece last year, many of them risking their lives in crowded boats to seek asylum in the European Union. Thousands remain stuck on Greek islands, and more are on the mainland.\n\nPresident Obama issued a statement Monday recognizing World Refugee Day, announcing that he will convene a Leaders' Summit on Refugees in New York in September.

Dramatic video filmed Wednesday showed crowds of people on a platform at Kharkiv train station queuing to get on a train to Uzhgorod, in the west, carrying their children and pets as they fled an assault on the city.\n\nWorryingly, a “big number” of those crossing into Poland are unaccompanied children, according to Poland’s Ambassador to the UN Krzysztof Szczerski. Many children crossing the border are leaving behind parents – particularly their fathers, who have been called by the Ukrainian government to stay behind and fend off Russian troops, he said.\n\nHumanitarian corridors\n\nOn Thursday, a second round of talks between Russia and Ukraine ended with an agreement on humanitarian corridors for civilians, but Ukraine said there were no breakthroughs beyond that.\n\nSenior Ukrainian official Mykhailo Podoliak said in a tweet: “The second round of negotiations is over. Unfortunately, the results Ukraine needs are not yet achieved. There is a solution only for the organization of humanitarian corridors.”\n\nThe head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, outlined some of the two-and-a-half-hour discussion to Russian media.\n\n“We have thoroughly discussed three points – military, international and humanitarian, and the third one is an issue of a future political regulation of the conflict. Both positions are clear and written down. We managed to agree on some of them, but the key thing that we have reached an agreement on today was a matter of rescuing civilians who found themselves in a military clash zone. Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministries agreed on providing humanitarian corridors for civilians and on a possible temporary ceasefire in areas where evacuation is happening,” Medinsky told journalists.\n\nAnother member of the Russian delegation, Leonid Slutsky, told Russia 24 that both sides have agreed on the third round of talks, which will happen in the “nearest future.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Czech government has declared a 30-day state of emergency from Friday in anticipation of a major influx of people fleeing the conflict.\n\nThe European Union has made the “historic decision” to grant temporary protection to all refugees fleeing the conflict, said the bloc’s Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, on Thursday.\n\nThe United Nations World Food Programme has launched an emergency operation to provide food assistance to people within Ukraine and in neighboring countries following an official request from the Ukrainian government. The organization is calling for $570 million to help refugees fleeing violence amid Russia’s ongoing invasion.\n\nMichelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement Thursday that, in addition to those who had left the country, one million people were displaced internally.\n\nBachelet said: “Thousands of people, including older people, pregnant women, as well as children and people with disabilities, are being forced to gather in underground shelters and subway stations to escape explosions. Many people in situations of vulnerability are separated from families and effectively trapped.”\n\nWith the scale of the humanitarian disaster becoming ever more apparent, the International Criminal Court announced Wednesday it had opened an immediate active investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\nICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement Wednesday his office “had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible.”\n\nThe move came as the United States and other Western officials warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be shifting his strategy to further target cities and civilian infrastructure with heavy weapons and potentially “tens of thousands” of troops.\n\nThe Russian government has “strongly” rejected accusations that it has committed war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the war, but the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission estimates there have been 750 civilian casualties. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers but there are fears of further casualties as Russian strikes hit built-up areas.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United Kingdom said it was “gravely concerned” by “reports of the use of cluster munitions” by Russia during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. And earlier that day, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine.\n\n“We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield. That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs – which are banned under the Geneva Convention,” she said. Vacuum bombs, or thermobaric bombs are filled with high-temperature, high-pressure explosives and when detonated suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine, though CNN saw Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, on February 26.\n\nThe Russian advance in the south of Ukraine shows the beginning of a potential land bridge that could link the port city of Odessa, through Kherson and Mariupol to the separatist-held pro-Moscow territories in the east.\n\n“It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea. I mean that is an obvious objective,” NATO’s former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe Richard Shirreff told CNN.\n\nHe said he feared the push could cause an increase in civilian deaths as cities become ruins.\n\n“I’m afraid to say I don’t think we have seen anything yet in terms of the destruction that’s likely to happen,” Shirreff added.", "authors": ["Helen Regan Paul P.

A year later, he launched a conflict that spiraled into a brutal civil war, spawning one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.\n\nIn November 2020, Abiy ordered a military offensive in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region and promised that the clash would be resolved quickly. Two years on, the fighting has left thousands dead, displaced more than 2 million people and given rise to a wave of atrocities, including massacres, sexual violence and the use of starvation as a weapon of war.\n\nEthiopia was struggling with significant economic, ethnic and political challenges long before a feud between Abiy and the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), bubbled over into unrest and threatened to pull Africa’s second-most populous country apart.\n\nNow, after years of grinding conflict, the Ethiopian government and the leadership of the TPLF have agreed to cease hostilities and pull the country back from the brink. But the surprise truce leaves many questions unanswered, with few details on how it will be implemented and monitored.\n\nHere’s a closer look at what’s happening in Ethiopia.\n\nHow did the conflict start?\n\nAn Ethiopian refugee prays at an Orthodox church near a refugee camp in Gedaref, eastern Sudan, on December 6, 2020. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Tigray conflict has its roots in tensions that go back generations in Ethiopia.\n\nThe country is made up of 10 regions – and two cities – that have a substantial amount of autonomy, including regional police and militia. Because of a previous conflict with neighboring Eritrea, there are also a large number of federal troops in Tigray. Regional governments are largely divided along entrenched ethnic lines.\n\nBefore Abiy Ahmed came to power, the TPLF had governed Ethiopia with an iron grip for decades, overseeing a period of stability and economic growth at the cost of basic civil and political rights. The party’s authoritarian rule provoked a popular uprising that ultimately forced Abiy’s predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn, to resign.\n\nIn 2018, Abiy was appointed by the ruling class to quell tensions and bring change, without upending the old political order. But almost as soon as he became prime minister, Abiy announced the rearrangement of the ruling coalition that the TPLF had founded – the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Front, or EPRDF, which was composed of four parties – into a single, new Prosperity Party, ostracizing the TPLF in the process.\n\nIn his drive for a new pan-Ethiopian political party, Abiy sparked fears in some regions that the country’s federal system – which guarantees significant autonomy to ethnically-defined states such as Tigray – was under threat. Leaders in Tigray withdrew to their mountainous heartland in the north, where they continued to control their own regional government.\n\nTensions boiled over in September 2020, when the Tigrayans defied Abiy by going ahead with regional parliamentary elections that he had delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Abiy called the vote illegal and lawmakers cut funding to the TPLF leadership, setting off a tit-for-tat series of escalations between the regional and the federal government.\n\nOn November 4, 2020, after accusing the TPLF of attacking a federal army base outside Tigray’s regional capital Mekelle and attempting to steal its weapons, Abiy ordered a military assault against the group, sending in national troops and fighters from the neighboring region of Amhara, along with soldiers from Eritrea. Getachew Reda, a senior TPLF leader, said in an op-ed in Foreign Policy that the group attacked the base in an “act of self-defense.” CNN cannot confirm the claims of either side.\n\nAbiy declared the offensive a success after just three weeks, but the conflict dragged on for two years, with both sides trading control over the regional capital Mekelle, gaining and losing ground.\n\nAn earlier humanitarian ceasefire broke down in August and fighting has intensified in the months since. The clashes, combined with a lack of fuel and the communications blackout, has severely curtailed aid distribution to the region.\n\nOn October 17, amid reports of heavy bombing in Shire and other Tigrayan cities, and food supplies running out in the regional capital Mekelle triggering fears of famine, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that the situation in the Tigray region was “spiraling out of control,” and that the violence had “reached alarming levels.”\n\nThe UN chief called for an “immediate withdrawal and disengagement of Eritrean armed forces from Ethiopia,” and the urgent resumption of talks, which had been due to take place in September.\n\nA damaged tank on a road north of Mekelle, the capital of Tigray, on February 26 EDUARDO SOTERAS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhat does the peace agreement actually mean?\n\nAfter just over a week of formal peace talks mediated by the African Union (AU) in South Africa’s administrative capital Pretoria, delegates from both sides of Ethiopia’s war agreed to a “permanent cessation of hostilities.” The surprise truce was signed by Getachew Reda from the TPLF and Redwan Hussein, national security adviser to Ethiopia’s federal government, on the eve of the second anniversary of the start of the war, on November 3.\n\nThe document laid out a number of key objectives, including the disarmament of fighters, unhindered humanitarian access to Tigray, repairing essential services in the region, providing a framework for accountability and justice, and restoring some semblance of stability in the country.\n\n“We have agreed to permanently silence the guns and end the two years of conflict in northern Ethiopia,” both sides said in a joint statement, published after delegates shook hands.\n\nThose involved in mediating the deal signaled that it was just the first in a long series of steps toward negotiating a more enduring peace. Mediators have also warned that forces fighting on the ground could easily disrupt the pact. Still, the UN has called it a “critical first step” towards ending the conflict.\n\n“This is not the end of the peace process but the beginning of it,” said Olusegun Obasanjo, the AU’s high representative for the Horn of Africa and a former Nigerian president, who first announced the deal.\n\nAbiy, whose military, backed by Eritrean forces, has made rapid gains in Tigray over recent weeks, celebrated the conclusion of the talks, saying: “Our commitment to peace remains steadfast. And our commitment to collaborating for the implementation of the agreement is equally strong.”\n\nBut how the deal will be implemented is unclear, with analysts pointing out that the text raises more questions than it answers.\n\n“These kinds of agreements should include constructive ambiguity, on the issues that are contested,” Kjetil Tronvoll, an expert on Ethiopian politics at Bjorknes University College in Norway, told CNN. “But here it’s not constructive it’s more destructive, in that it will undermine the trust process and could possibly jeopardize the durability of the agreement.”\n\nRepresentatives from Ethiopia and the TPLF and mediators at a press conference announcing the agreement in Pretoria, South Africa. Phill Magakoe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere are a number of points in the agreement that Tronvoll said raise concerns, particularly one issue that was omitted entirely: the status of Eritrean forces in Tigray, which the text makes no mention of in spite of their outsized role in the conflict. Though the agreement states that the Ethiopian military will be deployed along the country’s borders, it does not specify whether they will ensure Eritrea’s withdrawal. “I don’t see any sustainable peace process if Eritrean forces are still on the ground,” Tronvoll said.\n\nThe deal is widely being seen as a capitulation by the TPLF, which, by Getachew’s own account, have suffered huge losses since hostilities resumed. “In order to address the pains of our people, we have made concessions because we have to build trust,” he said, adding that civilians and fighters were dying as he spoke.\n\nThe swift 30-day timeline for the overall disarmament and demobilization of Tigrayan fighters has raised eyebrows. And the agreement does not outline what force will replace them to provide security guarantees for Tigray’s civilian population, who have suffered widespread abuses at the hands of Ethiopian forces.\n\nThe agreement also states that the Ethiopian government will ensure “accountability, ascertaining the truth, redress for victims,” but ultimately how that accountability might come about is opaque.\n\n“It’s one of the key issues left unanswered … how accountability will come about,” Tronvoll said. “Ultimately it is the generals and Abiy Ahmed himself who should be held to account. I don’t know if anyone believes he’ll sign off on an agreement in which he would be put on trial.”\n\nWhat atrocities have been committed in the conflict?\n\nFor months at the start of the conflict, Abiy denied that civilians were being harmed or that soldiers from Eritrea had joined the fight. But reports from international observers, human rights groups and CNN proved both of those claims wrong.\n\nThousands of people have died in the fighting, by many estimates, with reports of razed refugee camps, looting, sexual violence, massacres and extrajudicial killings. Many more have fled to Sudan, in what the United Nations has called the worst exodus of refugees from Ethiopia seen in two decades. They describe a disastrous conflict that’s given rise to ethnic violence.\n\nEthiopia’s government has severely restricted access to journalists, and a state-enforced communications blackout concealed events in the region, making it challenging to gauge the extent of the crisis or verify survivors’ accounts.\n\nBut evidence of atrocities began to leak out last year.\n\nTigrayans grieve by a mass grave in the city of Wukro, north of Mekele, on February 28, 2021. EDUARDO SOTERAS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCNN investigations have uncovered evidence of massacres carried out in two Tigrayan towns, by Eritrean forces in Dengelat, and by Ethiopian soldiers in Mahibere Dego. A CNN team on the ground in central Tigray last April captured Eritrean troops – some disguising themselves in old Ethiopian military uniforms – operating with total impunity, manning checkpoints and blocking vital humanitarian aid to starving populations more than a month after Abiy pledged to the international community that they would leave.\n\nAll actors in the conflict have been accused of carrying out atrocities, but Eritrean forces have been linked to some of the most gruesome. In addition to perpetrating mass killings and rape, Eritrean soldiers have also been found blocking and looting food relief in multiple parts of Tigray.\n\nEritrea’s government has denied any involvement in atrocities. Ethiopia’s government has pledged investigations into any wrongdoing.\n\nThe conflict, which erupted during the autumn harvest season following the worst invasion of desert locusts in Ethiopia in decades, plunged Tigray even further into severe food insecurity. The UN has repeatedly issued warnings about de facto humanitarian aid blockades, barring critical food and assistance to Tigray.\n\nThe Ethiopian government has repeatedly rejected allegations that it is blocking aid. But days after the UN’s aid chief warned Tigray was facing a “man-made” famine, Ethiopia ordered seven senior UN officials to be expelled from the country, including from organizations coordinating relief efforts.\n\nThere are currently about 5.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Tigray, including 3.8 million in desperate need of healthcare, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nOn the same day that the truce was announced, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it had been two months since the last humanitarian aid reached the region, and that large numbers of displaced people were arriving in or moving toward Mekelle seeking assistance every day.\n\n“Since the beginning of the siege, food, medicine and other basic services have been weaponised,” Tedros said. “It has now been more than two months since the last humanitarian aid reached Tigray. But even before that, the aid reaching Tigray was a trickle – nowhere near enough to meet the needs.”\n\nHow did Abiy win the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed campaigns in Jimma on June 16, 2021. Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than a year before Abiy launched an assault on his own people, he described war as “the epitome of hell” during his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize. He was awarded the honor for his role in ending a long-running conflict with neighboring Eritrea and for pushing significant reforms in Ethiopia.\n\nEritrea was once a part of Ethiopia, but won independence in 1993 after a 30-year armed struggle. From 1998 to 2000, Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a war that killed thousands on both sides, which led to a long, dangerous stalemate and a total freeze in cooperation.\n\nOnce in power, Abiy moved quickly to normalize relations with Eritrea, in part by accepting the ruling of an international commission on boundaries between the two states.\n\nAbiy also made significant moves towards domestic reforms, raising hopes that he would bring about lasting change. As well as forging a truce with Eritrea, he lifted a severe security law, released thousands of political prisoners, moved to open up the telecommunications industry and expand private investment.\n\nBut his reputation as a leader who could unite Ethiopia has swiftly deteriorated, and his much-lauded peace deal with Eritrea appears to have paved the way for the two countries to go to war with their mutual foe – the TPLF.\n\nSince the conflict began, ethnically-driven violence has broken out into other parts of the country, including in Abiy’s home region, Oromia, the country’s most populous region. Last May, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), an armed group, vowed to wage “total war” against Abiy’s government.\n\nDespite promises to heal ethnic divides and pave the way for a peaceful, democratic transition, Abiy has increasingly invoked the playbook of repressive regimes: Shutting down internet and telephone services, arresting journalists and suppressing critics. Abiy has also been criticized for fueling “inflamed” rhetoric amid the conflict in Tigray, whose forces he has described as “weeds” and “cancer.”\n\nLast July, in the midst of the war, Abiy and his party won a landslide victory in a general election that was boycotted by opposition parties, marred by logistical issues and excluded many voters, including all those in Tigray – a crushing disappointment to many who had high hopes that the democratic transition Abiy promised would be realized.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/middleeast/shireen-abu-akleh-jenin-killing-investigation-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "New evidence suggests Shireen Abu Akleh was killed in targeted ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story contains a disturbing image.\n\nCNN —\n\nSeveral shots ring out in quick succession, cutting through a clear, blue spring morning in Jenin, in the West Bank. Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack.\n\nThe cameraman filming the scene scrambles backwards to take cover behind a low concrete wall. Then a man cries out in Arabic: “Injured! Shireen, Shireen, oh man, Shireen! Ambulance!”\n\nWhen the camera operator pans around the corner, Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh can be seen lying motionless, face down on the ground as another Palestinian reporter, Shatha Hanaysha, crouches down beside her, using a tree trunk for cover. Hanaysha reaches out and tries to rouse her as gunshots continue. There’s no response. Both women are wearing helmets and blue protective vests marked “Press.”\n\nIn the moments that follow, a man in a white T-shirt makes several attempts to move Abu Akleh, but is forced back repeatedly by gunfire. Finally, after a few long minutes, he manages to drag her body from the street.\n\nThe shaky video, filmed by Al Jazeera cameraman Majdi Banura, captures the scene when Abu Akleh, a 51-year-old Palestinian-American was killed by a bullet to the head at around 6:30 a.m. on May 11. She had been standing with a group of journalists near the entrance of Jenin refugee camp, where they had come to cover an Israeli raid. While the footage does not show Abu Akleh being shot, eyewitnesses told CNN that they believe Israeli forces on the same street fired deliberately on the reporters in a targeted attack. All of the journalists were wearing protective blue vests that identified them as members of the news media. ​\n\n“We stood in front of the Israeli military vehicles for about five to ten minutes before we made moves to ensure they saw us. And this is a habit of ours as journalists, we move as a group and we stand in front of them so they know we are journalists, and then we start moving,” Hanaysha told CNN, describing their cautious approach toward the Israeli army convoy, before the gunfire began.\n\nWhen Abu Akleh was shot, Hanaysha said she was in shock. She couldn’t understand what was happening. After Abu Akleh dropped to the ground, Hanaysha thought she might have stumbled. But when she looked down at the reporter she had idolized since childhood, it was clear she wasn’t breathing. Blood was pooling under her head.\n\n“As soon as she [Shireen] fell, I honestly wasn’t comprehending that she [was shot] … I was hearing the sound of bullets, but I wasn’t comprehending that they were coming at us. Honestly, the whole time I wasn’t understanding,” she said.\n\n“I thought they were shooting so we stayed back, I didn’t think they were trying to kill us.”\n\nOn the day of the shooting, Israeli military spokesperson Ran Kochav told Army Radio that Abu Akleh had been “filming and working for a media outlet amidst armed Palestinians. They’re armed with cameras, if you’ll permit me to say so,” according to The Times of Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military says it is not clear who fired the fatal shot. In a preliminary inquiry, the army said there was a possibility Abu Akleh was hit either by indiscriminate Palestinian gunfire, or by an Israeli sniper positioned about 200 meters (about 656 feet) away in an exchange of fire with Palestinian gunmen — though neither Israel nor anyone else has provided evidence showing armed Palestinians within a clear line of fire from Abu Akleh.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on May 19 that it had not yet decided whether to pursue a criminal investigation into Abu Akleh’s death. On Monday, the Israeli military’s top lawyer, Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said in a speech that under the military’s policy, a criminal investigation is not automatically launched if a person is killed in the “midst of an active combat zone,” unless there is credible and immediate suspicion of a criminal offense. United States lawmakers, the United Nations and ​the international community ​have all called for an independent probe.\n\nBut an investigation by CNN offers new evidence — including two videos of the scene of the shooting — that there was no active combat, nor any Palestinian militants, near Abu Akleh in the moments leading up to her death. Videos obtained by CNN, corroborated by testimony from eight eyewitnesses, an audio forensic analyst and an explosive weapons expert, suggest that Abu Akleh was shot dead in a targeted attack by Israeli forces.\n\nAl Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Facebook/Shireen Abu Akleh\n\nThe footage shows a calm scene before the reporters came under fire in the outskirts of Jenin refugee camp, near the main Awdeh roundabout. Hanaysha, four other journalists and three local residents said that it had been a normal morning in Jenin, home to about 345,000 people — 11,400 of whom live in the camp. Many were on their way to work or school, and the street was relatively quiet.\n\nThere was a frisson of excitement as the veteran journalist, a household name across the Arab world for her coverage of Israel and the Palestinian territories, arrived to report on the raid. About a dozen or so men, some dressed in sweats and flip-flops, had gathered to watch Abu Akleh and her colleagues at work. They were milling around chatting, some smoking cigarettes, others filming the scene on their phones.\n\nIn one 16-minute cellphone video shared with CNN, the man filming walks toward the spot where the journalists had gathered, zooming in on the Israeli armored vehicles parked in the distance, and says: “Look at the snipers.” Then, when a teenager peers tentatively up the street, he shouts: “Don’t kid around … you think it’s a joke? We don’t want to die. We want to live.”\n\nIsraeli raids on the Jenin refugee camp have become a regular occurrence since early April, in the wake of several attacks by Palestinians that left Israelis and foreigners dead. Some of the suspected assailants of those attacks were from Jenin, according to the Israeli military. Residents say the raids often lead to injuries and deaths. On Saturday, a 17-year-old Palestinian was killed and an 18-year-old was critically injured by Israeli fire during a raid, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.\n\nSalim Awad, the 27-year-old Jenin camp resident who filmed the 16-minute video, told CNN that there were no armed Palestinians or any clashes in the area, and he hadn’t expected there to be gunfire, given the presence of journalists nearby.\n\n“There was no conflict or confrontations at all. We were about 10 guys, give or take, walking around, laughing and joking with the journalists,” he said. “We were not afraid of anything. We didn’t expect anything would happen, because when we saw journalists around, we thought it’d be a safe area.”\n\nBut the situation changed rapidly. Awad said shooting broke out about seven minutes after he arrived at the scene. His video captures the moment that shots were fired at the four journalists — Abu Akleh, Hanaysha, another Palestinian journalist, Mujahid al-Saadi, and Al Jazeera producer Ali al-Samoudi, who was injured in the gunfire — as they walked toward the Israeli vehicles. In the footage, Abu Akleh can be seen turning away from the barrage. The footage shows a direct line of sight towards the Israeli convoy.\n\nPalestinian journalist Shatha Hanaysha pictured in the West Bank city of Ramallah on May 12, a day after she and Abu Akleh came under fire.

We were standing right there, we saw it. When we tried to approach her, they shot at us. I tried to cross the street to help, but I couldn’t,” Awad said, adding that he saw that a bullet struck Abu Akleh in the gap between her helmet and protective vest, just by her ear.\n\nA 16-year-old, who was among the group of men and boys on the street, told CNN that there were “no shots fired, no stone throwing, nothing,” before Abu Akleh was shot. He said that the journalists had told them not to follow as they walked toward Israeli forces, so he stayed back. When the gunfire broke out, he said he ducked behind a car on the road, three meters away, where he watched the moment she was killed. The teenager shared a video with CNN, filmed at 6:36 a.m., just after the journalists left the scene for the hospital, which showed the five Israeli army vehicles driving slowly past the spot where Abu Akleh died. The convoy then turns left before leaving the camp via the roundabout.\n\nCNN reviewed a total of 11 videos showing the scene and the Israeli military convoy from different angles — before, during and after Abu Akleh was killed. Eyewitnesses who were filming when the journalist was shot were also in the line of fire and pulled back when the gunfire started, so do not capture the moment she is hit with the bullet. ​\n\nThe visual evidence reviewed by CNN includes a body camera video released by the Israeli military, which captures soldiers running through a narrow alleyway, holding M16 assault rifles, and variants, as they spill out onto the street where the armored vehicles are parked. An Israeli military source told CNN that both sides were firing M16 and M4 style assault rifles that day.\n\nIn the videos, five Israeli vehicles can be seen lined up in a row on the same road where Abu Akleh was killed, to the south. The vehicle closest to the journalists, emblazoned with a white number one, and the vehicle furthest away, marked with the number five, are both positioned perpendicular across the street. Toward the rear of the vehicles, directly above the numbers, is a narrow rectangular opening in the exterior of the vehicle.\n\nThe Israeli military referenced such an opening in a statement about its initial investigation into Abu Akleh’s shooting, saying that the journalist may have been hit by an Israeli soldier shooting from a “designated firing hole in an IDF vehicle using a telescopic scope,” during an exchange of fire. Several eyewitnesses told CNN that they saw sniper rifles sticking out of the openings before the shooting began, but that it was not preceded by any other gunfire.\n\nJamal Huwail, a professor at the Arab American University in Jenin, who helped drag Abu Akleh’s lifeless body from the road, said he believed the shots were coming from one of the Israeli vehicles, which he described as a “new model which had an opening for snipers,” because of the elevation and direction of the bullets.\n\n“They were shooting directly at the journalists,” Huwail said.\n\nHuwail, a former parliamentarian and member of the Palestinian Fatah Party in Jenin, first met Abu Akleh two decades ago, when Israel launched a major military operation in the camp, destroying more than 400 homes and displacing a quarter of its population. When he spoke with the journalist briefly that morning of May 11 at the Awdeh roundabout, she had showed him a video of one of their early interviews from 2002. The next time he saw her up close, she was dead.\n\nShireen Abu Akleh lies face down in the street, after having been shot in the head. from Al Jazeera\n\nIn videos of the dawn army raid on Jenin camp earlier in the morning, Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants can be seen battling each other with M16 assault rifles and variants, according to Chris Cobb-Smith, an explosive weapons expert. That means both sides would have been shooting 5.56-millimeter bullets. To trace the bullet that killed Abu Akleh to the barrel of a specific gun would likely require a joint Israeli-Palestinian probe, since the Palestinians have the bullet that killed Abu Akleh, while CNN’s investigation suggests the Israelis have the gun. None is immediately forthcoming. While Israel weighs whether to launch a criminal investigation, the Palestinian Authority has ruled out collaborating with the Israelis on any investigation.\n\nA senior Israeli security official flatly denied to CNN on May 18 that Israeli troops killed Abu Akleh intentionally. The official spoke under the condition of anonymity to discuss details about an investigation that remains formally open.\n\n“In no way would the IDF ever target a civilian, especially a member of the press,” the official told CNN.\n\n“An IDF soldier would never fire an M16 on automatic. They shoot bullet by bullet,” the official said, in contrast with ​Israel’s assertion that Palestinian militants were firing “recklessly and indiscriminately” while its soldiers conducted the raid in Jenin.\n\nIn a statement emailed to CNN, the IDF said it was conducting an investigation into the killing of Abu Akleh. It “calls on the Palestinian Authority to cooperate with a joint forensic examination with American representatives to conclusively determine the source of the tragic death.”\n\nAnd added, “assertions regarding the source of the fire that killed Ms. Abu Akleh must be carefully made and backed by hard evidence. This is what the IDF is striving to achieve.”\n\nEven without access to the bullet that hit Abu Akleh, there are ways to determine who killed Abu Akleh by analyzing the type of gunfire, the sound of the shots and the marks left by the bullets at the scene.\n\nCobb-Smith, a security consultant and British army veteran, told CNN he believed Abu Akleh was killed in discrete shots — not a burst of automatic gunfire. To reach that conclusion, he looked at imagery obtained by CNN, which show markings the bullets left on the tree where Abu Akleh fell and Hanaysha was taking cover.\n\n“The number of strike marks on the tree where Shireen was standing proves this wasn’t a random shot, she was targeted,” Cobb-Smith told CNN, adding that, in sharp contrast, the majority of gunfire from Palestinians captured on camera that day were “random sprays.”\n\nPalestinian journalist Mujahid al-Saadi, who was with Abu Akleh when she was killed, points to bullet marks on the tree in Jenin where she died. Nedal Eshtayah/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nAs evidence, he pointed to two videos that showed Palestinian gunmen firing haphazardly down alleyways in different parts of Jenin. The videos were circulated by the office of Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and Israel’s foreign ministry, with a voiceover in Arabic saying: “They’ve hit one — they’ve hit a soldier. He’s lying on the ground.”\n\nBecause no Israeli soldiers were reported killed on May 11, Bennett’s office said the video suggested that “Palestinian terrorists were the ones who shot the journalist.” CNN geolocated the videos shared by Bennett’s office to the south of the camp, more than 300 meters, or 1,000 feet, away from Abu Akleh. The coordinates of the two locations, which were verified using Mapillary, a crowdsourced street imagery platform, and footage of the area filmed by Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, demonstrate that the shooting in the videos couldn’t be the same volley of gunfire that hit Abu Akleh and her producer, Ali al-Samoudi. CNN was also unable to verify independently when the footage was filmed.\n\nAccording to the Israeli army’s initial inquiry, at the time of Abu Akleh’s death, an Israeli sniper was 200 meters away from her. CNN asked Robert Maher, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University, who specializes in forensic audio analysis, to assess the footage of Abu Akleh’s shooting and estimate the distance between the gunman and the cameraman, taking into account the rifle being used by the Israeli forces.\n\nThe video that Maher analyzed captures two volleys of gunfire; eyewitnesses say Abu Akleh was hit in the second barrage, a series of seven sharp “cracks.” The first “crack” sound, the ballistic shockwave of the bullet, is followed approximately 309 milliseconds later by the relatively quiet “bang” of the muzzle blast, according to Maher. “That would correspond to a distance of something between 177 and 197 meters,” or 580 and 646 feet, he said in an email to CNN, which corresponds almost exactly with the Israeli sniper’s position.\n\nAt 200 meters, Cobb-Smith said that there was “no chance” that random firing would result in three or four shots hitting in such a tight configuration. “From the strike marks on the tree, it appears that the shots, one of which hit Shireen, came from down the street from the direction of the IDF troops. The relatively tight grouping of the rounds indicate Shireen was intentionally targeted with aimed shots and not the victim of random or stray fire,” the firearms expert told CNN.\n\nA Palestinian artist paints a mural in Gaza City honoring Shireen Abu Akleh, and depicting Shatha Hanaysha crouching beside her after she was killed. Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nThe tree is now referred to in Jenin as the “journalist tree” and has become a makeshift shrine to Abu Akleh, with photographs of the beloved reporter taped to the trunk and Palestinian kaffiyeh scarves draped from its branches.\n\nAwad, one of the Jenin residents who inadvertently captured Abu Akleh’s killing on camera, said the first time he saw her in person was in 2002, when she was covering the Intifada, or uprising, in Jenin. “She is of course loved by so many, but she has a very special memory in our camp specifically because of the work she has done here.

It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow’s invasion on February 24.\n\nThe agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday.\n\nOne convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city’s regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy.\n\n“At the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,” Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. “After 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy.”\n\nThe frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians “hostage” in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that a long-awaited convoy of humanitarian aid to the city appeared to have come under fire on Tuesday. Russian troops are not allowing “children, women and the elderly” out of the city, and have launched an attack “precisely in the direction of the humanitarian corridor,” Ukraine’s Joint Forces Operation said.\n\nCNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response.\n\nA senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been “isolated” by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it “in any significant way.”\n\nCNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days.\n\nMeanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught.\n\n“The main issue today remains humanitarian aid,” Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video.\n\nResidents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are “forced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,” he said, adding that Moscow is preventing “humanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces “violated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,” following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army’s advance in northern Ukraine.\n\nThat warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing “several civilians” trying to evacuate the town of Irpin.\n\nZelensky calls for help as Ukrainians flee west\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the “sidelines” of the Russian invasion.\n\nAddressing the UK’s House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that “we will fight to the end,” echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s famous wartime speech.\n\n“We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,” he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to “strengthen the sanctions” against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia “as a terrorist state” and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine.\n\nNATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a “responsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine” during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits.\n\n“That would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,” said Stoltenberg. “The situation could spiral out of control,” he said.\n\nOn the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week.\n\nIn the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city.\n\n“In order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,” Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. “If the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.”\n\nExplosions are seen in the southern city of Mykolaiv on Monday. From Telegram\n\nThe senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling.\n\nThe official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country.\n\nIn total Russia has launched “nearly 670” missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nAlmost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, “the other half largely from inside Ukraine,” the official said. “A little bit more than 70” missiles have been fired from Belarus, and “only a half dozen or so” are coming from the Black Sea, the official added.\n\nA humanitarian crisis keeps growing\n\nMeanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia’s invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began.\n\nThe milestone is a “terrifying” number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries “where they have connections, family,” he added.\n\n“What worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,” said Grandi.\n\nAt least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta Jack Guy", "Rob Picheta", "Jack Guy"], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/12/10/students-reflect-right-safe-home/95155494/", "title": "Students reflect on the right to a safe home", "text": "Argus Leader\n\nSix Sioux Falls middle school students were recognized Saturday for their essays marking Human Rights Day. The essay topic this year, \"The Right to Seek a Safe Place to Live,\" is one of the 30 rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is celebrated around the world each Dec. 10 on the anniversary of its signing.\n\nHere are the first-place winning essays for seventh grade and eighth grade.\n\n'Refuge'\n\nBy seventh-grade winner Caleb Miller, Patrick Henry Middle School\n\nI walk for another mile and\n\nthen lay down to rest. I look up at the night sky not knowing where I am. My village and everything I’ve ever known burned down, and now I am walking to Ethiopia where hopefully I will be safe. For right now, I twitch at every sound as I lay in the mashed down grass. I think, “When will I get back home?”\n\nHome. A place to sleep. A place to stay. A place to live. Some of us in America take our home for granted. Most times we go through life without even thinking about the many people who don’t get the things we do. Imagine having the ground for your king size bed. Having a train race by you every four minutes as you cling to the subway wall. The three basic needs of a human are food, water and shelter. What happens when someone doesn’t have those things?\n\nLast year, I started a project called Share A Shirt in which I get used T-shirts and provide them to children in South Sudan. After seeing what goes on their country, I desperately wanted to help them more, but what else can we do? Help doesn’t come by thinking, rather by taking action. We together can make sure everyone can have a bed at night. That’s why having a place to live is a right, not a privilege. So everyone has a home.\n\n'The Right to Seek a Safe Place to Live'\n\nBy eighth-grade winner Chloe Hartje, Patrick Henry Middle School\n\nFrom South Sudan’s vast camps, to armed forces in North Korea, to the wall threatened of being built between the United States and Mexico, it is obvious that the world’s system of protecting refugees is broken. All around the globe, 65 million people are forcibly displaced from their homes worldwide. These individuals are being restricted of their natural, human rights, including the right to seek a safe place to live. But goals related to improving the protection of refugees can be conquered by rebuilding strong refugee systems that were agreed during the aftermath of World War II.\n\nThese systems include: allowing people to apply for asylum, treating their refugee claims fairly, resettling the most vulnerable of all, and providing basics like education and health care (according to Amnesty International). This is not impossible to achieve if peaceful protests and campaigns are supported and fulfilled. For example, the United Kingdom has a reputation of granting refuge to those escaping persecution, saving the lives of many thousands of people who would have otherwise been killed. But, unfortunately, not all countries are as welcoming so there continues to be a need for countries such as the U.K. to provide a place of safety. With the development of the previously mentioned system, the world could unite to help solve the refugee crisis.\n\nPeople are dying while governments spend billions on border control, and this has to change immediately. Leaving people in complete destitution is inhumane and degrading, and we must help protect these vulnerable individuals.\n\n'Human'\n\nBy eighth-grade runner-up Srishti Kumari, Memorial Middle School\n\nYour life is full of passive pleasures: The ability to be able to sleep in for another 10 minutes, the meals available at a moment’s notice, the reassurance that ‘yes, you are safe.’ Millions of people don’t have what you have: a home.\n\nImagine – one day, your house, family, everything you’ve loved, is taken from you at a moment’s notice. Every day, 34,000 people experience this as war consumes their world.\n\nCurrently, we are in the midst of one of the worst refugee crises since World War II. Lives have been taken, families have been haunted, happiness has been stolen, and history repeats itself time after time.\n\n65.3 million. This number is made up of human beings: Wives and husbands, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, people who have families to love and care for, and people who don’t. This is also the amount of people displaced from their homes worldwide.\n\nRefugees have no choice in that matter, but you do. Yet the majority of the nation chooses to do nothing. You’ll watch the news. You’ll read the stories. You’ll feel bad, but you won’t choose to do anything because you don’t think you can.\n\nSo take a stand. Show the world your opinion matters. Lives can be saved because of you.\n\nYou just have to be accepting.\n\nYou just have to be human.\n\n'A Refuge from the Storm'\n\nBy eighth-grade runner-up Autumn Towe, Edison Middle School\n\nScreams, booms, and tremendous crashes are the sounds that fill many towns and cities lining the beautiful countries in West Africa. One million civilians were displaced in the civil war in Sierra Leone. One of these is a dear friend to my mother. In the winter of 2002 a young woman left her home in Freetown, Sierra Leone to escape from the death trap of her home. The long journey to a refugee camp weakened her body. Once she arrived to the dirty and extremely humble refugee camp, she was put on the very bottom of the list to be relocated. Just months later she gave birth to a baby girl. It was in the dark rainy night and lying on the sandy ground, she knew her life would be forever changed. Volunteers helped her through the painful labor and helped her name her baby. In the next week she was moved to the top of the list and sent to be relocated in Omaha, Nebraska. This woman is very lucky. Even though she went through things that many cannot even imagine, many refugees are in these dreadful camps for an average of 17 years. Who deserves that?\n\nThe people of Sioux Falls have done an excellent job welcoming incoming refugees, but we could do better by never ceasing to help these refugees thrive here in Sioux Falls, and also not leaving it to the few locations that help them, but we as community members can help the refugees by giving donations and just by giving our time. The United States, being a powerful country, can make a good and a big difference. So let’s do that and help this worldwide crisis.\n\n'A Universal Right: A Safe Place to Call Home'\n\nBy seventh-grade runner-up Nathan Koole, Sioux Falls Christian Middle School\n\nShantal is a refugee from Congo, Africa. She was forced to leave all of her belongings and come here to the United States, running for her life from civil war and tribal disputes. In the process, family members and close friends died in the conflict. At age 13 she came to the busy streets of New York with her closest family members and nothing but the clothes on their backs. Shocked by the way we live here, she and her family traveled from place to place searching for a home. They finally settled in Sioux Falls, SD, - a city that has offered a new start and a safe community.\n\nWhy are there an estimated 65.5 million refugees in the world today? Why are half of the world’s refugees children? These questions are hard to understand, but we should know why. The refugee crisis is caused by civil wars, religious persecution, and natural disasters. Many of the countries the refugees go to do not let them in due problems with security or financial issues. They end up getting stuck in between the home that they fled and their final destination.\n\nThese problems can seem overwhelming, but we can help. Letting these refugees in and giving them education, warm homes, and loving community will help. Most of all we can help by praying. Using the power of prayer can save nations and help thousands. This is what Sioux Falls, SD, has done for Shantal and her family. They now have a home to call their own, jobs, clothing, and live freely in their new community. The refugee crisis will not go away but there is hope. Shantal will tell you.\n\n'Home'\n\nBy seventh-grade runner-up Grace Lee, Edison Middle School\n\nHome. What do we think of when we hear that word? Some people would think of a nice house with furniture, a TV, etc. Other people might think of a small house crammed with little furniture and no TV. These are our shelters, a place we can call home. But many people, like Syrian refugees, don’t have a place to call home. They are instead force to live under rough circumstances.\n\nI believe that everyone should have a right to seek for a safe place to live. They should be able to go to their house, and sleep with no worries. But this doesn’t happen. The United Nations said in 2016, there are 11 million Syrians forced to flee their homes. And nearly 25 million people live at refugee camps in Turkey, but only 11 percent of them stay in traditional refugee camps.\n\nI remember a popular photo that I saw back in 2015. It’s a photograph of a Syrian (refugee) boy named Alan Kurdi, who was trying to get to Greece with his family, bud died of drowning because their boat capsized. There were also 3,600 others that joined Alan. While this was happening, I was probably sitting in my warm room, using my laptop. This picture helped me realize that I am extremely lucky to be able to live in a place where I don’t have to constantly fear for my life. This picture helped me realize I am lucky to have a home.\n\nWinners and runners-up\n\nEighth grade: Chloe Hartje, Patrick Henry Middle School, first place; Srishti Kumari, Memorial Middle School, runner-up; Autumn Towe, Edison Middle School, runner-up\n\nSeventh grade: Caleb Miller, Patrick Henry Middle School, first place; Nathan Koole, Sioux Falls Christian Middle School, runner-up; Grace Lee, Edison Middle School, runner-up", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/us/five-things-august-7-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know on August 7, 2022: Start your week smart: Senate ...", "text": "Travelers are scrambling to get flights in and out of Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Wexler/NorthJersey.com/USA Today Network In pictures: The world rallies in support of Ukraine Prev Next\n\nTensions between the two countries had been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-sunday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Putin orders Russian deterrence forces onto high alert as troops ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nA Ukrainian delegation will meet with a Russian delegation on Monday for talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border following assurances from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nThe announcement came Sunday as Ukrainian forces engaged in fierce fighting with Russian troops in multiple cities across Ukraine.\n\nRussia is facing universal condemnation and increased sanctions from Western powers over Moscow’s unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its fourth day.\n\nUkraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin said the talks would take place Monday morning local time.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier said he would be willing to hold talks with Russia but not in Belarus, pointing out that Russian military actions are being launched from that country.\n\nOn Sunday, Zelensky said in a brief televised statement that he doesn’t expect much from the meeting.\n\n“I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky’s office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. “The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said.\n\n“Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, meeting and return.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s deterrence forces – which include nuclear arms – onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin’s latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\n\n“The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,” said the official. “This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.”\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin’s order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a “direct threat to us” and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday’s scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to “listen to what Russia has to say” but will not give in to pressure. “We will tell them what we think of this,” he said. “And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nRussia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nAlthough Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel. There are currently no Russian troops in the capital, he added. The mayor extended a strict curfew across the city until Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a local hospital, a six-year-old boy died in heavy gunfire in a western district of Kyiv on Saturday evening.\n\nA woman was killed after a nine-story residential building in the eastern city of Kharkiv was hit by “enemy artillery” on Saturday night, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.\n\nPolish officials said Sunday that 187,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began on Thursday.\n\nA defiant Ukraine\n\nAs the battle continues, a defiant Zelensky has released a series of videos from the streets of Kyiv urging citizens to defend their country.\n\nOfficials armed reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone, and Ukrainian TV has broadcast instructions for making Molotov cocktails. Ukrainian males ages 18 to 60 are banned from leaving the country.\n\nMolotov cocktails and personal arms. See how Ukrainians are fighting back 02:26 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Zelensky called on citizens of the world also to join the fight against the “Russian war criminals.”\n\n“This is not just Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military on Sunday claimed successful attacks by its Turkish-made force of drones against Russian forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration. On Saturday, the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\nRussian state TV is covering the war very differently 02:24 - Source: CNN\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed Sunday that “very soon the Russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay” for the invasion of Ukraine, as he announced he would raise German military funding during a special session with lawmakers.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed Sunday that the European Union is shutting down its airspace to Russia.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered and Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the European Union. This will apply to any plane,” von der Leyen said.\n\n“Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane. And that includes the private jets of oligarchs too,” she added.\n\nOn Sunday, the EU also announced a ban on Russian news outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, according to the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell.\n\n“Today we are taking a crucial step to turn off the tap for the Russian’s information manipulation in Europe by banning Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the European Union,” Borrell said at a joint press conference in Brussels.\n\nAt home, the Kremlin appears to be in damage control, attempting to limit information about the difficulties its forces are facing in Ukraine.\n\nSocial media platform Twitter said Saturday it is being restricted inside Russia and is working to address the issue.\n\nRussia’s media regulator told 10 news outlets that it would restrict access to their publications unless they stopped spreading “false information” – including the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians caused by the Russian armed forces.\n\nNonetheless, Russians continued to turn out for anti-war protests over the weekend. Russian authorities have detained a total of 4,862 people for participating in unsanctioned anti-war protests across the country since the invasion of Ukraine was ordered independent monitoring site OVD-Info said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Ivana Kottasová Laura Smith-Spark Julia Hollingsworth", "Tim Lister", "Ivana Kottasová", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Julia Hollingsworth"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}]}

This is important because we believe those responsible for the breach are in Russia,” he said.\n\nMedibank says the stolen data belongs to 9.7 million past and present customers, including 1.8 million international customers. The files include health claims data for almost half a million people, including 20,000 based overseas.\n\nThis week, the group started releasing curated tranches of customer data onto the dark web, in files with titles including good-list, naughty-list, abortions and boozy, which included those who sought help for alcohol dependency.\n\nKershaw said police intelligence points to a “group of loosely affiliated cyber criminals” who are likely responsible for previous significant data breaches around the world, without naming specific examples.\n\n“These cyber criminals are operating like a business with affiliates and associates who are supporting the business. We also believe some affiliates may be in other countries,” said Kershaw, who declined to take questions due to the sensitivity of the investigation.\n\nLinks to notorious Russian hackers\n\nCyber security experts have said the criminals are likely linked to REvil, a Russian ransomware gang notorious for large attacks on targets in the United States and elsewhere, including major international meat supplier JBS Foods last June.\n\nThat breach shut down the company’s entire US beef processing operation and prompted the company to pay an $11 million ransom. Last November, the US State Department offered a $10 million reward for information leading to the identification or location of key leaders of REvil, also known as the Sodinokibi organized crime group.\n\nIn mid-January, Russian state news agency TASS reported that at least eight REvil ransomware hackers had been detained by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) at the request of the US.\n\nThey were facing charges of committing “illegal circulation of payments,” a crime punishable by up to seven years in prison, TASS reported, citing Moscow’s Tverskoi Court.\n\nIn March, Ukrainian national Yaroslav Vasinskyi, one of the chief suspects linked to an attack on US software vendor, Kaseya, was extradited from Poland to the US to face charges, according to a statement from the Justice Department.\n\nJeffrey Foster, associate professor in cyber security studies at Macquarie University, said there’s one major link between the REvil network and the group suspected of hacking the Medibank network.\n\n“The biggest link is that the REvil dark web website now redirects to this website. So that’s the biggest link we have between them, and the only link we have between them,” said Foster, who is monitoring the blog where the group is posting their demands.\n\n“As Russia has stated that they’ve arrested and disbanded REvil, it seems likely this is a case of maybe a former REvil member, who had access to the dark web website to be able to do the redirect which requires access to the hardware,” he said. “Whether or not REvil has returned, we don’t know.”\n\nHow the breach unfolded\n\nMedibank first detected unusual activity in its network almost a month ago. On October 20, the company issued a statement saying a “criminal” had stolen information from its ahm health insurance and international student systems, including names, addresses, phone numbers and some claims data for procedures and diagnoses.\n\nAn initial ransom demand was made for $10 million (15 million Australian dollars), but the company said after extensive consultation with cybercrime experts it had decided not to pay. It was later lowered to $9.7 million – one for every customer affected, according to Foster.\n\nAt the time, Medibank said there was only a “limited chance” that paying the ransom would stop the data being published or returned to the company.\n\nIn his statement on Friday, Kershaw, the AFP Commissioner, said Australian government policy did not condone paying ransoms to cyber criminals.\n\n“Any ransom payment small or large fuels the cybercrime business model, putting other Australians at risk,” he said.\n\nKershaw said investigators at the Australian Interpol National Central Bureau would be talking with their Russian counterparts about the individuals, who he addressed directly with a threat to see them charged in Australia.\n\n“To the criminals, we know who you are. And moreover, the AFP has some significant runs on the scoreboard when it comes to bringing overseas offenders back to Australia to face the justice system,” he said.\n\nEarlier Friday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was “disgusted” by the attacks and, without naming Russia, said the government of the country they come from should be held accountable.\n\n“The nation where these attacks are coming from should also be held accountable for the disgusting attacks, and the release of information including very private and personal information,” Albanese said.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Medibank CEO David Koczkar said it was clear the criminal gang behind the breach was “enjoying the notoriety,” and it was likely they would release more information each day.\n\n“The relentless nature of this tactic being used by the criminal is designed to cause distress and harm,” he said. “These are real people behind this data and the misuse of their data is deplorable and may discourage them from seeking medical care.”", "authors": ["Hilary Whiteman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/china/china-billion-people-data-leak-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China data leak: Nearly one billion people had their personal data ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA massive online database apparently containing the personal information of up to one billion Chinese citizens was left unsecured and publicly accessible for more than a year – until an anonymous user in a hacker forum offered to sell the data and brought it to wider attention last week.\n\nThe leak could be one of the biggest ever recorded in history, cybersecurity experts say, highlighting the risks of collecting and storing vast amounts of sensitive personal data online – especially in a country where authorities have broad and unchecked access to such data.\n\nThe vast trove of Chinese personal data had been publicly accessible via what appeared to be an unsecured backdoor link – a shortcut web address that offers unrestricted access to anyone with knowledge of it – since at least April 2021, according to LeakIX, a site that detects and indexes exposed databases online.\n\nAccess to the database, which did not require a password, was shut down after an anonymous user advertised the more than 23 terabytes (TB) of data for sale for 10 bitcoin – roughly $200,000 – in a post on a hacker forum last Thursday.\n\nThe user claimed the database was collated by the Shanghai police and contained sensitive information on one billion Chinese nationals, including their names, addresses, mobile numbers, national ID numbers, ages and birthplaces, as well as billions of records of phone calls made to police to report on civil disputes and crimes.\n\nA sample of 750,000 data entries from the three main indexes of the database was included in the seller’s post. CNN verified the authenticity of more than two dozen entries from the sample provided by the seller, but was unable to access the original database.\n\nThe Shanghai government and police department did not respond to CNN’s repeated written requests for comment.\n\nThe seller also claimed the unsecured database had been hosted by Alibaba Cloud, a subsidiary of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. When reached by CNN for comment on Monday, Alibaba said “we are looking into this” and would communicate any updates. On Wednesday, Alibaba said it declined to comment.\n\nBut experts CNN spoke with said it was the owner of the data who was at fault, not the company hosting it.\n\n“As it stands today, I believe this would be the largest leak of public information yet – certainly in terms of the breadth of the impact in China, we’re talking about most of the population here,” said Troy Hunt, a Microsoft regional director based in Australia.\n\nChina is home to 1.4 billion people, which means the data breach could potentially affect more than 70% of the population.\n\n“It’s a little bit of a case where the genie is not going to be able to go back in the bottle. Once the data is out there in the form it appears to be now, there’s no going back,” said Hunt.\n\nIt is unclear how many people have accessed or downloaded the database during the 14 months or more it was left publicly available online. Two Western cybersecurity experts who spoke to CNN were both aware of the existence of the database before it was thrust into the public spotlight last week, suggesting it could be easily discovered by people who knew where to look.\n\nVinny Troia, a cybersecurity researcher and founder of dark web intelligence firm Shadowbyte, said he first discovered the database “around January” while searching for open databases online.\n\n“The site that I found it on is public, anybody (could) access it, all you have to do is register for an account,” Troia said. “Since it was opened in April 2021, any number of people could have downloaded the data,” he added.\n\nTroia said he downloaded one of the main indexes of the database, which appears to contain information on nearly 970 million Chinese citizens. But it was difficult to judge whether the open access was an oversight from the owners of the database, or if it was an intentional shortcut intended to be shared among a small number of people, he said.\n\n“Either they forgot about it, or they intentionally left it open because it’s easier for them to access,” he said, referring to the authorities responsible for the database. “I don’t know why they would. It sounds very careless.”\n\nUnsecured personal data – exposed through leaks, breaches, or some form of incompetence – is an increasingly common problem faced by companies and governments around the world, and cybersecurity experts say it is not unusual to find databases that are left open to public access.\n\nIn 2018, Trioa discovered that a Florida-based marketing firm exposed close to 2 TB of data that appeared to include personal information on hundreds of millions of American adults on a publicly accessible server, according to Wired.\n\nIn 2019, Victor Gevers, a Dutch cybersecurity researcher, found an online database containing names, national ID numbers, birth dates and location data of more than 2.5 million people in China’s far-western region of Xinjiang, which was left unprotected for months by Chinese firm SenseNets Technology, according to Reuters.\n\nBut the latest data leak is particularly worrying, cybersecurity researchers say, not only because of its potentially unprecedented volume, but also the sensitive nature of the information contained.\n\nA CNN analysis of the database sample found police records of cases spanning nearly two decades from 2001 to 2019. While the majority of the entries are civil disputes, there are also records of criminal cases ranging from fraud to rape.\n\nIn one case, a Shanghai resident was summoned by police in 2018 for using a virtual private network (VPN​) to ​evade China’s firewall and access Twitter​, allegedly retweeting “reactionary remarks involving the (Communist) Party, politics and leaders.”\n\nIn another record, a mother called the police in 2010, accusing her father-in-law of raping her 3-year-old daughter.\n\n“There could be domestic violence, child abuse, all sorts of things in there, that to me is a lot more worrying,” said Hunt, the Microsoft regional director.\n\n“Might this lead to extortion? We often see extortion of individuals after data leaks, examples where hackers can even try to ransom individuals.”\n\nThe Chinese government has recently stepped up efforts to improve protection of online user data privacy. Last year, the country passed its first Personal Information Protection Law, laying out ground rules on how personal data should be collected, used and stored. But experts have raised concerns that while the law can regulate technology companies, it could be challenging to enforce when applied to the Chinese state.\n\nBob Diachenko, a security researcher based in Ukraine, first came upon the database in April. In mid-June, his company detected that the database was attacked by an unknown malicious actor, who destroyed and copied the data and left a ransom note demanding 10 bitcoin for its recovery, Diachenko said.\n\nIt is not clear if this was the work of the same person who advertised the sale of the database information last week.\n\nBy July 1, the ransom note had disappeared, according to Diachenko, but only 7 gigabytes (GB) of data was available – instead of the 23 TB originally advertised.\n\nDiachenko said it suggested the ransom had been resolved, but the database owners had continued to use the exposed database for storing, until it was shut down over the weekend.\n\n“Maybe there was some junior developer who noticed it and tried to remove the notes before senior management noticed them,” he said.\n\nShanghai Police did not respond to CNN’s request for comments on the ransom note.\n\n\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.", "authors": ["Yong Xiong Hannah Ritchie Nectar Gan", "Yong Xiong", "Hannah Ritchie", "Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/tech/cyberattack-businesses-russia/index.html", "title": "US warns businesses to prepare for Russian cyberattacks. Here's ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nAs Russia’s war in Ukraine and its diplomatic conflict with the United States both continue to escalate, the warnings that Russian hackers could go after US businesses have gained new urgency.\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Monday urged business leaders to strengthen their online defenses, warning that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin could use cyberattacks as a means of escalating the crisis.\n\n“The point is that he has the capability,” Biden told the Business Roundtable Quarterly Meeting in Washington. “He hasn’t used it yet, but it’s part of his playbook.”\n\nIn a March 18 advisory to US businesses obtained by CNN, the FBI warned that hackers linked to Russian internet addresses have been scanning the networks of five US energy companies.\n\nAnd experts have warned of ‘significant’ vulnerabilities in US systems that Russian hackers can exploit, as evidenced by attacks last year that breached Florida’s water supply, hit one of the world’s largest meat producers and shut down one of America’s largest fuel pipelines for several days.\n\n“The threat will probably continue long after this conflict is over,” David Murphy, cybersecurity manager at accounting firm Schneider Downs and a former National Security Agency analyst, told CNN Business. “I think it’ll just increase with time.”\n\nHere’s what businesses can do to better protect themselves.\n\nUpdates, patches and backups\n\nIt may sound like an obvious and straightforward fix, but experts say keeping your system’s software up to date is an important way to prevent many attacks. Those software updates will often include security patches to fix loopholes that hackers can and do exploit.\n\n“It’s like raising the cost for the adversary… if I make it a little harder, they go on to the next victim,” said Karen Evans, managing director of the Cyber Readiness Institute, which provides resources for businesses to shore up their cyber defenses.\n\nMulti-factor authentication, which supplements passwords with an additional login method such as a numbered code from a separate device or a fingerprint scan, is also becoming something of a must-have for companies to secure potential entry points into their networks.\n\nHowever, one such service, Okta, acknowledged late Tuesday that a cybersecurity incident in January may have affected hundreds of its clients. The new details came after a mysterious hacking group known as Lapsus$ published screenshots claiming access to an Okta internal administrative account and the firm’s Slack channel. The incident may only add to jitters in the corporate community.\n\nEvans says it’s important for businesses to also have a contingency plan in case they do get attacked, and one of the best ways to do that is having backups of critical or sensitive data stored outside the system.\n\n“Can I restore operations from my data backups if I go down? Do I have an alternate way to do business?” she said. “Those are the business resiliency, the continuity plans that small businesses have to have, and in the middle of the crisis is not the time to find out I have a gap.”\n\nAnd in the current situation, where concerns about cyberattacks are centered on one particular country, Murphy suggests companies can specifically target internet addresses originating from that country — in this case, Russia — in a move known as geo-blocking.\n\n“It’s not going to protect you 100%, but it’s definitely at least knocking off some of the low-hanging fruit,” he said.\n\nCyber insurance\n\nAs the risk of cyberattacks increases — particularly ransomware attacks that can extract millions of dollars to restore systems — companies are increasingly opting for additional insurance plans that can help pay for damages and losses from cyberattacks.\n\nDemand for cyber insurance has gone up in recent years, according to providers and industry experts, driving up premiums for those plans by as much as 22% between 2019 and 2020. But for companies that can afford it, it’s a good way to not only protect against damages but also to keep them more vigilant against threats in the first place.\n\n“Cyber insurance is becoming extremely expensive, but also kind of levying requirements on businesses to make sure that they’re covered and protecting themselves as well,” said Murphy, highlighting that insurance firms will often have a list of questions companies have to answer and protections they must have in place to even qualify for a plan.\n\nBut companies should be wary of treating cyber insurance as the be-all and end-all of protection against attacks, Evans warns. Companies need to evaluate their risk and make systemic changes regardless of whether they’re protected after the fact.\n\n“It’s not necessarily: ‘Oh, I bought cyber insurance and I’m done,’” she said.\n\nTo complicate matters further when it comes to Russian cyberattacks, insurance companies often have clauses making exceptions for acts of war and attacks by nation states, in which case the policy does not apply.\n\nEmployee awareness\n\nAlthough companies must protect themselves at the network and system level, past precedent shows that attacks can originate from even a single compromised device, account or email address.\n\nThree of the four pillars of cyber protection that the Cyber Readiness Institute urges companies to address — weak passwords, external USB drive usage and phishing attacks (where hackers use deceptive links to obtain personal data) — tend to exploit individual users.\n\n“When you look across the board, it’s a culture change that has to happen,” Evans said. “No matter what the size of an organization is — it’s the leadership, it’s the CEO, it then cascades down to all the employees.”\n\nUltimately, many cyber vulnerabilities come down to human error and lapses in judgment, and that’s why companies need to raise awareness among employees about cyberattacks and steps to mitigate them. The rise of remote work during the pandemic has further complicated that task, with distributed workforces providing hackers with many more potential entry points into the network.\n\n“Humans are in the equation, and so that’s why this ends up having to be an organizational change,” Evans said.\n\n— CNN’s Sean Lyngaas contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Rishi Iyengar"], "publish_date": "2022/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/29/politics/intel-report-fbi-searches/index.html", "title": "Intel report states FBI conducted nearly 2 million searches of US ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe FBI conducted up to 3.4 million warrantless searches of Americans’ electronic data last year including 1.9 million related to a cyber threat from Russia, according to an annual transparency report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Friday.\n\nThe report is the first time that the US intelligence community has disclosed even an approximate number of the FBI’s searches of American data using the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The law is focused on threats emanating from outside of the United States, but also allows the FBI, the CIA and others to search data for Americans’ information provided there is a validly predicated foreign intelligence purpose.\n\nThe report does not suggest that the FBI acted improperly. The report highlights the big trove of intelligence data that the bureau can tap in pursuing hackers, spies and terrorists.\n\nMore than half of the FBI’s queries were related to attempts to compromise US critical infrastructure by foreign cyber actors in early 2021, according to the report. That includes about 1.9 million queries related to one particular cyber threat from Russia against US critical infrastructure, according to the FBI.\n\nIt is unclear what Russian hacking effort the FBI was referring to. The bureau declined to comment.\n\nIn the first half of 2021, the Biden administration investigated at least two major cyber incidents originating in Russia: the espionage campaign that exploited SolarWinds software to breach at least nine federal agencies, and the cybercriminal ransomware attack in May 2021 that shut down one of the largest US fuel pipeline operators for days.\n\nWhile the hacking campaign that exploited SolarWinds and other software vendors appeared aimed at US government agencies, the malicious code used by the attackers was downloaded by thousands of companies, including hundreds of electric utilities.\n\nThe Biden administration blamed Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service for the so-called SolarWinds campaign, which was discovered in December 2020 – an allegation the Kremlin denied. US officials believe that Russian authorities in January detained the individual responsible for the pipeline hack, but it is unclear if the Russians will follow through on prosecuting that person.\n\nThe number of FBI queries detailed in the report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is not the same as the number of individuals whose data was examined. Officials can search an individual’s email address, name and any other identifier, sometimes multiple times – all of which would be counted as unique queries.\n\nIt is also possible that the number of queries of Americans’ data is far lower than the 3.4 million disclosed in the report. According to the report, sometimes the FBI conducts large queries of hundreds or even thousands of terms, and if even one term is associated with a US person, every term in the bulk search is counted as a US person search.", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis Sean Lyngaas", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/04/29"}]}

The show fails to build characters worth caring about or any kind of narrative stakes. The problem is not that \"Sandman\" is a cerebral, talky kind of fantasy series. There are plenty of great works of science fiction and fantasy that rely more on character and dialogue than action set pieces.

His desire for his hosts to pump more oil to ease gas prices and inflation in the US is colliding with his previous condemnation of the ruthless rule of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nIf the President leaves without securing a significant injection of crude into the global market, he risks more political damage at home, where Americans are taking out their frustrations with high gas prices on him. But if he succeeds, he will further anger human rights advocates who accuse him of ditching US principles for short-term political gain. In either case, Biden must find a way to justify his opening to the Crown Prince, Saudi Arabia’s erratic and repressive de facto leader who was blamed by US intelligence for ordering the murder and dismembering of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident and Saudi dissident.\n\nBiden has, after all, put democracy promotion at the center of his foreign policy agenda while bin Salman has presided over the execution of political prisoners, launched a vicious war in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, and was accused of detaining Lebanon’s prime minister in another regional power play.\n\n“The reason that I’m going to Saudi Arabia … is to promote US interest … in a way that I think we have an opportunity to reassert what I think we’ve made a mistake of walking away from: our influence in the Middle East,” Biden said Thursday.\n\nThe President is ostensibly going to Saudi Arabia to take part in a regional conference also with leaders from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Iraq and Jordan. He is seeking to cement recent progress in a rapprochement between some of these nations and Israel where he spent the last few days. He’s also keen to build support for his drive to use diplomacy to revive a 2015 nuclear deal before Tehran enriches sufficient uranium for a nuclear bomb – a diplomatic process about which both the Israelis and the Saudis are skeptical.\n\nAnd Biden has a strong interest in reasserting America’s leadership as its great power rivals Russia and China seek new inroads in the region. So the President’s claim, that it is now in US interests to reengage with Saudi Arabia after the 2018 Khashoggi killing severely strained relations, does have merit – even though he’s taking heat from progressives in his party for doing so.\n\nBalancing act\n\nWith his visit, the President, who vowed to make the Saudis a “pariah” on the campaign trail in 2020, is experiencing a rite common to commanders-in-chief who have to sometimes dilute their own political interests for a wider strategic goal.\n\n“How do we balance our interests in the free flow of oil at reasonable prices with our values,” asked former US ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk on “Amanpour” on CNN International this week, encapsulating Biden’s dilemma.\n\n“Somehow, the President has to walk the line. We need the Saudis to increase oil production to bring the price down because that is having a terrible impact on inflation. On the other hand, we need to take a clear stand against the way (Mohammed bin Salman) treats some of his people some of the time.”\n\nThe distasteful aspect of this trip is that there is no way for Biden to accomplish his goals without elevating bin Salman, who is the dominant figure in the Saudi royal family and will use the visit of an American President to rehabilitate himself globally and to send a message to other strongman-ruled states that there is no longterm price for acting in a way that offends American values. He may, therefore, not feel especially beholden to offer wide-ranging concessions.\n\nThe White House confirmed for the first time late Thursday that Biden will meet with the Crown Prince without King Salman, who will depart after about 30 minutes of the bilateral meetings, which was expected because of his health. The administration’s shifting positions on whether and how Biden would interact with the Crown Prince in recent weeks have appeared to whip up even more controversy about the visit. In retrospect, an earlier announcement and a strong statement about what the President would do and say might have eased some of the political pressure.\n\nStill, Biden argued in a recent Washington Post op-ed that the broader aspiration of using his trip to promote regional stability was important since it could prevent the conflicts that led to US troops having to fight and die in the Middle East for decades. Biden – whose worldview was shaped by his own experiences and that of his late son Beau, who served in Iraq – has put avoiding new foreign wars at the center of his presidency. This is also one reason why he is committed to trying to revive the Iran nuclear deal, which could head off a fateful decision on whether he might use military force to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n\nWhy does the US have an alliance with the Saudis?\n\nThe question of balancing US principles and national interests was bound to resurface for Biden sooner or later in relation to the Saudis because it has been a constant theme of US relations with the kingdom for over half a century. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has long been a key strategic US ally, but its tolerance for radical Wahabi Islam provided a fountain of extremism in which terrorism grew and eventually led to events like the September 11 attacks in 2001.\n\nThat is why some foreign policy observers have questioned whether there needs to be a complete rethink of the marriage of convenience between Washington and Riyadh and the idea that the two powers really do have common interests. This was not a concern during the transactional presidency of Donald Trump, who blatantly explained that he was not severing relations over the Khashoggi killing, because the Saudis bought lots of American-made weapons. But that interregnum from long-term US foreign policy certainties aside, Presidents have long wrestled with the proper balance of US-Saudi relations. But they have always been drawn back to the kingdom because of the vital importance of the free flow of oil for the US economy, living standards and their own political survival.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on CNN’s “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer” on Thursday that the question of whether Biden would shake the hand of bin Salman was irrelevant. Instead, the Saudis need to show a commitment to changing their behavior on human rights and demonstrate their loyalty to Washington, he said.\n\n“The question for me, (is) why did it take an emergency visit from the United States President to convince the Saudis to choose their ally, the United States?” Murphy asked.\n\n“I thought the whole point of the United States’ decision, over multiple administrations, to look the other way when the Saudis chopped up political opponents, when they bombed civilians inside Yemen, when they executed political prisoners, was that when the chips were down, we would not have to make an emergency visit for the Saudis to choose the United States.”\n\nWhy is Biden meeting the oppressor and not the oppressed?\n\nThe trip comes at a moment of political peril for Biden, with his approval ratings tumbling while inflation soars and after a period of record gasoline prices, which have moderated slightly in recent days. From a purely political perspective, the sight of a President engaging with oil-producing nations to ease prices back in the United States may be welcome to some voters. But if his visit doesn’t result in significant production increases from Gulf states, or if the move fails to ease gas prices that helped power inflation to a more than 40-year-high of 9.1% last month, the President will face claims he misused the prestige of the presidency and trashed his principles on human rights for no gain.\n\nAnd one concern for the administration is that there is no guarantee that more oil on the market will lower gas prices – sent racing higher by the war in Ukraine – permanently. This is because one of the issues in the industry has been a scarcity of refining capacity coming out of the pandemic – a situation a sudden flood of crude could actually exacerbate.\n\nA trip to the region that doesn’t produce clear wins for the President could add to perceptions of a presidency that is losing direction – even if Biden’s foreign policy, especially his revival of the Cold War coalition of Western nations to confront Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, has been largely successful.\n\nThe brutal murder of Khashoggi has become a metaphor for wider US concerns about human rights in Saudi Arabia, which include the fate of political prisoners, summary executions, the treatment of women and the disregard for civilian life in Yemen.\n\nThe President appeared tetchy at a news conference in Israel on Thursday when he was pressed over whether he would raise the case of the Washington Post journalist when he was with bin Salman.\n\n“I always bring up human rights. I always bring up human rights, but my position on Khashoggi has been so clear. If anyone doesn’t understand it in Saudi Arabia or anywhere else, then they haven’t been around for a while,” Biden said.\n\nLina al-Hathloul, a Saudi democracy activist, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Thursday that it would be a “betrayal” if Biden didn’t bring up US concerns about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record. Human rights organizations have called on Biden to meet political dissidents while he is in Saudi Arabia, a step some past presidents took when doing business with totalitarian regimes. So far there has been no announcement from the White House of any such contacts\n\n“Why is he meeting with the oppressor and not meeting with the oppressed?” she asked.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/economy/saudi-arabia-biden-opec-oil/index.html", "title": "America and Saudi Arabia are locked in a bitter battle over oil. The ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia is one of the most important on the planet. And lately, it’s also been one of the most awkward.\n\nAngry officials in Washington vowed “consequences” after Saudi-led OPEC sharply cut oil production earlier this month, driving up pump prices just weeks before the midterm elections.\n\nUS lawmakers are threatening steps that were unthinkable not long ago, including banning weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and unleashing the Justice Department to file a lawsuit against the country and other OPEC members for collusion.\n\nRiyadh has been caught off guard by the thirst for revenge from US politicians. And Saudi officials are hinting at payback – including dumping US debt – that could have huge ripple effects in financial markets and the real economy.\n\nNeither side is even trying to hide the tension. After a top Saudi official suggested the kingdom has decided to be the more mature party, a top White House official responded by saying, “It’s not like some high school romance here.”\n\nWhat happens next is critical.\n\nIf this decades-old relationship devolves into a full-blown break-up, there could be enormous consequences for the world economy, not to mention international security.\n\n“This is a new low. We have seen a degradation in the US-Saudi relationship for years but this is the worst it’s been,” said Clayton Allen, director at the Eurasia Group.\n\nSo much for that secret deal\n\nThe spat is linked to one of the biggest sore spots among voters during the Biden era: Inflation and high gas prices.\n\nAfter trying and failing to persuade OPEC to ramp up oil production, President Joe Biden reversed his 2020 campaign promise to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” over its human rights record. Biden visited Saudi Arabia over the summer and even fist-bumped Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nUS officials thought they reached a secret deal with Saudi Arabia to finally boost supply of oil through the end of the year, The New York Times reported this week.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nOPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, responded by increasing oil production by a measly 100,000 barrels per day – the smallest increase in its history. The move was widely viewed as a “slap in the face” of the Biden administration.\n\nWhat came next was worse.\n\nIn early October, OPEC+ announced plans to slash oil production by 2 million barrels per day – a move that briefly drove up oil and gasoline prices at a time of high inflation and infuriated US politicians.\n\n“Neither side seems to understand each other,” Allen said. “Riyadh underestimated the severity of the US backlash. And the US assumed we had an unspoken agreement.”\n\nFatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, described the move as “unprecedented” and “unfortunate” in an interview with CNN International on Thursday.\n\n“When the global economy was on the brink of a global recession, they decided to push the prices up,” Birol said.\n\nSaudi official accuses US of manipulating markets\n\nThe tensions haven’t eased, and officials from both sides have sharpened their criticism of each other in recent days. In one telling episode, a top Saudi minister went from defending Biden’s energy strategy to slamming it.\n\nDuring the OPEC+ press conference in early October, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman seemed to praise Biden’s decision to release unprecedented amount of emergency oil reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n“I wouldn’t call it a distortion. Actually, it was done in the right time,” Prince Abdulaziz told reporters. “If it didn’t happen, I’m sure that things might be different than what it is today.”\n\nFlash forward three weeks, and that same Saudi minister sang a very different tune.\n\n“People are depleting their emergency stocks, had depleted it, used it as a mechanism to manipulate markets while its profound purpose was to mitigate a shortage of supply,” Prince Abdulaziz said during a conference in Saudi Arabia this week. “However, it is my profound duty to make it clear to the world that losing emergency stock may become painful in the months to come.”\n\nThe criticism is noteworthy, especially given that OPEC openly manipulates markets in many ways by withholding supply to support prices.\n\nOPEC is unpopular\n\nThe risk is that the tension devolves into a tit-for-tat cycle of retaliation that undermines global economic stability, or whatever economic stability there is at the moment.\n\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle have stepped up their calls to enact NOPEC (No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels) legislation that would empower the Justice Department to go after OPEC nations on antitrust grounds. Although NOPEC isn’t new, it seems more possible now than at any point in recent memory. Eurasia Group pegs a 30% chance of NOPEC enactment and a 45% chance of a watered-down version of the bill.\n\n“You can’t overstate how upset a huge number of lawmakers are,” said Allen.\n\nLawmakers aren’t only upset, they realize OPEC is not exactly endearing itself to voters.\n\n“This is popular. American sentiment is anti-Saudi. This now has domestic political utility for American politicians. That’s where we are now,” said Karen Young, senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “NOPEC would be harder to veto than in the past.”\n\nCould Saudi Arabia dump US debt?\n\nSaudi Arabia could respond to penalties from Washington with drastic steps of their own, ratcheting up the conflict further.\n\nSaudi officials have privately warned that the kingdom could sell US Treasury bonds if Congress passes NOPEC, The Wall Street Journal reported this week, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nAt a minimum, dumping US debt would create uncertainty in markets at an already-perilous moment. A fire sale would drive up Treasury rates, destabilizing markets and raising borrowing costs for families and businesses.\n\nAnd of course, Saudi Arabia’s own holdings would be damaged in such a fire sale.\n\nSaudi Arabia is sitting on roughly $119 billion of US debt, according to Treasury Department data, making it the world’s 16th largest holder of Treasuries.\n\nAnother risk is that Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC+, could remove further supply from world oil markets – or at least refuse to respond to future price spikes as the West continues to crack down on Russia.\n\nFurther curbs on OPEC supply would lift gasoline prices and worsen inflation, raising already-high recession risks.\n\nAll of this explains why a full-blown breakdown in relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia may be the last thing the fragile economy needs right now.", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/30/politics/crown-act-hair-discrimination/index.html", "title": "CROWN Act: What the legislation is and what advocates say it will ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Texas high school policy banning braided or twisted hair has stopped a teenager from attending school, according to his mother, and brought renewed attention to the CROWN Act.\n\nDyree Williams, 17, of East Bernard, Texas, is just one of many Black Americans who have felt discriminated against over their hair.\n\nAdvocates say the CROWN Act would help people like Williams.\n\nWhat the CROWN Act stands for\n\nThe CROWN Act stands for Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural hair.\n\nThe bill would protect against bias based on hair texture and protective styles, including locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots and Afros.\n\nWhat the legislation would do and why advocates feel it’s vital\n\nThe bill being considered in Congress would ban race-based hair discrimination in employment and for those participating in federally assisted programs, housing programs, and public accommodations.\n\nThe bill passed the US House last month but needs to be approved by the US Senate, before it’s sent to President Joe Biden’s desk.\n\n“A lot of people are not aware that race-based hair discrimination exists,” said Esi Eggleston Bracey, who leads Unilever’s beauty and personal care portfolio and is a co-founder of the CROWN Coalition, which champions the legislation.\n\nThere are “implicit and explicit biases” against natural hair “deeply ingrained in workplace norms and society at large,” New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker, a Senate sponsor of the CROWN Act, said in a statement.\n\nAlthough existing federal law prohibits race-based discrimination, “our current legislation or interpretation of it is insufficient, so the additional protection is needed,” Eggleston Bracey told CNN.\n\nShe raised the case of Williams in Texas, saying there was “no recourse for him” in a state without the protections included in the CROWN Act.\n\nPolicies, such as the high school dress code policy that barred Williams from wearing his hair braided or twisted, don’t “give us access to employment, that’s financial empowerment, it doesn’t give us access to education, which is knowledge to better ourselves,” Eggleston Bracey said. “People need to understand this is not superficial. …This is identity. And it puts us, it puts Black people under the microscope, and subjects us to humiliation, unfair inspection that’s undeserved. And all of that wears on our self-esteem.”\n\nBlack women are 80% more likely to believe that they must change their natural hair to “fit in at the office,” according to a 2019 study commissioned by personal care brand Dove, a co-founder of the CROWN coalition. The same study found that Black women’s hair was over three times more likely to be perceived as unprofessional.\n\n“Natural Black hair is often deemed ‘unprofessional’ simply because it does not conform to White beauty standards,” New Jersey Democrat Bonnie Watson Coleman, the bill’s sponsor in the House, said in a statement. “Discrimination against Black hair is discrimination against Black people.”\n\nSupporters of the CROWN Act say it would prevent against a larger trend across the US, with more and more Black students saying they were being penalized for their hairstyles.\n\nThe problem lies in the policies, experts say, which don’t necessarily take into account an increasingly diverse student body, to the detriment of mostly Black and biracial schoolchildren.\n\nAs CNN previously reported, there have been a number of high-profile cases in recent years of Black students receiving punishment for their hairstyles.\n\nIn Williams’ case, the new high school he moved to in February in East Bernard, Texas, had a dress code policy in its handbook that states “boy’s hair may not extend below the eyebrows, below the tops of the ears or below a conventional standup shirt collar, and must not be more than one-inch difference in the length of the hair on the side to the length of the hair on top.”\n\nThe handbook, which has been removed from the district’s website, goes on to say: “This includes but [is] not limited to tall hair styles, side swept bang styles, and long hair dangling over shaved sides or shaved back of the head. This also includes mullets and mullets in the making. Braided hair or corn rows will not be allowed. No extremes in hair styles.”\n\nCNN made several attempts to reach the East Bernard High School and the school district, but has not heard back.\n\nIn 2020, Louisiana high school senior Asia Simo was kicked off her school’s cheer team after she accumulated demerits for having her hair out of uniform, which led to her eventual dismissal.\n\nThat same year in Texas, high school senior DeAndre Arnold was told he couldn’t walk at graduation unless he cut his dreadlocks and complied with the school district’s dress code that states male student’s hair must be shorter than the top of a T-shirt collar.\n\nIn 2019, an elementary school in Georgia came under fire after a hairstylist shared photos that the school used to show “appropriate” and “inappropriate” hairstyles for students.\n\nAnd in 2018, Andrew Johnson, a Black high school wrestler in New Jersey, was told by a referee to cut off his dreadlocks because it wasn’t in compliance with league regulations or forfeit a match.\n\nMost school administrators and school boards cite policies and regulations as reason for their actions and maintain their rules aren’t meant to be discriminatory.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a floor speech in March: “For too long, Black girls have been discriminated against and criminalized for the hair that grows on our heads and the way we move through and show up in this world.”\n\nShe added, “Whether you are a student in a classroom, an employee in the workplace, or the next Supreme Court Justice or the speaker pro [tempore], you deserve to show up as your full self, rocking your crown with your head held high.”\n\nWhere the legislation stands\n\nSo far, 15 states and more than 40 municipalities have enacted their versions of the CROWN Act. California, in 2019, was the first state to pass the legislation, according to the CROWN Coalition. The US Virgin Islands this month became the first US territory to enact the bill.\n\nLast month, the Democratic-led US House passed the federal version of the CROWN Act in a 235-189 vote, with 14 Republicans joining with Democrats to approve the bill. The fate of the bill in the 50-50 Senate remains unclear.\n\nRepublican opponents of the legislation have said that federal law already covers this kind of discrimination and that Democrats should be focusing on other issues, such as inflation and high gas prices.\n\nThe Biden administration has said it “strongly supports” the CROWN Act and “looks forward to working with the Congress to enact this legislation and ensure that it is effectively implemented.”\n\n“State legislation, having that concurrent with the federal legislation, actually provides more coverage, it makes sure even small businesses are covered, not just the larger businesses,” Eggleston Bracey told CNN, adding that state action “creates even more momentum for the federal legislation.”", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi Rachel Janfaza", "Veronica Stracqualursi", "Rachel Janfaza"], "publish_date": "2022/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/16/politics/biden-middle-east-trip-takeaways/index.html", "title": "5 takeaways from Joe Biden's first presidential trip to the Middle East ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Saturday capped a four-day trip to Israel and Saudi Arabia, his first trip to the Middle East since taking office.\n\nThe President started his trip by meeting with Israeli leaders to expand security ties with the nation and discuss countering efforts by Iran to destabilize the region. He next went to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he attempted to reassure regional leaders – and the rest of the world – that his administration remains committed to actively engaging in the Middle East and not allowing Russia or China to expand their geopolitical influence.\n\nOn Friday, he sought a reset of relations with the Saudis as he looked for ways to lower high gas prices in the US, which have contributed to a significant drop in Biden’s approval ratings.\n\nThat reset began with a widely criticized fist bump with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, whom the US has accused of sanctioning journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. Biden said he raised Khashoggi’s murder directly with the Crown Prince and indicated he believes MBS was responsible for it, as he emphasized the US commitment to human rights.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the trip:\n\nBiden’s fist bump with MBS signals a reset in US-Saudi relationship and draws fierce criticism\n\nAhead of his departure to the Middle East, administration officials had told CNN they were aiming for a full reset of the US-Saudi relationship after years of strain following Khashoggi’s murder.\n\nA fist bump in front of the cameras between Biden and the Crown Prince neatly symbolized that moment.\n\nThe meetings in Jeddah largely seemed to go along with the planned reset of the US relationship with the kingdom, and Biden announced several new areas of cooperation aimed at reshaping US-Saudi relations. But the images of Biden’s seemingly chummy interactions with the Crown Prince drew the most attention.\n\nThe President was fiercely criticized – including by fellow Democrats – for fist-bumping MBS during their first in-person interaction in Jeddah. Critics argued the fist bump helped rehabilitate the 36-year-old leader’s reputation on the world stage just over a year after the US declassified an intelligence report concluding that he personally ordered the brutal killing of Khashoggi, a charge the Crown Prince denied in their meeting, Biden said.\n\nThe images of the fist bump were quickly promoted by the Saudi government, including on Saudi state TV. Washington Post publisher Fred Ryan said Biden’s fist bump was “shameful” because it “projected a level of intimacy and comfort that delivers to MBS the unwarranted redemption he has been desperately seeking.”\n\nThere was much speculation ahead of the trip whether Biden would shake the Crown Prince’s hand, particularly when the White House said the President would be looking to reduce contact with others amid the spread of a transmissible subvariant of the omicron variant of Covid-19.\n\nBiden brings up Khashoggi’s killing with MBS and emphasizes American support for human rights\n\nHours after being criticized for that fist bump, the President went in front of the traveling press to say he had raised Khashoggi’s murder directly with Crown Prince Mohammed.\n\nBiden said he was “straightforward and direct” with MBS, adding that he indicated to the Crown Prince that he believed he was responsible for Khashoggi’s murder. A day earlier, while in Israel, Biden had stopped short of confirming that he planned to raise Khashoggi’s death with the Crown Prince, instead insisting that he “always” brought up human rights and that his views on the murder had been made “absolutely” clear.\n\nThe President reiterated that point on Friday.\n\n“For an American president to be silent on the issue of human rights is inconsistent with who we are and who I am. I’ll always stand up for our values,” Biden told reporters.\n\nOn Saturday, as he was making remarks to the Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as leaders of Egypt, Iraq and Jordan, the President again touched on human rights as he sat beside Crown Prince Mohammed, calling the values enshrined in the UN charter “foundational to who we are as Americans” and encouraging the assembled leaders to allow more rights for women and the press.\n\n“I’ve gotten plenty of criticism over the years. It’s not fun. But the ability to speak openly, exchange ideas freely, is what unlocks innovation,” Biden said.\n\nBiden leaves Saudi Arabia without any public promises for increased oil production, but hints at private assurances\n\nBiden came to Jeddah seeking solutions to one of his top political problems at home – high gas prices -- as diplomacy with the kingdom and other allies in the Middle East was seen as one of the few routes he could take to ease the pain at the pump. But, the trip did not produce any immediate announcements on increased oil production.\n\nThe trip came amid high gas prices and widespread inflation in the US and across the globe, in part due to Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine that has been ongoing since February. The high gas and grocery prices in the US are putting stress on millions of Americans and represent a major political liability for Biden’s Democratic Party in this year’s midterm elections.\n\nWhile gas prices have been falling in recent weeks, high prices have become a thorn in Biden’s side. White House officials said in the lead-up to the Saudi leg of the trip that they did not expect to be leaving with promises of increased oil production, and that prediction came true by the time Biden left the kingdom on Saturday.\n\nHowever, the President did strike an optimistic note that regional leaders would soon take action given that the next OPEC meeting will take place in early August.\n\n“Based on our discussions today, I expect we’ll see further steps in the coming weeks,” Biden said Friday after hours of meetings with Saudi leadership.\n\nThe President attempts to reassure allies the US is committed to the Middle East\n\nBiden attempted to reassert US leadership in the Middle East during the GCC+3 summit Saturday with key leaders in the region and promised that his administration would stay actively engaged amid fears that China and Russia could swiftly fill a leadership vacuum.\n\nThe President’s foreign policy focus since taking office has largely been on countering China’s growing geopolitical influence and Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has raised questions about the extent of Biden’s commitment to engagement in the Middle East.\n\n“The United States is invested in building a positive future in the region in partnership with all of you, and the United States is not going anywhere,” Biden said at the meeting with the GCC+3.\n\nThe summit came nearly one year after the US withdrew all military troops from Afghanistan and ended 20 years of war in the country. Biden also noted that his visit to the Middle East was the first time since the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 that a US president had visited the region without American troops being engaged in combat in the area, though US forces continue to conduct operations in Syria.\n\nBiden has been under pressure to do more to counter Iran in the region and come up with a coordinated strategy among allies, and on Saturday he made a commitment to the US playing a large role in the Middle East for years to come.\n\n“Let me state clearly that the United States is going to remain an active and engaged partner in the Middle East,” he said.\n\nThe White House released a joint statement later Saturday that said all the meeting’s participants “affirmed their keenness to continue to hold the U.S.-GCC Summit annually.”\n\nBiden looks to diplomacy to block Iran from getting nuclear weapon despite Israeli skepticism\n\nDuring the first leg of his trip, in Israel, Biden repeatedly vowed to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon and said he believed diplomacy remained the best avenue to keep Tehran from obtaining one. His Israeli hosts were skeptical at best.\n\nBiden has pushed for a revival of the Iran nuclear deal, which former President Donald Trump withdrew the US from in 2018, as he faces increasing pressure from key Middle East allies to produce a plan to contain Iran. But hopes appear to be fading that a deal will materialize, and the President acknowledged that the US is “not going to wait forever” for a response from Iranian leadership.\n\n“I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome,” Biden said at a news conference Thursday. “We will continue to work with Israel to counter other threats from Iran throughout the region, including support for terrorism and ballistic missile program that continues and the proliferation of weapons to terrorist and proxies like Hezbollah.”\n\nStanding alongside Biden at that news conference was Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid, who was dismissive about another nuclear deal as the means to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\n“Words will not stop them, Mr. President. Diplomacy will not stop them. The only thing that will stop Iran is knowing that if they continue to develop their nuclear program, the free world will use force. The only way to stop them is to put a credible military threat on the table,” Lapid said.\n\nIran was a main topic of discussion during Biden and Lapid’s bilateral meeting on Thursday, and the two leaders signed a new joint declaration aimed at expanding the security relationship between their nations and countering what they described as efforts by Iran to destabilize the region. The President reiterated the US’ “ironclad commitment” to Israel’s security.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/14/politics/joe-biden-saudi-arabia-mbs/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Saudi Crown Prince outlasts US' moral outrage, with a little ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has outlasted the United States, nearly four years after the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAn announcement Tuesday that President Joe Biden will visit Saudi Arabia next month is not a surprise – the White House has been preparing the ground for days. And the President’s decision to visit, as well as lawmakers’ reactions to the trip, fit a prevailing pattern of the US-Saudi relationship: Washington recoils over distaste for Saudi behavior that conflicts with its values, then gets pulled back into its marriage of convenience owing to the kingdom’s oil wealth and critical strategic position.\n\nAlthough Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday defended Biden’s upcoming meetings with the Saudis, Senate Majority Whip Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin – Schumer’s No. 2 – and other leading Democrats are showing their concern.\n\nDurbin told CNN he has “concerns” with Biden’s trip and called on the President to change his plans, but that he understands why Biden decided to take part in the visit.\n\n“I have concerns about it. I think the Saudis have demonstrated that they don’t share our values. The episode with Khashoggi is an international incident of historic proportions. I can’t get around it,” Durbin said, later adding, “It’s a tough call. Sustaining the energy services for our allies and NATO, doing something to increase the oil supply in the world, perhaps bring down gasoline prices. All these things are timely and important. But I’m sorry he has to do it with Saudis.”\n\nVirginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, a member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN that the trip is a “really bad idea.”\n\n“His blood stain has not been cleansed,” Kaine said. “And I get it that circumstances change. But what’s the fundamental issue in the world right now? It’s the authoritarians. … I don’t think you go say, ‘Well, circumstances change. We sit down with a murderer who killed a journalist who lives in Virginia.’ I think it’s a big mistake. I’d meet with other — I’d meet with (the) foreign minister. I’d meet with the Saudi ambassador. I’d meet with the King, but I wouldn’t meet with MBS.”\n\nConnecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, another member of Senate Foreign Relations, said he has some “real worries,” adding, “I think I need to hear more from the administration to understand what kind of commitments they’ve gotten from the kingdom to change their ways.”\n\nDurbin’s Republican counterpart, Senate Republican Whip John Thune of South Dakota, also had problems with the trip, saying, “I just wish he would focus on American energy and he wouldn’t have to deal with the Crown Prince.”\n\n“He’s expressed concerns about going there in the past for all the obvious reasons. And it just seems … having to go hat in hand to the Saudis to increase energy production because we won’t do it here – I think it’s unfortunate an American president is put in that position,” Thune added.\n\nThere’s little doubt that Biden is making his trip in order to persuade the Saudis to pump more crude oil to help alleviate the political impact of record-high US gasoline prices. His visit also comes as a new crisis looms with arch Saudi foe Iran, which may soon cross the threshold to building a nuclear bomb.\n\nTo quell the controversy, the White House is styling the visit of Biden to a nation he called “a pariah” over Khashoggi’s brutal killing, for which US intelligence determined the Crown Prince was responsible, as part of a regional peace initiative. The President will take part in a summit with the Gulf Cooperation Council plus Egypt, Jordan and Iraq in Jeddah after visiting Israel to show support for the Jewish state’s warming relations with anti-Iran Arab neighbors.\n\nThere will be bilateral meetings with King Salman and his team, which the White House expects to include the Crown Prince. And White House officials have broadly said that Biden plans to bring up human rights issues with bin Salman and the Saudis during their discussions, but they’ve also repeatedly underscored that the President is looking to reorient its relationship with the Middle Eastern nation.\n\n“We are not overlooking any conduct that happened before the President took office,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday in regard to Khashoggi’s death, noting that Biden “issued an extensive report” from the intelligence community on the journalist’s killing.\n\n“So, it’s important to also emphasize that while we [recalibrate] relationships, we are not looking to rupture relationships – but human rights issues, human rights conversation, is something that the President brings up with many leaders and plans to do so,” she continued.\n\nJean-Pierre also praised Saudi Arabia for having been “a strategic partner of the United States for nearly 80 years,” adding that “there’s no question that important interests are interwoven with Saudi Arabia, notably the recent extension of truce in Yemen, which has saved countless of lives.”\n\n9/11 Families United, an organization consisting of the families of individuals killed during the September, 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, sent a letter to the President earlier this month urging him to ensure accountability for the 9/11 attacks is a key priority of his discussions with Saudi officials.\n\nNational Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told CNN’s “New Day” on Tuesday that Biden is expected to discuss a “range of human rights issues” with the crown prince during the trip, but he did not say whether concerns from the 9/11 families would be brought up during the upcoming talks.\n\nAnd while the Saudis say they’ll be holding official talks with the US, Kirby refused to definitively characterize the meetings taking place between Biden and the Saudi Arabian government, adding that the President will hold “lots of bilateral discussions” with the nine heads of state present at the meeting, adding, “And yes, that will certainly include King Salman and his leadership team and we would expect that the Crown Prince will be part of those discussions.”\n\nStill, there’s no sugarcoating it.\n\nSometimes presidents must do things they find distasteful or that appear hypocritical to advance what they perceive to be the national interest – that is what Biden is doing here. But his visit sends a message to states like Saudi Arabia, that as the US embarks on what looks like a new Cold War with China and Russia, repressive conduct is no barrier to relations with a President who put saving global democracy at the center of his foreign policy.\n\nBiden, for instance, praised bin Salman’s “courage” in extending a truce in Yemen. But it was MBS who started the vicious war that killed thousands of civilians. So, Jean-Pierre’s remark Tuesday that the Saudi move had saved “countless” lives in the country was rather tone deaf.\n\nOnce a pariah.

But a recession can ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThere is one surefire cure for high gas prices. Unfortunately, it’s far worse than the problem itself: A recession.\n\nNothing kills demand for oil — and brings down prices faster — than recessions. Not only do they cause job losses, which means fewer people commuting to work, but those who keep their jobs invariably pull back on spending, which means fewer trips to go shopping or eat out, as well as fewer vacations. All of that cuts the amount of fuel consumed.\n\nBasic economics means that when demand for a product is lower, prices fall, often fairly quickly, unless there’s a corresponding drop in supply.\n\n“When the world goes into recession and the demand for commodities goes down, the [oil futures] market is unforgiving,” said oil analyst Andy Lipow.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has made numerous efforts to deal with high gas prices this year: his administration released oil from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which likely had only a marginal impact on prices, and publicly chastised US oil companies for high prices, which likely had little effect since the price of oil and gas futures is set on global markets.\n\nBut one of the things keeping oil and gas prices in check on those markets and at the pump, where prices remain well below the $5.02 a gallon record set in June, is the widespread fear that the economy is about to go into recession.\n\nAfter hitting that record high, the US daily average fell for 98 straight days, dropping to $3.68 a gallon, as oil prices tumbled more than 25% during those three months.\n\nPrices have crept back up due in large part to refineries shutting down for maintenance or following accidents. The average price stood at $3.80 as of Saturday, down 10 cents a gallon in the last 10 days. Experts say the prospect of a recession drove down those prices from the June peak, and kept them from rebounding above $4 when the refinery issues cropped up.\n\n“There is now a perceived huge downward risk tied to recession,” said Tom Kloza, chief energy analyst for OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA.\n\nAnd it’s not just US economic worries that’s putting downward pressure on gas prices. Recession fears are even more severe in Europe and much of Asia. That’s one of the main reasons for the recent decision by OPEC and other oil exporting states, a group known as OPEC+, to cut production by 2 million barrels a day.\n\n“I think OPEC+ will continue to watch the market, if they see a recession in Europe spread to the rest of the world, they will take action to support the price of oil,” Lipow said.\n\nWhat scares OPEC and other oil producers is what recessions have done to oil prices in the past, which is one reason there was no rush to increase oil production as prices soared after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPrices crashed during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. The average price of a gallon of regular gas hit a then-record of $4.11 in early July 2008, according to AAA. Six months later, following the meltdown in financial markets, it was down 61% to $1.62. During the brief Covid recession in the spring of 2020, oil prices on global markets actually turned negative, albeit briefly, amid a shortage of places to store the unused crude.\n\nIt doesn’t take a severe economic downturn to take a bite out of gas prices. The nine-month recession of 2001 ended with prices down 37% at the end of that year from their peak. Some of that decline might have been normal seasonal factors, but prices ended the year down 25% from where they had been 12 months earlier, eliminating that seasonal impact.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/20/politics/biden-inflation-recession-gas-prices-analysis/index.html", "title": "Analysis: America is on edge, and that's bad news for the White ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIf Americans are “really, really down,” as President Joe Biden suggests, it’s hardly surprising.\n\nMany key aspects of economic, social and national life that were once viewed as smoothly running certainties are out of joint. The Covid-19 pandemic, though it has eased its deadly grip, has left a complicated legacy of challenges that are still disrupting daily life. Some are aggravations – like the more than 800 airline flights cancelled on Sunday. Others threaten Americans’ economic prospects and sense of safety and wellbeing, like the growing fears of a recession.\n\nSuch an atmosphere is sure to breed new turmoil in a nation seeing widening ideological divides ahead of midterm elections that are likely to cause more dysfunction if power is split in Washington between Republicans and Democrats. And it almost guarantees years of political bickering ahead of the 2024 presidential race, which may hamper the nation’s capacity to solve any crisis.\n\nAcute problems include record gasoline prices. Families are struggling to cope with the soaring costs of food and vital goods. Some major cities are failing to manage a homelessness crisis. Baby formula shelves are still often empty. And summer getaways are hampered by an airline industry knocked off balance by Covid-19. While vaccinations and less deadly variants reduced the threat of the virus, it’s still disrupting business, schools and summer camps.\n\nThis is what determines the price of gas 01:57 - Source: CNN\n\nThe political split in the country, meanwhile, is exemplified by the tortuous effort to pass even rudimentary firearms safety measures in the Senate. While liberals watch the ever-escalating death toll from mass shootings with horror, conservatives who believe all gun rights are at risk make it difficult for Republican lawmakers to compromise. Political divisions are also underscored by the mixed reception of televised hearings of the House select committee probing the US Capitol insurrection. The panel is showing just how close the US came to an authoritarian takeover with ex-President Donald Trump’s coup attempt. But the new evidence is being largely ignored by his supporters, reflecting the GOP’s turn against democracy and raising the stakes for the next elections.\n\nA tense national mood is likely to be exacerbated if, in what would be twin triumphs for conservatives, the Supreme Court rules against majority public opinion and loosens gun restrictions and overturns a woman’s right to an abortion in the coming days. Already, a man has been charged with trying to kill conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, reflecting the charged atmosphere surrounding the court and the politicized issues it’s set to rule on.\n\nLooming troubles\n\nThings are unsettling abroad as well. The United States is bankrolling a war against Russia in Ukraine, which – despite Biden’s success in reviving the West’s Cold War front against Moscow – is turning into a costly stalemate. A building superpower showdown with China will stretch US resources and a new nuclear crisis with Iran may shortly join the continuing one with North Korea.\n\nThese are undoubtedly troubled times. But some perspective is also in order. Biden is right to highlight the strong job growth that has taken unemployment to such low levels that it could cushion the impact of a potential recession set off by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive attempt to cool inflation. And for the first time in two decades, the US does not have troops on the ground in a major war overseas. A snapshot of almost any moment in US history could reveal political struggles over the destiny of the country and the scope of rights conferred by the Constitution. Even if a recession comes, there is hope that it won’t be within the scale of the 2008 financial crisis or the Great Depression nearly 100 years ago, though that will be of little consolation to anyone who loses their job.\n\nThe crush of current crises will inevitably have political reverberations most immediately for Democrats in Congress who are facing a terrible environment less than five months before Election Day. Midterm elections are typically wounding for first-term Presidents. Biden’s eroded approval ratings and the White House’s difficulty in projecting control threaten to hand both the House and the Senate to Republicans, prolonging a political age in which almost every election seems to turn into a repudiation of those in power and a recalibration of voters’ decisions from the previous election.\n\nIt is debatable just how much Biden could do to improve the economy and all the troubles that are afflicting the country. But his professed rationale for his 2020 victory – that he was chosen by voters to fix problems – is crumbling. And while the White House has taken multiple steps to fix things – including expansive use of war-time powers under the Defense Production Act, the releases of millions of barrels of oil from national reserves and mounting emergency flights of baby formula from abroad – its efforts have not always been effective.\n\nWhen it comes to inflation especially, the White House has presented an often confusing political message as officials oscillate between saying there’s not much more Biden can do to highlighting multiple plans to show that the President understands the pressure on Americans. But given the reality of rising gas prices, Biden is a tough political spot – unable to take credit for positive aspects of the recovery since many people are simply not feeling the strength of the economy in their lives.\n\nAt times, Biden has appeared to be claiming credit for what works in the economy and blaming others for what doesn’t – rejecting criticism that his stimulus spending fueled inflation and branding high gasoline prices as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “price hike.” Last week, the President lashed out at big energy firms over their inflated profits, in what might be a smart political strategy to rally Democrats but may not help lower gas prices.\n\nFact-checking Biden's claim that Putin shares blame for inflation 02:33 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden’s remarks in an interview with the Associated Press last week that Americans are “really, really down,” after years of pandemic deprivations and political divisions, were consistent with his promise to always tell Americans the unvarnished truth. But they didn’t necessarily paint a picture of a President with the capacity to inspire the nation in hard times. This is especially problematic since his comments coincided with a pro-active attempt by the White House to dampen speculation about Biden’s reelection intentions amid increasing discussion about his age. He will turn 82 between the next presidential election and inauguration. Every White House assurance that he plans to run only fuels stories about Biden’s political plight.\n\nBut there would be far less Washington whispering about his future were economic conditions in a better place.\n\nThings could get worse\n\nThe daunting reality for Democrats – and struggling Americans – is that things could get worse.\n\nA combination of stubbornly high inflation and rising job losses in an economy slowing due to Federal Reserve action would be an even bigger political disaster for the White House. The administration already has limited credibility in talking about the economy after repeatedly downplaying the risks of risking inflation last year and insisting that it was a temporary phenomenon. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is one of the few officials to admit she got it wrong, as she did in a recent CNN interview. She insisted on ABC News’ “This Week” on Sunday that though inflation was “unacceptably high,” a recession was not inevitable. Brian Deese, the director of Biden’s National Economic Council, had a similar message on other Sunday talk shows.\n\nTreasury secretary warns of 'unacceptable levels of inflation' 01:58 - Source: CNN\n\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, meanwhile, added to the messaging confusion about Biden’s upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia by saying that she thought Biden would meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom US intelligence blames for ordering the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Biden last week said he was not going to the kingdom to meet the Crown Prince but that he would attend an international meeting of regional powers at which he would be present.\n\nThe dancing on a rhetorical pin head reflects an apparent desire by the administration to mend relations with the Saudis to secure an increase in oil production that might bring gas prices down. But it’s also a reflection of the backlash Biden is facing from some Democrats over easing his position on a nation he once branded a “pariah.”\n\nFrom 'pariah' to 'partner'? Anchor presses White House official on Saudi Arabia 03:47 - Source: CNN\n\nBack home, the administration’s struggles are bound to be good news for Republicans who are banking on major gains in the midterms and have an easy case to make that Biden’s economic plans are not working. Any improvements to the inflation picture are unlikely to be sufficient to shift the political environment before November. And a prolonged fight against rising prices and a possible dip into recession could haunt Biden as the 2024 campaign ramps up after November.\n\nThis is giving Democrats heartburn as Trump shows every sign of launching a campaign for his old job – despite the evidence of his extremism and abuses of power unveiled by the House panel in its televised hearings.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/business/energy-crisis-inflation/index.html", "title": "The world may be careening toward a 1970s-style energy crisis -- or ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe world is grappling with gravity-defying energy price spikes on everything from gasoline and natural gas to coal. Some fear this may just be the beginning.\n\nCurrent and former energy officials tell CNN they worry that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the wake of years of underinvestment in the energy sector have sent the world careening into a crisis that will rival or even exceed the oil crises of the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nUnlike those infamous episodes, this one is not contained to oil.\n\n“Now we have an oil crisis, a gas crisis and an electricity crisis at the same time,” Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency watchdog group, told Der Spiegel in an interview published this week. “This energy crisis is much bigger than the oil crises of the 1970s and 1980s. And it will probably last longer.”\n\nThe global economy has largely been able to withstand surging energy prices so far. But prices could continue to rise to unsustainable levels as Europe attempts to wean itself off Russian oil and, potentially, gas. Supply shortages could lead to some difficult choices in Europe, including rationing.\n\nJoe McMonigle, secretary general of the International Energy Forum, said he agrees with this depressing forecast from the IEA.\n\n“We have a serious problem around the world that I think policymakers are just waking up to. It’s kind of a perfect storm,” McMonigle, whose group serves as a go-between for energy producing and consuming nations, told CNN in a phone interview.\n\nThe extent of that perfect storm – underinvestment, strong demand and supply disruptions from the war – will have wide-reaching consequences, potentially threatening the economic recovery from Covid-19, exacerbating inflation, fueling social unrest and undermining efforts to save the planet from global warming.\n\nBirol warned of supply bottlenecks of gasoline and diesel, especially in Europe, as well as rationing of natural gas next winter in Europe.\n\n“It is a crisis for which the world is woefully unprepared,” said Robert McNally, who served as a top energy adviser to former US President George W. Bush.\n\nNot only are energy prices very high, but the reliability of the power grid is being challenged by extreme temperatures and severe drought. A US power grid regulator warned last month that parts of the country could face electricity shortages and even blackouts this summer.\n\n‘Our fears have borne out’\n\nFormer Obama energy adviser Jason Bordoff and Harvard University professor Meghan O’Sullivan wrote a piece in the Economist in late March warning that the world was on the cusp of “what may become the worst energy crisis since the 1970s.”\n\n“Since we wrote that, our fears have borne out,” Bordoff, co-founding dean of the Columbia Climate School, told CNN.\n\nOf course, there are key differences between today and the 1970s. Prices have not spiked nearly as much as they did then and policymakers have not resorted to extreme steps like price controls.\n\n“Were we to resort to price controls and price caps, then we could have shortages,” McNally said.\n\nWhen the war started, the West sought to avoid targeting Russia’s energy supplies directly because it was simply too critical to global markets. Russia is not just the world’s largest oil exporter, but it is the biggest natural gas exporter and a major supplier of coal.\n\nBut as the brutality of the war became clear to the world, that hands-off approach did not last, with the United States and other countries banning Russian energy imports.\n\nRussia retaliated against Western sanctions by restricting or even halting its shipment of natural gas to multiple European countries.\n\nThe European Union announced plans this week to phase out 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of the year. That move has raised the specter of further retaliation from Russia.\n\nThis tit-for-tat situation has only worsened the supply shortfall in energy markets that were already tight.\n\n“We have not yet seen how bad this energy crisis is going to get,” Bordoff said.\n\nAlready, US gasoline prices have surged by 52% over the past year to record highs, angering the public and contributing to the nation’s inflation crisis.\n\nPrices for natural gas, a vital fuel for heating homes and powering the electric grid, have nearly tripled over the past year in the United States. Natural gas prices have skyrocketed even further in Europe, though they are well off their worst levels.\n\n‘Putin just brought us there faster’\n\nToday’s energy turmoil is not simply the result of the war in Ukraine. It is also the byproduct of cratering investment in oil and natural gas, which are depleting resources that require massive sums of money just to maintain their production, let alone increase it.\n\nUpstream investment in the oil and gas sector stood at just $341 billion in 2021, 23% below the pre-Covid level of $525 billion and well below the recent peak in 2014 of $700 billion, according to the IEF.\n\nThis investment shortfall has been brought on by a series of factors, including a push among investors and governments to bet on clean energy, the uncertain future of fossil fuels and years of weak and volatile oil prices.\n\n“Because of the desire to bring down carbon emissions, we have a lot less appetite to invest in hydrocarbons. And that exacerbates the price volatility and makes it more difficult to resolve the supply side,” said Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities at Bank of America.\n\nEurope was already grappling with an energy crisis last year and prices for natural gas, coal and oil were high long before the first Russian tanks began rolling into Ukraine.\n\n“We were heading towards a crisis anyway. Putin just brought us there faster and sharper,” said McNally, who is now the president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group.\n\nShortages and gas lines?\n\nThe 1973 oil crisis was marked by hours-long lines at gas stations, fuel shortages and panic.\n\nExperts said they worry about fuel shortages again today, although they view that as a greater risk in Europe than in the United States.\n\n“Fuel shortages are a global problem. You’re going to see that very soon, though maybe not in the US,” said Bank of America’s Blanch.\n\nBlanch said he thinks this risk is lower in the United States because the country remains one of the biggest oil producers on the planet and is a major exporter of energy. Europe, on the other hand, is more reliant on foreign oil and natural gas – especially from Russia.\n\nThe IEA chief warned of natural gas rationing in Europe, which is heavily dependent on Russia for gas.\n\nBlanch noted that sky-high natural gas prices have already shut down factories in Europe.\n\n“Europe is already in natural gas rationing mode,” he said.\n\n‘We have to be careful here’\n\nOctopus CEO on renewable energy: Less gas means 'less power and less leverage to Putin' 03:56 - Source: CNNBusiness\n\nEnergy experts told CNN they worry global policymakers are mismanaging the climate crisis, focusing too much on reducing supply and not enough on cutting the world’s appetite for fossil fuels.\n\n“We’re not doing nearly enough to reduce hydrocarbon demand consistent with our climate goals,” said Bordoff.\n\nFocusing on just one side of the equation risks not only price spikes but social unrest and turning the public off to climate action.\n\n“We have to be careful here because if we allow the public to equate high energy prices with the energy transition, we’re doomed,” said McMonigle. “You will essentially lose public support, probably permanently.”\n\nMcMonigle urged governments to send signals to investors that not only is it okay to still invest in fossil fuels, but it’s “necessary” for the world economy and progress in the energy transition.\n\nBut even if policymakers convince investors to ramp up investment, that would take considerable time to result in more supply.\n\nWhat could end the energy crisis\n\nOf course, no one can say with certainty exactly how all of this will play out. And there could be surprises that ease the supply crunch.\n\nFor instance, a diplomatic breakthrough that ends the war in Ukraine and allows sanctions to get lifted from Russia would be a gamechanger.\n\nBirol said other surprises that would ease the energy crisis include an Iranian nuclear deal, a deeper economic slowdown in China or an agreement by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers to ramp up oil production.\n\nHe also reiterated that governments stand ready to release further emergency stockpiles of oil. However, even the record-setting release of US emergency stockpiles had just a modest and fleeting impact on gasoline prices.\n\nIn March, the IEA also urged governments around the world to consider drastic steps to slash oil demand, including reducing speed limits on highways, working from home up to three days a week where possible and car-free Sundays in cities.\n\nAnd there’s at least one other development that has been front-and-center lately and would ease the energy crisis: An economic recession, or at least one that’s deep enough to cause demand to collapse.", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/18/politics/house-vote-crown-act/index.html", "title": "US House passes CROWN Act that would ban race-based hair ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe US House on Friday passed legislation that would ban race-based hair discrimination in employment and against those participating in federally assisted programs, housing programs, and public accommodations.\n\nThe Democratic-led House voted 235-189 to pass the CROWN Act, which stands for “Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair.” The bill seeks to protect against bias based on hair texture and protective styles, including locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, and Afros.\n\n“Natural Black hair is often deemed ‘unprofessional’ simply because it does not conform to White beauty standards,” Democratic Rep.

Cori Bush of Missouri said Friday on the House floor before the vote. “This is the last time we say no more to Black people being demeaned and discriminated against for the same hairstyles that corporations profit from. No more to Black people being made to feel like we have cut our locs just to get a job. This is the last time we say no more to Black people being made to feel like we have to straighten our hair to be deemed professional.”\n\nRepublicans objected to the bill, arguing that federal law already covers this kind of discrimination and that Democrats should be focusing on other issues, like inflation and high gas prices.\n\n“Fourteen months of chaos and we’re doing a bill on hair,” Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said Friday, adding, “I hope we can actually focus on the things that matter to the American people.”\n\nDemocrats acknowledged that such discrimination is prohibited under existing federal law, such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act but said courts have misinterpreted the law by narrowly interpreting the meaning of race, thus allowing discrimination against people who wear natural or protective hairstyles.\n\nThis is the second time this year the House considered the legislation. The bill failed to pass the House last month when Democrats sought to fast track it. Fifteen Republicans joined with Democrats to pass the bill, but it did not reach the required two-thirds threshold to pass.\n\nThe House on Wednesday passed a resolution clearing the way for the bill, H.R. 2116, to be reconsidered.\n\nThe House passed the CROWN Act last Congress, but the bill stalled in the Senate where Republicans had held control. Now, Democrats have a 50-50 majority in the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote.\n\nThe CROWN Act is already law in more than a dozen states, after California was the first to pass it in 2019. Massachusetts recently advanced its version of the CROWN Act in the state House, which now heads to the state Senate.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/10/politics/us-saudi-relationship-reset-jamal-khashoggi/index.html", "title": "US seeks full reset with Saudi Arabia, effectively moving on from the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSenior US officials have conveyed to Saudi Arabia that the US is prepared to move forward with a “reset” of the relationship, and effectively move on from the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in order to repair ties with the key Middle East ally, senior US officials tell CNN.\n\nThe planning for a reset is a dramatic about-face for President Joe Biden, who came into office vowing to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” over Khashoggi’s murder. His administration also released an intelligence report last year that directly accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of orchestrating Khashoggi’s killing.\n\nBut officials say Biden, who is under immense pressure to crack down on Russia and lower domestic gas prices amid inflation that’s rising at the fastest pace since 1981, has set aside his moral outrage to pursue warmer relations with the Kingdom amid the dramatic global upheaval spurred by the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“Both sides have decided that for the sake of achieving peace and stability in the Middle East, we need to move past it,” said one senior US official, referring to Khashoggi’s murder. The Saudis, for their part, consider the Khashoggi case closed—and have made that clear to the US, officials said.\n\nThat doesn’t mean forgiving and forgetting, the sources noted. Biden, they said, does plan to raise Khashoggi’s murder directly with MBS, as the crown prince is known, when they meet as soon as next month. And some officials inside the administration still believe more should be done to hold MBS accountable for the crime. But the shift is now well underway after months of meetings in Riyadh between two of Biden’s top national security advisers, Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein, and Saudi officials, including MBS. And it is already sparking outrage, with Khashoggi’s fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, accusing Biden of losing his moral compass.\n\n“President Biden’s decision to meet MBS is horribly upsetting to me and supporters of freedom and justice everywhere,” she said in a statement to CNN.\n\nA human rights defender in Washington close to the administration, who was also a close friend of Khashoggi’s, told CNN that he believes moving on and doing nothing more to hold MBS accountable for Khashoggi’s killing will deal a huge blow to the prince’s opposition and Arab dissidents around the world.\n\n“The promise of accountability was the only check on this guy [MBS], now it’s gone,” he said. “When the President of the US goes to this murderer’s hometown to appease him, he’s not only glossing over his past heinous crimes with stunning impunity but enabling his future ones. It’s a wink-wink nudge-nudge to commit the next crime in a cleaner, less messy fashion.”\n\nUS officials told CNN that the decision to meet with MBS has been a tough pill to swallow for the President, who said in 2019 that Saudi Arabia had “no redeeming social value.” But they said the countries have agreed that the relationship cannot be held “hostage” by the murder, especially given how dramatically the world has changed since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nAmong the US’ most important foreign policy goals now is to isolate Russia politically and cut off funding for its war machine by banning Russian oil exports – two objectives that officials believe will be nearly impossible if Saudi Arabia is not on the US’ side, particularly when it comes to increasing oil production to try to stabilize global oil markets. The President and his senior national security advisers therefore believe that to “shun” Saudi Arabia over the murder of Khashoggi would be shortsighted.\n\nThe troubling economic trends, particularly when it comes to record high domestic gas prices and soaring inflation, have also come to dominate the priorities of the administration and shunted others aside, said a US official outside the White House.\n\n“I do think the desperation of the trajectory of the global economy is driving everything,” the official said. “They [the White House] are anxious, they are desperate.”\n\n“Their fear, and their anxiety, is making them throw principle out the door,” the official added. “The worst [economic] outcomes on this are really bad and would devastate any hopes the Democrats would have in November.”\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN en Español on Wednesday that the administration never sought to fully “rupture” US-Saudi relations, even after releasing the report last year that put MBS at the center of Khashoggi’s murder. But he said that the US would continue “to make sure that human rights is fully reflected in our foreign policy.”\n\nOil prices driving the reset\n\nBiden’s advisers have said openly that the need to increase oil production to stabilize prices is a key driver of the Saudi reset.\n\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday that “there is no doubt that Saudi Arabia has to account for what they did with Jamal Khashoggi.” But, she added, “there is also no question that we have to increase global [oil] supply. And OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, is at the head of the pack for that.”\n\nThere are of course things the Saudis want in return from the US, including a viable strategy for dealing with Iran – the Kingdom’s biggest regional enemy – as the US struggles to finalize a new nuclear deal. The Saudis also want security commitments, like the continued provision of missile defense systems, officials said.\n\nBut White House officials argue that Saudi Arabia has been working with the US in good faith over the last several months, which has made the White House more confident that a meeting between Biden and MBS will be fruitful.\n\nUS officials have repeatedly pointed to the fragile ceasefire in Yemen reached in April and the Saudi’s ouster of Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who was viewed by many officials in the region and in the US as an impediment to peace, as major diplomatic victories that would not have been possible without US engagement. The two-month-old ceasefire, which was extended last week, is the first between the warring Saudis and Houthis in six years.\n\n“I’m not going to change my view on human rights,” Biden said last week. “But as President of the United States, my job is to bring peace if I can. And that’s what I’m going to try to do.”\n\nWorking on a ‘significant agenda’\n\nA National Security Council spokesperson noted that the Khashoggi murder took place during the Trump administration, telling CNN that the US is “not looking past any conduct that took place before we entered office.” The spokesperson pointed to the sanctions the US has imposed on Saudi individuals believed to have been involved in Khashoggi’s murder and others implicated in human rights abuses.\n\nBut the spokesperson also said the US has “a significant agenda with Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the other countries of the Middle East. That agenda is focused on delivering results for the American people as well as ending wars and leading through diplomacy to bring stability to the Middle East region.”\n\nLast week’s agreement by OPEC+ to increase oil production by 200,000 barrels per day in July and August, a decision spearheaded by Saudi Arabia, was another show of good faith by the Saudis, officials believe. And with help from the United States, relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia are also slowly but steadily improving, officials noted – discussions are underway now, for example, to expand Israeli commercial planes’ access to Saudi airspace, the sources said. One regional official briefed on the discussions said Israel wants the Saudis to allow Israeli Arab Muslims to fly to the Kingdom for religious pilgrimages.\n\nIsrael has been pushing heavily for the Biden-MBS meeting to happen, multiple officials said. And underscoring the changing nature of the Israel-Saudi relationship, Biden is expected to make an extraordinarily rare flight directly from Tel Aviv to Riyadh on Air Force One while in the Middle East next month, according to two regional officials briefed on the plans.\n\nStill, those developments are unlikely to satisfy activists and American lawmakers who continue to call for further accountability and justice for Khashoggi.\n\n“The highest levels of the Saudi government, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are culpable in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, and there is no escaping that stark truth laid bare in the U.S. Intelligence Community’s 2021 public assessment,” top House lawmakers wrote in a letter to Biden earlier this week. “We must continue to insist on justice for this horrific crime.”", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Alex Marquardt", "Natasha Bertrand", "Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}]}

It is the largest fine the FTC has ever imposed for a rule that it enforces, the agency said Monday.\n\nIn a second and separate settlement, Epic will pay $245 million as refunds to consumers who were allegedly harmed by user-interface design choices the FTC claimed were deceptive. That agreement is the largest administrative order in FTC history, the FTC added.\n\nIn a blog post addressing the twin settlements, Epic said the agreement reflects an evolution in how US laws are applied to the video gaming industry.\n\n“No developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here,” Epic said in the blog post. “We accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.”\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan said the settlement reflects the agency’s heightened focus on privacy and so-called “dark patterns,” a term used to describe design elements intended to nudge users toward a company’s preferred result.\n\n“Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices,” Khan said in a statement.\n\nThe FTC’s complaint and proposed settlement dealing with children’s privacy was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. In addition to the alleged illegal collection of children’s data, the FTC also claimed that Epic’s default settings for matchmaking and in-game communications exposed children to bullying and harassment.\n\nThe allegations of Epic’s deceptive design choices were filed as an FTC administrative complaint. The complaint claims Epic made it extremely easy for children to purchase in-game items with a single click or button press without parental approval, resulting in more than one million parental complaints to Epic about unwanted charges.\n\nThe FTC further alleged that Epic made it more difficult to cancel purchases of in-game items by burying the option at the bottom of the screen and by requiring consumers to push and hold a button on their controllers to complete the cancellation. Those design choices were allegedly implemented after surveys showed that, when the cancel button was more prominently displayed, accidental charges were the “number one ‘reason’” users clicked on the button, the FTC said.\n\nEpic’s agreement with the FTC, which is not yet final, prohibits the company from using dark patterns or charging consumers without their consent, and also forbids Epic from locking players out of their accounts in response to users’ chargeback requests with credit card companies disputing unwanted charges. The agreement will last for 20 years from the time it is adopted.\n\nIn its blog post, Epic said it has agreed with the FTC to implement a feature that explicitly asks Fortnite users whether to save their payment information for future use. The feature is currently live, it added. The company also recently rolled out a more limited version of “Fortnite” for younger players that allows them to access some features while awaiting parental consent but that restricts chat and purchases.\n\nThe FTC said that as part of its children’s privacy settlement, Epic may no longer enable text and voice chat by default for teenage Fortnite players or those under the age of 13. The company must also establish a comprehensive privacy program and delete the data it allegedly gathered in violation of COPPA.\n\n“We share the underlying principles of fairness, transparency and privacy that the FTC enforces, and the practices referenced in the FTC’s complaints are not how Fortnite operates,” Epic wrote. “We will continue to be upfront about what players can expect when making purchases, ensure cancellations and refunds are simple, and build safeguards that help keep our ecosystem safe and fun for audiences of all ages.”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/business/nightcap-zelle-fraud-warren-investigation/index.html", "title": "Zelle fraud is rising. And banks aren't coming to the rescue", "text": "This story is part of CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nZelle, the popular payment app, is under fire for how it handles (or rather, doesn’t handle) fraud and scams that have exploded on the platform in recent years.\n\nThe New York Times called Zelle out in two reports earlier this year. That grabbed the attention of US senators, who pressed the CEOs of the nation’s large banks that own the platform in hearings last month and began an investigation into the service.\n\nHere’s the deal: On Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren’s office said its investigation into Zelle showed that fraud and theft are not only rampant but getting worse. And once people report fraudulent transactions, banks are reimbursing only a small fraction of the swindled customers.\n\nSen. Warren questions bank CEOs about Zelle during a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Sept. 22. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\n“Big banks own and profit from Zelle but are failing to make their customers whole for both authorized and unauthorized fraudulent activity on the platform, despite their claims that it is safe,” Warren’s office wrote.\n\nKey things to know:\n\nZelle (rhymes with “tell”) was created in 2017 as the banking industry’s answer to Venmo and Cash App.\n\nThe fintech companies behind those apps were doing what big banks had failed to do for decades — make transferring money to your friend who just paid for dinner easy and free and fast.\n\nSo the big banks got together and created Zelle, which was lame and almost no one used it till around 2020, when digital payments took off in response to the pandemic.\n\nZelle is now by far the largest peer-to-peer payment system in America. Last year, according to Zelle, transactions totaled $490 billion, up 59% from the year before. (PayPal-owned Venmo, its closest rival, handled $230 billion.)\n\nThe service is operated by Early Warning Systems, a fintech company owned by seven of the US’s largest banks.\n\nNaturally, where the internet and money collide is where scammers get to work.\n\nZelle’s size and accessibility — it’s built right into participating banks’ apps — make it the “preferred tool of fraudsters and other bad actors,” according to the report from Warren’s office.\n\nAmong the investigation’s key findings, which corroborate anecdotal evidence reported by the Times:\n\nBanks are not repaying 90% of cases in which customers were tricked into making payments on Zelle.\n\nAn estimated $440 million was lost by Zelle users through frauds and scams in 2021. But banks “appear not to have provided sufficient recourse to their customers.”\n\n“Authorized” vs “Unauthorized:” Under the a federal rule known as Regulation E, banks are technically only liable to cover fraudulent activity when it involves “unauthorized” transactions. Say, when someone steals your credit card and makes purchases without your permission. But if someone persuades you to send them $500 through a phishing scam, banks consider that “authorized” and won’t reimburse those funds.\n\nBUT… The bank data reviewed by Warren’s office suggest even the bulk of unauthorized cases are going unpaid. For example: PNC Bank indicated that its customers reported 10,683 cases of unauthorized payments totaling over $10.6 million. It refunded only 1,495 cases, totaling $1.46 million.\n\nZelle sought to downplay the report and didn’t specifically address Warren’s allegations Monday. In a statement, the company said: “Tens of millions of consumers use Zelle without incident, with more than 99.9% of payments completed without any report of fraud or scam,” adding that the proportion of fraud and scams has steadily decreased as its user numbers have climbed.\n\nThe Bank Policy Institute, a banking industry group, also disputed Warren’s findings and claimed that Zelle’s rivals Venmo and CashApp receive more reports of disputed transactions.\n\n“Zelle is the safest peer-to-peer network,” it said in a statement Monday. “For any real discussion of online fraud, the focus belongs elsewhere.”\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nIt’s kind of crazy to remember how anyone moved money among friends before the advent of payment apps. Did I actually carry cash with me? On the first every month did I take my little checkbook out and literally write out my portion of the rent on a magic slip of paper and then just hand it to my roommates? Wild. It would not surprise me if the original idea for a payments app came from a restaurant server who was fed up with splitting bills unevenly across eight different cards.\n\nBut that’s the pre-internet world Regulation E was made for. It’s a 1978 rule that only got a 21st century electronic payments update by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau late last year. It wasn’t made for the world of instant payments, and could hardly have envisioned how easy the internet would make it to swindle people out of their money.\n\nWarren’s report on Zelle could add pressure on regulators including the CFPB to update its guidance.\n\n“Given this uncertain landscape and the banks’ abdication of responsibility, regulatory clarity is needed to further protect Zelle users,” researchers wrote in the report, noting that the CFPB has regulatory authority over peer-to-peer platforms including Zelle.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: $1.26 million\n\nKim Kardashian, the reality TV star, cosmetics entrepreneur and budding private-equity manager, was hit with a $1.26 million fine for touting what turned out to be a worthless crypto token to her millions of Instagram followers.\n\nKardashian failed to disclose that she was paid $250,000 for the endorsement. Her hashtag “#ad” in the June 2021 post wasn’t enough to satisfy the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition to the fine, Kardashian agreed to refrain from any crypto asset promotions for three years.\n\n“This case is a reminder that, when celebrities or influencers endorse investment opportunities, including crypto asset securities, it doesn’t mean that those investment products are right for all investors,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nUK U-Turn\n\nIn a development that I can only assume means that Liz Truss is a Nightcap reader, the British government is reversing part of its tax proposal that was so unpopular it nearly tanked the UK bond market last week.\n\nHere’s the deal: The newly installed government of Prime Minister Liz Truss had announced a massive slate of tax cuts that have amounted to a windfall for the nation’s wealthiest people, slashing the top rate of income tax to 40% from 45%.\n\nThat provision “had become a distraction,” the finance minister said Sunday.\n\nThe proposed cuts of more than $50 billion were aimed at turbo-boosting growth. Instead, it caused panic. The pound plunged to its lowest level against the US dollar, and sparked chaos in the market for UK debt because they will require a large increase in government borrowing.\n\nIt was a dumpster fire of a plan that no mainstream economist supported.\n\nBut, as my colleague Mark Thompson writes, the about-face is more of a symbolic gesture than a genuine reckoning. It will likely reduce the overall size of the tax-cutting package by about £2 billion.\n\n“This move is rather symbolic, being less about the amount of money it will save (low billions) and more about the poor signal it had delivered of ideological (unfunded) tax cuts,” wrote Chris Turner, global head of UK markets at ING.\n\nBottom line: The Truss government’s unfunded tax cuts, which set off a panic in financial markets and put Downing Street in a standoff with the Bank of England, remain, uh, unfunded. The BOE’s bond-buying intervention may have bought the government some time, but Truss has shown no signs of budging on her fringe trickle-down economic theory.\n\nTruss’ finance minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, “still has a lot of work to do if he is to display a credible commitment to fiscal sustainability,” said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, on Monday.\n\n“Unless he also U-turns on some of his other, much larger tax announcements, he will have no option but to consider cuts to public spending: to social security, investment projects, or public services.”\n\nEnjoying Nightcap?

The allegations are virtually identical to those leveled previously by the Federal Trade Commission, which announced a settlement with Amazon on the matter in 2021.\n\nThe business practice at issue involved Amazon’s public claims that it would pay Amazon Flex delivery drivers a rate of at least $18 per hour, plus 100% of any tips that customers contributed. According to the FTC, and now Racine, Amazon in 2016 changed its payment model without notifying drivers or customers. The new model allegedly used a portion of customer tips to subsidize Amazon’s own labor costs, and tried to hide the change from drivers by reporting their tips and wages as a combined figure.\n\nRacine’s office said Tuesday it is bringing the new complaint because the FTC settlement, although it involved Amazon agreeing to pay drivers a total of $61.7 million to make them whole, did not impose any fines on the company.\n\nAmazon “has thus far escaped appropriate accountability, including any civil penalties, for consumer harm,” Racine’s office said in a release. It added that the DC lawsuit seeks civil penalties “for every violation” of DC’s consumer protection law stemming from the practice and a court order barring Amazon from such violations in the future.\n\nIn a statement responding to Racine’s suit, Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti said the company revised its payment model for delivery drivers in 2019. In its earlier allegations, the FTC said Amazon only changed its payment model after the company learned that federal regulators were investigating the practice. (The 2019 changes, the FTC said at the time, appeared to largely revert the 2016 changes and provided more transparency to drivers about their earnings.)\n\n“This lawsuit involves a practice we changed three years ago and is without merit,” Boschetti said. “All of the customer tips at issue were already paid to drivers as part of a settlement last year with the FTC.”\n\nAs part of the 2021 FTC settlement, Amazon agreed on a nationwide basis not to mislead drivers about their earnings, including tipped earnings, and to seek drivers’ explicit consent before changing how much of the customer tips they actually receive.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/business/nightcap-sbf-prison-extradition/index.html", "title": "Analysis: After a day of courtroom bickering and confusion, SBF is ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nNew York CNN —\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has agreed to be extradited to the United States, where he faces eight federal counts of fraud and conspiracy that could land him behind bars for life.\n\nJerone Roberts, the attorney representing Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas, confirmed that SBF’s next court appearance will be to complete the extradition process and is expected to happen this week — likely Tuesday.\n\nHere’s the deal: All signs pointed to a swift extradition to the US after people familiar with SBF’s plans said he intended to abandon his fight against returning to the US.\n\nBut at Monday’s hearing in Nassau, the mood was pure chaos.\n\nThe tl;dr version: It seems that SBF’s US lawyers worked out an agreement with Bahamian prosecutors to drop the extradition fight, which would have taken months, if not years, to play out.\n\nBut SBF’s local defense lawyer, Roberts, said he wasn’t included in that plan, and claimed prosecutors wouldn’t share the US indictment with him. Prosecutor Franklyn Williams dismissed Roberts’ accusation, saying that it was “not to be believed.”\n\nA representative for SBF’s American lawyers told me it was “tough to give specifics while relying on the Bahamian courts.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, the understandably frustrated magistrate judge cleared the courtroom so that Bankman-Fried could call his US attorneys with his Bahamian attorney present.\n\nKEY CONTEXT\n\nSBF had initially planned to fight efforts to return him to the United States. He has repeatedly denied knowingly defrauding customers, while admitting to managerial mistakes at FTX, his crypto exchange, and Alameda, its sister trading house (both of which are now bankrupt).\n\nBut then he was denied bail in the Bahamas, meaning he wouldn’t be able to fight extradition from the comfort of his luxury home. Instead, he’d have to stay in the country’s notorious Fox Hill prison — a place the US State Department has described as overcrowded, dirty and lacking medical care. Its crowded cells often lack mattresses and are “infested with rats, maggots, and insects,” according to a recent report. Toilet access is, at times, nonexistent.\n\nAfter a week of that, SBF is ready to face the music on US soil.\n\nTo be sure, the federal detention facility in Brooklyn where SBF could end up while awaiting trial isn’t exactly the Ritz. Inmates, lawyers and human rights advocates say the conditions inside that facility are also inhumane, citing overcrowding, frequent loss of heating and poor sanitary conditions overall. But he could also make another attempt at bail before a US court… It seems either of those options are preferable to an interminable stay at Fox Hill.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: $520 MILLION\n\nEpic Games, maker of the hit video game “Fortnite,” will pay a record $520 million to settle US government allegations that it tricked millions of players, including children and teens, into making unintended purchases and that it violated a children’s privacy law.\n\nIt is the largest fine the Federal Trade Commission has ever imposed, the agency said Monday.\n\nSPEAKING OF CHAOS…\n\nWell, the votes are in: Twitter users think Elon Musk should step down as CEO of the platform, according to a (highly unscientific) survey of Musk’s followers.\n\n57.5% of respondents said yes, Musk should step down, while, 42.5% voted no. Musk did say he would abide by the results, though as of this typing he hadn’t said whether he was stepping down or indicated who might replace him.\n\nFor those keeping track at home: It’s now been two chaotic months of Musk-era Twitter. In that time, Musk has:\n\nLaid off about half of Twitter’s staff.\n\nGiven an ultimatum to the remaining staff that they need to do “extremely hardcore” work or leave.\n\nFired employees who disagreed with him and publicly shamed former employees who were engaged in difficult moderation discussions as part of the “Twitter Files.”\n\nStarted, stopped and then restarted a revised user-verification system that costs $8 a month for a blue check.\n\nFrequently changed Twitter’s rules by executive fiat and with no notice, banning people who violate the new rules — including several tech journalists and an account that tracked his jet.\n\nSpread a conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi.\n\nWelcomed back some of the platform’s permanently banned accounts, including former President Donald Trump and at least one prominent neo-Nazi.\n\nRolled out and then promptly retreated on a policy that would prevent users from sharing links to other social media on Twitter.\n\nIn summary: Musk appears to be making it up as he goes along.\n\nThat’s not very reassuring for advertisers, which make up the vast majority of Twitter’s revenue. The company is on pace to lose $4 billion a year thanks to an advertiser exodus, estimates Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities.\n\nA successor won’t be easy to find. One of Musk’s first orders of business as CEO was to gut Twitter’s C-suite — the executive ranks who would, in normal times, be natural candidates for the top job.\n\n“No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,” Musk tweeted. “The question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive.”\n\nAnd even if he recruits externally, you’d need an iron stomach to take the helm of the financially and reputationally damaged social media platform, which Musk bought for $44 billion. Any new CEO will still have to answer to Musk, the sole board director.\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk’s management of Twitter has “severely damaged” market sentiment around Tesla, and risks sparking a backlash from advertisers and consumers, a Wall Street analyst warned.\n\nEnjoying Nightcap?

Facebook must also maintain a data security program, which includes protections of information such as users' phone numbers.\n\nFacebook-FTC deal:Settlement means a $5B fine for social network, but not much on face for users\n\nGoodbye to Apple's iPhone 6:So now what smartphone should I buy as a budget option?\n\nThe company separately agreed to pay $100 million to settle data misuse charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\"Public companies must accurately describe the material risks to their business,\" Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's Enforcement Division said in a statement. \"As alleged in our complaint, Facebook presented the risk of misuse of users data as hypothetical when they knew user data had in fact been misused.\"\n\nFacebook's privacy practices have long been in the government crosshairs and under the scrutiny of consumer watchdog groups, not all of which are satisfied with the terms of Wednesday's agreement.\n\nZuckerberg has appeared in congressional hearings after the Cambridge Analytica scandal surfaced. Facebook suspended the data analysis and political consulting firm in March 2018 for improper access to user data. That move came after The New York Times and U.K.'s The Observer said Cambridge Analytica had access to 50 million profiles and used them to target ads during the 2016 presidential election campaign. At the time, Facebook said it knew the firm had violated its policies by obtaining and secretly passing on the data, which users had agreed to share with a personality prediction app.\n\nThe separate SEC complaint also dates back to Facebook's response to Cambridge Analytica. The allegation, which Facebook while agreeing to the final $100 million judgment neither admits nor denies, is that in 2014 and 2015, Cambridge Analytica paid an academic researcher to \"collect and transfer data from Facebook to create personality scores for approximately 30 million Americans\" and that Facebook discovered this misuse in 2015 but failed to correctly disclose it for more than two years.\n\nThe $5-billion FTC fine is nearly 20 times greater than the largest privacy or data security penalty that has ever been assessed worldwide and is one of the largest imposed by the U.S. government for any violation.\n\nAs part of the settlement, the FTC's order also curbs Zuckerberg's oversight in privacy and security matters, with the requirement Facebook create a new privacy committee with independent board members who cannot be removed without a two-thirds shareholder vote. Zuckerberg and designated compliance officers each must submit individual quarterly compliance reports to the FTC.\n\nBig tech:Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter likely facing review from Justice Department\n\nEquifax-FTC settlement:What does Equifax's $700M settlement over its data breach mean for you?\n\nAdditionally, a third-party assessor will monitor Facebook's privacy-related decisions going forward.\n\nThe commission approved the settlement with a 3-2 vote, with the dissenting commissioners wanting tougher action taken against Zuckerberg.\n\nBut the order achieves more than the FTC could have achieved by going to court, says chairman Joe Simons and the commissioners Noah Joshua Phillips and Christine Wilson, who approved the settlement in their lengthy statement.\n\n\"The Order significantly diminishes Mr. Zuckerberg’s power – something no government agency, anywhere in the world, has thus far accomplished,\" the statement says.\n\n\"The provisions of this Order extinguish the ability of Mr. Zuckerberg to make privacy decisions unilaterally by also vesting responsibility and accountability for those decisions within business units, DCOs (digital compliance officers), and the privacy committee.\"\n\nThe settlement hasn't placated Facebook's harshest critics.\n\n\"A penalty that doesn’t require real structural changes, that financially is a drop in the bucket, and that appears to absolve Facebook of any liability over additional abuses like tricking kids into in-app purchases, is a get out jail free card for Facebook and sends a signal to the rest of the industry that business as usual is acceptable,\" said Common Sense CEO James Steyer in a statement. \"This punishment simply does not fit the crime and we strongly encourage policymakers to consider this just the very beginning of a long way we have to go to hold Facebook and the tech industry accountable for protecting the privacy of users, especially young people.\"\n\nConsumer Reports President and CEO Marta Tellado, added, “As expected, the size of the settlement is historic, but these attempts to hold Facebook accountable are not enough to make a real difference. With a weak and under-resourced FTC, and a glaring need for far more comprehensive privacy laws, Congress must raise the standards for consumers and hold Big Tech accountable.\"\n\nSimilarly, earlier this week, the FTC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and 50 states and territories reached a settlement with credit-reporting company Equifax over allegations that it did not implement sufficient security measures to prevent a massive data breach. Equifax must pay at least $575 million and potentially as much as $700 million.\n\nPreviously, the FTC’s highest fines were to Google, which paid $22.5 million in 2012 and Upromise, which paid $500,000 in 2017.\n\nFacebook agreed to the settlement with the agency over allegations it broke a previous agreement over privacy protections.\n\nThe changes the company agreed to will likely make it take longer to bring new features to Facebook and its other products, Zuckerberg said.\n\nBut, it is the company's \"responsibility to protect people's privacy. We already work hard to live up to this responsibility, but now we're going to set a completely new standard for our industry,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Overall, these changes go beyond anything required under US law today. The reason I support them is that I believe they will reduce the number of mistakes we make and help us deliver stronger privacy protections for everyone.\"\n\nFacebook (FB) shares were down more than 1% in early trading to $199.94; the ended the trading day up $2.30 to close at $204.66. Shares have risen 47% so far this year. The company is expected to release its second-quarter results after the market closes Wednesday.\n\nThe FTC also announced separate settlements with Cambridge Analytica, its former CEO Alexander Nix, and Aleksandr Kogan, an app developer who worked with the company. The actions allege Cambridge \"used false and deceptive tactics to harvest personal information from millions of Facebook users\" and all face restrictions on future business.\n\nTimeline:Facebook becomes the Uber of 2018\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/business/kroger-albertsons-merger-warren-sanders/index.html", "title": "Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders want to block a Kroger ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe proposed $25 billion Kroger-Albertsons grocery giant merger is already running into significant opposition from progressive lawmakers and others.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Wednesday called on the Federal Trade Commission to block the deal. “More mergers and less competition would mean even higher prices—and layoffs for employees,” Warren said on Twitter.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has also urged the regulators to reject the deal. And the Senate Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee announced Tuesday that it will hold a hearing next month to scrutinize the merger.\n\n“We have serious concerns about the proposed transaction between Kroger and Albertsons,” Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mike Lee of Utah said in a joint statement. “We will hold a hearing focused on this proposed merger and the consequences consumers may face if this deal moves forward.”\n\nSenators Klobuchar, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Cory Booker of New Jersey urged FTC chair Lina Khan Tuesday to investigate the merger, saying it “raises considerable antitrust concerns.”\n\nSenators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and others have urged regulators to block a proposed Kroger- Albertsons merger.\n\nThe proposed merger, which the companies expect to complete in 2024, would combine two of the largest grocers in the United States. Kroger currently owns nearly two-dozen chains, including Ralphs, Dillons, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Mariano’s and QFC. Albertsons, meanwhile, owns 24, such as Safeway, Vons, Jewel-Osco, Shaw’s and Acme.\n\nThe companies contend a combination would help them compete with Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Costco (COST) and other giants. The grocers are also facing increased pressure from Aldi, the fast-growing German discount supermarket chain.\n\nThe companies said the merger will benefit shoppers, workers and local communities and make the US food system more equitable.\n\nWith grocery prices already a concern for many shoppers, the companies said that they would be able to use $500 million in cost savings from the deal to reduce prices for shoppers and tailor promotions and savings. They also said they will invest $1.3 billion in Albertsons, which would include lowering prices.\n\nBut the new grocery empire would worsen the problem of grocery access, particularly in low-income areas in cities and rural towns, say some competition experts, small business advocates and researchers.\n\nThey believe the merger would drive out rival smaller grocers and independent stores, squeeze suppliers, and set off a vicious cycle of consolidation among supermarkets and suppliers, further entrenching the problem.\n\nTo satisfy regulators, Kroger and Albertsons have said they will divest hundreds of stores in areas where they overlap.\n\nBut FTC chair Khan has been critical of such divestitures in the past as a remedy for antitrust concerns, saying they were an ineffective remedy to preserve competition., and she has has pointed to Albertsons itself as a prime example.\n\nIn 2015, Albertsons merged with Safeway and sold off 146 stores to Haggen, a smaller chain, to appease regulators.\n\nBut Haggen struggled to integrate the Safeway stores and soon spiraled into bankruptcy. Albertsons then bought back dozens of the same stores it had previously sold to Haggen in bankruptcy court.\n\nKhan, in a 2017 law review article, called it a “spectacular” failure and said the remedy was “[hard] to fathom.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personal-finance/susan-tompor/2022/06/30/utility-shutoff-scam-stole-cash-via-zelle/7714138001/", "title": "Zelle is money transfer app scammers love: Tips to stay safe", "text": "The Rochester Hills woman was absolutely thrilled when she opened the letter from the Bank of America. Her nightmare of being scammed by those horrible DTE impersonators appeared to be over.\n\nThe letter, which arrived in late June, gave her hope that she might recover the money she lost to the utility shut-off scam in late April.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'\" she told me, thinking things had turned in her favor.\n\n\"Your claim has been resolved,\" the bank proclaimed in its bold greeting.\n\n\"We're happy to tell you that we've credited your account for $1,324.85. We appreciate your patience and are happy we could resolve this in your favor,\" the letter stated.\n\nIt was all there in black and white. All there, except the green.\n\nWill she or won't she recover the cash?\n\nWhen she went online to look at her bank account, she couldn't spot an extra $1,324.85 in her checking account. Worse yet, a bank representative later told her that the letter was sent in error. No money would be showing up — ever.\n\nThat phone conversation with the bank lasted nearly an hour, the woman said, as she tried to get the representative on the phone — who was very polite — to explain how in the world the bank could send a letter one day saying they're fixing the problem, then never fix it and claim they aren't required to do so.\n\nA mistake? Oh, nevermind? You won't get more than a thousand dollars back after all?\n\n\"And I lost it,\" she told me frantically by phone. \"I said, 'Do you know what you've just done to me?'\"\n\nAll the shame, all the self-doubt, all the embarrassment, all the frustration of the scam, all back to torment her once again.\n\nMore:Fake Caller ID in utility shut-off scam cost Troy woman $700 via Zelle\n\nMore:Don't lose cash on money apps, digital wallets: How to protect yourself\n\nMore:When is it time to hang up on scam call?

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Jack Reed of Rhode Island.\n\n\"Zelle’s biggest draw — the immediacy of its transfers — also makes scams more effective and 'a favorite of fraudsters,' as consumers have no option to cancel a transaction even moments after authorizing it,\" the letter stated.\n\nWhat is Zelle?\n\nAbout 1.8 billion payments — totaling $490 billion — were sent by consumers and businesses through the Zelle Network in 2021, according to the Early Warning Services. Total dollars transferred were up 59% from 2020.\n\nEarly Warning Services, which operates Zelle, is owned by seven big banks — Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.\n\nZelle is found easily on thousands of banking apps for a wide variety of banks and credit unions across the country. Or you download the Zelle app on your own. You send money to another person's bank account if you have their email or cellphone number.\n\nBank of America highlights Zelle online as a way to \"send and receive money with almost anyone in minutes, no matter where they bank.\"\n\nAt the same time, though, Zelle and others say money transfer apps should only be used to send and receive money with people you know and trust, not strangers. The same is true of gift cards, too, which are also used by scammers.\n\nZelle \"doesn’t offer a protection program for authorized payments,\" according to Early Warning Services.\n\n\"Money moves fast — directly into the enrolled recipient’s bank account. Always double check the recipient’s correct U.S. mobile number or email address, so the money goes to the right person,\" according to Early Warning Services.\n\nWhat are the hot scams?\n\nCrooks are using Zelle and other apps to rob consumers when listing fake puppies to sell, advertising phony apartments or homes to rent, offering extra income from wrapping your car in an ad and even texting consumers and pretending to be their bank.\n\nDTE had received reports of 58 scam cases through late June where customers confirmed they had paid a scammer or provided sensitive information, according to Katie Susko, a spokeswoman for DTE.\n\nSo far in 2022, Susko said, 95% of the shut-off scams requested payment through Zelle.\n\nThe latest DTE-related scam involves crooks, posing as DTE Energy, initially contacting customers via text message, then by phone call and asking them to make missed payments via a website.\n\nDTE Energy said it will never contact customers through text messaging. If you are unsure about a caller claiming to be a DTE employee, the utility recommends hanging up and calling customer service line at 800-477-4747.\n\nOne new scam: A prospective buyer supposedly wants to buy an item you listed on Facebook Marketplace but then claims that you \"need” to upgrade your Zelle or another digital wallet app to accept money from their \"business account\" for the big-ticket purchase to go through, according to a June alert by the Better Business Bureau.\n\nThe scammer supposedly puts up $300 and sends you screenshots of his Zelle app as proof. Then, the scammer pressures you into paying him back.\n\nBut the BBB warns: If you refund the fake buyer, you’ll be out a few hundred dollars. No money was spent on an upgrade. And you won't receive any money for selling the item.\n\n\"Scammers go where it's easy to get the money. Zelle is their current mechanism to drain consumer accounts,\" warned Ed Mierzwinski, PIRG Education Fund’s senior director of federal consumer programs.\n\n\"The scammers are taking advantage of consumers because the banks are letting them,\" Mierzwinski said, who says tougher consumer protection laws are needed.\n\n\"My basic advice is don't use these apps,\" Mierzwinski said.\n\nIf you do use them, PIRG suggests, that if possible, keep one separate bank account to link to peer-to-peer accounts. Don't link a money transfer app to your bank account with the biggest balance.\n\nAvoid engaging with those who contact you out of the blue and suggest that you can pay a utility bill or anything else via Zelle or another peer-to-peer app.\n\nNot surprisingly, the top payment method used by scammers to obtain money in 2021, in terms of reported dollars lost, was by “bank transfer or payment,\" according to data from the Federal Trade Commission Consumer Sentinel Network. Cryptocurrency was a very close second.\n\nVery tough for many to get money back when scammed\n\nWill you get your money back if you're scammed? Many times, the best way currently is to put up a fight — and even that might not work.\n\nYou should contact your bank or credit union immediately if a fraudster takes money from your account. Even if you were the one who was scammed into sending the money, contact your bank or credit union immediately and insist that they investigate and try to get the money back from the scammer’s bank.\n\nIf you've been scammed with Zelle and your bank refuses to return your money, file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which forwards complaints to financial institutions to respond. See www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint. Consumers also can call the CFPB at 855-411-2372.\n\nMierzwinski also suggests filing a complaint with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or www.occ.gov.\n\nYou also can report a scam to the Federal Trade Commission at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. And you can report the fraud to the state attorney general. In Michigan, go to www.michigan.gov/ag/complaints.\n\nWhat happened with the bank's letter?\n\nThe woman who lost money to the DTE scam said the Bank of America letter arrived unexpectedly in her afternoon mail on a Wednesday.\n\nWhen she didn't see the money online, she called the bank first thing the next morning. The woman then called me at 9:41 a.m. to share her frustration. We missed each other and she left a message.\n\nI called back and we talked. After we hung up, I left a voicemail and sent an email to a Bank of America media contact around 2:12 p.m. and included the woman's claim number from her letter.\n\nBy 3:49 p.m., the woman was calling me all happy now because all of a sudden the $1,324.85 was showing up as pending in her Bank of America account.\n\n\"I'm absolutely shocked,\" she said. \"I'm stunned.\"\n\nThe woman admitted to me later that when she was talking with the bank representative she did tell them that she was going to call the Detroit Free Press. Well, she did.\n\nA Bank of America spokesperson declined to address questions about the customer.\n\nThe bank only issued a statement beginning: \"It’s unfortunate when people fall for scams like this and send money to scammers posing as a legitimate business.\"\n\nThe bank said customers are warned during a Zelle transaction if they are sending money to a new recipient to only send money to people they know and trust and never to transfer money as a result of an unexpected call or text.\n\nTo help customers avoid scams, the bank has information on its website. Tips include: \"Beware of scammers impersonating banks and fraud departments.\"\n\n\"In cases like this, we attempt to get the money back from the recipient bank; however, there is no guarantee since the customer has authorized the payment,\" according to the bank's statement.\n\nWhy would a bank send the woman a letter and then claim it was a mistake?\n\nPIRG's Mierzwinski speculated that perhaps one junior level bank employee researched the rules and interpreted regulations one way and then a senior level attorney disagreed but only did so long after the letter was sent out.\n\nMierzwinski said he's heard of cases where banks took care of consumer complaints after the issue was reported to local consumer reports at newspapers or TV stations.\n\nIt's not typical, consumer watchdogs say, to hear of a bank sending a letter to offer the recovery of money and then saying it was a mistake.\n\n\"The banks are generally doubling down and claiming it's not our fault,\" he told me.\n\n\"The bank is telling consumers that it's your fault.\"\n\nWatchdogs want more breaks for consumers\n\nConsumers are caught in a mess because regulations apparently have not kept up with changing technology. Many say more consumer protection is needed.\n\n\"Clearly, the warnings provided by the payment apps themselves to beware of scams are not adequate to protect consumers from the losses,\" according to a report submitted by consumer groups April 28 before the House Financial Services Taskforce on Financial Technology.\n\nRegulation E — a federal banking rule that's meant to protect banking customers who use electronic methods to transfer money — was enacted in 1978, long before we had mobile phones, online banking and payment apps. The regulation implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.\n\n\"Regulation E’s protection against unauthorized transfers will likely not apply when the consumer is fraudulently induced to make a payment, even if the consumer’s authorization was obtained through fraud,\" according to a statement written by written by Lauren Saunders and Carla Sanchez-Adams at the National Consumer Law Center.\n\n\"Zelle is a very dangerous payment system,\" Saunders told me in interview by phone.\n\n\"These scams happen in a lot of ways and the legal rights are tricky,\" she said.\n\nIf you're persuaded to send money, Saunders said, you're probably not protected, as it's viewed as an authorized transaction. But if hackers steal money out of your account, she said, it's clear that you're protected, even if you got tricked into giving them information needed to get into your account.\n\nAn argument is being made by consumer advocates that the fraudster in many cases is actually initiating the transfer of money.\n\nThe crooks might already have the consumer’s online banking username and password, and mobile phone number.\n\nThe fraudster uses the consumer’s online banking username and password to begin the account-logon process.\n\nBut the fraudster needs more information and tricks the consumer into handing over the authentication code that the consumer’s bank just texted to the consumer. The fraudster enters that code into the consumer’s bank’s online banking portal. And the fraudster is now logged into the portal as the consumer. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently clarified, Saunders said, that consumers still have rights in that situation.\n\nNever give over such a code to a stranger, even if you believe you're talking with a trusted source.\n\nMierzwinski called the issue a loophole in the law and noted last year that the watchdog group planned to lobby Congress to fix that problem. The law hasn't change yet.\n\nIn December 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued new FAQs and clarified that Regulation E protects victims who are induced into turning over their account credentials to scammers, who conduct unauthorized transfers.\n\nSaunders noted that CFPB's FAQs only addresses the situation where you are induced into giving the crook your account credentials, not where you are induced into transferring the money.\n\nShe said banks and Zelle are responsible for unauthorized transfers that the scammers initiate, but not for ones in which consumers are defrauded into sending money.\n\n\"Given this regulatory landscape, your company and the banks have a clear responsibility to more aggressively protect consumers,\" according to the letter Warren and other Democrats sent to Zelle’s parent company, criticizing it for not doing enough to combat fraud.\n\nA bank would need to conduct an investigation to determine whether a fraudster induced the transaction.\n\n\"When a consumer provides notice to a financial institution that money was stolen from the consumer’s account, the burden is on the institution to show that the transfer of funds out of the consumer’s account was authorized by the consumer,\" according to a CFPB spokesperson.\n\nConsumers, of course, experience a great deal of confusion when they are scammed and have no idea how crooks are accessing the money.\n\n\"The banks appear to be gaming the lack of clarity to deny consumer claims,\" Mierzwinski said.\n\nA fake collection call makes a migraine worse\n\nConsumers must move cautiously to protect their money. Look out for signs of fake collection calls.\n\nThe Rochester Hills woman originally reached out to me in May when I wrote about consumers who lost money to crooks who were impersonating DTE Energy.\n\nShe saw herself in that column when she reading that a Troy woman paid $700 via the mobile wallet Zelle to scammers claiming to be from DTE and an Allen Park consumer lost $376.96 via the Zelle app to a similar DTE scam.\n\nThe Rochester Hills woman was dealing with a bad migraine when she received the fake DTE call in April. She thought she's was paid up on her bills. But the caller ID said DTE. The real DTE number showed up.\n\nThe man pretending to be from DTE claimed she owed $232. He sounded helpful, giving the impression that we could get this cleared up right away.\n\nShe wanted to pay by credit card but the scammer told her to use Zelle.\n\n\"I never used Zelle. I don't know anything about it,\" said the woman, who works for a major automaker. But the app was there at the bank site.\n\n\"Once I opened it, it was ready to go,\" she said.\n\nSomehow, the crooks figured out a way to ultimately get most of her money in her checking account. They left her with $7 in checking.\n\nWhen this first happened, she contacted DTE and Bank of America. But she said she was told by Bank of America back in April after she visited a branch that she authorized this payment so it was not fraud.\n\n\"After I got home from the bank, I cried and cried,\" she told me.\n\nAnd then she got upset all over again when the bank representative on the phone told her in June that that letter was all a mistake.\n\n\"I am beyond happy,\" she said about getting the money. \"What a roller coaster of emotions these last 24 hours.\"\n\nShe is still very upset with her bank — and says she intends to close her account.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/06/26/rent-to-own-contracts-challenged-federal-court/385195001/", "title": "Rent-to-own contracts challenged in federal court", "text": "In a first-of-its-kind lawsuit, an Indianapolis housing rights group is challenging a local realty company’s rent-to-own practices, alleging predatory lending and civil rights violations.\n\nThe owner of Rainbow Realty Group denies the allegations, saying he is merely trying to sell homes to individuals who would otherwise never qualify for a traditional mortgage.\n\nOfficials at the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana say the real estate firm targets predominantly black and minority neighborhoods in a “predatory and unlawful” rent-to-own contract scheme.\n\nHomeownership mirage:How home buyers say their American dream became a nightmare\n\nYour rights:Indiana has few protections for land contract purchases\n\nThe fair housing organization filed a federal lawsuit this month against Rainbow Realty Group, Empire Holding Corp. and the companies’ owner, James R. Hotka, alleging that Hotka, through his businesses, purchased close to 1,000 homes to target minorities for unfair land sale contracts.\n\nThe complaint alleges that through Rainbow Realty, Hotka purchased dilapidated homes in Marion County, and “lured the victims into paying inflated prices and exorbitant interest rates for these run down houses,” adding that homeowners were tricked “into investing their own money and time into repairs.”\n\nAt his office on the east side, Hotka told IndyStar he is devastated that he is being accused of running a “scheme.”\n\n“These are homes that no bank would offer a traditional home mortgage on,” he said, adding that the homes would otherwise sit empty and decrease the value of other homes in neighborhoods.\n\nThe fair housing organization alleges Hotka deliberately targets minority neighborhoods “due to the historic denial of equal opportunities for good credit and homeownership, many people in minority neighborhoods are especially susceptible to this predatory scheme,” the lawsuit filed in the Southern District of Indiana alleges.\n\n“Given the condition of their houses and their reliance on deception to ensnare victims, defendants need vulnerable customers to perpetrate this scheme.”\n\nIn this case, the homebuyers were responsible for all improvements to the interior of the home, including repairs to make the home habitable. Several consumers who participated in the rent-to-own program were evicted for delinquent payment in small claims court, according to court documents.\n\nHotka says his business practice is clear — the contract is construed as a rental for the first two years with just a few hundred dollars down, and afterwards the home becomes the property of the resident.“Most of the costs for us are at the beginning of the contract,” Hotka says, adding that he charges an average 10 percent interest on a home.\n\n“I am not trying to put people in homes they can’t afford.”\n\nHotka told IndyStar that the allegations against his 45-year-old firm are “clearly untrue,” adding that roughly 2 percent of his residents, both renters and owners, are evicted per month.\n\n“We require each one of our owners to inspect their homes,” he told IndyStar.\n\nThis is not the first time Rainbow has been under scrutiny for its business practices.\n\nThen-Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller sued Rainbow Realty in 2012 for similar claims and \"for allegedly running a rent-to-buy scheme meant to avoid Indiana's landlord tenant law.\"\n\nZoeller pursued revocation of Hotka’s real estate license through an investigation with the Indiana Real Estate Commission.\n\nIn March, current Attorney General Curtis Hill took over the case and filed a motion to dismiss the request to revoke Hotka’s license.\n\nHis office would not comment on why the request was dropped.\n\nThe origins of rent-to-own\n\nRent-to-own contracts came to fruition as early as the 1950s, “when you had neighborhoods that were credit starved and couldn’t get access to (traditional mortgages),” said Amy Nelson, executive director of the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana.\n\nNelson’s organization advocates on behalf of renters and home buyers to “ensure equal housing opportunities by eliminating housing discrimination,” according to the non-profit’s website.\n\nA representative of the National Consumer Law Center in Boston says the contracts are most often used in low-income neighborhoods and that the lawsuit against Hotka is believed to be the first to allege racial discrimination in a rent-to-own case.\n\nThe problematic aspect of rent-to-own contracts are that they can be misconstrued in court as a renters’ contractby consumers despite the resident of the home believing that they are the true owner of the property, says Sarah Mancini, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.\n\n“Really what makes (rent-to-own contracts) so predatory is because it blurs the lines between renting and owning,” Mancini said.\n\nThe practice has grown substantially in the past 10 years, because after the Great Recession many people were unable to qualify for conventional mortgages, Nelson said.\n\n“In 2010 and 2011, credit was extremely tight, no one was getting a mortgage unless someone had a lot of money to put down,” Nelson said.\n\nAfter the housing market collapsed nearly a decade ago, Fannie Mae resold about 400,000 homes to investors, including more than 10,000 to firms that specialize in seller-financed deals. Some of those homes were sold in bulk transactions for pennies on the dollar.\n\nFannie Mae stopped these bulk sales in 2014, but firms continue to buy individual homes from Fannie on the open market. In all, Fannie has resold 1.2 million homes since 2009, the worst year of the crisis.\n\nA particularly troubling aspect of the contracts is that the seller enjoys the most gains when an individual is evicted from the property, Nelson said. Hotka disputes the notion.\n\n\"I lose money when people are evicted,\" he said.\n\nNelson estimates that there are roughly 12 companies that offer rent-to-own contracts in the Indianapolis area.\n\nThe future of the practice\n\nThe federal government and state agencies are taking a critical look at rent-to-own contract agreements.\n\nIn May, Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that they would cease sales of bank-owned properties to rent-to-own company Vision Property Management and its affiliates.\n\nThis month, the Wisconsin Department of Justice sued South Carolina-based Vision Property Management, which owns about 200 homes that it offers to rent or lease to low-income individuals.\n\nThe department wants Vision tobe banned from running a rent-to-own operation in Wisconsin and be ordered to refund money collected through the \"illegal rental, leasing and sale\" of its properties, according to the suit filed this month.\n\nIndianapolis City-County Councilman Zach Adamson, whose district contains tens of thousands of empty and abandoned homes, says he would like to see greater regulation of rent-to-own contracts in the state.\n\nHe said he believes the contracts are often predatory.\n\nHotka disagrees.\n\nHe said he runs a long-standing, legitimate business and wants to continue to run it as he has for the past four decades.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Fatima Hussein at (317) 444-6209.

The median individual reported loss was $2,600.\n\nThe vast majority of those who reported being bilked used Bitcoin to pay scammers, at 70%, followed by Tether and Ether. The victims typically are part of a younger age group – those aged 25-40 are three times as likely to lose money due to fraud.\n\nCrypto scams are becoming increasingly popular, shooting up 60 times higher than in 2018. It has all the elements that give scammers an advantage – no bank to flag suspicious transactions, irreversible transfers and novice investors that are often largely unfamiliar with how crypto works.\n\nThe FTC’s warning comes at a volatile time in the crypto market. Since Bitcoin hit its peak of $69,000 in November, it’s lost more than half its value as investors have pulled out of riskier assets due to rising interest rates.\n\nNearly half of those who reported losing money to a crypto scam in 2021 said they were lured in through an online post or social media message. More than half of the posts were seen on Facebook or Instagram.\n\nFake investment opportunities were behind $575 million of all crypto losses reported to the FTC, far more than any other fraud type.\n\n“The stories people share about these scams describe a perfect storm: false promises of easy money paired with people’s limited crypto understanding and experience,” the FTC report said.\n\nIn February, a federal grand jury in San Diego indicted the founder of BitConnect for allegedly orchestrating a $2.4 billion global Ponzi scheme. The founder was accused of misleading investors about the cryptocurrency’s “lending program,” claiming the company’s proprietary technology would bring substantive returns to investors by tracking cryptocurrency exchange markets.\n\nAnd in May, the CEO of Mining Capital Coin was indicted for “allegedly orchestrating a $62 million global investment fraud scheme” that promised sizable returns from mining new cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn both cases, scammers promised substantial returns to their investors, but instead pocketed the money into their own crypto wallets.\n\nLast month, the SEC announced it was hiring more than a dozen new employees to combat cryptocurrency fraud.\n\nThe FTC said there are steps to take to avoid getting scammed. The first is to steer clear of anyone who promises guaranteed returns.\n\n“No cryptocurrency investment is ever guaranteed to make money, let alone big money,” the FTC said. A legitimate investment also will never require you to buy cryptocurrency, the FTC said.\n\nRomance scams also play a role in this kind of fraud – with a median individual reported crypto loss of $10,000. The FTC also warned not to mix online dating and investment advice.\n\n“If a new love interest wants to show you how to invest in crypto, or asks you to send them crypto, that’s a scam,” the FTC said.", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/26/gonerfest-purple-haze-russia-chaco-chocolate-news-around-states/40203691/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: A new project is highlighting some of the places in the state that played a role in the civil rights movement. An online oral history presentation called “Voices of Alabama” features photos of historic sites and interviews with some of the people who worked with the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s. The state was a hotbed of the movement at the time. The parsonage where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. lived in Montgomery is included. So are other places including a home in Selma where landmark demonstrations were planned, as well as churches in Birmingham that played a role in the movement. The project, which features 20 sites total, was assembled by the New York-based World Monuments Fund and the Alabama African-American Civil Rights Heritage Sites Consortium.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Board of Education has announced high teacher turnover statewide. KTUU-TV reports 25 superintendents out of the state’s 54 school districts have been in their position for less than two years, and 13 of them began this school year. The education agency says the turnover rate for teacher, principal and superintendent positions mirrors a national trend of teachers leaving the profession without being replaced. Agency officials say they expect to have the latest data Oct. 15 on how many teachers are leaving the state. Officials say lack of competitive salaries and benefits could be the cause, and they are exploring alternative certification pathways that won’t sacrifice teacher quality. Officials say the University of Alaska Anchorage education program’s loss of accreditation could also pose problems.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state Department of Corrections urged an appeals court Tuesday to throw out a 2018 contempt-of-court ruling against now-retired Corrections Director Charles Ryan for failing to follow through on promises in a legal settlement to improve prisoner health care. Timothy Berg, an attorney representing the agency, told the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco that the judge who found Ryan in civil contempt and imposed a $1.4 million fine against the state for noncompliance didn’t have contempt powers available to enforce the nearly 5-year-old settlement. The settlement was a private agreement between the state and prisoners, not a court order enforceable through contempt powers, Berg said. The state has been dogged by complaints that it has been dragging its feet for years in complying with the settlement.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State environmental officials have approved an air permit for a Chinese company’s $1.8 billion paper mill that has been delayed by President Donald Trump’s trade dispute with China. The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality approved the permit for Sun Paper’s mill in Arkadelphia, setting emissions limits for the facility. The plant will produce liner board for cardboard boxes. Sun Paper consultant Ray Dillon says design engineering can now begin, but a construction date hasn’t been set. The project was first announced in 2016. Dillon says it will be further delayed unless the trade dispute is resolved. Stephen Bell, the Arkadelphia Area Chamber of Commerce president and chief executive officer, says a delegation from Clark County is traveling to China next month to meet with Sun Paper.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A proposal to restrict where homeless people may camp drew protest at a City Council meeting from demonstrators who fear the rules would criminalize homelessness. Councilmembers began discussion Tuesday on proposed changes to the city’s code that would prevent people from sleeping near sensitive areas such as schools or blocking right-of-ways like driveways and loading docks. During public comment, opponents voiced concerns that the restrictions would send the message that homeless people are dangerous. The meeting was briefly halted as demonstrators chanted “shame on you.” A motion to consider the changes was submitted in July. Last week, President Donald Trump visited California and blamed the state’s homelessness crisis on “liberal” policies. The council took no action and promised further discussion on the issue.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Alarmed by violence depicted in trailers for the upcoming movie “Joker,” some survivors of the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting are asking distributor Warner Bros. to commit to gun control causes. Sandy Phillips’ daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was one of 12 people killed during a midnight showing of the Batman film “The Dark Knight Rises,” also distributed by Warner Bros. Phillips and four other Aurora survivors sent a letter to Warner on Tuesday asking the studio to lobby for gun control. Phillips says she was compelled to act after seeing a trailer for “Joker,” with the Batman villain portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the film being released Oct. 4. Warner issued a statement later Tuesday saying it has always supported victims of gun violence and calling on policymakers to enact bipartisan legislation to address what it called an epidemic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A federal appeals court has ruled that a lawsuit seeking to change the way the state counts prisoners when drawing up legislative districts can move forward. A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Tuesday rejected the state’s request to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the NAACP. The judges disagreed with the state’s argument that it is immune from the lawsuit. The decision upheld a ruling by a federal judge in Connecticut. The civil rights organization argues it is unfair and unconstitutional that inmates are included in the population counts of the areas where they’re imprisoned rather than their home districts. The NAACP says urban legislative districts, with larger minority populations, often lose out because there is essentially an undercount in their communities.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The U.S. Mint is now selling $1 coins that pay homage to a female astronomer from the state. Annie Jump Cannon, who developed the star-classifying system that is still used today, was born in Dover. Cannon graduated as valedictorian from Wilmington Conference Academy, which is now Wesley College, in 1880, according to the Delaware Public Archives. She went on to develop the Star Spectra system, which classifies more than 300,000 stars based on color and temperature. Cannon was the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, according to the state archives. She was legally deaf. One side of the coin features a silhouette of Cannon with a backdrop of the night sky and the phrase “Classifying the Stars.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The FBI has searched the headquarters of the city’s Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. Deputy Mayor Lucinda Babers oversees the agency and tells The Washington Post that the Tuesday search focused on the workstation of a single employee. Officials didn’t immediately identify the employee, who has since been placed on administrative leave. FBI Washington Field Office spokeswoman Melanie Lowry would only confirm there was court-authorized law enforcement activity at the agency. Babers said in a statement that the search wasn’t related to operations of the agency, which is responsible for housing code enforcement and occupational licensing. The agency has been heavily criticized since a fatal fire at an unlicensed rental row house last month.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A police officer who was fired after arresting two 6-year-olds at their schools has a disciplinary history that includes excessive force and a racial profiling allegation. The Orlando Sentinel reports Dennis Turner had retired from the department last year and was working in the reserve unit when he arrested the students. Records released Tuesday show Turner was disciplined seven times during his 23-year tenure and was the subject of 16 citizen complaints. In one case, records show Turner stunned a trespassing suspect five times. In 2015, he was accused of asking a woman during an investigation if she was related to Saddam Hussein because her last name sounded the same. The children were arrested in separate incidents last week. The state attorney’s office said they won’t be prosecuted.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State records show that behind the elegant lobbies and brochures promising compassionate care, many senior care facilities fail to provide even a minimum level of care. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports many senior living centers in the state feature extremely thin staffing and constant turnover among low-paid staff. The failures have resulted in injuries, humiliation and even deaths. At Sunrise at East Cobb, 91-year-old World War II veteran Adam Bennett left a desperate voicemail to his daughter saying, “I’m dying. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.” After Bennett’s death, doctors discovered broken ribs, a punctured lung and a damaged kidney. Prosecutors said a caregiver had punched him repeatedly. A worker was convicted of elder neglect. In a statement, Sunrise said it has made changes at the home, including hiring new staff and retraining workers.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Conservationists have released seven Hawaiian crows, increasing the population of the critically endangered birds. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports the Hawaiian crows, or Alala, joined nearly 20 other birds released in the Big Island’s Puu Makaala Natural Forest Reserve in the past two years. The release this month was part of the Alala Project, a joint revitalization effort by the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and San Diego Zoo Global. Officials say the birds were declared extinct in the wild in 2002 but have been gradually reintroduced in groups since 2017. Officials say 11 crows were released in 2017, including one that sustained an injury and was retrieved by the Alala Project and released again this month.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Four women are suing Canyon County because they say they were paid lower wages than their male colleague, even though they all had equal or superior experience and performed the same tasks. Linda Ellis, Tracy Johnson, Rene Whitneck and Toni Kreiter filed the civil rights lawsuit Monday in Idaho’s U.S. District Court, contending they were each paid less than $25 an hour for their work as nurses at the Canyon County Jail, while the only male nurse at the jail was paid more than $31 an hour. They also said that they were required to wear scrubs, while the male nurse was allowed to wear tactical gear, and that the disparities were not the result of a seniority or merit system. Both state law and federal law make it illegal to pay an employee less for comparable work because of their sex.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Fewer bicyclists are being ticketed in the city, but most of the citations are going to riders in low-income, predominantly African American neighborhoods. The Chicago Tribune obtained figures from the police last month under the Freedom of Information Act showing bike citations dropped from more than 4,000 in 2016 to 2,196 last year. Fewer than 600 tickets were issued through late June. But the newspaper reports that over half of the citations were issued in majority African American neighborhoods on the South and West sides in 2018 and 2019, mirroring the numbers in preceding years. Transportation equity advocates say the practice of ticketing bikers in impoverished areas is “racist and discriminatory.” City officials and the state attorney general approved a police consent decree in January, heightening scrutiny on misdemeanor arrests.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Four state residents have sued the federal government over Indiana’s plan to implement work requirements for low-income residents who receive their health insurance through Medicaid. The lawsuit filed Monday in federal court comes after rulings have blocked similar work requirements in Arkansas, Kentucky and New Hampshire. Indiana’s program would require those not qualifying for exemptions to report 20 hours a month of work or related activity or face coverage loss after Dec. 31. The lawsuit filed by Indiana Legal Services and the National Health Law Program maintains the rules wrongly jeopardize health coverage for thousands of people. Gov. Eric Holcomb’s office tells The Journal Gazette the requirements are intended “to ensure Hoosiers can easily skill up, volunteer in their community or get a better-paying job.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Slaughterhouse, a haunted attraction featuring Iowa’s own heavy metal band Slipknot, is returning to downtown. New features have been added to the Slaughterhouse – including Slipknot memorabilia, decor and themed actors – for the entirety of its 2019 season. The attraction, which opens Oct. 4 and runs through Oct. 26, is heavily influenced by the band’s legacy of heavy metal expression. General admission tickets for the Thursday-through-Sunday haunted house cost $20. Skip-the-line passes are available for $30. Exclusive merchandise bundles and tickets are on sale online. “The quality and cohesive story line make the Slaughterhouse comparable to a cinematic experience,” says Ian Miller, attraction co-founder, creative director-producer and director. “We want our guests to feel immersed as if they are walking through a favorite horror film.”\n\nKansas\n\nMerriam: A dog that spent more than 400 days at a suburban Kansas City animal shelter has found a home after a man moved into a kennel with the terrier mix and posted videos of the experience on Facebook. Staff with the Great Plains SPCA shelter in Merriam cheered as the 3-year-old dog, named Queen, left the shelter with her new owner, Tony Puluso. He told KMBC-TV that Queen is a “perfectly sweet dog.” He said he didn’t even know she was at the center of a viral campaign to find her a home. The man behind the campaign was Scott Poore, of Mission Driven Goods, which creates fundraisers for shelters. He moved in with Queen on Sept. 18, bringing with him a laptop, a desk and a small twin mattress.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: Two students are suing the University of Kentucky, claiming the college is violating federal law by failing to offer women enough varsity athletics opportunities. The lawsuit says UK has to add about 183 women to its athletics programs in order to comply with Title IX, the civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education programs. The suit was filed in federal court Wednesday morning against UK, its board of trustees, athletic director Mitch Barnhart and university President Eli Capilouto. The plaintiffs are asking the court to require UK to expand varsity-level athletics opportunities for women and increase the financial assistance it affords female athletes. They’re also seeking monetary damages.\n\nLouisiana\n\nWoodworth: State wildlife agents say a stolen cellular game camera kept sending pictures, letting them identify the man who had it. He and the man from whom he said he’d bought it were arrested. A Department of Wildlife and Fisheries statement Monday said Kurt Wiggins, 55, is accused of theft and Ernie Jenkins, 53, of possessing stolen items. Both are from Woodworth. Department spokesman Adam Einck says he doesn’t know whether either has an attorney. He says a U.S. Department of Agriculture feral hog trapper reported Sept. 16 that his game camera, mount and battery pack were stolen from a trap site in the Kisatchie National Forest near Woodworth. Einck says agents with a search warrant found the items Sept. 19 at Jenkins’ home. The camera was marked as U.S. government property.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Some voters in the state say they were tricked into signing a petition that could lead to a vote on repealing a law that eliminates religious and philosophical exemptions for childhood vaccines. The Portland Press Herald reports that voters claim to have been misled and, in some cases, lied to about the details of the petition they were signing. Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap says he cannot remove signatures under state law. However, petitioners are required to have a copy of the law they want to enact or repeal for a voter’s review. Cara Sacks, co-chair of Mainers for Health and Parental Rights, which organized the petition drive, says voters were asked to sign a petition to allow people to vote on the issue of government-mandated vaccines.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The federal government is poised to provide $76million in funding for the Chesapeake Bay Program next year, more than 10 times the amount originally allotted for the program by the Trump administration in March. A 2020 funding bill that passed a Senate appropriations subcommittee Tuesday included a $3 million increase over last year’s budget for the Environmental Protection Agency program. The allocation amounts to the first annual increase in funding for the program since fiscal year 2015. When the Trump administration proposed cutting the program by 90% in March, the move was met by bipartisan criticism. The cuts were part of a move to reduce the overall Environmental Protection Agency budget by about 30%, down to $6.1 billion.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State regulators have approved a tightly regulated home delivery system for recreational marijuana. The Cannabis Control Commission voted 4-1 Tuesday to grant final approval for the system. Legal deliveries are scheduled to begin next year. For two years, the commission will only give delivery permits to participants in its social equity program, as well as smaller growers and businesses owned by state residents. Commissioners say it makes sense to prioritize smaller businesses because delivery programs will likely be cheaper to start than retail stores. Consumers will be required to visit a store to verify they’re over age 21 before they can place delivery orders. Delivery workers will also have to wear a body camera during customer interactions to deter theft.\n\nMichigan\n\nEscanaba: Researchers from Michigan Technological University have wrapped up their second year of work using drones to photograph native and invasive plants in the Hiawatha National Forest. The team conducted drone flights in August in the eastern half of the forest, the Escanaba Daily Press reports. The first flights were completed last year, marking the first time that drones have been used to survey the forest. Researchers are reviewing the information collected by the drones and will share their findings with the U.S. Forest Service. Jim Ozenberger, program manager for the Hiawatha National Forest’s soils, water and landscape ecology programs, says the drones are an efficient way to collect information about invasive species, particularly in coastal parts of the forest that can be difficult to access.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: A homeless man has pleaded guilty to starting a fire that destroyed a 117-year-old synagogue. Matthew Amiot, 36, entered his guilty pleas on negligent fire charges Tuesday in St. Louis County District Court. The fire destroyed the Adas Israel Synagogue on Sept. 9. Authorities say Amiot used a lighter to ignite combustible materials outside the main building, near a separate religious structure called a sukkah. The complaint says Amiot admitted starting the fire and told police he tried to spit on it to put it out but walked away when that didn’t work. Police say they don’t believe the fire was a hate crime. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 25. The Star Tribune of Minneapolis reports that prosecutors are recommending probation.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A guitar given to B.B. King for his 80th birthday has sold for $280,000 at an auction of items from the blues legend’s estate. Julien’s Auctions says the Mississippi native often used the black Gibson ES-345 prototype that was one of several guitars he called “Lucille.” Early in his career, King ran back into a burning nightclub to rescue his guitar, and he later learned the fire started when two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. The estate auction took place Saturday, a few days after what would have been King’s 94th birthday. The 15-time Grammy winner was 89 when he died in 2015. He is buried in the small town of Indianola, Mississippi, near the community where he grew up picking cotton.\n\nMissouri\n\nOak Grove: A nonprofit that advocates for the separation of church and state alleges that a school district on the outskirts of Kansas City is forcing religion on students and has threatened to sue if it doesn’t stop. The Kansas City Star reports that Oak Grove Superintendent Bryan Thomsen says the district is investigating the claims that the Freedom From Religion Foundation made in a letter this month alleging that the district repeatedly violated the First Amendment’s establishment clause. The groups say many middle and high school teachers instruct students on the “biblical view of the creation of the world” while teaching them about evolution. The group says crosses are displayed in the district’s front office, and mandatory faculty meetings include prayer.\n\nMontana\n\nLivingston: With a Montana International Film Festival screening of their latest movie, “Robert the Bruce,” on the horizon, a group of local filmmakers is intent on making this city the Hollywood of the North. Real estate developer and area native Carter Boehm and his production company, Ponderosa Films, partnered with Livingston’s own Soundcolor Studios to build a medieval village on Boehm’s Cokedale ranch to serve as the setting for the “Braveheart” sequel starring actor Angus MacFadyen reprising his role as Robert the Bruce. The movie closed out the Montana International Film Festival, held in Billing’s Babcock Theatre, the Livingston Enterprise reports. Soundcolor Studios, led by local brothers Abram and Michael Boise, is hard at work constructing a sprawling 28-building Old Western town on land just south of Chico Hot Springs.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A major building project at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s College of Engineering is getting a $20 million boost from one of North America’s largest construction and engineering companies. University officials have announced a donation of $20 million from Pete Kiewit Sons’ Inc. The contribution will help pay for a planned $85 million engineering facility in Lincoln, to be named Kiewit Hall. The building will serve as the engineering college’s academic hub. It also will house Lincoln-based construction management programs. Bruce Grewcock, the company’s chairman and chief executive officer, says the goal is to help turn the university’s engineering program into one of the best in the country.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The University of Nevada, Reno has completed the $18 million sale of about one-tenth of its half-century-old research farm for commercial development on one of the last big, undeveloped parcels zoned for industrial-retail use within the city limits. The university plans to spend the proceeds from the 104 acres – more than $173,000 per acre – on new campus laboratories and advanced research into wetlands and range improvements for livestock. It finalized the deal Monday with Reno Land Inc., which already is building a pair of master-planned communities at a former Reno shopping center and on ranchland that was owned by casino mogul Bill Harrah. The agricultural research center along the Truckee River about 5 miles east of downtown dates to 1956.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: More than 800 families will be getting lock boxes and safe disposal bags in an effort to keep youth away from prescription drugs. Organizations that promote public health and drug abuse prevention on Tuesday announced the new initiative aimed at fighting the state’s opioid crisis. Officials from the Capital Area Public Health Network and the Rx Abuse Leadership Initiative of New Hampshire said they will be distributing the boxes and bags at community events in Concord and two dozen surrounding towns, or parents can request them directly from the organizations. They said prevention is a key part of addressing the crisis, and the new initiative builds on other programs, such as the periodic drug take-back days when police departments collect prescription medication.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: The state says it has bought its 700th home under a program to acquire and demolish houses in flood-prone areas. But nearly seven years after Superstorm Sandy, not one of those purchases has been along the ocean. The state Department of Environmental Protection announced the milestone Tuesday, the purchase of a home in South River in Middlesex County. The clusters of homes bought thus far have mainly been along rivers, and some have been on or near bays, both of which are also flood-prone. The environmental protection agency did not respond to a request for comment on why no oceanfront homes have been bought under the Blue Acres program. But it has in the past said there have been no willing sellers in those areas. The program is strictly voluntary.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nChaco Culture National Historical Park: Chaco Canyon has fueled scientific curiosity for more than a century, with each discovery made at the world heritage site spurring only more questions about the people who lived there. One thing is for sure: Chocolate was part of life at the once-bustling ceremonial and economic hub. By analyzing 1,000-year-old pottery sherds, archaeologist Patricia Crown solved that mystery in recent years when she and a chemist at Hershey Co. uncovered the first evidence of chocolate consumption beyond the cacao-growing regions of Mesoamerica. That work has since shed more light on early trade routes and the widespread use of cacao in the American Southwest. Chocolate residue has been found on sherds collected in Utah, Arizona and northern Mexico. Crown is after the details now – who got to drink the frothy libations, and did the size of the mug matter?\n\nNew York\n\nSalamanca: A crumbling 3-mile stretch of the New York State Thruway that runs through Seneca Indian Nation territory will be repaired under an agreement between the state and the Senecas. The state is set to begin work on the western New York roadway Thursday. The section crossing the Senecas’ Cattaraugus Territory has fallen into dangerous disrepair amid conflict between the state and tribal leaders, including over whether New York had permission to build on Seneca territory when it constructed the 500-mile Thruway across New York in the 1950s. Seneca President Rickey Armstrong Sr. says the agreement announced Wednesday follows several days of direct communication with state officials. Thruway Authority Executive Director Matthew Driscoll says the work will begin with urgent repairs followed by full reconstruction.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nLinville: Park officials are warning visitors that black bears have been active this season at a popular camping spot. Officials at Grandfather Mountain State Park, about 120 miles northwest of Charlotte, alerted visitors last week that they may need to be prepared to “back away slowly and make lots of noise” if they encounter one of the brazen bears. Officials confirmed there have been multiple sightings reported this month. One recent report detailed that a bear even figured out how to get into “bear-proofed” food hung from a campsite tree. Park officials say that once a bear associates humans with food, it can become a “problem bear.” They added that as more people enjoy the state’s remote environments, it can put a strain on animals that live there.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s top gambling regulator says her agency needs to double in size to keep pace with the “explosion” of wagering brought on by electronic pulltabs. Charities began operating electronic pulltabs one year ago. State gaming director Deb McDaniel told the Legislature’s interim Taxation Committee on Tuesday that the popularity of the games has “put a tremendous strain” on her agency. She says the amount wagered on charitable games in the current two-year budget cycle will top $1 billion, mostly from electronic pulltabs. That’s about 75% more than the 2015-17 budget cycle. Rep. Jim Grueneich, who heads the committee studying charitable gambling taxes, says the panel will meet at least two more times before the full Legislature convenes in 2021. He says legislation likely will come from the meetings.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: It’s the year of Lafcadio Hearn. The enigmatic late-19th-century author was once celebrated across the globe, but his fame did not last outside Japan, where his writings on Japanese folklore are still taught in schools. In Cincinnati, where his career began as a reporter for the Cincinnati Enquirer and Cincinnati Commercial, Hearn is relegated to the fringe of history. That could change. The Lafcadio Hearn Society/USA is presenting a Hearn symposium at downtown’s Main Library at 1 p.m. Saturday. It’s one of many efforts to raise the awareness of Hearn on the 150th anniversary of his arrival in America. He’s the subject of a new novel, “The Sweetest Fruit” by Monique Truong, which explores Hearn through the women in his life. Also celebrating the author are a collection of his Japanese tales, a featured article in The New Yorker and plans for a plaque in Cincinnati.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt is demanding that all state agencies receive approval from his office before applying for federal grants or other outside funding. The Republican issued an executive order Tuesday requiring approval of his Secretary of Budget Mike Mazzei before any state agency, board or commission applies for a grant of more than $50,000 from a foundation or nonprofit. The threshold is increased to $100,000 for applications for federal grants. In a statement accompanying the order, Stitt says he wants to avoid pursuing short-term funds that may run out and require continuing state funds. He also says he wants to make sure the grants that agencies seek “match the vision and values of Oklahoma.” The governor’s order doesn’t apply to public colleges and school districts.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The secretary of state is preparing an effort to make her office, the state’s top elections watchdog, a nonpartisan post. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the deputy to Secretary of State Bev Clarno, Richard Vial, says they are considering it and may ask the Legislature to adopt the change that would make that happen. Of the 35 states that elect their secretaries of state, all but one is held by a politician affiliated with a specific party. In places where the secretary of state oversees elections, though, that role is increasingly contentious. Candidates frequently complain that partisan elections officials favor candidates from their own party. The secretary of state’s job is the only statewide office Republicans have held in the past 19 years.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he is now in favor of legalizing marijuana for recreational use and is asking lawmakers to consider it. Wolf’s announcement Wednesday advances his position from December, when he signaled that he was open to taking a look at it as it gathered popularity and momentum, particularly in bordering states. Before last winter, he had dismissed the idea. Wolf, a Democrat, made the announcement while releasing a report from Lt. Gov. John Fetterman’s statewide listening tour on legalizing marijuana. Wolf has long supported decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, although the Legislature hasn’t passed legislation to that effect. He signed a bill in 2016 creating Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program. He also wants lawmakers to allow the expungement of past convictions of nonviolent and small marijuana-related crimes.\n\nRhode Island\n\nExeter: State Police say they plan to create three new state police substations and close two barracks. State Police Col. James Manni says the new substations will improve public safety and ensure troopers can be closer to their patrol areas. Manni says the new substations in Jamestown, Exeter and Portsmouth are expected to open within the next six months to a year. Within the next few years, the department plans to shut down barracks in Richmond and North Kingstown and condense their operations with the already-closed Portsmouth barracks into one central-southern barracks. All those buildings are in poor physical condition. Manni says about 80 to 100 troopers and 10 detectives would work at the new barracks.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Federal officials say they’re encouraged by a test of a jamming technology some hope will help combat the threat posed by inmates with smuggled cellphones. The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday that they received “promising results” from the test conducted in April at a maximum-security South Carolina prison. Assistant Attorney General Beth Williams says it was the first time federal officials have collaborated with officials at a state prison for such a test. The test marked progress on the state level quest to stamp out cellphones, which officials have long said represent the top security threat within their institutions. Jamming technology was tested last year at a federal prison, but a decades-old law says state or local agencies don’t have the authority to jam the public airwaves.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nYankton: The Yankton Sioux Tribe won’t be getting National Guard assistance for now for flood relief efforts at Lake Andes. The South Dakota Department of Public Safety on Tuesday recommended declining the request because other options are available. However, the state says it’s willing to provide other aid. The Yankton Daily Press and Dakotan reports that flooding from Lake Andes has cut off Highway 18/50/281 east of Lake Andes. The road has been mostly closed since March. The state responded by raising the highway several feet. The road reopened for about two weeks, only to close again following more flooding two weeks ago. Tribal leaders told KSFY-TV the two rounds of flooding have taken taking a toll on members, causing mold in homes and cutting off a housing unit from town.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: For the 16th time, Goner Records will present its multiday, multivenue garage rock extravaganza, Gonerfest, this weekend. While the event has always been popular – drawing fans from all over the globe and packing out venues across Memphis – this year all-access passes sold out well in advance, as did individual tickets for Friday and Saturday night concerts at the Hi-Tone Cafe. The festival is an outgrowth of the Cooper-Young-based record label and retail store. Since launching in 2004, Gonerfest has become one of the Bluff City’s unique cultural events, expanding beyond its modest garage rock origins to include a mix of music, film and visual arts. Tickets are still available to the Thursday night opening concert, and Goner will present a series of daytime shows, starting Friday with an event at Memphis Made Brewing, which has crafted special Gonerfest beers.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Recent sunsets in the city have been tinged with a burst of purple haze that experts link to a volcano eruption three months ago in Russia. The Houston Chronicle reports the National Weather Service says chemicals and other particles are ejected into the atmosphere when a volcano erupts. Meteorologist Jimmy Fowler, with the NWS office in Galveston, says the particles causing people to see purple light rays are sulfur dioxide gas. Fowler says that the gas is not harmful and that “it just looks pretty.” A volcano in the Kuril Islands in Russia’s Sakhalin Oblast region erupted June 22. The volcano, called Raikoke, spewed ash and debris 10 miles into the sky.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Surprise, or maybe no surprise at all: Among the 50 states, Utahns drink the least beer. According to a recent Gallup poll, some 63% of American adults drink alcohol, with beer the favored beverage among them. Americans consumed an estimated 6.3 billion gallons of beer in 2018, or about 26.2 gallons per drinking-age adult. In Utah, there are both religious and legislative reasons for residents drinking less alcohol than other states. A heavy presence from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, whose beliefs require that members abstain from alcohol, almost certainly plays a major role. State laws also maintain that there can only be one bar for every 10,200 residents, meaning that with a population of just over 3 million people, Utah is only allowed to have about 300 bars in the entire state.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: State transportation officials say Amtrak’s Ethan Allen Express passenger train could reach the city by 2021. The extension of the service from Rutland north to Burlington has been in the planning stages for decades while officials have upgraded the tracks and other infrastructure between the two cities. The Ethan Allen Express currently runs between Rutland and New York. Dan Delabruere of the Vermont Transportation Agency tells WCAX-TV railroad passenger platforms in Vergennes, Middlebury and Burlington need to be upgraded before the train can be extended. Delabruere says he hopes the platforms can be finished by the end of next year. Officials say the train ride from Burlington to New York will take about eight hours. Vermont officials also hope to extend the state’s other Amtrak train, The Vermonter, to Montreal.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: In an effort to save dwindling space, the Army is proposing new rules to limit who can be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Under the current rules, the cemetery would run out of space by the mid-2050s, the Army says. The proposed restrictions would preserve the cemetery’s lifespan for another 150 years. Veterans who retired from active duty and were eligible for retirement pay would no longer be automatically eligible for in-ground burial. They would be eligible, though, for above-ground “inurnment” of cremated remains. Those who were killed in action or received awards such as the Purple Heart or Silver Star could still receive an in-ground burial. U.S. presidents and vice presidents also would retain eligibility. The proposed rules will now be subjected to the federal rulemaking process and published in the Federal Register.\n\nWashington\n\nSalem: State authorities have identified an unprecedented pest that could defoliate forests in the region. The Capital Press reports the state Department of Agriculture has announced likely plans to mount an air assault to eradicate the Hokkaido gypsy moth. Department officials say they have asked the governor’s office for $176,000 in state funds to spray and trap the potentially new and destructive pest to see if a population is developing. Authorities say the first Hokkaido moth ever detected in the U.S. was caught by the department in July in southwest Snohomish County. Authorities say the moths are mobile and eat a wide variety of plants and trees. Officials say the department currently traps Asian and European gypsy moths each year to keep them from defoliating forests.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A federal judge has ordered companies owned by West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice to pay $35 million over a lawsuit accusing them of violating a mining contract. U.S. District Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove in Kentucky on Monday ordered the Kentucky Fuel Corp. and the James C. Justice Cos. to pay the sum. The lawsuit was filed by the New London Tobacco Market and Five Mile Energy. They are accusing the Justice companies of failing to pay mining royalty payments and retainer fees. The ruling includes roughly $17 million in damages, $17 million for royalties and $1 million in retainer fees. A lawyer for Justice’s companies says they plan to appeal the judge’s ruling.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A bipartisan state legislative task force reversed course Wednesday by recommending the faster release of funding for a suicide prevention hotline after it had initially called for the Legislature to pass a bill to award the money, which would take much longer. The fight over the $110,000 annual grant has broken down over partisan lines, even as Democrats and Republicans on the suicide prevention task force managed to agree on a host of other recommendations to reduce the number of suicides in Wisconsin. Democrats – including four who served on the task force – said the group’s recommendations weren’t meaningful because they didn’t include the passage a “red flag” law through which judges could temporarily take away firearms from people deemed to be suicidal or a risk to others.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Some $1.7 million for job training and other career assistance will continue to be available for workers laid off from the state’s coal industry. Gov. Mark Gordon announced Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Labor grant funding set to expire Sept. 30 will still be available to the state through June 2021. Coal industry workers who’ve lost their jobs due to layoffs are eligible for tuition assistance and other career help through the Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce Economic Revitalization grant program. Gordon says the funding comes at a critical time for Wyoming. Some 600 workers have been furloughed since Milton, West Virginia-based Blackjewel filed for bankruptcy July 1, and the company closed two major Wyoming coal mines.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/26"}]}

Giant African land snails are illegal to own as pets in the United States. But some exotic pet owners still keep the invasive pests. If the owners discard them into the wild or accidentally lose them, they can quickly establish a foothold, feeding on over 500 different plant species and even consuming the paint and stucco off houses as a source of calcium.\n\nChitty said the department is currently investigating the population and determining how many snails are in Pasco County. The snails are native to east Africa and can grow up to 8 inches long.\n\nThe quarantine took effect June 25 and prevents residents from moving the snail or related items, like plants and soil, in or out of the designated quarantine area. Residents who think they have spotted a giant African land snail are advised to call the FDACS hotline and avoid touching the snail without gloves on due to the meningitis risk.\n\nAccording to Chitty, FDACS plans to spend three years eradicating the population in Pasco County, using the pesticide metaldehyde to treat the soil.\n\n“The goal is to eradicate” the snails, said Chitty. “It is a comprehensive and extensive process.”\n\nThis is not the first time Florida has dealt with an invasion of giant snails. In 2011, a population of the pests was discovered in Miami-Dade County. It wasn’t until 2021 the population was fully eradicated.\n\nWhile the snails in Miami-Dade County had grey-colored flesh, the snails in Pasco County have white flesh, said Chitty.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/26/world/destroy-spotted-lanternfly-invasive-species-scn/index.html", "title": "Spotted lanternfly: It's OK to kill this invasive insect | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nState agricultural departments across the United States are asking you to commit murder – bug murder, that is.\n\nYour victim: the spotted lanternfly, or Lycorma delicatula, a beautiful creature with large brownish gray wings with black spots that open to reveal striking red underwings.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it: “Kill it! Squash it, smash it … just get rid of it,” pleads the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture on a website alert.\n\nNative to China, the invasive bug was first detected stateside in Berks County, Pennsylvania, in 2014. With no natural predators in the US, lanternflies have since spread to numerous counties and adjacent states, including Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nWhy the call for mass bugicide? After all, the striking insects aren’t venomous, and don’t even bite humans or pets.\n\nWhat spotted lanternflies do instead is suck the life out of many species of trees and plants, including those that people rely on for food and livelihood, such as grapes, apples and hops. The situation has been so severe in Pennsylvania that the state could lose about 2,800 jobs and $324 million annually if the invasive pest is not contained soon, economists from Penn State’s College of Agricultural Sciences have predicted.\n\nThe hunt to track and kill each and every lanternfly fugitive is so intense Pennsylvania officials set up a hotline to report sightings: 1-888-4BADFLY.\n\nA spotted lanternfly is shown in an early developmental stage, called a nymphal instar, before it develops wings. Heide Estes/AP\n\n“The bugs are hitchhikers,” said entomologist Gene Kritsky, dean of the school of behavioral and natural sciences at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati. “If you should visit an area where the spotted lanternfly has been found, you should inspect your vehicle and clothing to make sure you have not given one a ride. This can help slow down their spread.”\n\nOther states are buzzing with worry as the pesky predator invades their counties. Connecticut, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia have all reported sightings, but “most states are considered at risk,” according to the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n\nThe voracious bug will likely even reach California’s wine country by 2033 if current methods fail to stop the spread, scientists have predicted.\n\nIn parts of the East Coast, the infestation is so bad that Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York has called for the USDA to spend over $200 million to bolster the state’s efforts to fight the spotted lanternfly. Schumer also said he would ask Congress for an additional $22 million in 2023 to help states to prevent and fight invasive species.\n\nStates are taking this bug invasion seriously: North Carolina held a “squishathon” in September 2021, as did New York City’s borough of Staten Island, to warn residents of the dangers and educate them on the best ways to kill the pests.\n\nStomping and squishing is a proven method, experts say – but be quick! Lanternflies are lightning fast on their wings. You can also put sticky tape on tree trunks, rocks and fence posts where the bugs like to lay eggs (but be careful not to trap other small creatures). Once the tape is full and the bugs are dead, discard it.\n\nYou can also help by killing the bug’s egg masses, “which look like someone smeared mud on tree trunks, trucks, campers, tents, and other surfaces,” Kritsky said.\n\n“If found, the egg masses should be scraped off the surface and sealed into zippered storage bag along with a good dose of hand sanitizer. The sealed bag should be carefully disposed of in a way that will not tear open the bag,” Kritsky advised.\n\nA lanternfly is seen on the rooftop of an apartment building in New York City in 2022.

You can track your serial bug murders on an app called Squishr.\n\n“KILL THESE BUGS! They jump and fly and are hearty like a roach,” tweeted one successful mass murderer. “Been using flat spatula-like sticks to smash them.”\n\nSometimes killing the pests can seem like mission impossible: Twitter users are bug-bombing the social media platform with accounts of spotted lanternflies crawling on a building near Broadway in New York City, swarming a tree in Woodbridge, New Jersey, and hitching a ride on commuters.\n\n“A few of them attached themselves to my husband at a rest stop in NJ last weekend & tried to hitch a ride to VA. Another driver & I managed to get them off before he got in the car. So I am personally taking credit for saving my commonwealth from those pests,” tweeted a proud citizen.\n\nBe sure to report the bugs you spot to your state agency: The USDA has reporting information by state here. But before you kill it, “photograph it with your smartphone,” Kritsky said. “Make sure your GPS or location services are turned on as that will provide the coordinates of where you took the photo.”\n\nPrevention efforts are critically needed, experts say. These bugs like to lay eggs on tires, grilles and bumpers on cars, so don’t park under trees or near bushes in an area with a known infestation. Always check your vehicle for stowaways, and do the same for recreational vehicles, as well as building materials, firewood, propane tanks and outdoor machinery.\n\nAnd don’t forget to check outside play sets and toys, garden tools and outdoor furniture before bringing them inside for the season.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/world/murder-hornet-new-name-scn/index.html", "title": "Invasive species 'murder hornet' gets a new common name | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe “murder hornet” is no more. At least, its name is gone.\n\nThe Entomological Society of America and the Entomological Society of Canada have adopted a new name for the murder hornet, also known as the Asian giant hornet, saying “the usage of ‘Asian’ in the name of a pest insect can unintentionally bolster anti-Asian sentiment” especially “amid a rise in hate crimes and discrimination against people of Asian descent.”\n\nThe ESA adopted the name “northern giant hornet” for the species in its Common Names of Insects database.\n\nSince all wasps are native to Asia, the name Asian giant hornet does not convey unique information about the biology or behavior of the species, according to the ESA.\n\nChris Looney, entomologist at the Washington State Department of Agriculture, authored the name change proposal, saying that the previous common name of the species, scientifically called Vespa mandarinia, “is at best a neutral and uninformative adjective, potentially a distraction from more salient characters of the organism, and at worst a racist trope.”\n\n“I don’t want my Asian American or Pacific Islander colleagues, friends and family to have any negative connotations with invasive or pest species that might be used against them in a negative way,” ESA President Jessica Ware said.\n\nIn 2021, ESA updated its guidelines for acceptable insect common names to ban names that refer to ethnic or racial groups or may cause fear, and discourage names that reference geographical areas, especially for invasive species.\n\n“Common names are an important tool for entomologists to communicate with the public about insects and insect science,” Ware said in a release Monday. “Northern giant hornet is both scientifically accurate and easy to understand, and it avoids evoking fear or discrimination.”\n\nThe northern giant hornet poses a potential threat to honeybees, human health and agriculture, said Karla Salp, acting communications director of the Washington State Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn 2019, the hornet now known as the northern giant hornet was found in Washington State, and there have been efforts to eradicate the species entirely since then. The public helped find three out of the four nests that have been eradicated in the state, demonstrating that public awareness is critical.\n\nWashington State is the only US state that has had confirmed northern giant hornet sightings, but the species could find habitat elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest if not contained, according to a 2021 study in the Journal of Insect Science.\n\n“If allowed to establish in regions within North America, the northern giant hornet could significantly impact local ecosystems,” according to the ESA’s common name toolkit for the northern giant hornet.\n\n“Northern giant hornets generally do not attack people, but will do so if provoked or threatened,” the toolkit said. “Their stinger is longer than that of bees and wasps found in North America, and their venom is more toxic.”\n\nNorthern giant hornets are not the only thing that causes damage to honeybee hives, and the word murder evokes fear, Ware said. She hopes that the name change will allow people to learn about and understand the species from a wider perspective.\n\n“Even though the northern giant hornet has some negative things about it, like all of the 1.5 million insect species out there, it’s got a complicated life,” Ware said. “Some parts of its life history and ecology are really fascinating. It’s been around for over millions of years before humans even came on the scene.”\n\nWare encourages people to submit a request to the Better Common Names Project if there is an insect name they believe should be changed.", "authors": ["Rachel Fadem"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/13/world/new-deep-sea-isopod-scn-trnd/index.html", "title": "New species of giant deep-sea isopod discovered in the Gulf of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new deep-sea crustacean that bears a striking resemblance to the facehuggers from “Alien” has been identified in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe bathynomus yucatanensis is a species of giant isopod, crustaceans that scavenge for food at the bottom of the ocean. Their segmented, fourteen-legged bodies resemble their much smaller relative, the woodlouse. The foot-long size of the giant isopods has been attributed to deep-sea gigantism, the same phenomenon that leads to giant squids at the bottom of our oceans.\n\nA group of Taiwanese, Japanese, and Australian researchers set out to describe the new species of giant isopod and distinguish it from the bathynomus giganteus, the giant isopods found throughout the tropical western Atlantic waters.

While Asian bees have adapted to protect themselves from the predatory hornets, North American bees have not.\n\nGiant hornets have wreaked havoc on the bee population in the United States. It’s estimated the giant hornets – the largest in the world – harm over $100 million of bee-pollinated crops production annually.\n\nMany people often refer to them as “murder hornets,” but it’s a sensational name that should be avoided, said study author James Nieh, professor and associate dean in the department of biological sciences at the University of California San Diego.\n\n“They are predators, but so are lions and tigers, and we don’t call them murder lions,” he said.\n\nTrapping the invasive insects\n\nNieh’s team created a series of traps using sex pheromones to attract male hornets. Pheromones are chemicals that are produced to convey information within a species, according to Nieh.\n\nMale hornets are attracted to the female hornet’s sex pheromone, so researchers used their own mixtures of synthetic pheromones along with a natural sex pheromone from a female Vespa mandarinia to test which traps would perform the best.\n\nEach trap was outfitted with a dummy female hornet to attract the males as well, Nieh said.\n\n“Hornets would be attracted and fly around the traps, but none of them would land if there was nothing there that looked like a female hornet,” he explained.\n\nAfter setting them up near hornet colonies in China’s Yunnan province, the researchers found that the queen-equivalent pheromone was the most successful. It’s made of hexanoic acid, octanoic acid and decanoic acid, the study said.\n\nThe winning trap captured more than 16 times more hornets than a trap without pheromones, according to the study. After leaving the traps out for a day, the scientists were able to capture thousands of hornets, Nieh said.\n\nStopping the hornets in their tracks\n\nResearchers used materials similar to a sticky mouse trap, making it easy for other scientists to re-create them and use them on hornets around North America, Nieh said.\n\nThe chemicals can also be easily purchased at chemical suppliers in the United States, which makes it even easier to implement this trapping method, he added.\n\nWhile it’s an effective method to capture a large number of giant hornets in a short period of time, it may not be an ideal system, said Allen Gibbs, a professor in the department of life sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“This method attracts males, but if they’ve already mated, the females are free to fly off and start a new colony,” he said.\n\nAdditionally, the hornets only mate for a few months in the fall, so the trapping method could only be implemented during that time, Gibbs noted.", "authors": ["Megan Marples"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}]}

Some of us are even pretty good at solving one, dusting off the skill when in need of a party a trick or a “fun fact” to share at the office.\n\nFor Max Park and his family, however, the iconic colorful blocks are a symbol of much more. In fact, Park’s parents credit the activity, known as cubing, and the community built around it with saving their son.\n\n“Basically cubing has saved his life. It has just been an unbelievable teacher for Max,” father Schwan Park told USA TODAY.\n\nMax, a 21-year-old California native, was declared the new world record holder earlier this month after solving a 3x3x3 Rubik’s Cube in a matter of 3.13 seconds, surpassing former champ Yusheng Du’s time of 3.47 seconds.

It was during the course of this therapy, when Max was about 9 years old, that Miki decided to hand her son a Rubik’s Cube that had been laying around the house. After learning the basics on YouTube, she taught Max how to use the puzzle and watched as the student very quickly surpassed the teacher.\n\n“Max took the cube and he just gravitated towards it and just went down a rabbit hole,” said Schwan. “I mean, he really loved it, he needed to solve it, and so right away in about two days he was able to solve it. He learned very, very quickly. It was just something he loved.”\n\nAt the age of 10, Max’s parents brought him to his first cubing competition, believing it would be a good environment for Max not only to share his passion but work on things like socialization, learning non-verbal cues such as pointing, communication and recognizing social cues. Even waiting in line at the event served as valuable learning experience for Max, Schwan said.\n\nQuickly, the family realized that the cubing community was much bigger – and much more welcoming – than they had realized.\n\n“We took him to a cube competition and all of a sudden, he was pointing at some kids that he knew from YouTube. We just saw him light up and he totally found his tribe of people,” Schwan said. He and Miki immediately recognized these events as a potential “goldmine” of opportunities to help their son expand and grow his life skills.\n\n“We’re sitting there always struggling to look for therapy sessions, to help him get socialized and here was a perfect venue,\" Schwan said. \"The motivation was something that was just so helpful in helping him to develop everything that we had hoped he could achieve.”\n\nFirst man diagnosed with autism diesMississippi man Donald Triplett, first person diagnosed with autism, dead at 89\n\nA master in the making\n\nMax took to competitive cubing faster than even his parents could have imagined, winning the 6x6 cube contest at the second competition he attended. They were shocked to watch Max quickly outpace contestants three times his age, Schwan said, beating college-aged kids that towered over him in family photos from the time.\n\n“The crazy part is we didn't even know he could do the 6x6, so when we found out that he won, we were like, are you kidding?” said Schwan. “I remember the delegate telling us ‘Oh, the time that he got is top 100 in the United States,’ and we were just blown away.”\n\nFrom those first moments, Max and his family never looked back.\n\nNow 21 and a record-breaker many times over, Max has no intentions of slowing down. In fact, besides being a well-recognized member of the World Cube Association, Max is also an official ambassador for the Rubik’s brand itself. He also appeared in a 2020 documentary titled “The Speed Cubers,” which explored the rivalry and friendship between Max and fellow world-renowned speedcuber Feliks Zemdegs.\n\nAs Max’s star grew, people began to recognize him not only at cubing competitions and gatherings but on the street, as well. Even this development, Schwan said, was an avenue for Max to learn and practice new skills.\n\n“As he started getting more and more notoriety within the speed cubing community…. people were asking for his autograph. And we really had to work on that because, being on the spectrum, he sort of really doesn't get the kind of like the adulation and the fame part,” said Schwan.\n\nAfter some therapy work and practice, Max got more comfortable meeting fans and got used to signing autographs and smiling for pictures. Though Max has gotten somewhat accustomed to the limelight, he still hesitates to appear on camera and often communicates with a mixture of verbal and non-verbal cues, meaning he isn't usually available to give his own interviews. But to Max, it isn't about the accolades or fame anyway, but rather facing the next challenge head-one.\n\nCubing as a community\n\nMax’s latest landmark achievement with the 3x3 Rubik's Cube happened earlier this month, June 11, at Pride in Long Beach, a competition overseen by the World Cube Association (WCA). The non-profit is tasked with hosting and governing competitions for mechanical puzzles known as “twisty puzzles,” which are solved by twisting groups of pieces into place.\n\nWhile Rubik’s is by and far the most famous example, the WCA selects a group of these puzzles for official events, which have been hosted in multiple countries across the globe. According to their website, the WCA has hosted more than 10,000 competitors from 140 different countries over the past decade, operating entirely with a volunteer-only team. The small but mighty organization offers not only a fair place for the best to compete, but a sense of community that has proven invaluable for families like the Parks.\n\n“The speed cubing community, the WCA, we can't thank them enough,” said Schwan. “I mean, we even tear up sometimes just thinking about where our lives would be without this, because this has given back so much that most people don't even see. The little things, the little moments of success we are just so unbelievably grateful for.”\n\nThe community opened up to Max and his family from day one, Schwan said, providing an inclusive environment and a warm welcome. They helped and understood exactly how to help Max without even being told, something the family was especially grateful for 10 years ago, when the general public was less aware and educated on the topic of autism.\n\nThe Parks have also enjoyed watching the young people around them grow in self-confidence along with their son, noting that kids who may be called “nerdy” or “shy” often blossom after finding their “tribe” in the cubing community.\n\n\"They find themselves,\" Schwan said. \"And not only do they find themselves, they get to know who they are and they like themselves very much, which I think is just unbelievably amazing.”\n\nFuture competitors\n\nAs for Max breaking more records, Schwan said it’s a very really possibility for the future.\n\nThough he thinks 3.13 seconds should hold as the world's fasted for a while, cubing has always been about personal challenge as opposed to public adoration for Max, who will continue to cube competitively for as long as he loves doing it.\n\nThough meeting Max at the competition table may seem a bit intimidating for speedcubing hopefuls, Schwan encouraged anyone with interest to give it a shot.\n\n“My one piece of advice is just go,\" Schwan said. \"It’s not just the competition and doing well at the competition, you're going to find yourself. It's going to be something that’s going to, possibly, define your life, as it did for Max.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/columnists/christopher-maag/2018/06/09/rubiks-cube-teen-sets-record-feet-rutherford-nj/486095002/", "title": "In Rutherford, teen sets record for solving a Rubik's Cube with feet", "text": "Daniel Rose-Levine has world champion feet. His feet are pale and hairless, thick at the heel, tapered in the middle and wide at the toes. In appearance they could be the feet of any 15 year-old boy, being smooth, devoid of scars, and not uncommonly dexterous.\n\nYet despite the banal appearance of his lower extremities, Daniel does things with his feet that many would think impossible. For the last three months, that has meant setting records for solving Rubik’s Cubes with his feet.\n\nDid I say “setting”? I’m sorry, that’s not quite right. Rose-Levine clobbers world records. Destroys them. Sets them on fire.\n\n“Daniel is extremely skilled from a technical standpoint,” said Anthony Michael Brooks, who holds the Guinness world record for the most Rubik’s Cubes solved in a single breath, underwater. “His current world record for feet solving would have been absolutely unfathomable not long ago.”\n\nOn Saturday, at a competition held inside a church in Rutherford, he did it again. Using his feet, Daniel solved three Rubik’s Cubes with an average time of 22.761 seconds, breaking his old record by nearly nine-tenths of a second.\n\nHe thinks he can go faster.\n\n“I’m shooting for a sub-20 average,” said Daniel, who traveled with his father, David Levine, from their home in Red Hook, in Dutchess County, New York, to defend his title. “My personal best is 16:96.”\n\nNo one else comes close. Daniel's latest record beats Thomas Cherry, the second fastest in the world, by three and a half seconds.\n\n“Usually when I compete with feet, it’s a blowout. It’s not really a competition. I always win,” said Raymond Goslow, currently America’s third-fastest Rubik’s Cube foot solver, who flew from his home in Marietta, Georgia. “That’s why I came to this competition, because Daniel is here. He’s No. 1.”\n\nOne clean foot for humankind\n\nIn most arenas, humans evolve slowly. The transition from scrawling bulls across the walls of caves in France to capturing the eerie light of the Danish coast, arguably the pinnacle of painting as a skilled craft, took 35,000 years. Pheidippides, the original marathoner, ran 150 miles in two days; 2,508 years later, elite runners manage to shave just 12 hours off his time.\n\nDaniel Rose-Levine’s progress follows a somewhat steeper trajectory. He is to the Rubik’s Cube and feet what Gordon Moore was to transistors and semiconductors, what Jeff Bezos is to corporate profits.\n\nHe is killing it.\n\n“When I started in 2005, the fastest people solved foot in two three minutes” said Bob Burton, a Belleville resident and a board member of the World Cubing Association who has competed with Rubik’s Cubes since 2005, and who served Saturday as the event’s lead judge. “That’s nowhere near the times that are being achieved now. Daniel is very impressive.”\n\nBurton’s memories fail to do Daniel Rose-Levine justice. In fact, the fastest person at solving a Rubik’s Cube with his feet in 2005 was Will Arnold, who set the world record with a time of 4 minutes and 25 seconds, according to World Cubing Association records.\n\nForget shaving seconds off a marathon time, or millimeters off the size of a semiconductor. After a little more than a decade, modern Rubik’s Cube foot solvers are beating historical records by a factor of 20. Top competitors like Daniel Rose-Levine are doing it by practicing four to eight hours a day, said Chris Tran, a World Cubing Association delegate who also traveled from Georgia to judge the event in Rutherford.\n\nMAAG:This man makes his living foraging and selling wild plants to fancy NJ restaurants\n\nMAAG:Bourdain and Spade weren't family. But we mourn them like they were. Why?\n\nMAAG:A British billionaire's giant yacht is anchored near Fort Lee\n\nBut it’s not entirely about the work.\n\n“People were obsessed then, people are obsessed now,” Burton said. “The difference is technology.”\n\nFour technologies, to be precise. When Burton started in 2005, YouTube occupied a tiny space above a pizzeria in San Mateo, California. When Rose-Levine started, nearly a decade later, YouTube was the primary method for young cubers to steal ideas from world record holders.\n\n“YouTube is super beneficial,” said Eva Kato, 16, of Closter, who set the female world record for cube solving in 2015. Her YouTube channel, “Hashtag Cuber,” had 45,264 subscribers as of Saturday afternoon. “You can learn a lot from it.”\n\nThe other technologies changing the speed of Rubik’s Cube competitions involve the cube itself. In the last three years, several manufacturers introduced cubes that spin faster than the original, Tran and Burton said.\n\nOther companies developed a new generation of lubricants that get inserted into the guts of the toy.\n\n“For years, people were using old-fashioned automobile lubricants,” said Jules Manalang, 26, sponsorship coordinator for The Cubicle, a company based in Westchester County that began selling new types of synthetic lubricants for Rubik’s Cubes two years ago.\n\nIts product line includes Angstrom Gravitas, described on the company’s website as “a high viscosity silicone lube that utilizes micro-friction of two nanoscale compounds to achieve unparalleled levels of smoothness and controlability.”\n\nThe Cubicle also makes tiny magnets, about the size of an ant’s head. When glued to the inside walls of a Rubik’s Cube, the magnets’ subtle tug informs competitors that their spins are complete, and the sides of the cube are perfectly aligned.\n\n“Two years ago, nobody was using magnets,” said Tran, who develops new products for The Cubicle. “Now 90 percent of the people on the playing field are using engineered lubes and magnets.”\n\nAround the same time that magnets came into vogue among competitive cubers, Daniel Rose-Levine got serious about cubing. He got so serious he won a sponsorship from The Cubicle, which covers his travel expenses to competitions, whether in Rutherford or Paris.\n\nHe got so serious, in fact, he nearly ended his nascent cube career.\n\n“I started doing it with my feet because my hands were hurting from cubing too much,” he said.\n\nAt first it seemed easy to win, since most people found competing with their toes distasteful.\n\n“Nobody was doing it. Everyone thinks it’s gross,” Daniel said. “A year ago, if you averaged under one minute you’d be in the Top 10 in North America.”\n\nHis success may be changing that. In American culture, we have come to knew a few top athletes by initials. LeBron James is LBJ, Odell Beckham Jr. is OBJ.\n\nIn the last few months, the world of Rubik’s Cubers has become obsessed with DRL.\n\n“Feet is getting bigger worldwide because of DRL,” said Manalang, whose opinion may not be unbiased because it’s his job to coordinate The Cubicle's sponsored competitors, including Daniel. “He excelled at feet-solving, and now everybody wants to do it.”\n\nShaking like a leaf\n\nIn Rutherford on Saturday, \"everybody\" consisted of 25 teenagers. They sat in a row of metal folding chairs against the west wall of the Rutherford Congregational Church, their bare feet exposed.\n\nThe feet competition started at 8:16 a.m.\n\n“We do the feet competition first, before people have spent all day wearing shoes,” said Kyle Steppe, an organizer. “We try to keep things hygienic.”\n\nMost of the competitors were lucky to finish in under a minute. And most kept their distance from Rose-Levine. The only one who approached DRL was Goslow, who darted over to Rose-Levine’s chair after every solve to check the record holder’s time.\n\n“I don’t think I’ll be able to beat him,” Goslow said. “But I’d love to.”\n\nIt was not to be. Each competitor got five chances. The fastest and slowest were set aside, with the official time determined by averaging the middle three. DRL completed his third try in 23.6 seconds.\n\n“That’s below his world record average,” his father said.\n\n“Only by point oh-one,” Daniel said.\n\n“Yeah. So we won’t count our chickens until they’re hatched,” David Levine said. “As a side note, I’m shaking like a leaf.”\n\nEmail: maag@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/us/delphi-indiana-killings/index.html", "title": "Delphi killings: They spent years waiting for a break after 2 girls ...", "text": "Delphi, Indiana CNN —\n\nFor nearly six years, Delphi, Indiana, a small town an hour north of Indianapolis, has been holding its breath. And Monday morning, when Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter stepped to the lectern to announce the arrest and charging of local resident Richard Allen with two counts of murder, it seemed the victims’ families and nearly 21,000 residents of Carroll County were finally allowed to exhale.\n\nAnd as the sun came up Tuesday, 22 hours later, it meant a new reality for the town that describes itself as “small town living, big town adventures.” The unknown, now partly known, and the question of who, partly answered.\n\nAt the Stone House, a Main Street staple and one of the few restaurants in town, there wasn’t much chatter about the announcement, but the quiet seemed to say everything: relief. The non-stop questions since teenagers Abby and Libby were found dead near a creek just outside of town would continue, but for today, just for a while, it was about understanding the new phase of a case that’s drawn worldwide attention.\n\nMike and Becky Patty, the grandparents of Liberty German, said the announcement of an arrest presents a fork in the road, where they go from advocates for finding a killer to a role that, for now, they’re still unsure of.\n\n“I think the reality of it is still setting in,” Mike Patty said in an interview with HLN’s Susan Hendricks. “And more importantly, trying to figure out what our path forward is, and that is the prosecution of the case.”\n\nThe arrest also provides a new path forward for investigators, who are still asking the public for help, and were adamant during their news conference that the investigation is far from over.\n\n“If there’s anything out there that law enforcement doesn’t know about, we want them to know about it. And especially with this arrest, and this person being charged with this,” Patty said. “There’s a face to the ‘bridge guy’ now. And a name with the ‘bridge guy.’”\n\n‘Everything changes now’\n\nAuthorities would not give any details about Allen’s alleged involvement in the killings, and it’s unclear whether Allen is in fact the man on the bridge, or the voice that uttered the phrase “down the hill,” recorded by Libby’s cell phone shortly before the crime.\n\nAllen pleaded not guilty in an initial hearing. He has a pretrial hearing scheduled for January and a trial date set for March. Efforts to find an attorney representing Allen have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nAuthorities have pivoted from desperately asking the public for leads to clamping down on what information is released.\n\nLiberty German, 14, and her good friend Abigail Williams, 13, went for a hike in 2017 and never returned. Family Photos/WXIN\n\nNicholas McLeland, the Carroll County prosecutor, has sealed the charging documents and hasn’t released additional details surrounding the arrest.\n\n“Now that the charges have been filed against Allen, the days of talking about what we have are over,” Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter said to HLN’s Susan Hendricks.\n\n“And everything changes now.”\n\nAllen is being housed in the White County Jail, nearly 16 miles from downtown Delphi. Over the weekend, Allen’s home was vacant, with curtains drawn, lights turned off, and no cars in the driveway.\n\nA suspect among them\n\nNews of the arrest began to circulate in Delphi prior to Monday’s announcement, but the confirmation by authorities was the period at the end of a sentence locals had long been hoping would be written.\n\nLisa Greene, a Delphi resident and downtown business owner, said the news brings a sense of sadness not just for the victims’ families, but also for the family of the accused.\n\n“It just breaks my heart. So many families are affected by this,” she said. “And I feel bad for his family and his friends, but I’m glad justice is going to be served, I hope.”\n\n“I think the town has mixed emotions, honestly,” she said. “To know that another family is being affected by this breaks our heart, and to know he was a part of this community, and that we all liked him and trusted him and spoke to him on a daily basis sometimes, that’s kind of an upsetting feeling. It really is.”\n\nAllen, 50, was employed at the local CVS. In the back of the store, near the pharmacy counter, there’s a wanted poster with an image of the man on the bridge. It’s a flier that Allen likely saw every day at work.\n\nRichard Allen was arrested last week. Indiana State Police\n\nDenise Rossi, a Delphi resident who knew both girls, said she was shaken by the news.\n\n“When I found out who it was, it was horrifying, and how close he lives to my house and all his neighbors that are good friends of mine,” she said. “There’s a handful of stores in Delphi. He works at CVS; everybody goes to CVS.”\n\nHoping the healing can begin\n\nFor now, the town of Delphi, the day after the arrest announcement, remains largely quiet and the work of continuing an investigation is left to those tasked with building the case.\n\n“I look forward to telling the country the story, by presenting the facts, to what we know, versus what we think,” Carter said. “I hope that after today, people start healing just a bit and start trusting again.”\n\nAnd for Becky Patty, the new phase of this case serves as a reminder that while her role may change, her life without Libby does not.\n\n“You feel it, you live it every day,” she said. “She may not be here with us physically, but we take her with us everywhere we go.”", "authors": ["Drew Iden Hln", "Drew Iden"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/us/stockton-california-serial-killings-what-we-know/index.html", "title": "Stockton, California, connected shootings: 6 people have been ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAuthorities in California’s Central Valley are investigating what they believe is a series of killings that has claimed the lives of six people since last year.\n\nPolice in Stockton are offering a $125,000 reward for any information regarding the homicides, which began in April 2021 with the most recent killing reported late last month, officials said.\n\nSeven people have been shot and one survived.

Four of those killed this year were Hispanic men ranging from 21 to 54 years old, and the fifth was a 35-year-old White man, police said.\n\nOn Monday, San Joaquin County’s Office of the Medical Examiner identified the victims of this year’s killings as: Paul Yaw, 35, killed on July 8; Salvador Debudey Jr., 43, killed on August 11; Jonathan Hernandez Rodriguez, 21, killed on August 30; Juan Cruz, 52, killed on September 21; and Lawrence Lopez Sr., 54, killed on September 27.\n\nAuthorities don’t know how many suspects carried out the killings\n\nAs investigators continue their probe in the case, they’re emphasizing that they’re not sure whether the killings were carried out by one person or multiple people, McFadden said.\n\n“At this time, we don’t know if it is a person or persons. As I said before, we have absolutely no evidence that connects a person or persons to any of these incidents,” McFadden said.\n\nHe noted the killings did not appear to be related to robberies.\n\n“They’re not talking about any gang activity in the area or anything,” McFadden said. “It’s just element of surprise.”\n\nSuspect or suspects surveyed crime scenes before attacking\n\nBesides the ballistic evidence connecting the string of shootings, the circumstances of each attack also show some similarities.\n\nAll seven shootings happened in dark areas where not many cameras were present. The victims were “alone, often caught off guard, or maybe relaxing in a vehicle or walking alone in almost pitch darkness,” McFadden told CNN’s Kasie Hunt Tuesday.\n\nFurther, police believe the suspected shooter or shooters may have conducted reconnaissance during daylight hours before attacking at night, according to McFadden.\n\n“We believe that perhaps this individual, or individuals, may be looking for their area during daylight to anticipate where cameras may be, and what would be the best approach,” McFadden said.\n\nSurveillance video shows a ‘person of interest’\n\nThe woman who survived described the suspect’s height between 5’10” and 6’ and said they wore dark clothing and a dark Covid-style mask, according to McFadden.\n\nStockton Police on Tuesday released surveillance video showing what they say is a “person of interest” in the killings. The video does not show the person committing any crimes on camera, police said.\n\nThe person in the video demonstrates a specific, uneven stride and upright posture, making them identifiable in the video surveillance police recovered, McFadden noted.\n\nIn this undated surveillance image released by the Stockton Police Department, a grainy still image of a \"person of interest\" is seen dressed in black clothing. AP\n\nMotive is unclear\n\nAt this point in the investigation, authorities have not identified a motive for the killings. They have said, however, that the assailant or assailants appear to be “mission-motivated,” and there is no evidence at this time to suggest the homicides are hate crimes.\n\nIt’s also unclear whether the suspect or suspects targeted the victims, officials said.\n\nCNN Law Enforcement Analyst John Miller noted gaps in time between shootings mean a killer may “be mature and somewhat patient.”\n\n“Given past cases and offender characteristics, it is likely that he goes ‘hunting’ much more often than he kills,” Miller said.\n\n“He likely ‘hunts’ regularly and strikes when everything is just right: single victim, no witnesses in the immediate area, likely an area without video coverage.”", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/world/black-naped-pheasant-pigeon-scn-trnd/index.html", "title": "Long-lost pigeon species 'rediscovered' in Papua New Guinea | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nA bird thought to be extinct for 140 years has been rediscovered in the forests of Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe black-naped pheasant-pigeon was documented by scientists for the first and last time in 1882, according to a news release from nonprofit Re:wild, which helped fund the search effort.\n\nRediscovering the bird required an expedition team to spend a grueling month on Fergusson, a rugged island in the D’Entrecasteaux Archipelago off eastern Papua New Guinea where the bird was originally documented. The team consisted of local staff at the Papua New Guinea National Museum as well as international scientists from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the American Bird Conservancy.\n\nFergusson Island is covered in rugged, mountainous terrain – making the expedition especially challenging for the scientists. Many members of the community told the team that they hadn’t seen the black-naped pheasant-pigeon in decades, says the news release.\n\nBut just two days before the researchers were scheduled to leave the island, a camera trap captured footage of the exceptionally rare bird.\n\n“After a month of searching, seeing those first photos of the pheasant-pigeon felt like finding a unicorn,” John C. Mittermeier, director of the lost birds program at American Bird Conservancy and co-leader of the expedition, said in the release. “It is the kind of moment you dream about your entire life as a conservationist and birdwatcher.”\n\nThe black-naped pheasant-pigeon is a large, ground-dwelling pigeon with a broad tail, according to the release. Scientists still know little about the species and believe the population is small and decreasing.\n\nInsight from local residents was crucial for the scientists to track down the elusive bird.\n\n“It wasn’t until we reached villages on the western slope of Mt. Kilkerran that we started meeting hunters who had seen and heard the pheasant-pigeon,” Jason Gregg, a conservation biologist and co-leader of the expedition team, said in the release. “We became more confident about the local name of the bird, which is ‘Auwo,’ and felt like we were getting closer to the core habitat of where the black-naped pheasant-pigeon lives.”\n\nThey placed a total of 12 camera traps on the slopes of Mt. Kilkerran, which is the island’s highest mountain. And they placed another eight cameras in locations where local hunters reported seeing the bird in the past.\n\nA hunter named Augustin Gregory, based in the mountain village Duda Ununa, provided the final breakthrough that helped scientists locate the pheasant-pigeon.\n\nGregory told the team that he had seen the black-naped pheasant-pigeon in an area with “steep ridges and valleys,” says the news release. And he had heard the bird’s distinctive calls.\n\nSo the expedition team placed a camera on a 3,200-foot high ridge near the Kwama River above Duda Ununa, according to the release. And finally, just as their trip was ending, they captured footage of the bird walking on the forest floor.\n\nThe discovery was a shock for the scientists and the local community alike.\n\n“The communities were very excited when they saw the survey results, because many people hadn’t seen or heard of the bird until we began our project and got the camera trap photos,” said Serena Ketaloya, a conservationist from Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea, in the news release. “They are now looking forward to working with us to try to protect the pheasant-pigeon.”\n\nIt’s still not clear just how many of the black-naped pheasant-pigeon are left, and the rugged terrain will make identifying the population difficult. A two-week survey in 2019 failed to find any proof of the bird, although it did discover some reports from hunters that helped determine the locations for the 2022 expedition.\n\nAnd the discovery might provide hope that other bird species thought extinct are still out there somewhere.\n\n“This rediscovery is an incredible beacon of hope for other birds that have been lost for a half century or more,” said Christina Biggs, the manager for the Search for Lost Species at Re:wild, in the release. “The terrain the team searched was incredibly difficult, but their determination never wavered, even though so few people could remember seeing the pheasant-pigeon in recent decades.”", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/05/18/24-7-wall-st-the-best-selling-products-of-all-time/9223465/", "title": "10 best-selling products of all time", "text": "Vince Calio, Thomas C.

But making an all-time bestseller can transform an industry and define a business for decades.\n\nMany of the best-selling products were first in a new category. Apple (AAPL), which has sold more than 500 million iPhones, was the first to introduce a touchscreen smartphone that could seamlessly handle music, Web browsing and phone calls.\n\nOther bestsellers took a niche market and made it mainstream. Before Star Wars, film was either comedy, romance or drama. The Harry Potter book series was so successful that The New York Times Book Review created a separate children's bestseller list in 2000 to account for the series' popularity.\n\nIn some cases, top-selling products were simply better than their competitors. Before Sony (SNE) PlayStation, video game consoles were largely cartridge-based. With the advent of the PlayStation, which relied on the new CD-rom format, game files could be large enough to support 3D gameplay and full-motion video. Lipitor, which has become the world's best-selling drug with $141 billion in sales, was far more effective than previously-released drugs at lowering bad cholesterol.\n\nA number of these products continue to dominate their markets. The iPad remains the world's best-selling tablet, with a 32.5% market share last quarter, despite challenges from Amazon.com's (AMZN) Kindle Fire and Samsung's Galaxy tablet lines. The PlayStation 4 has sold over 7 million units since it launched last year, well above the Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox One.\n\nDespite their success, some of these products face challenges. Sales of Pfizer's (PFE) Lipitor dropped each year after its maker, Pfizer, lost patent protection on the drug in 2011 and cheaper generic drugs came on the market. The ongoing Star Wars saga may lose its status as the all-time best-selling movie franchise to Walt Disney's (DIS) Marvel franchise. The Avengers broke box office records, grossing $203.4 million on its opening weekend.\n\nTo determine the best-selling products of all-time, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed categories of products widely purchased by consumers and identified individual products that had the highest sales in their category.

PlayStation\n\n• Category: Video game console\n\n• Total sales: 344 million units\n\n• Parent company: Sony\n\nWhen Sony released the PlayStation in the United States in 1995, its 32-bit processor was the most powerful available on the console market at the time. Sony sold more than 70 million PlayStations worldwide by the time the PlayStation 2 was released in 2000. The PlayStation 2 also sold very well in the U.S. and abroad. Sony released the PlayStation 3 in 2006, and it sold 80 million units to retailers by November 2013. The latest generation, the PlayStation 4, has been wildly successful thus-far, already selling 7 million units as of April.\n\n2. Lipitor\n\n• Category: Pharmaceutical\n\n• Total sales: $141 billion\n\n• Parent company: Pfizer\n\nPfizer's Lipitor is prescribed to lower LDL (or bad) cholesterol — high levels of bad cholesterol increase the risk of heart disease. Lipitor is classified as a statin, a class of drug used to reduce the risk of heart-related ailments. However, Lipitor sales have plummeted in recent years after its U.S. patent expired in 2011. Lipitor has lost patent protection in other major markets since. In 2013, Lipitor sales totaled $2.3 billion, down from $9.6 billion in 2011 according to Pfizer's 2013 annual report. Still, since its introduction in 1997, no other drug came close to Lipitor's commercial success. The closest competitor for all time sales is Plavix, which had slightly more than half of Lipitor's lifetime revenue, according to Forbes.\n\n3. Corolla\n\n• Category: Vehicle\n\n• Total sales: 40.7 million units\n\n• Parent company: Toyota (TM)\n\nToyota announced last month it sold 1.2 million Corollas in 2013, a 5% year-over-year increase. Since its introduction in Japan in 1966 — the car became available in the U.S. in 1968 — Toyota has sold more than 40.7 million Corollas, more than any other car model. The Corolla's success on the market is likely due to its reliability, relatively low gas mileage and affordability. The newly redesigned 2014 Corolla is the model's 11th generation, and it claims to have better gas mileage and a slightly larger interior. Brand new, the Corolla's starting MSRP is $16,800.\n\n4. Star Wars\n\n• Category: Movies\n\n• Total sales: $4.6 billion\n\n• Parent company: 20th Century Fox\n\nOnly Gone with the Wind brought in more money than the original Star Wars movie. Combined, however, the original trilogy grossed $2.4 billion, accounting for inflation. When Star Wars: Episode I was released more than 20 years later, it grossed $675 million, considerably more than the later installments — Episodes 2 and 3 — which each still grossed more than $400 million. In total, the Star Wars movies, including special editions and re-releases, grossed $4.6 billion adjusted for inflation in the U.S. While 20th Century Fox still owns the rights to the original Star Wars, Disney purchased the Star Wars universe — Lucasfilms — for $4 billion in 2012. Disney will release the final three movies under J.J. Abrams' direction. The first of the three is scheduled to hit the box office in 2015.\n\n5. iPad\n\n• Category: Tablet\n\n• Total sales: 211 million units\n\n• Parent company: Apple\n\nDespite losing market share in the first quarter, Apple's iPad is still the best-selling tablet. The iPad held 40% of the tablet market in the first quarter of 2013, but only 32.5% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC. Close rival Samsung picked up much of that market share. IDC analyst reported that iPad lost some of its market share because consumers are holding onto their tablets for longer rather than immediately purchasing the newest version. Apple sold 16.4 million units in the second quarter alone, and more than 211 million since the iPad was first introduced in 2010.\n\n6. Mario Bros. franchise\n\n• Category: Video game franchise\n\n• Total sales: 262 million units\n\n• Parent company: Nintendo\n\nSince debuting in 1981 in the popular Donkey Kong arcade game, the Italian plumbers have appeared in 115 titles and in their own cartoon series. According to the company, as of 2011 more than 262 million units of \"core\" Mario Bros. games have been sold worldwide. Mario originally was known as Jumpman in a Japanese arcade game before being converted into a plumber in the U.S. In 2011, the Guinness Book of World Records named the original Mario the top video game character of all time as voted-on by more than 13,000 readers.\n\n7. Michael Jackson's Thriller\n\n• Category: Album\n\n• Total sales: 70 million units\n\n• Parent company: Epic records\n\nMichael Jackson's Thriller is not only the best-selling album of all time, but is also credited with ushering in the MTV generation, bringing the moonwalk into mainstream culture, and giving Jackson the moniker \"The King of Pop.\" According to michaeljackson.com, a website run by Sony Music and owned by the Michael Jackson record label, 70 million copies of the album have been sold since its release in 1982, although various sources have estimated that as many as 110 million copies have been sold. The album featured hits: \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean,\" and \"Thriller.\" Perhaps what made the album most famous was the 14-minute long Thriller movie/music video. The Thriller album also sold 101,000 copies the week after Jackson's death in 2009, and downloads of Jackson's songs totaled 2.3 million.\n\n8. Harry Potter\n\n• Category: Book\n\n• Total sales: 450 million units\n\n• Parent company: Scholastic (U.S. publisher)\n\nRoughly 450 million Harry Potter books had been sold in 73 different languages as of mid-2013, making it the best-selling book series of all time. The books has also made author J.K. Rowling the highest-paid author in the world. In 2007, Harry Potter's U.S. publisher Scholastic sold 8.3 million copies of the final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in the first 24 hours. The book series inspired eight movies between 2001 and 2011 that, combined, grossed $7.7 billion worldwide. In 2012, Rowling launched Pottermore.com, a site that offers new Harry Potter content and interactive experiences. The site reportedly had 1 billion viewers in the first two weeks it went live.\n\n9. iPhone\n\n• Category: Smartphone\n\n• Total sales: 516 million units\n\n• Parent company: Apple\n\nApple took the smartphone market by a storm when it launched the iPhone in 2007. Despite suggestions from some analysts that the iPhone's market share has peaked, unit sales remain massive. In its fiscal first and second quarter, the company sold nearly 95 million iPhones, and sales this year are poised to exceed the 150 million mark set in 2013. With the exception of a brief period in 2012, Apple's iPhone has been the best-selling smartphone since its inception. According to Counterpoint Technology Research, the iPhone 5S and 5C were the two top-selling smartphones in February, while the Samsung Galaxy S4 was a distant third.\n\n10. Rubik's Cube\n\n• Category: Toy\n\n• Total sales: 350 million units\n\n• Parent company: Seven Towns\n\nThe Rubik's Cube remains the top-selling single toy of all time with 350 million sold since 1980. The Rubik's Cube remains so popular that in the decades since its creation, it has spawned entire speed-cubing competitions. The toy still has a large fan base, among young and old. One developer even created an iPhone application that instructs users how to solve a Rubik's Cube in 20 moves. Unlike other best-selling toys, such as Monopoly and the Gumby Doll, the cube was not originally intended to be a toy. Its inventor, Hungarian architecture professor Erno Rubik, created it in 1974 as a way to teach his students three-dimensional geometry. The combined collections of Mattel's Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels have both outsold the Rubik's Cube, but none of them have as a single toy.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Each paid $250,000 to ride on the submersible.

He was also the co-founder of OceanGate Foundation, a non-profit organization \"which aims to catalyze emerging marine technology to further discoveries in marine science, history, and archaeology,\" according to the company's website.\n\nRush said at a conference in Seattle last year: “One of the reasons I started the business was because I didn’t understand why we were spending 1,000 times as much money to explore space as we were to explore … the oceans. There is no private access to the deep ocean, and yet there’s all this life to be discovered.”\n\nAt the same conference, he also said submarine safety programs were “over the top in their rules and regulations.”\n\nBefore graduating from Princeton University with a degree in aerospace engineering in 1984 and obtaining a master’s degree in business administration from the University of California in 1989, Rush had obtained his captain’s rating at the United Airlines Jet Training Institute. He went on to oversee business ventures that included serving on the board of Seattle’s BlueView Technologies and as chairman of Remote Control Technology.\n\nGreg Stone, the former executive vice president and chief scientist for Conservation International as well as a friend of Rush, said there was a need for advances in research submersibles.\n\n“That’s the direction he was going in. And I liked where he was going,” Stone said.\n\nBut, he added, Rush “had the problem that a lot of frontier people have. And that is he was ahead of the regulations.”\n\nRush had familial ties to the Titanic, NPR reported. Stockton Rush was married to Wendy Rush, the great-great granddaughter of Isador and Ida Straus, who were on board the sinking Titanic ship together.\n\nBritish billionaire explorer Hamish Harding\n\nHamish Harding, 58, was chairman of Action Aviation, a global sales company in business aviation. He held three Guinness World Records related to his explorations by plane and into the deep ocean. He had also been to space.\n\nHe had been looking forward to his Titan ride. “Due to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023,\" Harding wrote in a Facebook post Saturday, the day before the Titan voyage, according to the New York Times. \"A weather window has just opened up and we are going to attempt a dive tomorrow. We started steaming from St. Johns, Newfoundland, Canada yesterday and are planning to start dive operations around 4am tomorrow morning. Until then we have a lot of preparations and briefings to do.\"\n\nRichard Garriott de Cayoux, president of The Explorers Club, mourned the loss of his friends Harding and Paul-Henry Nargeolet on Twitter in a letter Thursday to “fellow explorers.”\n\n“They were both drawn to explore, like so many of us, and did so in the name of meaningful science for the betterment of mankind,” he wrote. “Their memories will be a blessing and will continue to inspire us in the name of exploration.”\n\nFrench maritime and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet\n\nPaul Henri-Nargeolet, 73, was director of Underwater Research for E/M Group and RMS Titanic, Inc.

Or build us housing,” Joshua Petitt, an unhoused Iraq War veteran, told CNN in an alley a hundred yards or so from the gates of the land, which is known as the West Los Angeles Campus.\n\nJoshua Petitt, an unhoused Iraq War veteran. CNN\n\nThere are more homeless veterans in Los Angeles than anyplace else in this country – around 3,500 of them on the streets and in shelters, according to the city’s Homeless Services Authority. There are also 388 acres in the leafy, lovely neighborhood of Brentwood on the city’s West Side that were given to the nation specifically to house veterans. But very few veterans actually live here. The land is used for a large VA health center and, among other things, the UCLA Bruins’ baseball diamond, and the sports fields and swimming pool of the elite Brentwood School. They are neighbors, and the Department of Veterans Affairs leases them chunks of this valuable parcel.\n\nCNN\n\nThe lawsuit demands that, “Permanent Supportive Housing should be made available within 6 months, both on the WLA Campus and in apartments near the WLA Campus for at least 3,500 eligible homeless veterans.” Obviously to help those veterans with housing, and to give them access to services they need that are offered on the campus. It also seeks an injunction, forcing the VA not to use the land “for purposes that are not primarily related to providing housing and healthcare for veterans with disabilities.” So no more private school playing fields.\n\nPetitt, who lived for a year in a tent outside the fence that surrounds this land, is now one of the 14 unhoused veterans among the plaintiffs. “They don’t want us here, bro. I mean, I get it. But I don’t care,” he said. “People always talk about Beverly Hills. But Beverly Hills ain’t nothing compared to Brentwood. That’s why they don’t want us here, because we might be hard to deal with, we have some problems. But they can send us to war to get those problems? But then not have to deal?”\n\nA spokesperson for UCLA told CNN, “UCLA is in full compliance with the West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016, as indicated in the Department of Veteran Affairs Office of the Inspector General’s audit of September 2021.”\n\nTerrence Hayes, the VA’s press secretary, told CNN after the suit was filed, “While we cannot comment on ongoing litigation, we at the VA promise that we will not rest until every Veteran has a good, safe, stable home in this country they fought to defend.”\n\nHayes pointed out that this year across Los Angeles the VA has, “made available 138 units of housing with nearly 700 more units expected in 2023.” And as for building those new units on the VA campus, he says there will be more than 700 units completed by the end of 2025.\n\nCNN asked the Brentwood School for comment on the lawsuit. They have not yet replied.\n\nEarlier this year, CNN published an investigation into what has happened and is happening here on the land and the promises made previously to veterans.\n\nIn 2016, after intense pressure from veterans and their advocates, and after another lawsuit, the VA agreed to house veterans on this land. They published a Master Plan. When we visited in March, more than 700 new housing units should have been completed. But not even one was complete. There were about 180 units under construction and scheduled to open this fall. None of them are open yet. “Now we’re being told next year January, February time frame,” said Rob Reynolds, another Iraq War veteran, a veterans’ advocate, and a driving force behind this new lawsuit.\n\nIn the spring, Brentwood School declined an interview, but gave CNN a statement detailing the amount of money they pay the VA in rent, as well as the services they offer veterans, such as the use of the school’s gym. In response to recent protests outside the school gates by veterans and their advocates, the school posted a statement on its website that reads, in part, “We have been a reliable partner since 1972 … Brentwood School will continue to work with Veterans and VA officials to ensure that our facilities, services, and programs remain available to the thousands of Veterans and their families who use and benefit from them.”\n\nJackie Robinson Stadium CNN\n\nUCLA also declined an interview in the spring, but a press officer wrote in a statement to CNN: “UCLA pays market-rate rent for its use of Jackie Robinson Stadium.” But, according to a 2016 appraisal of the land, they’re actually about a half-million dollars short. The college also provides some legal and other services, and veterans can attend Bruins baseball games for free.\n\nBall games don’t cut it for Petitt.\n\n“UCLA lets us go to baseball games, if there’s seating available. My daughter’s absolutely benefiting from that. Oh great. Cool,” said Petitt sarcastically. “Brentwood School lets us use their gym when their precious students aren’t there.”\n\n‘It’s tragic’\n\nFour thousand veterans did once live on this land, say veteran advocates. Roughly the same number of homeless veterans spread across Los Angeles today.\n\n“It wasn’t given to anybody but veterans. For a home,” Christine Barrie, whose ancestor donated much of the land way back in 1888, said in March.\n\n“But with Vietnam, the VA decided, no more,” said Mark Rosenbaum, one of the attorneys behind this lawsuit. “And the neighboring community said we don’t want disabled Vietnam vets out here.” Some say an earthquake in the 1970s that damaged many buildings on the land is actually the reason. The VA says changes in the law prevented them from paying to build veteran housing. The National Veterans Foundation is also a plaintiff. And the legal team includes Rosenbaum’s Public Counsel, as well as the Inner City Law Center, Brown, Goldstein & Levy and Robins Kaplan LLP.\n\n“This is a battle that’s been going on for decades,” said Rosenbaum. “And it’s tragic that we have to go to a federal court in order that vets who served this country can be served by this country.”\n\n\"Tiny homes\" come with a bed, heating and air conditioning, and a door to shut. CNN\n\nIn 2016, Congress also passed an act mandating that any leaseholders on this land must, “principally benefit veterans and their families.” Since then, the VA has signed a new agreement with a company that drills for oil on the land. “2.5% revenue we do get,” Robert McKenrick, then a senior official at the VA campus, told CNN back in March. The money is used for veteran transportation. The VA also amended, in private, the UCLA lease, allowing a practice field. That Act of Congress allowed UCLA on the land, on the condition that, “the provision of services to veterans is the predominant focus of the activities of The Regents at the Campus during the term of the lease.” And the VA also signed a new 10-year lease with Brentwood School.\n\n“What’s the point of a law if our own federal government is not going to follow it?” said Reynolds. “And then the end result of this is that veterans are dying on the street.”\n\n“The arrangement with the school is non-compliant,” McKenrick told CNN in March. So, he agreed with a key part of this new lawsuit, that Brentwood School should not be on this land. But, he added, “I’m sure if we terminated the lease, they would take us to court over it.”\n\nNow the VA is being taken to court, but by veterans who want housing. Petitt says housing is, “everything.” He is currently being treated for PTSD. “I can look right here right now and still see the alley in Ramadi,” he said. “Iraq is still so raw.” He wants to help build new homes for vets on this land. “Stability, housing and then everything else will fall into place. And veterans deserve that.”", "authors": ["Nick Watt"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}]}

That means 25 milliliters or a single shot of liquor is one unit; a 16-ounce can of beer or cider is two units; and a standard 6-ounce glass of wine (175 milliliters) is two units.\n\nThe brains of nondrinkers who began consuming an average of one alcohol unit a day showed the equivalent of a half a year of aging, according to the study.\n\nIn comparison, drinking four alcohol units a day aged a person’s brain by more than 10 years.\n\n“It’s not linear. It gets worse the more you drink,” first author Remi Daviet, an assistant professor of marketing in the Wisconsin School of Business at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in a statement.\n\n“A problem in this study is that they only have information on people’s drinking habits for the one year prior to the (brain) imaging,” said alcohol researcher Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington.\n\n“I think this is a major limitation of the study as it’s likely that the cumulative consumption of alcohol throughout one’s lifetime is associated with the brain, not just the level of consumption right before the images were taken,” she added.\n\n“The relationship between alcohol and health is complex, and our understanding of that relationship is evolving over time. Based on this study, I would not really draw any definitive conclusions, but I would say that the authors have identified areas for further research.”\n\nBenefits of alcohol?\n\nDoctors used to believe that moderate amounts of alcohol could provide a health benefit, especially to the heart and the brain, but recent research has called that assumption into question. A number of studies have found no amount of drinking to be healthy, and the World Heart Federation recently published a policy brief saying there is “no level of alcohol consumption that is safe for health.”\n\n“Small amounts of alcohol are associated with health benefits for some conditions, such as ischemic heart disease and diabetes, but harmful for others, such as road traffic accidents and breast cancer,” Gakidou said, adding there are others, such as a stroke, where the outcome isn’t clear.\n\n“There isn’t really a simple answer for a given individual,” she said. “Based on what we do know at this time, whether small amounts of alcohol are beneficial or harmful for an individual depends on that person’s health status and their risk profile. … Are they more prone to heart disease or cancer?”\n\nBrain scans and large study size\n\nThe report analyzed data from more than 36,000 people who took part in the UK Biobank study, which houses in-depth genetic and health information on more than 500,000 middle-aged adults living in the United Kingdom.\n\nPeople in the study had provided information on the number of drinks they had each week in the previous year and had undergone an MRI brain scan. Researchers compared their scans with images of typical aging brains and then controlled for such variables as age, sex, smoking status, socioeconomic status, genetic ancestry and overall head size.\n\n“The fact that we have such a large sample size allows us to find subtle patterns, even between drinking the equivalent of half a beer and one beer a day,” coauthor Gideon Nave, an assistant professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said in a statement.\n\n“Having this dataset is like having a microscope or a telescope with a more powerful lens,” Nave said. “You get a better resolution and start seeing patterns and associations you couldn’t before.”\n\nHe told CNN that is why this study was able to find a more distinct pattern of association between drinking and brain volume than past studies. However, he added, the results are just that – an association – as the study could not prove cause and effect.\n\n“Our study is by far the largest investigation of the topic,” Nave said. “It uses a general population sample, and it controls for more confounds than before. As such, it provides overwhelmingly more evidence than any previous investigations and gets us closer to settling the debate.”\n\nHowever, the study left a number of questions unanswered, such as a person’s cognitive engagement, Gakidou said.\n\n“I believe that there is sufficient evidence that suggests that brain function decays faster among those that are not engaged in intellectually stimulating activities, either through work or hobbies,” she said.\n\n“My main criticism is that the authors are overinterpreting the findings of their study and drawing conclusions that are not necessarily supported by what is presented in the paper. I do not see a significant trend in their graphs, and so I’m not convinced by the conclusions.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/961359/the-week-unwrapped-eu-vs-apple-lab-made-embryos-and-power-naps", "title": "The Week Unwrapped: EU vs. Apple, lab-made embryos and power ...", "text": "Olly Mann and The Week delve behind the headlines and debate what really matters from the past seven days.

Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nA large new study published provides evidence that people 50 and older who sleep five hours or less at night have a greater risk of developing multiple chronic diseases as they age compared with peers who get a longer night’s rest.\n\nThe study, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine, took a closer look at a group of nearly 8,000 civil servants in the United Kingdom who had no chronic disease at age 50. Scientists asked the participants to report on how much sleep they got during clinic examinations every four to five years for the next 25 years.\n\nFor those whose sleep was tracked at age 50, people who slept five hours or less a night faced a 30% higher risk that they would develop multiple chronic diseases over time than those who slept at least seven hours a night. At 60, it was a 32% increased risk, and at 70, it was a 40% greater risk.\n\nDiseases for which there was a higher risk included diabetes, cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, depression, dementia, mental disorders, Parkinson’s and arthritis.\n\nOther research has shown that adults who do not get enough sleep – about seven to nine hours a night – have a greater chance of developing chronic diseases that also include obesity and high blood pressure, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nUnlike other studies, the new one did not find that those who slept longer than nine hours had health problems, but few people in the study slept that much, and that may have affected the results.\n\nThe study has some additional limitations. Most of the subjects were White men; only about a third were women. The researchers say the civil servants also tend to be a little healthier than the general population. And the study relied on self-reported data, which is considered less reliable than if people were in a sleep study in which scientists could directly observe how the person was sleeping.\n\n“Short sleep duration in midlife and old age is associated with higher risk of onset of chronic disease and multimorbidity,” the study concluded. “These findings support the promotion of good sleep hygiene on both primary and secondary prevention by targeting behavioral and environmental conditions that affect sleep duration and quality.”\n\nSharon Cobb, who has worked on sleep research and was not involved with the new study, said it’s important because it provides more evidence that sleep and chronic conditions are related.\n\n“I think for a long time, we’ve stressed that you need your sleep. But now we’re starting to really push forward. There’s more literature coming out that sleep can affect more than just mental health. It’s also affecting more comorbidities,” said Cobb, who is the director of prelicensure nursing programs and an associate professor at the Mervyn M. Dymally School of Nursing at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles.\n\nCobb points out that duration is important with sleep, but so is quality – a factor this study did not capture. The study also doesn’t explain what may be causing the chronic conditions among the people who slept five hours or less.\n\nOther research has shown that sleep is a restorative process that, among other things, produces and regulates hormones in the body, explains Adam Knowlden, an associate professor of health science at the University of Alabama, who was not involved in the new research but is working on a different large sleep study.\n\nHormones regulate things like appetite, metabolism, sex drive, blood pressure and heart rate, body temperature, and circadian rhythms. If the body doesn’t produce adequate hormones due to a lack of sleep, that is thought to lead to chronic health problems in addition to things like fatigue, body aches and problems with blood pressure.\n\nStudies show that a lack of sleep can also increase inflammation, the body’s natural defense against infection or injury. Temporary inflammation works well to protect the body, but if it is chronic, it can lead to multiple diseases.\n\n“Sleep is always one of the biggest pieces of the equation for people to be healthy,” Knowlden said.\n\n“Often, people see the need to sleep as an inconvenience. They think to get the most out of life, they need to deprive themselves of sleep to get ahead or to be more social, but it’s really the other way around,” he said. “Most of the research shows your quality of life actually improves if you get sufficient sleep.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nKnowlden said that when people tell him they’re having trouble sleeping, he offers several recommendations.\n\nFirst, establish a consistent sleep schedule. Training your body to go to bed at a consistent hour and get up at the same time every day makes getting a regular night’s rest easier.\n\nThe bedroom should be dark, quiet and free or pets who can interfere with sleep.\n\nAvoid caffeine, alcohol and large meals before bedtime. Exercise during the day can also lead to better sleep at night.\n\n“The more we can encourage people to get a better night’s rest, the better,” Knowlden said. “Sleep impacts everything.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/health/12-weeks-to-a-sharper-you-sanjay-gupta-wellness/index.html", "title": "Dr. Sanjay Gupta: 6 keys to keeping sharp in 2023 | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is a practicing neurosurgeon and the author of the new book, “12 Weeks to a Sharper You: A Guided Program.”\n\nCNN —\n\nAt least once a year, we read a sparkling headline about some promising new drug that might help patients with Alzheimer’s disease. And at least once a year, we also hear about failed drug trials and reversals of promises that a cure-all is in sight. I wrote a book about how to keep your brain sharp that came out two years ago. Since then, not much has changed in our understanding of how we can preserve our memories, and the lessons remain as relevant as ever. But one thing has become abundantly clearer: Preventing and even treating forms of dementia are largely driven by lifestyle and the choices we make daily. You are not necessarily doomed to whatever fate you think sits stuck in your genes. If there’s one fact that’s increasingly apparent in scientific circles, it’s that our lifestyle choices contribute mightily to our aging process and risk for disease, likely as much – or perhaps even more – than our genetics.\n\n\"12 Weeks to a Sharper You: A Guided Program\" is a new book by CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Simon & Schuster\n\nIndeed, your everyday experiences – including what you eat, how much you move, with whom you socialize, what challenges you face, what gives you a sense of purpose, how well you sleep, and what you do to reduce stress – factor much more into your brain health and overall wellness than you might imagine. We may never have a drug that everyone can take to avoid, let alone cure, dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. But we all can access the same toolkit proven to help stack the deck in our favor for a sharp brain for life. The program I outline in my book, and which informed the interactive workbook I have coming out this week – “12 Weeks to a Sharper You: A Guided Program” – features all the practical tools you need to implement in your life today. They can help stave off brain decline, and also help you feel less anxious, sleep better, improve energy, think more clearly, make better decisions, become more resilient to daily stress, and even lose weight and boost immunity – all resolutions most of us aim to make at the transition to a new year filled with hope and high expectations. We all know that change is a challenge, and changing long-established habits takes effort. But it doesn’t have to be tortuous, and it is really not that hard to do. Let me give you six things that will help you in 2023 – your keys to the kingdom of mental sharpness.\n\nKey No. 1: nutrition\n\nSkip the crash diet and simply work on following the S.H.A.R.P. protocol: Slash the sugar and salt; Hydrate smartly; Add more omega-3 fatty acids from dietary sources; Reduce portions; and Plan ahead. The S.H.A.R.P. protocol is the easiest way to gravitate toward healthier foods in general and minimize the amount of processed, brain-busting junk. And if you need just one single thing to focus on here, start with the sugar. The average American consumes nearly 20 teaspoons of added sugar daily, most of that in the highly processed form of fructose, derived from high-fructose corn syrup. My guess is that a lot of this sugar intake comes in the form of a liquid – soda, energy drinks, juices and flavored teas. Swap sugar-laden drinks with water and you’ll take on two steps. That’s how to hydrate smartly.\n\nKey No. 2: movement\n\nPhysical exertion is the only thing we’ve scientifically documented to improve brain health and function, and it may even slow memory loss. It’s the brain’s only superfood. And it needn’t be formal or require equipment. Walk more, take the stairs, and get up for light activity for two minutes every hour. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cognitive decline is almost twice as common among adults who are inactive compared to those are active. In 2022, a large international study that tracked the health of more than half a million people showed that the simple act of performing household chores like cooking, cleaning and washing the dishes can cut the risk of dementia by a stunning 21%. That put chores as the second biggest protective activity behind more obvious things such as riding a bike. In this same study, regular movement was shown to reduce risk of dementia by 35%, followed by meeting up with friends and family (a 15% lower risk). Again, simple things with huge payoffs.\n\nKey No. 3: downtime\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most extreme, how would you rate your stress level? What if I told you that stress is now considered a trigger for silent neurodegeneration, which occurs years before symptoms develop? Scores of well-designed studies routinely show that chronic stress can impair your ability to learn and adapt to new situations, and subtly erode your cognition. More specifically, stress destroys cells in the hippocampus, the brain site responsible for memory storage and retrieval. So, by reducing stress, you not only help preserve cells vital to memory but you also improve focus, concentration and productivity. Don’t let toxic stress get in the way of keeping sharp. Take breaks during the day to engage in an activity that’s peaceful, meditative and stress-reducing. It can be as easy as walking in nature, journal writing, spending time with a pet, or even daydreaming. Download an app today that will give you a guided tour through a deep breathing exercise you can practice daily. I have a trusty meditative routine that calms me down in 90 seconds or less. I simply close my eyes, pay close attention to my breath, and picture my worries in clear bubbles directly in front of me that float weightlessly up and away.\n\nFind what works for you and make it a part of your day – every day.\n\nKey No. 4: sleep\n\nAre you getting restorative sleep? Contrary to popular belief, sleep is not a state of neural idleness. It is a critical phase during which the body replenishes itself in a variety of ways that ultimately affect every system, from the brain to the heart, the immune system, and all the inner workings of our metabolism. You can think of sleep as your brain’s rinse cycle for clearing out junk that could contribute to decline and disease. Prioritize sleep as you would anything else important. And start with your bedtime routine. Stop looking at screens a full hour before bed – your smartphone included – and prepare for a good night’s sleep. I bumped my pre-sleep prep time from 30 minutes to an hour and it has made all the difference in my energy and productivity the next day.\n\nKey No. 5: discovery\n\nAre you learning something new every day that’s cognitively stimulating? Staying mentally challenged is vital, so much so that studies show that someone who retires at age 65 has about a 15% lower risk of developing dementia compared with someone retiring at 60, even after other factors are taken into account. Retire late, or never at all. Choose different routes to familiar destinations. Brush your teeth with the non-dominant hand. Skip the solitary games and crossword puzzles and pick up a new hobby that involves other people. Which brings me to the final key …\n\nKey No. 6: connection\n\nWe are social creatures who need social connection to thrive, especially when it comes to brain health. Call a friend today. Invite a neighbor over for dinner. Go for a walk with a buddy and talk about your problems. Cherish those relationships. The strength of our connections with others can predict the health of both our bodies and our brains as we go through life. Good relationships protect us. They are a secret sauce to a long, sharp life.\n\nAs of 2022, scientists have documented a total of about 75 genes connected to the development of Alzheimer’s disease, but carrying these genes is not a one-way ticket to decline. How those genes express themselves and behave may depend largely on your daily habits. Remember that a disease like Alzheimer’s is multifactorial, made up of different pathological features. Which is why prevention and treatments are increasingly becoming personalized – individualized to a person’s biochemistry, from basic parameters like cholesterol levels, blood pressure and blood sugar balance, to the state of one’s oral health and gut microbiome, relics of past infections, and even how well you can see and hear. To that end, it helps to keep your numbers in check. Don’t let your cholesterol or blood pressure, for instance, run amok. Same goes for your vision and hearing. In recent years, hearing and vision impairment have been added to the list of modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline.\n\nYour DNA provides your body’s core language, but how that DNA behaves tells the story. In the future, interventional therapies that include a combination of lifestyle habits and drugs may help those stories end well. You’ll also track your risk for cognitive decline over time in the future using a simple app on your smartphone that can help you evaluate your physiology (and your memory) in real time and make suggestions tailored for you. Until we all have that technology at our fingertips, the six keys above afford you a great start and will give you a strong foundation.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to build what’s called cognitive reserve, which is what scientists call “brain resiliency.” With more cognitive reserve, you support cognitive function and can lower your risk of neurodegenerative issues. It’s like having a backup set of networks in your brain when one fails or, worse, dies and is no longer functional. In many aspects of life, the more backup plans we have, the more chances for success, right? Well, the same is true for our brain’s hard- and soft-wiring. And perhaps the most important key to establishing that reserve is to do so over time – years or even decades – before your risk for decline increases with advanced age.\n\nAlways remember this: Cognitive decline is not necessarily inevitable. Research suggests healthy habits you can incorporate into your daily life can help protect your brain health for the long term. Think of health as a “top-down” project. Focus on your brain and everything else will follow.

But today, equipped with an electrode device implanted on his spinal cord, Roccati can enjoy the simple things again: standing at a bar for drinks with friends, taking a shower without a chair and even strolling through the town with a walker.\n\n“I am free,” said Roccati, who is from Italy. “I can walk wherever I want to.”\n\nRoccati was one of three men between the ages of 29 and 41 to participate in the STIMO clinical trial, led by Dr. Jocelyne Bloch from Lausanne University Hospital and Grégoire Courtine of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The results of the study were published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\nThe participants had 16-electrode devices implanted in the epidural space, an area between the vertebrae and the spinal cord membrane. The electrodes receive currents from a pacemaker implanted under the skin of the abdomen.\n\nAll the patients in the trial had a complete loss of voluntary movement below their injuries. Two also had a complete loss of sensation. But with the devices in place, the researchers could use a tablet computer to initiate unique sequences of electrical pulses, sent to the epidural electrodes via the pacemaker, to activate the participants’ muscles.\n\nOther studies have anecdotally seen movement soon after surgery to implant similar devices, but this is the first study to report that all participants independently could take steps on a treadmill just a day after surgery, the researchers say.\n\n“It’s a very emotional moment, because [patients] realize they can step,” Bloch said.\n\nResearchers have been looking into electrical stimulation to the spinal cord for three decades. This study redesigned technology originally used to alleviate pain to target spinal nerve roots.\n\nPrevious studies out of the University of Louisville have shown that people who were completely paralyzed but still had sensation could walk again with several months of rehabilitation through electrical stimulation to the spinal cord. The STIMO trial found that within a week of their surgeries, all three participants could walk independently with the use of body-weight support from parallel bars and an overhead harness.\n\n“For the first time, we have not only immediate effect – though training is still important – but also individuals with no sensation, no movement whatsoever, have been able to regain full standing and walking independently of the laboratory,” Courtine told CNN.\n\nDr. Nandan Lad, a neurosurgeon at Duke University, said this “very exciting work gives a new treatment option for tens of thousands of patients that have spinal cord injury and don’t really have other options.” Lad is leading a clinical trial in this area of research in the US and was not involved in the new study.\n\nThe Swiss team has been able to observe immediate results through important changes in the structure and implantation of their electrode device. The electrode array used in the STIMO trial, made by Onward Medical, is wider and longer than the array most commonly used in similar studies. According to Bloch, this new electrode array allows access to a broader area of the spinal cord to stimulate both trunk and leg muscles.\n\nThe investigators developed an algorithm to optimally place the electrode array, running tests during the surgery to measure muscle activity after delivering pulses. The precise neurosurgical placement of the electrodes is key to the study’s ability to stimulate the necessary muscle groups in the legs so quickly, Lad said.\n\nThe STIMO trial also introduces a new method for initiating and sustaining movement. To begin stimulation, previous studies have relied on participants’ intent to move and the brain signals that follow. In the new study, a timed sequence of stimulations is generated using motor responses to different jolts of electricity. These pre-established sequences trigger movement and attempt to mimic the natural pattern of muscle activation needed to walk.\n\nSusan Harkema, a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery who led the Louisville studies, said it’s encouraging to know that two types of stimulation can generate movement patterns through human spinal circuitry, indicating that some function is retained, even with complete injuries.\n\n“But I don’t think we have enough evidence yet to know the best way to stimulate for the best outcomes,” Harkema told CNN.\n\nWith the STIMO device, people with complete spinal cord injury can regain voluntary movement in their legs only while receiving stimulation. While the device is off, voluntary movement will not be possible. The electrodes can remain in place for life, but the pacemaker needs to be replaced every nine years.\n\nBut with training, patients can build up greater endurance and do a wider range of activities. After the surgery, the study participants received one or two hours of physical therapy four times a week. With three or four months of consistent training, one participant could stand for two hours at a time. Another could walk 500 meters independently. One participant even climbed stairs again.\n\nThe tablet used in the study comes equipped with specific programs coded for certain types of activity, including standing, walking and swimming.\n\n“The more they train, the more they achieve, so they need the motivation to be able to stand a long time,” Bloch said of the participants’ progress.\n\nCourtine and Bloch now plan to work with Onward Medical to make the device more user-friendly for everyday use, such as integrating the program with cellphones or smartwatches. Next, the team is looking to scale up to a larger clinical trial in the US. They estimate that it will take another three or four years for the technology to become commercially available.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn a press briefing last week, the researchers announced that the US Food and Drug Administration has approved a “breakthrough devices” designation to expedite the process.\n\nThis designation would also ensure coverage through the Medicare Coverage of Innovative Technology program if larger clinical trials are successful.\n\n“I think [this research] should be a call for all of us to understand that there is hope for the treatment of these patients,” said Dr. Nicholas Theodore, director of the Johns Hopkins Neurosurgical Spine Center, who was not involved in the research. “I think the hope right now is going to be through an engineering solution and less so than cellular reparative strategy.”", "authors": ["Tasnim Ahmed"], "publish_date": "2022/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/health/omicron-ba-5-variant-immunity-severity/index.html", "title": "Why the Omicron offshoot BA.5 is a big deal | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nOnce again, Covid-19 seems to be everywhere. If you feel caught off-guard, you aren’t alone.\n\nAfter the Omicron tidal wave washed over the United States in January and the smaller rise in cases in the spring caused by the BA.2 subvariant, it might have seemed like the coronavirus could be ignored for a while. After all, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in December that nearly all Americans had been vaccinated or have antibodies from a past infection. Surely all that immunity bought some breathing room.\n\nBut suddenly, many people who had recovered from Covid-19 as recently as March or April found themselves exhausted, coughing and staring at two red lines on a rapid test. How could this be happening again – and so soon?\n\nThe culprit this time is yet another Omicron offshoot, BA.5. It has three key mutations in its spike protein that make it both better at infecting our cells and more adept at slipping past our immune defenses.\n\nIn just over two months, BA.5 outcompeted its predecessors to become the dominant cause of Covid-19 in the United States. Last week, this subvariant caused almost 2 out of every 3 new Covid-19 infections in this country, according to the latest data from the CDC.\n\nLab studies of antibodies from the blood of people who’ve been vaccinated or recovered from recent Covid-19 infections have looked at how well they stand up to BA.5, and this subvariant can outmaneuver them. So people who’ve had Covid as recently as winter or even spring may again be vulnerable to the virus.\n\n“We do not know about the clinical severity of BA.4 and BA.5 in comparison to our other Omicron subvariants,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing Tuesday. “But we do know it to be more transmissible and more immune-evading. People with prior infection, even with BA.1 and BA.2, are likely still at risk for BA.4 or BA.5.”\n\nA ‘full-on’ wave\n\nThe result is that we’re getting sick in droves. As Americans have switched to more rapid at-home tests, official case counts – currently hovering around 110,000 new infections a day – reflect just a fraction of the true disease burden.\n\n“We estimate that for every reported case there are 7 unreported,” Ali Mokdad, professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, wrote in an email.\n\nOther experts think the wave could be as much as 10 times higher than what’s being reported now.\n\n“We’re looking at probably close to a million new cases a day,” Dr. Peter Hotez said on CNN. “This is a full-on BA.5 wave that we’re experiencing this summer. It’s actually looking worse in the Southern states, just like 2020, just like 2021,” said Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\nThat puts us in the range of cases reported during the first Omicron wave, in January. Remember when it seemed like everyone everywhere got sick at the same time? That’s the situation in the United States again.\n\nIt may not seem like a very big deal, because vaccines and better treatments have dramatically cut the risk of death from Covid-19. Still, about 300 to 350 people are dying on average each day from Covid-19, enough to fill a large passenger jet.\n\n“That is unacceptable. It’s too high,” Dr. Ashish Jha, coordinator for the White House Covid-19 Response Team, said at Tuesday’s briefing.\n\nDaily hospitalizations are also climbing in the United States. The fraction of patients needing intensive care is up by about 23% over the past two weeks. And other countries are experiencing BA.5 waves, too.\n\n“I am concerned that cases of Covid-19 continue to rise, putting further pressure on stretched health systems and health workers. I am also concerned about the increasing trend of deaths,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, at a news briefing Tuesday after the agency’s decision to maintain its emergency declaration for Covid-19.\n\nThe pandemic, he said, is “nowhere near over.”\n\nWhat’s at stake with continued spread\n\nThere are also more insidious health risks to consider. A recent preprint study that compared the health of people who’d been infected one or more times with Covid-19 found that the risk of new and sometimes lasting health problems rose with each subsequent infection, suggesting that reinfections are not necessarily benign.\n\nAlthough vaccination reduces the risk of getting long Covid, a certain percentage of people have lasting symptoms after a breakthrough infection.\n\nThat’s another reason why high numbers of Covid-19 cases are a big deal: Because the virus is still spreading wildly, it has every opportunity to mutate to make even fitter and more infectious versions of itself. It’s doing this faster than we can change our vaccines, leaving us stuck in the Covid-rinse-repeat period of the pandemic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, pleaded with Americans to use all available tools to stop the spread of the virus, including masking, ventilation and social distancing.\n\n“We need to keep the levels of virus to the lowest possible level, and that is our best defense. If a virus is not very robustly replicating and spreading, it gives it less of a chance of a mutation, which gives it less of a chance of the evolving of another variant,” Fauci said in a news briefing.\n\nIn fact, this is already happening.\n\nMeet BA.2.75\n\nEven as the US comes to terms with BA.5, variant hunters around the world are closely watching another Omicron descendant, BA.2.75. It’s been detected in about 10 countries, including the United States, and seems to be growing quickly in India.\n\nBA.2.75 has nine changes in its spike region that distinguish it from BA.2 and about 11 changes compared with BA.5, according to Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London.\n\nSeveral of the mutations in BA.2.75 are in a region of the spike protein known to be an important place for antibodies to bind to stop the virus, said Ulrich Elling, a scientist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences who monitors coronavirus variants for that country.\n\nThere’s little information to go on: It’s still not known, for example, how BA.2.75 may compete against BA.5 or whether it causes more severe illness. But experts say it has all the hallmarks of a variant that could go global.\n\n“It spread to many different countries already, so we know that it has some sort of staying power,” said Shishi Luo, associate director of bioinformatics and infectious disease for Helix Labs, which decodes virus samples for the CDC and other clients.\n\nBecause of that, and because of changes in the region of the virus that our antibodies look for to shut it down, “we sort of know ahead of time that this one will cause some trouble,” Luo said.\n\nBased on what we know now, she expects that this subvariant could drive a fall Covid-19 wave in the United States.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn the meantime, Jha said, people should get boosters that are available to them to keep their immunity as strong as possible. US health officials emphasized that people who are boosted now will still be able to get an updated shot this fall that includes the BA.4 and BA.5 strains.\n\nJha specifically urged Americans who are 50 and older, “if you’ve not gotten a vaccine shot this year, go get one now.

Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhether it’s pursuing a demanding career, eating better or maintaining friendships, accomplishing the feats we most desire requires a healthy foundation.\n\nLiving life to the fullest starts with paying attention to your body and mind.\n\n“The long-term effects of good and bad health habits are cumulative. Simply stated, you cannot outrun your past,” said Dr. William Roberts, a professor in the department of family medicine and community health at the University of Minnesota, via email.\n\nGetting enough physical activity and seeing your doctor regularly is a good place to start, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen said.\n\n“There’s a lot of evidence about the things we can do proactively that can improve our longevity as well as the quality,” said Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.\n\nHere are some habits worth implementing to give yourself the best chance at a longer, happier life.\n\n1. Regular screenings\n\nYoung people tend to have fewer chronic illnesses than older ones, but prevention is key, Wen said. “If you screen positive for prediabetes, for example, there are steps that you can take to prevent progressing to diabetes.”\n\nAnnual checkups also enable you and your doctor to get to know each other, she added. “The best time to see your physician is not when you already have symptoms and need help – it’s on a regular basis to build and establish that relationship so that your physician can get a baseline of your health.”\n\n2. Consistent physical activity\n\nGetting enough physical activity can lower your risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, heart disease and stroke, Wen said.\n\n“There’s an overwhelming body of research that supports regular aerobic exercise for not only living longer but also to maintain cognitive function longer,” said Dr. Nieca Goldberg, medical director of Atria New York City and clinical associate professor of medicine at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine.\n\nThe World Health Organization has recommended that adults get at least 150 minutes (2 ½ hours) of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity weekly, while pregnant people should do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic and strengthening per week.\n\n3. A healthy BMI\n\nBody mass index is a measurement of body fat that assesses a person’s weight category and potential risk for health issues, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMaintaining a healthy BMI can lengthen your life by more than a decade, a 2018 study found, and has been linked with a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and cancer. Regular physical activity and eating healthy foods can help you with this goal.\n\n4. Proper nutrition\n\nEating more plant-based foods provides a great source of antioxidants, Goldberg said. “Oxidation is a sign of stress in our system and can lead to changes in the buildup of plaque in the arteries and such,” she said. “And this oxidation is also associated with aging.”\n\nYou could extend your life by eating fewer red and processed meats and more fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts, according to a February study published in the journal PLOS Medicine. The potential benefits are especially strong if you start young – women who began eating optimally at age 20 could increase life span by a little over 10 years, while men who start at the same age could add 13 years.\n\nAt mealtime, at least half your plate should consist of fruits and vegetables, Goldberg said. Also, what’s important is “not only what’s on the food, but how you prepare it,” she added. “So baking and broiling is better than frying.”\n\n5. Pay attention to mental wellness\n\nMental health is often “such a neglected part of our overall health, but actually contributes a huge amount to overall health and well-being,” Wen said.\n\nThe past few years have brought about stress and anxiety, which can affect blood pressure, sleep, dietary choices, alcohol intake or attempts to quit smoking, Goldberg said.\n\nCarving out just 15 minutes for a bit of mental health hygiene can make your life easier, experts have said. Try taking deep breaths upon waking, being present with your morning coffee instead of being distracted, going for a walk, journaling and taking breaks from screens.\n\nThe benefits of these mindfulness practices come from lowering levels of cortisol, the stress hormone linked with health complications. Being able to regulate your emotions better – which can be achieved with meditation – has been associated with health resilience in older age.\n\n6. Plenty of sleep\n\nPeople who sleep less than seven hours nightly tend to have higher levels of stress hormones, blood sugar and blood pressure, Goldberg said.\n\nYou can improve the quality and quantity of your sleep by getting regular exercise and having good sleep hygiene. Keep your bedroom dark, quiet and cold at night, and only use it for sleep and sex.\n\n7. Drinking less\n\n“For a long time, people have been associating alcohol with a healthier heart,” Goldberg said. But “heavy alcohol intake can actually be a direct toxin to the heart muscle and result in heart failure. And it also raises (blood sugar levels) and causes weight gain.”\n\nAvoiding too much alcohol can add at least several years to your life by lowering your risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and other chronic diseases, a 2020 study found.\n\n8. Not smoking\n\n“Smoking is a major risk factor that increases the likelihood of multiple cancers – not just lung cancer but also things like breast cancer,” Wen said. It also “increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and other conditions that shorten people’s lives.”\n\nIf you’re a habitual smoker, it’s not too late to quit to lengthen your life, Wen added.\n\n9. Build strong relationships\n\nHaving close, positive relationships adds happiness and comfort to our lives and reduces stress, experts have said. Studies have shown that people who have satisfying relationships with family, friends and community have fewer health problems, live longer and experience less depression and cognitive decline later in life, according to Harvard Health.\n\nIf implementing all these habits feels like a lot, think of them as a gradual build, Wen said. “We may not be perfect on everything all the time,” she said, “but (there are) things that we can do to improve in one or multiple dimensions, and we could commit to that kind of lifestyle improvement.”", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/955451/how-to-get-your-smell-and-taste-back-after-covid", "title": "How to regain your smell and taste after Covid-19 | The Week UK", "text": "Millions of people worldwide are trying to adapt to life without smell and taste after being infected with Covid-19.\n\nFor the majority, this olfactory dysfunction lasts for just a couple of days or weeks, but some are still suffering months after contracting the virus. A study last year found that between 700,000 and 1.6 million people in the US had lost or had a change in their sense of smell for more than six months after having Covid.\n\nAnd the authors of the study – published in the Jama Network Open journal – warned that these figures were “likely an underestimate”, reported CNN.\n\nHowever, hopes have been raised after scientists said that a molecule found in coffee, typically described by people with smell distortion as “disgusting” or “repulsive”, could provide a breakthrough.\n\nThe causes\n\nThe “precise cause” of sensory loss related to the coronavirus is not known, said Sky News, but experts believe it is connected to “damage to infected cells in a part of the nose called the olfactory epithelium”. Cells in this area of the nasal cavity protect olfactory neurons that enable humans to smell.\n\nA study published in the Nature Genetics journal in January suggested that genetics plays a key role in determining whether a person loses or experiences a change in their sense of smell and taste after being infected with Covid-19.\n\nThe analysis of DNA data on nearly 70,000 adults in the UK and the US with Covid found that those with “certain genetic tweaks” on a chromosome near two olfactory genes, called UGT2A1 and UGT2A24, were 11% more likely to lose the ability to smell or taste than people without the changes, explained Science News.\n\nThe researchers suggested that the genetic variants “could affect how the two genes are turned on or off to somehow mess with smell during an infection”, the site said.\n\nTrigger molecule\n\nA related and lesser-known symptom of Covid is parosmia, where people experience smell distortion after contracting the virus. According to Fifth Sense, a charity for people affected by smell and taste disorders, an estimated 25,000 UK adults who have had Covid have been affected by parosmia, which “can mean food gives off an unpleasant odour or taste, such as rotten meat or chemicals”, said the BBC.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/09/health/sleep-history-wellness-scn/index.html", "title": "How our ancestors used to sleep can help the sleep-deprived today ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nLike many people, historian A. Roger Ekirch thought that sleep was a biological constant – that eight hours of rest a night never really varied over time and place.\n\nBut while researching nocturnal life in preindustrial Europe and America, he discovered the first evidence that many humans used to sleep in segments – a first sleep and second sleep with a break of a few hours in between to have sex, pray, eat, chat and take medicine.\n\n“Here was a pattern of sleep unknown to the modern world,” said Ekirch, a university distinguished professor in the department of history at Virginia Tech.\n\nEkirch’s subsequent book, “At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past,” unearthed more than 500 references to what’s since been termed biphasic sleep. Ekirch has now found more than 2,000 references in a dozen languages and going back in time as far as ancient Greece. His 2004 book will be republished in April.\n\nThe practice of sleeping through the whole night didn’t really take hold until just a few hundred years ago, his work suggested. It only evolved thanks to the spread of electric lighting and the Industrial Revolution, with its capitalist belief that sleep was a waste of time that could be better spent working.\n\nThe history of sleep not only reveals fascinating details about everyday life in the past, but the work of Ekirch, and other historians and anthropologists, is helping sleep scientists gain fresh perspective on what constitutes a good night’s sleep. It also offers new ways to cope with and think about sleep problems.\n\nThere is value in knowing about this prior pattern of sleep in the Western world, said Ekirch. He’s convinced “a large number of people who today suffer from middle-of-the-night insomnia, the primary sleep disorder in the United States – and I dare say in most industrialized countries – rather than experiencing a quote unquote, disorder, are in fact, experiencing a very powerful remnant, or echo of this earlier pattern of sleep,” said Ekirch, who stressed he was speaking from a historical perspective and not as a medical doctor.\n\nAdults need more than seven hours of sleep a night, but more than a third of American adults are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA panel from a medieval stained glass church window depicts a married couple sleeping. TonyBaggett/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nMyth of 8-hour sleep?\n\nThe first reference to biphasic sleep Ekirch found was in a 1697 legal document from a traveling “Assizes” court buried in a London record office. The deposition of a 9-year-old girl called Jane Rowth mentioned that her mother awoke after her “first sleep” to go out. The mother was later found dead.\n\n“I had never heard the expression, and it was expressed in such a way that it seemed perfectly normal,” he said. “I then began to come across subsequent references in these legal depositions but also in other sources.”\n\nThese are notes made by historian A. Roger Ekirch when he came across the first reference to segmented sleep in a London archive office. University Distinguished Professor of History at Virginia Tech\n\nEkirch subsequently found multiple references to a “first” and “second” sleep in diaries, medical texts, works of literature and prayer books. A doctor’s manual from 16th century France advised couples that the best time to conceive was not at the end of a long day but “after the first sleep,” when “they have more enjoyment” and “do it better.”\n\nBy the early 19th century, however, the first sleep had begun to expand at the expense of the second sleep, Ekirch found, and the intervening period of wakefulness. By the end of the century, the second sleep was little more than turning over in one’s bed for an extra 10 minutes of snoozing.\n\nBen Reiss, author of “Wild Nights: How Taming Sleep Created Our Restless World” and professor and chair of the English department at Emory University in Atlanta, blames the Industrial Revolution and the “sleep is for wimps” attitude it engendered.\n\n“The answer is really to follow the money. Changes in economic organization, when it became more efficient to routinize work and have large numbers of people showing up on factory floors, at the same time and doing as much work in as concentrated fashion as possible,” Reiss said.\n\nOur sleep schedule got squeezed and consolidated as a result, Reiss said.\n\nThe image shows a lamplighter up a ladder.

SSPL/Getty Images\n\nNo golden age\n\nHowever, preindustrial life was no halcyon era when our ancestors went about their day well rested and rejuvenated, untroubled by insomnia or other sleep problems, effortlessly in sync with the cycle of night and day, weather patterns and seasons, according to Sasha Handley, a professor of history at The University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. She studies how families optimized their sleep in Britain, Ireland and England’s American colonies between 1500 and 1750.\n\n“Every discussion of sleep history seemed to center around the sort of watershed moment of industrialization, the coming of electricity ruining everybody’s sleep lives. The corollary of that is that anything preindustrial was imagined as this golden age of sleep.”\n\nA 15th century miniature of a room is shown. NSA Digital Archive/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nHandley said her research suggested, just like today, sleep was linked to physical and mental health and was a topic that people worried about and obsessed over.\n\nDoctor’s manuals from the time are full of advice on how many hours to sleep and in what kind of posture, she said. The reference guides also list hundreds of sleep recipes to aid a good night’s sleep, she said. These include the bizarre – cutting a pigeon in half and sticking each half to each side of your head and the more familiar – bathing in camomile-infused water and using lavender. People also burned specific types of wood in their bed chambers that were thought to aid sleep.\n\n“For our period, sleep is very strongly linked to digestion, emotion, stomach, and therefore to people’s diets,” Handley said.\n\nDoctors advised sleepers to rest first on the right side of their body before turning to the left side during the second half of the night. Resting on the right, perhaps during the first sleep, was thought to allow food to reach the pit of the stomach, where it was digested. Turning to the left, cooler side, released vapors and spread the heat evenly through the body.\n\nIt’s thought this habit could be the origin of the phrase about getting out of bed on the wrong side.\n\nThis is a woodblock print of a fisherman dreaming, circa 1700, Japan. The artist is unknown. Heritage Images/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nNot all scholars believe that sleeping in two shifts, while perhaps common in some communities, was once a universal habit. Far from it, said Brigitte Steger, a senior lecturer in Japanese studies at the University of Cambridge in the UK, who didn’t uncover any references to segmented sleep in her work on sleep habits in Japan.\n\n“There is no such thing as natural sleep. Sleep has always been cultural, social and ideological,” said Steger, who is working on a series of six books about the cultural history of sleep.\n\n“There is not such a clear-cut difference between premodern (or pre-industrial) and modern sleep habits,” she said via email. “And sleep habits throughout pre-industrial times and throughout the world have always changed. And, of course, there has always been social diversity, and sleep habits have been very different at court than for peasants, for instance.”\n\nSimilarly, Gerrit Verhoeven, an assistant professor in cultural heritage and history at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, said his study of criminal court records from 18th century Antwerp suggested that sleep habits weren’t so different to our own today. Seven hours of sleep was the norm and there was no mention of first or second sleep.\n\n“As a historian I’m concerned that arguments about alleged sleeping patterns in the past – prolonged, by-phasic and with napping during the day – are sometimes presented as a possible remedy for our modern sleeping disorders. Before drawing such conclusions, we have to do much more research about these early modern sleeping patterns,” he said.\n\nTry this routine before sleep to get a good night of rest 07:23 - Source: CNN\n\nRethinking insomnia\n\nRussell Foster, a professor of circadian neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said Ekirch’s findings on biphasic sleep, while not without controversy, had informed his work as a sleep scientist.\n\nExperiments in sleep labs had shown that when humans are given the opportunity to sleep longer, he said, their sleep can become biphasic or even polyphasic, replicating what Ekirch found in historical records. However, Foster, who is also the director of the Sir Jules Thorn Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford, doubted that it was a sleep pattern that would happen for everybody.\n\nNobody should impose a regime of segmented sleep on themselves, particularly if it resulted in a reduction of total sleep time, he added.\n\nWhat was clear, Foster said, was that interrupted sleep was perceived as less of a problem in the past and that modern expectations about what constitutes a good night’s sleep – sleeping through the night for eight hours – weren’t always helpful.\n\nHe said a key point was waking at night need not mean the end of sleep. One example he cited was more people waking up at night during lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“They’ll get terribly anxious and worried about waking up in the middle of night, because that’s not what they normally experience,” said Foster, who is also the author of “Life Time: The New Science of the Body Clock, and How It Can Revolutionize Your Sleep and Health,” which will be published in May 2022. More likely, what had happened was that people’s sleep episode – how much time they have available for sleep – had expanded and wasn’t constricted by an alarm clock going off.\n\n“It’s a throwback to a time when we genuinely got more sleep,” he said.\n\nIf we wake up at night, sleep is likely to return, if sleep is not sacrificed to social media or other behavior that makes you more alert or activates a stress response, Foster’s research has suggested. Like most sleep experts, he recommended getting out of bed if you’re getting frustrated by the failure to fall back to sleep and engaging in a relaxing activity while keeping the lights low.\n\n“Individual sleep across humans is so variable. One size doesn’t fit all. You shouldn’t worry about the sort of sleep that you get,” he said.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/01/09"}]}

To add urgency, he named the project after the incredibly fast rate a spaceship could travel on the cult classic TV series Star Trek: warp speed.\n\nMarks, 57, who runs a division of the Food and Drug Administration, has played a key role in nearly every major vaccine-related decision since the United States' COVID-19 outbreak began.\n\n\"The U.S. response to the pandemic as far as vaccines … was largely his concept,\" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting FDA director and Marks' boss.\n\nIt was his idea, she said, for the government to help vaccine companies quickly produce enough safe and effective vaccines for every American. \"It was definitely Peter who put the idea together for Operation Warp Speed for vaccines.\"\n\nDr. Stephen Hahn, who ran the FDA from 2019 through January, said one pharmaceutical executive told him Marks was \"not a pushover,\" providing clear direction and oversight to speed the process and help companies do their jobs better.\n\n\"It would have been easy for someone who was in a position of authority at an agency to stand back and use the procedures that had been used during normal times,\" Hahn said.\n\nBut Marks didn't do that.\n\n\"Peter was not afraid last year to do things that were necessary to foster innovation and bring novel things forward during a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic,\" Hahn said.\n\nThe effort was in character for Marks, who spent years as a cancer specialist and then moved into industry and government to try to help more people.\n\nNow, as head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Marks is responsible for ensuring that products made from living sources are safe, effective and widely available. His division also oversees advances in gene therapy, one of the most cutting-edge areas of medicine.\n\nFyodor Urnov, a professor and gene editing expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said Marks truly understands the potential for gene editing to provide transformative treatments for everything from rare diseases to widespread killers like heart disease.\n\n\"His leading of CBER will be highlighted as one of the things that made the era of gene editing possible,\" Urnov said.\n\nStaying above the fray\n\nMarks, who has an M.D. and a Ph.D. from New York University, is known for his strong intellect and character.\n\n\"His mind is working at warp speed,\" Woodcock said. \"Sometimes, it's a little bit hard to keep up with where he's going.\"\n\nThough appearing straight-laced and always professionally dressed without a hair out of place, Marks often gets a twinkle in his eye and fires off a quip. Meetings with him are punctuated with laughter, she said.\n\nWoodcock described herself as the more pragmatic and concrete of the two: \"He's more the mad scientist with incredible ideas.\"\n\nUnlike some visionaries, Marks is persistent and follows through.\n\n\"Warp Speed got done. They're moving ahead on gene therapy,\" Woodcock said. \"He has big ideas and doesn't let go of them.\"\n\nAsked to describe himself, Marks praised his staff and played down his own role in recent events.\n\n\"I'm a pretty boring person who feels very lucky to work with a lot of tremendously talented people making sure we do the right thing by public health,\" he said. \"I'm very happy to be in the right place at the right moment to help be a part of that.\"\n\nMore:The same mRNA technology used in COVID-19 vaccines could help treat cancer\n\nMarks' basement home office has become a familiar site to FDA-watchers. During repeated subcommittee meetings, he appeared on Zoom in front of paintings by his artist wife.\n\n\"For the first half of the year, I worked with the camera facing the ugly part of my basement and I was looking at these (paintings),\" he said, describing the stuffed polar bear, teapot and pillow still lifes. Then he decided to turn his desk around to improve the public's view.\n\nThe FDA faced criticism last year for yielding to political influence, authorizing use of hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma, before either was proved a safe or effective treatment against COVID-19. But Marks' division, which doesn't handle drugs, was roundly praised for sticking to the science with vaccine development and staying above the fray.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said he got a call from Marks after Offit wrote an op-ed in The New York Times. The article expressed the concern of Offit and a colleague that vaccines would fall prey to politics before November's election.\n\nMarks told him: \"If that happens, I'm going to quit and a lot of people will quit,\" Offit said.\n\nThe \"October surprise\" Offit feared didn't happen: \"They did stand up to the political pressure.\"\n\nTireless work by Marks and two other FDA officials, Marion Gruber and Dr. Doran Fink, were essential to getting the vaccines to the public, said Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease expert who chairs the COVID-19 Vaccine Analysis Team and is a professor at Georgetown University.\n\n\"I don't think this could have happened without the FDA,\" he said.\n\nRight place, right moment\n\nMarks was on a train heading to New York City when he first realized his life would be transformed by COVID-19.\n\nIt was late February 2020 and he was preparing to give a talk in his hometown. Somewhere between Philadelphia and Trenton, New Jersey, he saw data showing COVID-19 already was infecting people on five continents.\n\n\"Even though the case number was not incredibly high, once you had something that dispersed, there was no way you could imagine you were going to have containment as the strategy,\" he said. \"When you can't contain, you mitigate.\"\n\nHe recognized that speed was essential for saving lives.\n\n\"Every day you get a vaccine to someone faster, it means something,\" he said.\n\nMarks looked to Star Trek for the vaccine project's name, not, he insists, because he's a committed Trekkie, but because, \"the name was meant to shake us out of our everyday mode of doing things.\"\n\nMore:People hospitalized with COVID-19 now have one overwhelming thing in common. They're not vaccinated.\n\nOne of the ideas for speeding the process was to manufacture \"at risk\" – to start making product even before it had been proven safe and effective. If the vaccine failed to meet the same standards as other vaccines, all that product would have to be thrown out. But when one trial and then another proved out, there were millions of doses nearly ready to be injected into arms.\n\nHe expected problems. Any shot delivered to millions of people will cause some harm. \"Watching vaccines is not for the faint of heart,\" said Marks, who was part of the small group that decided to pause use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for 10 days in April so a rare side effect could be better understood and the public informed.\n\n\"I think allowing people the choice to know what is going on is very reasonable,\" he said.\n\nMarks understands why some might be hesitant about getting vaccinated, but as with most things, he assumes more knowledge is the solution.\n\n\"I'd like to believe if we can answer enough people's questions about vaccines that we would eventually get them to come on their own to realize this is not such a bad idea,\" said Marks, who speaks to two or three groups a week trying to counter hesitancy. \"In general, it's a matter of making sure that people don't feel judged about their questions.\"\n\nHe shuddered remembering how \"excruciatingly painful\" it was to be patient while being grilled by a group of extremely vaccine hesitant Hasidic Jews. But he kept his cool. Afterward, he said, \"that was the closest to ever getting fan mail I've ever had.\"\n\nMarks said he's grateful that his involvement in vaccine development has not led to celebrity. He doesn't want to be the subject of a bobble-head doll, like his colleague, the infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci: \"I'll stick to anonymity if I can.\"\n\nMarks said he's found his people at the FDA, where he and his colleagues can concentrate on public health \"to the exclusion of all the other noise,\" such as profit motive, politics and pettiness. \"Focusing on science-based public health – for the idealist in me – makes me very happy.\"\n\nIt's that idealism that has gotten him and his colleagues through the grueling last year-plus, he said: \"It's having a culture of people that don't tire at the end of the day in quite the same way because they know that what they're doing is critical for public health.\"\n\nWhile the rest of America is getting back to normal, Marks isn't ready yet to move on from the pandemic. He thinks it'll be with the world for a while, and may even surge again in the United States, particularly if people refuse vaccinations and masks.\n\nAnd there are still many lessons to be learned to prepare for the next pandemic and to get better, cheaper treatments in the meantime.\n\n\"That transformation that we might do for pandemic preparedness,\" he said, \"could also potentially transform medicines for our day-to-day life.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Chastain leads the NASCAR Cup Series points standings but lost an opportunity to win on Sunday at Darlington when he admitted he turned himself up into Larson off a restart with six laps to go as they battled for the lead.\n\n“Ross drove a great race,” Marks said. “He made good decisions in the first and second stages in not racing guys super hard, letting a couple of people go, just kind of managing that give and take and everything. And then it all kind of fell apart at the end.”\n\nChastain and Larson had been trading blows over a few restarts before the crash.

The higher price point on iOS appears to be an effort to account for Apple’s 30% app transaction fee, which Musk recently railed against.\n\nAs part of the new verification system, Twitter will offer gold checks for companies, gray checks for government entities and other organizations, and blue checks for individuals, whether or not they are celebrities. The gold business verification check mark started appearing Monday on the accounts for various companies, such as The New York Times and Taco Bell. Later on Monday, the option to subscribe to Twitter Blue returned to the platform.\n\nMusk has previously suggested that individuals who had been verified under the old system — because they are journalists, celebrities or public figures — would have their checks removed if they did not pay for Twitter’s new subscription service. On Monday, he tweeted that “all legacy blue checks” would be removed “in a few months.”\n\nSome Twitter users have started to see a new explanatory note when they click on the blue checks of accounts that were verified before Musk’s takeover that reads: “This is a legacy verified account. It may or may not be notable.”\n\nMusk has also said that Twitter, which has cut more than half its staff and lost many others to attrition, would “manually authenticate” all verified accounts before approving their check mark. The company will also temporarily remove check marks pending authentication if verified users change their account names. It’s unclear what that authentication process will involve, beyond verifying that users have a functional phone number. Crawford said in a tweet: “we don’t have ID verification in this update.”\n\nThe company says subscribers to the new Twitter Blue will also eventually have their tweets prioritized at the top of replies, mentions and search; see half the number of ads; and be able to post longer videos.\n\nMusk initially said the relaunch of the new system would take place at the end of November, but it was delayed several times over concerns about the safety of the feature.\n\nThe billionaire Twitter owner has promoted the ability to pay for verification as a way of leveling the playing field. But such an option also threatens to undermine the original purpose of verification — to help users know they can trust information being shared by prominent figures.\n\nIn attempting to use the paid verification option to boost its subscription revenue, Musk also risked further alienating many of the advertisers who still make up the vast majority of its sales. Within hours of launching the paid verification option last month, major brands including Nintendo of America and Eli Lilly had their accounts impersonated.\n\nThe additional gold and gray verification categories appear aimed at addressing some of those concerns, but it’s not clear what a requirement for individuals to pay to be verified would mean for trust in prominent individual users.\n\n“All verified individual humans will have same blue check, as boundary of what constitutes ‘notable’ is otherwise too subjective,” Musk tweeted last month. “Individuals can have secondary tiny logo showing they belong to an org if verified as such by that org.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/01/dog-eaten-alligator-st-marks-refuge/29554797/", "title": "Dog eaten by alligator at St. Marks Refuge - Tallahassee", "text": "Karl Etters\n\nDemocrat staff writer\n\nWhen an 8-foot alligator grabbed Mike Karris' 11-year-old dachshund, Cody, at the boat ramp in the St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge, he and his fiancee didn't think about their own safety for a second.

It was so fast,\" Karris said Tuesday. \"The whole thing, start to finish, didn't last 5 seconds and the dog wasn't on the ground for more than a minute.\"\n\nKarris and his fiancee returned to the ramp around 3 p.m. While they were preparing their boat to leave the park, they set the dog on the ground, unleashed.\n\nHe estimates the alligator came out of the pond, crossed 10 feet of grass and gravel and then onto the pavement where the boat was parked. The animal may be acclimated to humans given the brazen attack at the bustling ramp.\n\nHowever, Karris is not trying to shirk the responsibility to leash pets in the park.

It has become synonymous with the sport’s playing field. Just saying the word can conjure up the voice of John Facenda from NFL Films narrating highlights of the 1960s Green Bay Packers and the “frozen tundra” of Lambeau Field.\n\nThe word “gridiron,” as it relates to football, however, traces its origins decades before Vince Lombardi roamed a sideline in any stadium.\n\nSo, what’s the history behind football’s playing field?\n\nThe dimensions of a National Football League field have remained unchanged since the league's founding in 1920. The field measures 53 1/3 yards wide and 100 yards long between goal lines. It also includes a pair of end zones 10-yards deep.\n\nThere have been changes, however, to both the size of the field and markings on it since professional football's birth in 1892. When William \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, football’s first paid player, received $500 from the Allegheny Athletic Association, the length of the field was actually 110 yards long and included a 55-yard line. Also at that time, the end zones were essentially nonexistent. The goal line represented the end of the field.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1912 that the length of the field was changed to 360 feet (120 yards), while the width remained the same (53 1/3 yards). The field was 100 yards from goal line to goal line, with 10-yard end zones – the same size of a football field today.\n\nHow about the hash marks?\n\nThe hash mark is one of the most important lines on a football field. The marking determines ball placement throughout a game. There are two sets of hash marks (2 feet long and 4 inches wide) placed at 5-yard intervals exactly 70 feet and 9 inches at a parallel position from each sideline.\n\nIf a ball carrier is downed anywhere between the hash mark and its corresponding sideline, the ball is placed at that respective hash distance. If a ball carrier is downed in between the two hash marks, the ball is spotted exactly where the player was downed. That wasn’t the case before 1933.\n\nPrior to 1933, the hash mark didn’t exist. The ball was simply marked where the player was tackled down, and the next play began where the previous play ended. This resulted in some interesting offense if the runner went out of bounds or the play ended near the sideline. In that case, the offense had to adjust to an extremely unbalanced formation and run to the wide side. This gave defenses a distinct advantage.\n\nThe concept of placing the ball on a hash mark grew quick favor following the 1932 NFL playoff game between Chicago Bears and the Portsmouth Spartans (today the Detroit Lions). The game was moved indoors to Chicago Stadium due to extremely frigid and blizzard-like weather conditions.\n\nBecause a wooden wall separating the field from the spectators was practically on the sideline, a special rule was created for the game to bring the ball back in 15 yards if the offensive team desired. A quirk to this allowance was that the offensive team lost a down if the spot was moved.\n\nThe hashmark was written into the NFL's first rule book in 1933 at 10 yards from each sideline. Over the years the distance of the hashmarks has increased. In 1935, the distance grew to 15 yards. Ten years later, the hashes were moved again to 20 yards from the sideline. Finally, in 1972, the hashmarks were moved to where they remain today at 70 feet, 9 inches.\n\nBut how did the field come to be known as “the gridiron”?\n\nAttempting to “open up” the game and reduce its “brutality,” football rules were modified in 1906 to allow the forward pass. The new rule stipulated, however, that a forward pass could not cross the line of scrimmage within 5 yards of either side of the center. This was consistent with a 1903 rule stating that the first player to receive the ball from center also could not cross the line of scrimmage within that same space. If the ball carrier was the recipient of a handoff, lateral or backward pass, he could cross the line at any point. To assist game officials, the field was marked off in a 5-yard by 5-yard grid. Historians believe that the term “gridiron” was a result.\n\nJon Kendle is Director of Archives and Football Information at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Then Elon Musk ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA new verification mark intended to better identify prominent Twitter accounts has instead become the latest source of chaos at the company under new owner Elon Musk.\n\nJust hours after the feature’s debut, Musk abruptly said Wednesday he had “killed” a new, gray verification badge designed to label government accounts, major brands and media outlets, adding to the turmoil at one of the world’s most influential social media companies.\n\nThe new badge, which consisted of a gray check mark and the word “Official” placed underneath account handles belonging to Twitter, the United Nations and media outlets including CNN, was first introduced on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe feature was created to differentiate “select” identity-verified accounts from the blue check marks that Twitter has said it will soon offer to paying users for $8 per month, tweeted Esther Crawford, a director of product management at the company.\n\nThe new badge began rolling out early Wednesday morning. But by late morning, users began noticing that the badge had vanished.\n\n“I just killed it,” Musk tweeted in response to a tweet about the disappearances. Musk added: “Please note that Twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months. We will keep what works & change what doesn’t.”\n\nMinutes later, however, Crawford was forced to clarify what Musk meant.\n\n“The official label is still going out as part of the @TwitterBlue launch – we are just focusing on government and commercial entities to begin with,” Crawford tweeted. “What you saw him mention was the fact that we’re not focusing on giving individuals the ‘Official’ label right now.”\n\nDespite that, accounts including NASA, CNN and the UN had all been stripped of their “official” labels by Wednesday afternoon, fueling the confusion.\n\nThe real-time experiment highlights Musk’s improvisational management style, which he has applied liberally across the company in his initial weeks of ownership.\n\nIn recent days, Twitter and Musk have been met with widespread criticism over the company’s plan to change the meaning of the blue check mark away from identifying confirmed individuals, particularly public figures, toward a new meaning signifying that a user has paid for Twitter Blue, the company’s subscription service.\n\nElection security experts warned of the likelihood that bad actors could pay for a blue check mark, then change their display names to impersonate government officials or other authoritative sources of information.\n\nAfter appearing to ready the feature for rollout over the weekend, Twitter later decided to delay the deployment until after the midterms, CNN has previously reported. Also over the weekend, Musk vowed that accounts caught engaging in undisclosed impersonation would be permanently banned without warning, reversing earlier promises that so-called “permabans” would be extremely rare.\n\nTwitter said Tuesday evening that to resolve ambiguity about which accounts on its platform have been identity-verified — as opposed to those simply paying $8 a month for a blue check mark on their profiles — the company would introduce the gray check mark as part of an “official” label.\n\nAn earlier screenshot posted by Crawford showed how the new label would appear. The screenshot displayed Twitter’s own account profile, which included the standard blue check mark beside its display name as well as a gray check mark and the word “Official” underneath its account handle.\n\n“Not all previously verified accounts will get the ‘Official’ label and the label is not available for purchase,” Crawford tweeted on Tuesday. “Accounts that will receive it include government accounts, commercial companies, business partners, major media outlets, publishers and some public figures.”\n\nCrawford also confirmed that the forthcoming option to pay for a blue check mark will not include an identity verification requirement.\n\n“We’ll continue to experiment with ways to differentiate between account types,” Crawford said.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/industries/music/2015/11/02/spotify-snatches-john-marks-siriusxm/74870392/", "title": "Spotify snatches John Marks from SiriusXM - Nashville", "text": "Nate Rau\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee\n\nIn a move to bolster the streaming service’s country music presence, Spotify has signed John Marks away from SiriusXM.\n\nMarks will work as Spotify's global programming head for country music with the critical job of adding country artists to the service's popular playlists. During his tenure at Sirius, Marks earned a reputation for spotting talent and breaking young artists of all stripes. He was on the front end, for instance, of playing songs by Florida Georgia Line, Brandy Clark, Cole Swindell, Chase Rice and others.\n\nInitially confronted with a skeptical response from Music Row, Spotify has already made inroads in Nashville, thanks to country music label relations executive Copeland Isaacson. The streaming service has brokered deals to exclusively release new music and promoted emerging artists. Marks and Isaacson will work together to continue growing country music on the world's most popular streaming service.\n\n\"I think it’s doing great,\" Spotify vice president of content and distribution Steve Savoca said about how country music is faring on the service. \"And I think there’s a lot more headroom for it. Making a hire like John Marks speaks to our investment and interest in helping develop it.\"\n\nSiriusXM settles lawsuit over pre-1972 songs\n\nMarks said his new role will give him the opportunity to help spread country music on a worldwide basis. His primary job will be curating Spotify's various country music playlists.\n\nOn Spotify and other streaming services, listeners are increasingly relying on playlists to find new music. For a young artist, having a song placed on a popular Spotify playlist can help propel their career similar to a hot single on the radio.\n\n\"I'm just now getting my knowledge and awareness up to speed of the reach Spotify has around the world,\" Marks said in a telephone interview from the company's headquarters in Sweden. \"It's truly going to be an awesome opportunity, I trust, for me and also for country music.\"\n\nMarks said he enjoyed the job of helping break young artists by playing their music, often when they were still unsigned, on SiriusXM. For that reason, he said it was a tough choice to leave the satellite radio provider.\n\n\"Spotify came along, and I think we're going to have just as large an opportunity if not larger to continue to break new artists not only in the United States but perhaps give them a platform all around the world,\" Marks said.\n\nHow big data is changing the music game\n\nSpotify has had to work to catch on in country music circles. As recently as last year, Taylor Swift took down her mostly country music catalog off of Spotify and Jason Aldean followed suit shortly after.\n\nArtists and songwriters have complained about Spotify's royalty payouts and about the service's decision to not put new music behind its subscription paywall. Spotify costs $10 per month to subscribe, but users can listen for free with commercials.\n\nBut the service has also garnered exclusives and early releases from artists like Hunter Hayes. Savoca pointed to Sam Hunt as one of the future country stars that the streaming service supported early in his career.\n\n\"Spotify was one of our first partners to get behind Sam Hunt,\" Universal Music Group Nashville President Cindy Mabe said. \"That support helped Sam begin to build his fan base ahead of radio and national promotion. With Spotify’s exposure, Sam was able to grow his touring and raise his overall profile. Then, when we combined radio airplay with his growing Spotify fan base, Sam’s career just took off. To date, Sam Hunt has more than 275 million streams on Spotify and is the No. 2 country artist on the service.\"\n\nMarks has already started in his new role, he said.\n\nReach Nate Rau at 615-259-8094 and on Twitter @tnnaterau.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/things-to-do/2022/10/19/wings-and-claws-monarch-festival-back-stone-crabs-season/10530503002/", "title": "Monarch Butterfly Festival back, stone crabs in season in North Florida", "text": "Two North Florida favorites coincide once again this weekend.

And in Tallahassee, Southern Seafood's prices range from $26.50 a pound for the medium up to $49.50 for colossal.\n\nAccording to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the size of a stone crab claw is considered to be the length of the propodus, the larger, immovable part of the claw. Legal-sized (harvestable size) claws are 2 7/8 inches or greater in propodus length.\n\nMonarch Butterfly Festival takes flight at St. Marks Refuge\n\nThe St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge Monarch Butterfly Festival takes wing after a two-year pandemic hiatus.\n\nIn July, the monarch was added as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species, threatened by habitat destruction and climate change.\n\nCooler weather brings transport winds for migrating birds and butterflies and this week's cold front is well-timed for monarch sightings. The large orange and black monarch butterflies take advantage of these winds to head south to the Gulf coast and St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge on their migration to Mexico.\n\nThe Refuge will host its Monarch Festival from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday to showcase this amazing migration.\n\nVisitors to the festival will be able to able to witness the tagging of these delicate butterflies at the St. Marks Lighthouse, as well as enjoy exhibits and\n\ndemonstrations, learn about landscaping for butterflies and other pollinators, plus enjoy family-friendly crafts, music, and food near the visitor center. The Nature Store will also be open 10 a.m.-5 p.m.\n\nUnlike other animal migrations, each monarch butterfly is on its own. There is no parent to follow. Its annual journey is a complex, inherited behavior pattern, not a learned process.\n\nMigrating monarchs are usually those who hatch out in late summer. Monarchs have a 4-inch wingspan and weigh 1 gram (1/5 the weight of a penny). They travel with cold fronts, often at speeds of 10-30 mph, covering 80 miles a day. They may fly at 3,000 feet and higher and will “fall out” on the goldenrod and saltbush, blooming along the coast and feed for their long trip.\n\nThe regular entrance fee of $5 per car will be charged at the refuge. Please leave your pets at home.\n\nTo protect festival participants, Lighthouse Road will be closed just past the boat ramp parking lot entrance and visitors will be asked to park at the boat ramp parking lot and walk to the lighthouse.

It is customary before the event for the president to chat privately with the justices in a conference room and to sign the court’s oversized guest book.\n\nThe official told CNN that Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff will also be at the investiture.\n\nNo cameras are allowed inside the courtroom, and photographers usually wait outside for the new justice to emerge from the ceremony and take the traditional walk down the 36 marble steps at the front of the columned building. Per custom, Jackson will be accompanied by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nIn the court’s 233-year history, no African American woman has participated in this rite and gone on to decide the law of the land. Of the total 116 justices over time, all but eight have been White men. Jackson is the sixth woman on the bench; three of the others are still serving: Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nThe symbolic moment comes as Biden, who vowed during his 2020 campaign to appoint the first Black woman justice, continues to emphasize diversity in his judicial picks. He has nominated 143 federal judges, 68% of whom are women and 66% people of color. He has nominated 13 Black women as circuit court judges, with seven confirmed so far.\n\nJackson, 52, who previously sat on US district and appellate courts, took her official Supreme Court oaths at the end of June when Justice Stephen Breyer retired. Jackson has been voting on emergency cases and preparing for the upcoming 2022-23 session since then. She participated in Wednesday’s first closed-door session for the new term, as the nine culled through case petitions that had arrived over the summer and hashed out procedures for their building, opening to the public for the first time since it was closed in March 2020 because of Covid-19.\n\nThe special sitting of the court to receive the commission of a new justice was instituted in the early 1970s by then-Chief Justice Warren Burger, who reveled in the trappings of the institution.\n\nBurger also started the use of the Marshall chair, distinguished by a black horsehair seat and backrest, with brass nail trim. The new justice sits in the chair before being escorted to the bench to take the oath.\n\nFriday’s investiture, the first for a Democratic appointee in 12 years, is also likely to bring out, along with family and friends of Jackson, progressive luminaries of the law. Earlier such events for GOP appointees saw the Republican old guard hobnobbing in the courtroom before the event. An invitation-only reception will be held at the court afterward. Outside, crowds of well-wishers sometimes gather. Occasionally, it’s protesters.\n\nAs carefully arranged as these investitures are, they have not been without glitch. The attorney general usually stands at the lectern to present the commission, which has been previously signed by the president.\n\nIn November 2018, one day before the formal investiture for Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, for wholly unrelated reasons. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker then undertook the duty of referring the parchment commission to the court.\n\nAnother asterisk to the Kavanaugh ceremony: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s black leather chair at the bench was empty. She had fallen and fractured her ribs. When she was hospitalized for that injury, physicians discovered lung cancer, for which she had surgery that December. Ginsburg died in September 2020.\n\nThe courtroom audience for the investiture of her successor, Barrett, was scaled back because of pandemic precautions, and for that event, held in 2021, Kavanaugh’s chair was unoccupied. He had just tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nCurrent Attorney General Merrick Garland will be in place on Friday to ask Clerk Harris to read the parchment commission for the record. Garland at one time might have been at the elevated bench himself. Former President Barack Obama nominated Garland in 2016 to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia, but Senate Republicans blocked action on the nomination.\n\nBreyer is expected to be back in the courtroom for the special sitting. He will watch from one of the spectator seats close to the front of the room. Among the other judicial dignitaries expected are colleagues from the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, where Jackson sat from mid-2021 until her high court confirmation this year and the US District Court in DC where Jackson first wore the black robe, including Paul Friedman and Ellen Huvelle.\n\nOther close friends and mentors on her list are US District Court Judges Patti Saris, of Massachusetts, and Landya McCafferty, of New Hampshire, as well as US Appeals Court Judge Ray Lohier, of New York.\n\nThe new justice’s husband, Patrick Jackson, a surgeon, will be in the courtroom, along with their daughters Leila and Talia. Jackson grew up in the Miami area, and her parents who still live in Florida, Johnny and Ellery Brown, are scheduled to attend the ceremony.\n\nMaking history\n\nThe first justice to be seated, for investiture purposes, in the chair of Chief Justice Marshall (who served 1801-1835) was Lewis Powell in January 1972. He was immediately followed by William Rehnquist, sworn in on the same day as an associated justice. (Rehnquist became chief justice in 1986.)\n\nPowell was succeeding Hugo Black, and Rehnquist, John Marshall Harlan. (Both predecessor justices had been ailing when they left the bench in September 1971 and died soon after.)\n\nJudge Jackson in remarks: I am the dream of the slave 02:17 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Powell and Rehnquist appointments were the third and fourth of then-President Richard Nixon. According to The New York Times, a single picketer marched outside the investiture with a sign that said, “America mourns the death of an institution.”\n\nIt just so happens that Sandra Day O’Connor, a dear friend of Rehnquist from Arizona, was there that January 7, 1972, day. It was her first time in the courtroom. And within a decade, O’Connor, a lawyer, state senator and then state court judge, sat in the John Marshall chair. President Ronald Reagan appointed her in 1981, making O’Connor the nation’s first woman justice.\n\nNow Jackson will be the first African American woman to rule on high court cases. The nine justices will return to the courtroom on Monday for the beginning of the 2022-23 session.\n\nAlready on the calendar are disputes testing whether colleges and universities may continue to use students’ race as a factor in admissions for campus diversity and the breadth of Voting Rights Act protections against discriminatory electoral practices.\n\nAfter the commission is read, Roberts will administer the judicial oath, during which a new justice swears to “administer justice without respect to persons … do equal right to the poor and to the rich … faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon” an associate justice of the Supreme Court “under the Constitution and laws of the United States.”\n\nThe entire ceremony usually lasts only about five minutes.\n\nWhen Roberts and Jackson then stand out front, as photographers capture the scene, they will be joined, per the schedule, by Jackson’s husband.\n\nRarely is much said in this one moment in the public lens.\n\nBut back in 1981, when Burger descended the steps with O’Connor, the chief justice quipped to photographers, “You’ve never seen me with a better-looking justice, have you?”\n\nIf Burger’s remark put off O’Connor, the first woman justice didn’t let it show.", "authors": ["Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/29/shining-again-return-light-st-marks-lighthouse/3047321001/", "title": "St. Marks Lighthouse set to shine over Apalachee Bay after 20 years", "text": "It’s been 20 years since the beacon of the St. Marks Lighthouse shone over the waters of Apalachee Bay.\n\nThat all changes Saturday when a lamp behind a replica Fresnel lens is turned on, a move months in the making to now provide hope in a troubling time.\n\n“This has been a labor of love and passion not just for me but for all the volunteers working on the restoration and the community,” said St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge Ranger Robin Will.\n\n“You see the lighthouse as an icon all across Wakulla County and people need something positive right now.”\n\nThe replacement lens was purchased through a donation but it took approval from the U.S. Coast Guard to act as a private aid to navigation and to wait for annual bird migrations to dwindle before the light could be turned on, Will said. Paperwork started in October.\n\nThe light-emitting diode (LED) lamp will shine till Aug. 14 and stay dark until November to not disrupt migrating birds. Then, it will be on through the end of February.\n\nThe original lens, which was removed and displayed in the refuge’s visitor center in 2014, shone continuously from 1867-2000.\n\nThe lighthouse itself has undergone a complete renovation of the keeper’s quarters in recent years after water and termite damage.\n\nMore than 175 years of sitting on the edge of the Gulf of Mexico began to take a toll on the facility, built in 1842, three years before Florida became a state.

HSBC economist Chris Hare said the highest rise in core inflation for 31 years was fuelled by a spike in demand for live music events, package holidays and computer games – including the release of popular game “Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom”. Given the effect the game’s release may have had on inflation, the game is “rather aptly titled”, he added.\n\nBear breaks into house and steals pork chops\n\nA bear made quite a day of it when it broke into a US home and feasted on pork chops before dangling from a second-floor window, said ABC7.

Then it turned to Swedish meatballs ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIkea is known for sprawling showrooms, cheap flat-pack furniture and, of course, Swedish meatballs.\n\nThe retail giant sells more than a billion of its trademark Swedish meatballs at cafeterias in stores every year. The meatballs have become a symbol of Ikea’s friendly Scandinavian brand image and central to the retailer’s strategy of keeping customers browsing inside stores for hours — and getting them to pick up a new bed or couch after they finish eating.\n\nMeatballs are “the best sofa-seller,” Gerd Diewald, who led Ikea’s US food operations at the time, said in a 2017 interview.\n\nBut meatballs weren’t on the menu when Ikea opened its first in-store cafe in 1953 in Älmhult, Sweden. There was just coffee and cake. As Ikea grew, it started offering traditional Swedish dishes such as potato mash and sausage. Still no meatballs for a while, though.\n\nIkea sells more than 1 billion meatballs annually. Johannes Cleris/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIkea finally debuted its meatballs in 1985, following an overhaul of its menu and restaurant operations.\n\nBut the masterminds of Ikea’s meatballs never expected them to become a sensation.\n\n“I would never have imagined 40 years later people would be calling me about it,” said Sören Hullberg, who led Ikea’s food revamp at the time.\n\nIn fact, suppliers Ikea approached to produce its meatballs were skeptical of its plan, Hullberg said: “Why should a furniture dealer suddenly buy meatballs and send them across the world?”\n\nLanding on meatballs\n\nIkea turned to meatballs after it faced struggles selling food.\n\nCompany founder Ingvar Kamprad, who started Ikea as a mail-order company (Ikea’s name comes from his initials and the farm and village where he grew up in Sweden), felt that the company’s restaurants were a “mess,” Hullberg said. “He was not happy with the quality and the image.”\n\nAt the time, Ikea had around 50 stores worldwide. Kamprad worried that Ikea was losing customers who were getting hungry while they wandered around Ikea’s maze-like stores and leaving to grab a bite to eat.\n\nKamprad, who died in 2018, envisioned restaurants in stores as a place where customers could sit down, eat and plan how to decorate their living rooms with Ikea wares.\n\nHullberg, then an Ikea store manager, had gotten close to Kamprad and was tapped to create a new concept for all of Ikea’s restaurants — everything from kitchen lines to the menu to training staff. He and a team of four, including a chef recruited from a high-end restaurant in Stockholm, went to work on designing a restaurant that would be an extension of Ikea’s Swedish brand identity and thrifty reputation.\n\nThe meatballs were not Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad's idea. Ola Torkelsson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Our mission was to make sure that no one left an Ikea store because of being thirsty or hungry,” he said.\n\nAt the time, a typical Ikea store was serving up to 5,000 customers a day. To simplify operations and keep costs down, the menu would have to be limited. And since the menu would be similar at stores in different countries, Hullberg’s team looked for foods that were popular across different cultures.\n\nMeatballs, a mainstay of Swedish diets, fit the bill.\n\n“We were hooked on that one,” he said. “Even if it’s not really a Swedish innovation, meatballs exist in every culture you come to.”\n\nMeatballs were also efficient to freeze, transport and quickly prepare at Ikea’s kitchens.\n\nAlthough in Sweden “there are as many recipes of meatballs as there are people eating them,” Ikea needed to land on one recipe since it was outsourcing production. Making them in-house would have been too complicated for the volumes Ikea needed.\n\nIkea’s chef came up with a recipe that was two-thirds beef and one-third pork, but Kamprad, the founder, wanted the meatball to be primarily from pigs.\n\n“We won that battle because it was easier to export meatballs containing a majority of beef than pig,” Hullberg said.\n\nIn addition to meatballs, the new menu also featured Swedish staples such as salmon and roast beef, and smaller plates like salads and sandwiches.\n\nHullberg, 71, left Ikea in 1992. But he still shops there and stops by the restaurant to check out his brainchild.\n\n‘Iconic for IKEA’\n\nToday, Ikea has several meatballs — the original one, chicken, salmon, vegetarian and a newer plant-based meatball. They’re served with mashed potatoes, cream sauce, lingonberry jam and vegetables. Ikea also sells frozen meatballs customers can take home.\n\nThe meatballs survived a damaging recall in 2013 after traces of horse meat were found in a batch in Europe. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ikea shut down its restaurants and released the recipe for customers to cook them at home.\n\nThe cafeterias where meatballs are typically served are located near the middle of the store — not too close to the entrance or the exit.\n\nThere’s a strategy involved here, according Alison Jing Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management who studies consumer behavior and the impact hunger has on purchasing decisions.\n\nIkea doesn’t want to feed you right away, instead preferring that you work up an appetite while you shop and then visit the restaurant to take a break, Xu said.\n\nWhen you’re hungry, your mind is focused on acquiring food. This can spill over into acquiring other products, she said. Xu’s research has found that hungry mall shoppers spent 64% more money than shoppers who were already full.\n\nWhen Tiare Sol, an Ikea shopper in Sacramento, California, and her family visit the store, “almost everyone ends up ordering the meatballs.”\n\n“They’re delicious,” she said. “They have a plant-based one which is nice because I’ve been trying to cut down on eating meat and dairy.”\n\nFor Sol, eating Swedish meatballs at Ikea is part of the experience: “The meatballs are kind of iconic for Ikea. It’s just what you do.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/politics/liz-cheney-donald-trump-2022-election/index.html", "title": "Liz Cheney is already looking beyond 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nLiz Cheney didn’t come right out and say she expects to lose her primary next month. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday, it was pretty easy to read between the lines of the Wyoming Republican’s answers.\n\n“I am working hard here in Wyoming to earn every vote,” Cheney said at one point. “But I will also say this. I’m not going to lie. I’m not going to say things that aren’t true about the election. My opponents are doing that, certainly simply for the purpose of getting elected.\n\n“If I have to choose between maintaining a seat in the House of Representatives or protecting the constitutional republic and ensuring the American people know the truth about Donald Trump, I’m going to choose the Constitution and the truth every single day,” she said at another.\n\nAsked by Tapper whether her service as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6 will have been worth it even if she loses next month, Cheney responded that it was “the single most important thing I have ever done professionally.”\n\nIf it sounds to you like Cheney is framing her August 16 primary for Wyoming’s at-large House seat as a sort of fait accompli, and as not the end of the story but as a part of a broader narrative, well, then, you are right.\n\nThe simple fact is that Cheney is very unlikely to beat Harriet Hageman in next month’s primary. Hageman has the support of former President Donald Trump, as well as a number of top Republicans including, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWhile Cheney has tried to recruit Democrats to cross party lines and support her – and some undoubtedly will – it’s hard to see that making a real difference in the outcome of the race in such an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nSimply put: Cheney looks likely to lose – and she knows it.\n\nWhat she also knows is that, at least in her mind, this isn’t the end of her political career.\n\nHere’s how Cheney answered a question from Tapper on whether she is interested in running for president in 2024:\n\n“I haven’t really – at this point, I have not made a decision about 2024. …\n\n“… But I do think, as we look towards the next presidential election, as I said, I believe that our nation stands on the edge of an abyss. And I do believe that we all have to really think very seriously about the dangers we face and the threats we face. And we have to elect serious candidates.”\n\nWhich tells you everything you need to know about Cheney and 2024. She isn’t an announced candidate. But when you hear a politician talking about the country “standing on the edge of an abyss” and the need to elect “serious candidates,” well, it doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out what’s going on there.\n\nThe real question seems to be then not whether Cheney runs – she sounded to all the world like that decision is mostly made – but rather whether she would have any sort of impact on the 2024 race.\n\nIf Cheney runs as a Republican, it will, undoubtedly, be a very tough road for her.\n\nTrump is the clear frontrunner in all polling conducted on the Republican presidential primary and seems very likely to run. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is widely seen as the only serious alternative to Trump at the moment – and he has positioned himself as a representative of Trumpism without Trump.\n\nThere is no potential candidate garnering any serious support in hypothetical 2024 primary polls who is running expressly against Trump and his four years in office. The Republicans, aside from Cheney, who are signaling an interest in running that sort of campaign – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan being perhaps the most prominent – barely register in polls.\n\nCould Cheney somehow coalesce the anti-Trump vote within the Republican Party? Sure. But even if she was to do so, there’s scant evidence that bloc of voters comprise anything close to a majority of likely Republican primary voters.\n\nThe other – and perhaps more plausible – path for Cheney is to run as an independent in 2024. Assuming Trump is the Republican nominee, such a candidacy could skim off enough votes to potentially hamstring the former President’s chances of winning. (Presumably Cheney, who is conservative on most issues, would appeal more to Republicans than Democrats.)\n\nEven under that scenario, however, Cheney would function as a spoiler – trying to keep Trump from the White House – rather than as a viable candidate to be president. Which, given what she told Tapper Sunday, might be enough for her.\n\n“I’m fighting hard, no matter what happens on August 16, I’m going to wake up on August 17 and continue to fight hard to ensure Donald Trump is never anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again,” said Cheney.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/economy/retail-sales-july-inflation/index.html", "title": "US consumers continue to spend, but rising inflation has shifted their ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith lower gas prices effectively putting more money back in their pockets, Americans continued to spend last month. But persistent inflation has reshaped their shopping habits.\n\nIn July, US retail sales were flat compared to the previous month, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday. That marks a slowdown from June, when retail sales rose by a revised 0.8% over the month.\n\nSpending at gas stations fell by 1.8% month over month, reflecting the recent drop in gas prices, while spending at grocery stores rose 0.2% for the month.\n\n“[American shoppers] are clearly spending money on consumables and basics at the expense of some discretionary merchandise,” said Sarah Henry, portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management.\n\nConsumers have no choice but to buy essentials like groceries and gas, although they may switch to cheaper brands or change how frequently they buy, said Kayla Bruun, economic analyst at decision intelligence company Morning Consult. “It’s really those discretionary goods we’re seeing a lot of cutback on, particularly among those lower- and middle-income groups,” she said. Retail sales at department stores, for example, dropped in the month of July and were also lower on a year-over-year basis.\n\nEven wealthier Americans are being impacted by the highest inflation in 40 years: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Tuesday on the company’s investor call that higher prices were contributing to an influx of higher-income shoppers at the discount store.\n\n“We expect inflation to continue to influence the choices that families make,” McMillon said.\n\nHigher prices on food and gas impact lower-income households to a greater degree, because they must spend a larger share of their earnings for these necessary purchases, said Mike Rittler, head of retail card services at TD Bank.\n\n“It’s kind of a double whammy – you have less coming in, more going out. It really makes for challenging times,” he said, noting that the amount of debt people are carrying on their credit cards has been creeping up. The Federal Reserve said earlier this month that consumers added $40.1 billion worth of debt to their balance sheets in June.\n\nThe July data also showed that sales at home improvement stores rose by 1.5% over the month and by 10.1% from a year ago – as corroborated by recent earnings in this sector. Home Depot said Tuesday it had record sales in the most recent quarter, and that although the number of transactions ticked down by 3%, people spent about 9% more when they did make purchases. Lowe’s missed on expectations for same-store sales, but beat analyst estimates for earnings.\n\n“It speaks to the wealth effect of consumers who own homes,” Henry said.\n\nIncreasingly, experts worry that the divide between homeowners and renters is further driving economic inequality, as concerns grow that lower income households are losing more ground the longer inflation remains entrenched and prices for everything from groceries to rent keep rising.\n\nFor example, homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages are insulated from rising rents and are “not necessarily having to bear that burden of higher housing prices,” Bruun said, noting that lower-income adults are more likely to be renters, not homeowners.\n\n“There’s reasons to be optimistic, but also reasons to be concerned. Inflation still is really high, even if it’s slowing down,” Bruun said. “That’s a really long time for consumers to be living with these elevated prices.”", "authors": ["Martha C.

The lengthy delay contradicted widely taught protocol for active shooter situations that call for police to immediately stop the threat and came even as children inside repeatedly called 911 and begged for help.\n\nIn a hearing before the Texas Senate last month, DPS Director Col. Steven McCraw called the police response an “abject failure.” He placed sole blame for the failure on Arredondo, who officials have identified as the on-scene commander, saying he “decided to place the lives of officers before the lives of children.”\n\nBut Arredondo did not consider himself incident commander, according to a Texas House investigative committee’s preliminary report. “My approach and thought was responding as a police officer. And so I didn’t title myself,” Arredondo said in the investigative report.\n\nThe report instead placed blame more broadly, saying, “The entirety of law enforcement and its training, preparation, and response shares systemic responsibility for many missed opportunities.”\n\nIt also noted others could have assumed command.\n\nAdvanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training “teaches that any law enforcement officer can assume command, that somebody must assume command, and that an incident commander can transfer responsibility as an incident develops,” the report said. “That did not happen at Robb Elementary, and the lack of effective incident command is a major factor that caused other vital measures to be left undone.”\n\nIn the wake of sharp criticism, Uvalde school district Superintendent Hal Harrell placed Arredondo on leave from his position as school police chief on June 22.\n\n“Because of the lack of clarity that remains and the unknown timing of when I will receive the results of the investigations, I have made the decision to place Chief Arredondo on administrative leave effective on this date,” Harrell wrote in the announcement.\n\nArredondo, who has worked in law enforcement for nearly 30 years, has not spoken substantively to the public about his decision-making the day of the massacre, but he told the Texas Tribune in an interview he did not consider himself the on-scene commander.\n\nHowever, at least one of the responding officers expressed the belief that Arredondo was leading the law enforcement response inside the school, telling others, “the chief is in charge,” according to the DPS timeline.\n\nArredondo also told the Tribune he did not instruct officers to refrain from breaching the classrooms.\n\nSeparately, Arredondo resigned his position on the Uvalde City Council in early July, according to a resignation letter he sent to the city.\n\n“After much consideration, it is in the best interest of the community to step down as a member of the City Council for District 3 to minimize further distractions,” Arredondo said in the letter. “The Mayor, the City Council, and the City Staff must continue to move forward to unite our community, once again.”", "authors": ["Shimon Prokupecz Eric Levenson", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/us/safeway-shooting-bend-oregon/index.html", "title": "Bend, Oregon shooting: Victim fought to disarm gunman during ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne of the victims fought to disarm the suspected gunman during Sunday’s fatal shooting at a Safeway grocery store in Bend, Oregon, according to police spokeswoman Sheila Miller.\n\nTwo people were killed, police said. They were identified as Glenn Edward Bennett, 84, a customer who was shot in front of the store, and Safeway employee Donald Ray Surrett Jr., 66, who fought the shooter in the produce section, Miller said.\n\n“This is the Safeway employee who engaged with the shooter, which is to say he attempted to disarm the shooter and attacked this person, and we believe he prevented further deaths in addition to the quick police response,” Miller said. “Mr. Surrett acted heroically during this terrible incident.”\n\nGov. Kate Brown released a statement on Facebook Monday honoring Surrett.\n\n“While we are still gathering the facts about last night’s shooting, it’s clear that far more people could have been killed if not for the heroism of Donald Ray Surrett, Jr., who intervened to help stop the shooter, and the officers who entered while shots were still being fired,” Brown’s statement said. “In the face of senseless violence, they acted with selfless bravery. Their courage saved lives.”\n\nThe gunman – identified by police as Ethan Blair Miller, 20 – was found dead at the scene and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the police spokeswoman said.\n\nPolice found an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun close to Miller’s body, according to Bend Police Chief Mike Krantz.\n\nThe shooting unfolded shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday at a shopping center, Krantz said. Police initially received reports there may have been more than one shooter, Sheila Miller said, but there is no evidence of a second shooter. There were reports of at least two other people who had injuries that were not life threatening, as well, she said.\n\nThe motive remains unclear, but police are aware of online posts that might be relevant, Sheila Miller said.\n\n“We are aware that the shooter may have posted information online regarding his plan. We are investigating this. We have no evidence of previous threats or prior knowledge of the shooter. We received information about the shooter’s writings after the incident had taken place and the shooter has no criminal history in the area,” Miller said.\n\nSafeway said in a statement the company was saddened by the “senseless violence.”\n\n“Our thoughts and actions now are directed toward supporting our associates, customers, and the community affected by this tragedy. We thank the officers at the Bend Police Department for their response and will continue to support the department’s investigation over the coming days,” the company’s statement said.\n\nSunday’s shooting follows a spate of other grocery store shootings across the country in the past year and amid an overall surge in “active shooter” incidents, according to an FBI report.\n\nIn May, 10 people were killed in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack in Buffalo, New York. A “hero” security guard and a beloved teacher were among those gunned down.\n\nIn March, another 10 people were gunned down at a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. A veteran police officer with seven children was among those killed.\n\nLast September, a gunman shot 15 people – including one fatally – at a Kroger in Collierville, Tennessee. Some people hid in freezers to survive.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nMiller said police received multiple calls of shots fired around 7 p.m. at the Forum shopping center in northeast Bend.\n\nThe gunman entered from an apartment complex behind the shopping center, Miller said. He moved through the parking lot while firing rounds from an AR-15-style rifle before entering the Safeway.\n\nOnce inside, he shot a customer – Glenn Edward Bennett – who died while being taken to the hospital, Miller said.\n\nEmergency personnel respond to a shooting at the Forum shopping center in east Bend, Oregon, Sunday, August 28, 2022. Ryan Brennecke/The Bulletin/AP\n\nThe gunman continued to make his way through the store before having an altercation with and fatally shooting Donald Ray Surrett Jr., Miller said.\n\n“As our officers responded, they entered Safeway while shots were still being fired. They found the apparent shooter dead inside Safeway,” Miller said.\n\nAn AR-15 and shotgun were found near the gunman’s body, Miller said. Bend police did not fire any shots, she said.\n\nHow the gunman obtained firearms is under investigation. Because of online postings, Bend police also contacted the Oregon State Police Bomb Squad, who cleared the grocery store and the apartment complex, Miller said.\n\nPolice said it’s unclear how many people were in the store at the time of the shooting.\n\nOfficers were on scene within three minutes of the first 911 call, Miller said. It took four minutes from the time officers were dispatched to the time the shooter’s body was found, police said.\n\nPlans appeared to be posted online\n\nA search warrant was served on the gunman’s vehicle and home, Miller said. Investigators found three Molotov cocktails in his car along with a sawed-off shotgun. Police are working with the ATF to learn if the firearms were legal.\n\nIn his apartment, authorities found additional ammunition and digital devices that are currently being reviewed.\n\nCNN has identified several blog entries appearing to belong to Ethan Miller which were published on the blogging site “Wattpad” detailing a plan and reasons for the shooting. The posts were made public on the evening of August 28 by an anonymous account and viewable for 12 hours, according to Wattpad. The posts have since been removed.\n\nThe first blog entry was headlined June 29 and signed with the name Ethan. The writer of the post blamed Covid-19 and quarantine for worsening their mental health.\n\nInitially, this person planned a shooting inside a high school on September 8, according to the posts.\n\nMore than 35 posts were made by this same account on the blogging site. Most of the posts indicated a desire to commit violence.\n\nOne post referenced being “partially inspired” by the Columbine High School shooting.\n\nIn other posts signed with the name Ethan, several reasons were cited for the writer turning into a “ticking time bomb,” which included their family and their love life, which was detailed in a post headlined July 8.\n\nThe writer mentioned buying a shotgun and an AR-15 for the shooting, and said they hoped to kill over 40 people.\n\nThroughout the posts, other mass shootings were also referenced.\n\n“I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’”\n\nCustomers and employees described a chaotic scene at Safeway, saying they scrambled for safety as bullets flew.\n\nJosh Caba told CNN affiliate KTVZ he and his four children were shopping in the store when the shots broke out.\n\n“We started heading to the front. Then we heard I don’t know how many shots out front – six or seven. I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’ People were screaming. … it was a horrifying experience,” Caba told KTVZ.\n\nCaba said he was worried about his wife, who stayed in the car because she wasn’t feeling well. But as he and three of his children fled through exit doors by the produce department, he found that his wife had driven to the back of the store and was “sitting in the car, saying ‘Get in the car! Get in the car!’” KTVZ reported.\n\nThe father was able to rush back into the store and find their fourth child, he told KTVZ.\n\nAn employee who identified himself only as Robert told the Central Oregon Daily News that he and other employees were working a closing shift in the deli when they heard loud gunfire.\n\n“Me and three other employees ran into a walk-in refrigerator and closed the door and stayed there and stayed hidden until authorities arrived,” he said.\n\nA third person was struck and was in good condition at St. Charles Medical Center, spokesperson Lisa Goodman said.\n\nResidents in the central Oregon city were stunned by the shooting.\n\n“I heard anywhere from five to eight shots. I thought it sounded like backfire,” Heather Thompson, who lives across the street, told Central Oregon Daily News.\n\n“Less than a minute later, there were 10 to 20 shots, and then another 10 to 20 shots,” she said. “And by that time, I went inside and told my dad to get away from the window.

Much of the attention was on Nevada, where Republicans chose a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump’s lies about election fraud as their nominee to become the state’s top elections official. In South Carolina, voters delivered the vengeance that Trump had sought as they ousted Rep. Tom Rice, one of the 10 House Republicans who voted for Trump’s impeachment last year. But In a district near Rice’s, a one-time Trump critic, Rep. Nancy Mace, narrowly survived a challenge from a Trump-endorsed rival – displaying the difficulty of surviving in a GOP still dominated by the former President without embracing his grievances. A special election in Texas also resulted in a GOP win after Democrat Dan Sanchez conceded to Republican Mayra Flores in a contest for what had long been a Democratic-held House seat.\n\n2. Coronavirus\n\nAll eyes on are the Federal Reserve as it wraps up a two-day meeting on interest rates today. In a move to fight rampant inflation, the central bank is expected to increase its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point – the biggest single hike since 1994. This follows the Fed’s decision to raise rates by half a percentage point in May, the biggest increase in 22 years. So, what does this mean for consumers? Experts say every time the Fed raises rates, it becomes more expensive to borrow. That means higher interest costs for mortgages, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, student debt and car loans. Business loans will also get pricier.\n\nFact-checking Biden's claim that Putin shares blame for inflation 02:33 - Source: CNN\n\nAs Russian shelling and missile attacks continue to cause widespread destruction throughout his country, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that the work required to rebuild Ukraine should be a “common task” of the democratic world. Ukraine’s infrastructure losses amount to more than $100 billion, according to its prime minister. This comes as Ukraine’s military has warned that Russian forces are preparing for renewed assaults on cities in the Donetsk region still controlled by Kyiv after taking over Lysychansk – the final city to fall in the Luhansk region. Meanwhile, up to 60 million tons of grain could be stuck in Ukraine by the fall if Russia continues to block the country’s exports, Zelensky said.\n\n3. Mideast violence\n\nThe US expects more announcements of weapons and equipment packages to be sent to Ukraine to help in its fight against Russia at a meeting of nearly 50 countries in Brussels today, according to a senior US defense official. Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia is gaining ground in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, specifically in the city of Severodonetsk, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting. Without an influx of more weapons, some Ukrainian officials say it will be difficult to halt Russia’s progress or reclaim occupied ground in the region. This, however, could force a tough decision for Western governments, which have offered immense support to Ukraine at an increasing cost to their own economies and national stockpiles of weapons.\n\nSee Ukrainian troops try out US-supplied M4 rifles 02:42 - Source: CNN\n\nThe city of Akron, Ohio, remains on edge one week after the fatal police shooting of 25-year-old Jayland Walker. A news conference held by city officials one Sunday – along with the release of 13 police body camera videos – has started to paint a fuller picture of the shooting, which police say happened when Walker, who is Black, fled an attempted traffic stop on June 27. Walker was unarmed at the time he was killed, Akron Police Chief Stephen Mylett said. Authorities said Walker suffered at least 60 wounds in the fatal shooting. The Mayor of Akron declared a state of emergency and issued a curfew for Monday night through this morning in order to “preserve peace” in the community.\n\n4. Policing\n\n5.

According to the UK’s PA Media news agency, “all migrants have been removed from the plane and the flight to Rwanda will not take off as scheduled tonight.” Britain’s government had announced the deal with the east African country in April. Those people granted asylum would then be allowed to resettle in Rwanda. The government insisted the program was aimed at disrupting people-smuggling networks and deterring migrants from making the dangerous sea journey across the English Channel from France.\n\nUK government to start sending migrants to Rwanda.

However, the iconic landmark is instead being given a paint job costing 60 million euros in preparation for the 2024 Olympics, Reuters reports, according to a confidential analysis cited by French magazine Marianne. The Eiffel Tower, built by Gustave Eiffel in the late 19th century, is among the most visited tourist sites in the world, welcoming about six million visitors each year. “It is simple, if Gustave Eiffel visited the place he would have a heart attack,” one unnamed manager at the tower told Marianne. The company that oversees the tower is reluctant to close the tower for a long time because of the tourist revenue that would be lost, Marianne said.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nSee the spectacular finale of the DC fireworks show\n\nA Texas man fends off his giant aggressive bird with a very emusing tactic!

The state Democratic legislative caucus and the Black Legislative Caucus both said Monday they would boycott the ceremony. \"The current President does not represent the values that we would celebrate at the 400th anniversary of the oldest democratic body in the western world,\" the Virginia House Democrats said. The Black Legislative Caucus said Trump's participation is \"antithetical to the principles\" that the group stands for. Caucus members have instead planned alternative events Tuesday in Richmond. The decision comes at a time when Trump has heightened racial tensions with a series of tweets critical of black lawmakers in Washington.\n\nA$AP Rocky's trial starts in Sweden\n\nAmerican rapper A$AP Rocky's trial on assault charges began Tuesday in Sweden. The recording artist was arrested in early July while in Stockholm and is accused of pushing a man to the ground, kicking him and hitting him with a bottle. A lawyer for the rapper has said it was self-defense. The case found an audience with President Donald Trump, who tweeted his support for A$AP Rocky and demanded he be freed. Trump has even offered to pay Rocky's bail, although Sweden does not have a bail system.\n\nFed to begin meeting that will likely lead to rate cut\n\nThe Federal Reserve will begin a two-day meeting on Tuesday and it's expected to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point by Wednesday afternoon, a move President Donald Trump said \"will do very little by comparison\" to Europe and China. Trump has been jawboning the Fed to lower rates to juice the economy since last year, a strategy that has broken with a 25-year precedent of U.S. presidents refraining from criticism of the Fed to preserve its independence.Some economists don't believe the Fed should reduce rates at all with the economy growing at about a 2.6% annual rate in the first half of the year. But amid a slowing global economy, the U.S. trade war with China and stubbornly low inflation, the Fed has signaled that it will vote for an unusual \"insurance\" rate cut to head off a potential downturn.\n\nAmerica's illicit massage industry continues to thrive\n\nThe United Nations has labeled July 30 to be \"World Day against Trafficking in Persons.\" The U.N. notes that \"every country in the world is affected by human trafficking, whether as a country of origin, transit, or destination for victims.\" Going further, the U.N. states \"traffickers the world over continue to target women and girls,\" the vast majority for sexual exploitation. A study from the U.N.'s International Labour Organization reports there are at least 4 million victims of sex trafficking globally and 99% of them are women and girls. One of the most prolific is America's multibillion-dollar illicit massage industry. The State Department reports prosecutions of sex trafficking have fallen in the US.

Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy plans to introduce the bill during the next legislative session, The Anchorage Daily News reports. Tribes would be asked to enter into agreements with the state called compacts to operate the schools, education officials say. The state education department plans to hold a series of community meetings this month and in early 2020 to hear Alaska residents’ comments and questions, officials say. The schools would be open to all students and “offer a unique, culturally rich combination of Western and millennia-old tribal educational models,” the education department says.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: It’s taken 17 years, but the City Council has chosen a location and is moving forward with opening a Latino cultural center. The council voted Wednesday to build the center, which will support Latino arts and culture, in the north building of Margaret T. Hance Park downtown. But the years­long debate over the proper location continued during the meeting, with some suggesting the city find a spot more relevant to the Latino community. Councilman Carlos Garcia said the location did not meet the needs of the growing Latino community, which is expected to surpass 50% of the state’s population by 2020, according to a city-commissioned study. Councilwoman Thelda Williams stressed that the vote Wednesday marked the furthest the project has been able to get in 17 years and warned against further stalling.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the state attorney general’s request to prohibit a judge who demonstrated against the death penalty from handling any cases involving her office. In a 4-3 decision, justices rejected the request by Attorney General Leslie Rutledge to remove the cases from Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen’s court. The court did not elaborate on the reason for its decision. Griffen was prohibited from handling execution cases in 2017 after he participated in an anti-death penalty demonstration the same day he blocked the state from using a lethal injection drug. Rutledge asked in September that the order on execution cases be expanded to include all civil cases involving her office. She accused Griffen of regularly yelling at attorneys from her office when they appeared in his court. Griffen has denied any claims of bias.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The governor on Wednesday blamed the Trump administration for withholding data needed to release $650 million in state aid to combat homelessness. California’s cities and counties have been waiting since June for the money approved by the Legislature. But state law says the money can only be distributed based on federally approved homelessness counts for 2019. Most California communities submitted their homeless counts months ago. But the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has not yet approved them. Gov. Gavin Newsom called the delay “politicized roadblocks put up by the Trump administration.” Instead of waiting, Newsom said his administration has collected preliminary homeless data from California communities. Based on those numbers, Newsom said the state will open applications involving as much as $500 million of the money.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: State transportation officials unveiled plans Wednesday for a bus system that will shuttle skiers and snowboarders from Denver to three resorts in an effort to ease traffic congestion exacerbated by a recent population boom. Gov. Jared Polis said during a ceremony at Denver’s Union Station that the “Snowstang” service, which begins Dec. 14, will be “really convenient” and “super easy.” “We know that by providing more alternatives for people to go in buses or other ways of getting there, we can also have an impact on reducing traffic during peak times,” he said, standing across the street from three 51-seat buses equipped with restrooms, power outlets, Wi-Fi and luggage racks. The Colorado Department of Transportation will run the service to Loveland Ski Area, Arapahoe Basin and Steamboat on Saturdays and Sundays throughout winter, as well as the Martin Luther King Jr. and Presidents Day holidays.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Over a dozen people gathered Wednesday in front of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in the city to protest the nearly 2-year-long detention of a Connecticut immigrant marked for deportation. Mayor Luke Bronin joined the wife of Bakhodir Madjitov and others to support the Uzbek immigrant and father of three children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. “I’m living in pain with broke bones since my third child was born; I can neither work nor live peacefully,” his wife, Madina Madjitov, said at the rally. “I don’t think I can provide normal life without my husband for my children.” Diana Blank, one of the man’s lawyers, said he was granted in November two temporary emergency stays of removal by federal courts. He originally had a final order of removal of no later than Dec. 2. It’s unclear now how soon he could be deported.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A bear has caused an uproar after running through the streets of the First State’s biggest city. Police spent part of Thursday morning trying to catch the animal while bystanders rushed to get a look. Some residents were told to shelter in place. But by 11:15 a.m., police said the bear had left their jurisdiction. It’s unclear where the animal went, but it caused widespread excitement in a city and a state that rarely see bears. During the morning, the bear was seen in a backyard and in an alley. People later spotted it on railroad tracks behind a grocery store and then moving toward a park. Wilmington police said they had planned to tranquilize the bear. But they also warned that they might have to shoot it if the animal came to close to people. The sighting in Wilmington comes after drivers reported seeing a bear crossing major highways earlier in the week.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new D.C. Council proposal looks to create equity among parent teacher organizations in the district, WUSA-TV reports. Councilmember David Grosso has introduced a bill that would create an equity fund to benefit PTOs in the D.C. public school district. The bill’s language dictates that after a PTO expends more than $10,000 in a school year, it will be charged an “equity fee” of 10 cents for every additional dollar it spends. The monies collected from those fees will then go toward the equity fund, which would then be equally distributed to other PTOs in the district. PTOs often raise funds on the behalf of schools to finance field trips and extracurricular activities. According to Grosso’s office, last year 75% of D.C. elementary schools did not report having any PTO revenue.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: It took artist Leandro Erlich two years and 330 tons of sand to create his largest work of art to date – a giant traffic jam, made entirely of sand. Erlich was commissioned by the city of Miami Beach to create the work, which was unveiled during Art Basel. The surreal traffic jam depicts 66 life-sized sculptures of cars and trucks stuck in an imaginary traffic jam on the oceanfront of popular Lincoln Road. The installation is meant to suggest a future relic, like a contemporary Pompeii, and alludes to Miami’s fragile position in the large universal canvas, touching on climate crisis and rising sea levels. The installation cost over a million dollars, but the city paid $300,000 thanks to sponsors and donations. It will remain on display until Dec. 15.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Some Georgia State University students are demanding that the mayor remove a prominent downtown statue of a 19th century newspaper editor who called for maintaining white supremacy in the South. Henry Grady advocated for a “New South” after the Civil War. A plaque on the statue, erected in 1891, describes him as a patriot. But Grady also campaigned against equality for freed slaves, saying that “the supremacy of the white race of the South must be maintained forever.” “Let us be clear in recognizing that Grady, as a journalist, promoted racism,” several student groups wrote in an editorial Tuesday in Georgia State’s student newspaper. “Grady, as an orator, promoted racism. And Grady was certainly no patriot – he was simply a racist.” They want the statue relocated to the Atlanta History Center, but if Georgia law won’t allow that, they’ll accept a new marker explaining Grady’s beliefs.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State health officials have investigated dozens of adult residential care homes in the state after receiving reports that the facilities were operating without licenses. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports that the state Department of Health has received 114 complaints about unlicensed homes, and 74 remain open. Officials say state legislators passed a law last year authorizing the department to investigate and enter unlicensed care homes amid plans to crack down on these facilities. State officials say they have entered and inspected 52 homes so far with plans to issue 13 notices of violation to illegal operators. Officials say some residents of these homes have lost thousands of dollars because health insurers do not cover unlicensed facilities. Department officials say there likely are not enough licensed facilities for residents.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state is the least-regulated in the nation, Gov. Brad Little said Wednesday. The Republican said he’s cut or simplified 75% of Idaho’s administrative rules this year and leapfrogged ahead of South Dakota as the least-regulated state. State officials said they base the state’s least-regulated status on information collected by George Mason University. Little said he’s eliminated more than 30,000 restrictions and some 1,800 pages of regulations. Little had sweeping authority to eliminate thousands of rules after state lawmakers fought over the administrative rules process and failed to renew them before adjourning in April. Little said the cuts to regulations will help the economy. “Folks, when you reduce friction on entrepreneurs, good-paying jobs will follow,” the governor declared.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Hundreds of artifacts belonging to Abraham Lincoln and his family will remain in the state’s hands with the refinancing of a loan used to buy them. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum Foundation says it has refinanced the 2007 loan it used to purchase 1,500 items from collector Louise Taper. The foundation voted last year to seek an auction house to prepare selling some of the items in the collection, which includes a stovepipe hat purportedly belonging to Lincoln, if it couldn’t pay off the $9.2 million remaining on the loan by this fall when the note came due. But the foundation says it negotiated a three-year extension with Lake Forest Bank and Trust at a lower interest rate. In addition to the hat whose authenticity has been challenged, the collection includes the bloodied gloves Lincoln wore to the theater the night he was shot.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University President Mitch Daniels apologized Wednesday for recent remarks in which he described an African American scholar as “one of the rarest creatures in America.” “I retract and apologize for a figure of speech I used in a recent impromptu dialogue with students,” Daniels wrote in a letter sent to the Purdue chapter of the NAACP, Purdue’s Black Caucus of Faculty and Staff, the Black Student Union and other groups. “The word in question was ill chosen and imprecise and, in retrospect, too capable of being misunderstood. I accept accountability for the poor judgment involved.” Daniels made the comment Nov. 20 after a meeting with Purdue Student Government leaders when students asked Daniels to follow up on his thoughts about what Purdue was doing to promote diversity on campus and to make underrepresented minority students feel welcome.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A man convicted of delivering meth two decades ago should have been added to the state’s database of felons banned from voting, but an embarrassing clerical error instead listed the police force that busted him. The inclusion of the Des Moines Police Department among the names of murderers, drug dealers and other disenfranchised criminals is just one glaring example of the mistakes, wrongful additions and omissions that make the 103,000-entry database unreliable, a review by the Associated Press found. “Holy cow!” Des Moines police spokesman Sgt. Paul Parizek said as he was alerted to the error. “You would think there would be an audit with something as important as voting.” The database, which is part of the state’s 14-year-old voter registration system, helps determine a person’s eligibility to cast a ballot, run for public office or serve as a public official.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Death typically brings two options – burial or cremation – but a third option could be on the horizon in the state. The Kansas City Star reports that something called promession, the creation of a Swedish biologist, would allow the body to be cryogenically frozen and vibrated into tiny pieces. Proponents say it holds the potential to make burial more environmentally friendly. Promession has been used on pigs but so far has not been tried on humans. Still, the company pursuing the idea sees Kansas as fertile ground for the new method. That company, Promessa, has one of its few U.S. representatives based in Overland Park. Meanwhile, a state lawmaker may introduce a bill in 2020 to clear the way for the new method.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Abbey of Gethsemani has been added to the Kentucky Natural Areas Registry. The Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves said in a statement that it was recognizing the abbey’s historic stewardship of more than 1,500 acres of land in Nelson County. The voluntary designation is designed to recognize stewardship and awareness of the ecological significance of a property, state officials say. Landowners don’t relinquish any rights but agree to protect the area as best they can. Abbot Elias Dietz said he looks forward to collaborating with state officials to preserve and enhance natural areas such as grasslands and glades. Properties on the registry must have habitat for plants or animals that are rare or have a declining population, or they must contain an outstanding example of a Kentucky ecological community, such as an old-growth forest, wetland, glade or prairie.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: A parish commission has approved funding to remove a Confederate monument during a special budget meeting. The Caddo Parish Commission allocated $500,000 to remove the 30-foot-tall marble and granite Confederate monument in downtown Shreveport that was erected in 1905 on the north side of the Caddo Courthouse lawn. Although the commission has the funding to remove the statue, there’s still a legal battle brewing between the parish and the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The organization filed a temporary restraining order against the parish and the commission, halting the removal of the statue, and during Tuesday’s meeting continued speaking out in opposition of the statue’s removal. A judge ruled Nov. 29 that neither the parish nor the commission could move the statue, for now. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 13.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s independent U.S. senator says blueberry growers need help from the federal government to survive the Trump administration’s trade battle with China. Sen. Angus King says the value of Maine’s wild blueberry exports to China is on pace to drop by nearly 97% since 2017. Maine is America’s producer of wild blueberries, which are smaller than cultivated blueberries and are widely used in frozen and processed products. King says it’s unfair that Maine wild blueberry growers haven’t been included in President Donald Trump’s farm bailout programs. He says the blueberries are “an iconic Maine agricultural product” that has “lost a piece of its future.” The Maine wild blueberry industry is facing other difficulties outside the trade dispute with China. Prices for the fruit have been much lower than they were earlier this decade. The size of the harvest last year was also the lowest in more than a decade.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Four chambers of commerce in the state are endorsing a plan to build a $10 billion high-speed maglev train between Baltimore and Washington. The chambers of commerce for the city of Baltimore, Baltimore County, northern Anne Arundel County and Prince George’s County voiced support for the first phase of the project Wednesday. The high-speed train would help economic development and local business opportunities, the groups say. It could connect the two cities in 15 minutes along a 36-mile route. The project is currently under review by federal, state and local agencies, as well as the Federal Railroad Administration. The four chambers of commerce serve more than 1,500 member organizations, representing cities, agencies and businesses throughout portions of central Maryland.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A proposed ballot question that would overhaul the state’s electoral system has cleared another hurdle on the way to next year’s ballot. The group Voter Choice for Massachusetts is pushing what is called a ranked-choice voting system. On Wednesday, the group said it has submitted more than enough voter signatures to move the question along. Under the proposed system, voters have the option of ranking candidates on the ballot in order of their preference. If a candidate garners a majority of first-place votes, that candidate wins. If no candidate receives a majority of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Voters who ranked the eliminated candidate as their first choice will have their vote count instantly toward their second choice. The process repeats until one candidate receives a majority of the vote and wins.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state is opening its surplus store for a one-day sale Saturday. The shelves will be stocked with goods from police, airports and colleges, and property no longer needed by state government. The goods include computers, phones, knives, sporting goods, desks, chairs and even fashion accessories. The store in Lansing will be open from 8 a.m. to noon. Cash and credit cards will be accepted. More information is available online. Online shoppers can bid 24 hours a day at Michigan.gov/MiBid.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State budget officials projected a $1.332 billion surplus in the current two-year budget period Thursday, setting up contentious debates for the 2020 legislative session on whether to save the extra money or spend it, possibly to cover tax cuts. Budget Commissioner Myron Frans credited the surplus to a better-than-expected finish to the last budget period, a rosier revenue forecast and a modest decrease in estimated spending. He said the extra revenue will also boost the state’s separate budget reserve – a cushion against economic downturns – to $2.359 billion. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and Democratic legislative leaders joined Frans in urging a cautious approach to using the money, given that the forecast predicts slower economic growth over the next four years and doesn’t account for inflation in program costs. But they agreed the forecast shows the state can afford to pass a sizable public works borrowing package.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: William Carey University is waiving tuition for a professional development course in an effort to combat the state’s teacher shortage. The university said in a statement that the course can be used to renew a Mississippi Educator License. It begins in January and lasts five weeks, news outlets report. The class will be taught online, Dr. Teresa Poole told WHLT-TV. Poole says anyone can apply, but preference will be given to practicing teachers and those who have licenses that are about to expire. There is a $85 application fee. The deadline to apply is Jan. 8, and the course begins the following Monday.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The University of Missouri has received a $500,000 grant that will help it restart a law clinic dedicated to investigating possible cases of wrongful conviction. KMIZ reports the grant from the Department of Justice’s National Institute of Justice will fund the MU Innocence Clinic. The money will pay for DNA tests on evidence involved in cases where eyewitnesses may have misidentified a suspect. Law professor Rodney Uphoff says the school will partner with the Midwest Innocence Project, a law firm that specializes in exonerating inmates who may actually be innocent. Students in the clinic will review cases of the firm’s clients to interview witnesses in the case and identify possible pieces of evidence for testing. Eight students will work in the clinic during the 2020 spring semester.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: National park officials have announced plans for the selective slaughter of between 600 and 900 Yellowstone bison this winter to help manage population numbers. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports the officials expect most of the animals to be taken by hunters or shipped to slaughter. Some would stay alive in corrals or under park quarantine. Officials say the exact number of bison expected to be culled out of the estimated 4,900 depends on the winter migration. State, federal and tribal agencies managing bison say the winter plan was finalized Tuesday under the Interagency Bison Management Plan, a day after a judge rejected an attempt to block bison hunts this year. Officials say the plan includes putting 110 bison into brucellosis quarantine to produce disease-free bison.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Madonna Rehabilitation Hospitals is planning a $57 million expansion on its Lincoln campus and expects to begin construction in the spring. The project is a planned three-story, 112,000-square-foot patient wing that will also add 59 new rooms to replace ones that were built in the early 1970s, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. Madonna currently has 120 patient rooms, about half of which were upgraded and modernized in 2000. Hospital officials said at a news conference Wednesday that the new rooms will be bigger and more modern than current ones, allowing patients to be more independent and providing more room for staff and families. Construction will develop in phases and is expected to be completed by January 2023.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state’s two public universities saw significant spikes from 2017 to 2018 in reports of sexual violence, according to annual data going to the Nevada System of Higher Education board. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the tally says rape, fondling, stalking, and domestic and dating violence went up at the University of Nevada, Reno and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Police chiefs from both campuses attributed the numbers to an increase in reporting by students. “We’ve gone too long with people not feeling comfortable with reporting,” said Todd Renwick, police director at UNR, Truckee Meadows Community College, Western Nevada College and the Desert Research Institute in Reno. He said an Office on Violence Against Women grant was used to hire an in-house coordinator to field sexual assault cases, help victims file police reports and Title IX complaints, and connect with outside resources.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is taking steps to salvage federal money for schools that provide mental health counseling, speech therapy and other services to students, Gov. Chris Sununu and other state officials said Wednesday. The Medicaid to Schools program allows schools to be reimbursed by the federal government for services provided to Medicaid-eligible students. While it once applied only to special education students, the state expanded the program in 2017, and it now covers thousands of students from virtually every district. The program is in jeopardy, however, because under new federal guidance issued in July, those providing the services must be licensed by a medical board, not just credentialed by the state Department of Education. To address that issue, Sununu signed an executive order Wednesday to temporarily speed up the licensing process, and bipartisan legislation is being drafted to create a permanent change.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The Ocean Casino resort has hired a female CEO, one of a small handful of women leading casinos or casino companies nationwide. Terry Glebocki was named CEO this week after serving in the job in an interim capacity since August. She has more than 30 years of financial management experience and recently served as the casino’s chief financial officer. Glebocki previously worked for Tropicana Entertainment and Trump Entertainment Resorts. Ocean is the only one of Atlantic City’s nine casinos to be led by a woman. Glebocki says maintaining profitability and increasing revenue are her top goals. She also says she reads every social media post she can find from customers about the casino.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. Commerce Department is awarding the city a $1.2 million grant to help with redevelopment of its historic rail yards. Commerce Department officials were joined by Mayor Tim Keller and others in announcing the funding Wednesday. They say the award is expected to create more than 300 jobs and generate $9 million in private investment. The federal grant will be matched by local funds. Efforts to revitalize the rail yards began more than a decade ago with the creation of a special advisory board, and the city adopted a master plan for the 27-acre site in 2014. One portion is now used for a popular weekend market that features local vendors.Aside from attracting new retail, office and hospitality businesses, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says the grant could lead to expansion of Albuquerque’s film industry.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: One of the brightest signs of the holiday season has come to light. The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree was officially turned on Wednesday night, at an event featuring celebrities including Idina Menzel, Lea Michele and Ne-Yo among the performers. The tree, a Norway spruce that’s more than 60 years old, stands 77 feet tall and was lit up in colorful Christmas lights before 10 p.m. It was on the property of Carol Schultz in the village of Florida, New York, and was cut down last month. The tree was decorated with miles of lights, with a huge Swarovski crystal star at the top. It stays in place until Jan. 17, when it will be taken down and donated to Habitat for Humanity to help build homes. There’s been a tree in Rockefeller Center at Christmastime since 1931. The holiday lighting has been broadcast since 1951.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWake Forest: A second town in the state has canceled its Christmas parade over concerns about possible protests of a float celebrating the Confederacy. Leaders in Wake Forest had said last week that the town’s parade would go on and include the Sons & Daughters of the Confederacy despite a planned demonstration. That decision changed once police learned that the number of expected protesters had grown from 10 to 200 people, Police Chief Jeff Leonard says. The entire parade has now been canceled for safety reasons. This would have been the 72nd year of the parade, news outlets report. “We aren’t happy telling kids they can’t attend or participate in this year’s parade – but it’s better than trying to explain to a parent whose child was injured despite so many warning signs,” the chief said. The town of Garner also canceled its Christmas parade this year over fears that a float sponsored by the Sons of Confederate Veterans would be “targeted for disruption.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Burleigh County will hold a special meeting next week to take comments on whether it should resettle additional refugees. County commissioners postponed action on the matter at a meeting Monday after an overflow crowd showed up to address the issue. A recent executive order by President Donald Trump stated that new efforts to resettle refugees would have to receive permission from state and local governments. Gov. Doug Burgum announced last month that the state would continue to receive refugees as long as local governments agreed. The public will be able to voice opinions next Monday on whether to allow Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota to continue resettling refugees in the county. Commissioners could vote on the matter at the special meeting Monday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The governor wants lawmakers to drop bills that would prohibit local governments from forbidding the use of plastic bags. Gov. Mike DeWine opposes a pair of bills offered by fellow Republicans that would forbid municipalities and counties from banning single-use plastic bags by groceries and other stores. Some local governments, including Cuyahoga County and the Columbus suburb of Bexley, are trying to regulate the use of plastic bags in an effort to reduce litter and plastic waste in landfills. Some lawmakers and business groups say the local bans make it harder for grocers and other businesses to operate. DeWine said Wednesday that it would be a mistake for state lawmakers to override local government decisions. State government should allow allow local communities to do “what they think is best,” the governor said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The State Department of Health has asked for less money in its proposed budget. Oklahoma Commissioner of Health Gary Cox asked legislators this week to decrease his agency’s funding by 1.5%. The Oklahoman reports the current state budget allocates $60.8 million to the department. Cox says he needs $56.2 million for fiscal 2021. Cox says he aims to minimize administrative costs and maximize services. He says he will eliminate unnecessary jobs and combine employee duties. He also notes that he plans to add nurses and other positions to work at local health departments. Lawmakers grilled Cox during Monday’s budget hearing, saying his proposal is confusing and counterintuitive because the public needs the funds. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Cox in September to lead the department.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Conservationists have successfully bred the extremely rare, federally threatened Oregon silverspot butterfly in captivity, a potential breakthrough for saving a species that once was found in coastal regions from California to British Columbia but is now reduced to five isolated populations, the Oregon Zoo says. The captive breeding resulted in 269 silverspot caterpillars that will be released into the wild once they transform into butterflies. “This is a really exciting breakthrough,” says Tia Perry, a keeper in the butterfly conservation lab. Perry says wild silverspots lay their eggs in the Oregon Zoo lab each year, but this is the first time a female butterfly bred in captivity. At the request of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the zoo’s lab held back 22 pupae from this year’s butterfly release, and one of the resulting female butterflies mated in captivity with a wild male.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Owners of alligators and other dangerous reptiles will be required to register their pets with the city under an ordinance approved this week. The ordinance requires owners of alligators, crocodiles and venomous snakes to store and transport their pets in escape-proof containers. The owners must also provide the city with a list of each reptile they own. Rooms and buildings housing the animals also must be posted with notice that they contain reptiles. City Councilwoman Darlene Harris, who sponsored the bill, said regulations are needed, particularly after a number of loose alligators appeared in the city in recent months. At least four alligators were captured from May to October in the city and surrounding municipalities, The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports. First-time violators could face a $300 fine per reptile. Repeat offenders could be assessed a fine of $10,000 per reptile.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: The University of Rhode Island’s College of Business has received the largest gift in the institution’s history, school officials announced Wednesday. Former Hasbro Inc. Chairman and CEO Alfred J. Verrecchia made a donation of $15 million with his wife, Gloria, to his alma mater to create a scholarship for students, a fund for students seeking competitive internships, a faculty chair and professorship, and an emerging technology fund. The gift will offer support to students who have secured internships but do not have the financial backing to pursue them. The faculty position will focus on artificial intelligence and business analytics. The technology fund is intended to provide the tools students will need to prepare them for their careers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A recently discovered letter that could implicate a former Greenville County sheriff and his team in the 1975 murder of a deputy and his father is missing. Greenville police found the letter in a stack of documents while cleaning out storage lockers at the Law Enforcement Center in April 2018 and subsequently lost it, according to a statement the department sent Thursday. The letter appeared to be addressed to late Sheriff Cash Williams from one of his mistresses and indicated he was involved in the murder of Frank and Rufus Looper, as well as framing the man ultimately convicted in the slayings, Police Chief Ken Miller told the Greenville Public Safety Review Board during a July meeting. In a statement sent Thursday, the Greenville Police Department said it has been unable to find the evidence after searching investigator work stations, case files, and storage areas.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem’s husband has reached another milestone in his role as first gentleman, albeit a very small one. Bryon Noem has been memorialized in the First Spouse Doll Case, where dolls are displayed with the attire that the spouse – and, in one instance, sister – of every South Dakota governor wore at their inauguration. The dolls date all the way back to one showing the dress worn by Margaret Wylie, the wife of South Dakota’s first governor, Arthur Mellette. Every doll is displayed in a series of cases in the South Dakota State Capitol. Bryon Noem’s doll is the first one not to be wearing a dress, instead sporting a miniature tuxedo and bow tie. It is also the only doll with a head, which Sandy Rhoden, who spearheaded the project, said had no special meaning.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennesseans are invited to visit the governor’s mansion this holiday season for self-guided tours. This year’s decorations are themed “Songs of the Season,” with each tree decorated to represent a different classic Christmas carol. Visitors may also bring donations to benefit several nonprofits from around the state. “Bill and I consider it a great privilege to be celebrating our first Christmas at the Tennessee Residence,” first lady Maria Lee said in a news release. “We are delighted to open the doors of Tennessee’s home and share in the joys of the season with our fellow Tennesseans.” The free holiday tours begin Friday. Reservations are required. More information about the tours and suggested donations for charity can be found online.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The number of children adopted from the state’s foster care has reached a four-year high, and just over half of the kids were adopted by family members, according to data released Wednesday by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. “This is certainly great news and affirmation that our year-round adoption efforts are paying off,” said Kristene Blackstone, an associate commissioner for Child Protective Services, an arm of DFPS. All told, more than 20,000 children left Texas foster care during the 12-month period that ended Sept. 1. However, only 6,107 found permanent homes through the adoption process. Of those, 3,095 were placed with family members. Both numbers are all-time highs, officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A massive open-pit copper mine in the Oquirrh Mountains southwest of the city will remain open through 2032 after the owners announced a new $1.5 billion investment. Rio Tinto announced Tuesday that it will invest $1.5 billion in the Bingham Canyon Mine due to increasing demand for copper in electric vehicles and renewable power technologies. Closures of other mines have also affected supply and made the investment make sense, Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a news release. The investment will extend the mine’s operations an additional six years beyond the previously anticipated shutdown in 2026. A 2013 landslide at the mine that carried enough rock, dirt and debris to bury New York’s Central Park under 66 feet of rubble set back production and triggered layoffs. The mine still employees 1,900 people.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders has announced his annual State of the Union essay contest for the state’s high school students. It’s the tenth annual contest in which students describe a major issue facing the country and how to address it. The contest coincides with the president’s annual State of the Union speech to the joint session of Congress each January. Students must submit their 250-500 word essays by Jan. 8. A volunteer panel of Vermont teachers will judge the essays. The 10 finalists’ essays will be entered into the Congressional Record. Finalists also will be invited to be interviewed about the topic they covered. “We need our students to help find solutions for the problems that face our country as they are our future leaders,” Sanders says.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A commission assigned to research racist laws from the state’s past recommended Thursday that dozens of them be repealed, including measures that resisted desegregation, prevented black voters from casting ballots and prohibited interracial marriage. While most of the measures are outdated and “have no legal effect,” they are still enshrined in law, the nine-member commission of attorneys, judges, scholars and community leaders wrote in an interim report. Although “some of these acts were rendered null and void by an amended Virginia Constitution, by landmark civil rights cases or legislation, it’s clear that they are vestiges of Virginia’s segregationist past that still sit on the books,” Chief Deputy Attorney General Cynthia Hudson, who chairs the commission, said at a news conference in Richmond. “We should not afford them the distinction of that official status.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a voter-approved $30 car tab measure will remain on hold while a legal fight over the initiative’s constitutionality plays out. The Washington State Attorney General’s Office filed an emergency motion Monday saying Washington voters’ wishes were being “stymied” by a King County Superior Court judge’s decision to stop Initiative 976 from taking effect. On Tuesday, initiative sponsor Tim Eyman and his allies filed their own request to vacate the lower court’s injunction and move the case to the state Supreme Court. That was dismissed by the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Voters last month approved I-976, the statewide measure that calls for lowering many vehicle registration fees to $30, rolling back car-tab taxes that fund Sound Transit and doing away with local car-tab fees. Much of the measure had been set to take effect Thursday.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: After a photo surfaced of state correction officer trainees giving what appears to be the Nazi salute, state officials quickly suspended some employees, and the governor ordered the firing of those involved. The image, showing a more than two dozen trainees with their arms raised and faces blurred, was released Thursday by the West Virginia Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety. Before the photo was made public, the agency’s secretary, Jeff Sandy, released a memo describing the image of Basic Training Class Number 18 as “distasteful, hurtful, disturbing, highly insensitive, and completely inappropriate.” He wrote that the picture “betrays the professionalism I have seen time and time again displayed and practiced by our brave correctional employees.” Sandy’s memo ordered all copies of the picture destroyed or taken out of circulation to prevent them from spreading.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWausau: Workers will install a Christmas tree outside Pine Grove Cemetery’s Grand Avenue gate, a symbol of hope and resilience as the cemetery and the community contend with deep grief. The tree honors Patty Grimm, the cemetery’s general manager, who was shot and killed there Oct. 3. But cemetery leaders hope the tree can be used to help everyone in the community cope with loss during the holidays. Two others were wounded at the scene. Rosemelia Short, who is related to an employee at the cemetery, was hospitalized, treated and released shortly after the incident. William Buhse, who oversaw the cemetery’s work crew, was seriously wounded and is now undergoing long-term rehabilitation, says Pat Haskin, who is volunteering to help manage the cemetery until a new manager is hired to replace Grimm.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The U.S. Department of Energy has announced plans to partner with the University of Wyoming for further research on how to trap carbon dioxide before it leaks into the atmosphere. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the federal agency and university researchers plan to study the economics and technology behind carbon capturing at two of the state’s coal-fired power plants. Officials say research would begin at the Dave Johnston power plant in Glenrock and the Naughton power plant in Kemmerer. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon says he has remained committed to the state’s coal assets, as it produces about 40% of the nation’s coal despite declining demand nationwide and increasing interest in renewables and natural gas. Gordon says he encouraged the Legislature in January to support advancements in post-combustion carbon dioxide reduction technologies.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/06"}]}

What we loved so much about Warnie was his showmanship, his charisma, his tactics, the way he willed himself and the team around him to will teams around him to win games for Australia, and above all else his incredible skills as a leg-spinner.\n\n“There’s so many guys in this team and squad who still hold him as a hero … all-time favorite player. The game was never the same after Warnie emerged and the game will never be the same after his passing.\n\n“Rest in peace, King.”\n\nWarne celebrates with his teammates after taking the wicket Sachin Tendulkar in 1999. Jack Atley/ALLSPORT/Getty Images\n\nBall of the century\n\nWarne wasn’t just a bowler capable of dominating matches almost single handedly, he was also an entertainer, happy to engage in banter with England fans and often the subject of tabloid headlines.\n\nIf his first year as an international player gave a few indications that he was destined for success, a single ball he bowled in Manchester in 1993 completely changed perceptions about the bowler.\n\nJust a year after making his international debut in 1992, Warne was playing in his first Ashes series in England.\n\nAdorned with his short, bright blonde hair and wielding his now famous right-arm bowling action, Warne produced a bamboozling delivery in what has been dubbed the “ball of the century.”\n\nThe delivery looked to be heading past England batter Mike Gatting’s leg stump. Then it bounced on the pitch, spun dramatically and missed Gatting’s bat before astonishingly hitting the off-stump.\n\nLike many others, Gatting looked astounded that such an initially harmless-looking delivery had cost him his wicket – former England player Graham Gooch said: “He looked as though someone had just nicked his lunch.”\n\nWarne bowling during the Third Ashes test match against England at Old Trafford cricket ground on July 4, 1997. Tom Jenkins/Getty Images\n\nWarne’s ability to flight and spin the ball to such devastating effect helped revive leg-spin from a forgotten art into a key component in modern day cricket.\n\n“The highlight of my cricketing career was to keep wicket to Warnie,” Adam Gilchrist, Australia’s legendary wicketkeeper and Warne’s longtime teammate, wrote on Twitter.\n\n“Best seat in the house to watch the maestro at work. Have often felt a tad selfish, that Heals and I pretty much exclusively are the only ones who had that thrill and pleasure at Test level. Rip Warnie.\n\nOther cricket greats were quick to pay tribute to Warne’s remarkable talent.\n\n“Shocked, stunned & miserable,” wrote Indian Sachin Tendulkar – widely considered one of the best batters of all time.\n\n“There was never a dull moment with you around, on or off the field. Will always treasure our on field duels & off field banter. You always had a special place for India & Indians had a special place for you.\n\n“Gone too young!”\n\nFormer India international batter Virender Sehwag said on Twitter: “One of the greatest spinners, the man who made spin cool, superstar Shane Warne is no more.\n\n“Life is very fragile, but this is very difficult to fathom. My heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and fans all around the world.”\n\n‘I am shocked to the core’\n\nDuring his career which spanned over 20 years, Warne won numerous trophies and accolades.\n\nIn Australia’s victorious World Cup team in 1999, Warne collected the man of the match award in the final. He was named one of Wisden’s five best players of the 20th century, as well as being selected in an all-time Test World XI by Wisden to commemorate 150 years of the cricketers’ almanack.\n\nAway from international cricket, Warne also played a pivotal role in making the Indian Premier League (IPL) the behemoth it is today.\n\nIn 2008, he led the Rajasthan Royals to the inaugural IPL title, something he believes gave the tournament “credibility because the underdog came good.”\n\n“To then go and win it in the style we did, that put the IPL on the map. Any underdog story like that – you look at Leicester City, what they did. It’s a pretty amazing story,” Warne told CNN in 2019, referring to the soccer underdog’s remarkable Premier League title triumph in 2016.\n\n“I was very lucky to play in an era of Australian cricket where we were super successful. We beat every team home and away, won World Cups, Ashes series, so we had some huge results.\n\n“To be part of all of that with the Aussies and do those things was great but the IPL, it was completely different.”\n\nWarne poses for photos after speaking to the media during a Melbourne Stars Twenty20 Big Bash League announcement on November 8, 2011. Robert Prezioso/Getty Images\n\nWarne played his entire domestic cricket career in Australia with his native Victoria, but had stints with Hampshire in England.\n\n“Absolutely shocked and gutted to hear about Shane Warne, wrote former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara. “Legend and friend. Just can’t believe it.”\n\nFormer West Indies batter Vivian Richards also said on Twitter: “Unbelievable. I am shocked to the core. This can’t be true… Rest In Peace, Shane Warne. There are no words to describe what I feel right now. A huge loss for cricket.”", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}]}

It’s right that the individual concerned has stepped down.”\n\nKensington Palace denounced the incident, saying the remarks were “unacceptable” and that it was “right that the individual concerned has stepped aside with immediate effect.”\n\nIt’s the couple’s first visit to the US since their trip to New York eight years ago. The pair also previously embarked on a whirlwind California tour a few months after their wedding in 2011.\n\nThe trip is a chance for William to showcase how he intends to adapt to his new Prince of Wales role from his predecessor, while Catherine will hope to charm the public – as her new title’s former holder effortlessly did – but on her own terms.\n\nWilliam founded his climate change prize back in 2020 in the hope of harnessing the world’s smartest minds to confront some of the most pressing environmental challenges facing humanity. Each year for the next decade, five winners will receive £1 million (around $1.12 million) to fund their creative solutions to the climate crisis.\n\nThe heir to the British throne was inspired to launch the project by President John F. Kennedy’s “moonshot” speech in 1962 when he tasked the US to push forward with space exploration.\n\nHundreds gathered at Speaker’s Corner outside City Hall despite pouring rain and biting temperatures to get a glimpse of the royal couple. The crowd screamed and cheered as the pair walked outside with city officials.\n\nRoyal watchers await the arrival of William and Kate at City Hall Plaza. Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTaking the podium, Prince William told well-wishers he and wife, Catherine were “absolutely delighted to be with you today, for our first engagement in the great city of Boston, as we start the countdown to The Earthshot Prize Awards this Friday.”\n\nThe 40-year-old royal said Boston was “the obvious choice” for this year’s ceremony as the former president’s hometown and “because your universities, research centers and vibrant start-up scene make you a global leader in science, innovation and boundless ambition.\n\n“Like President Kennedy, Catherine and I firmly believe that we all have it in ourselves to achieve great things, and that human beings have the ability to lead, innovate and problem-solve,” William continued.\n\n“We cannot wait to celebrate the Earthshot Prize finalists later on this week, and we are both looking forward to spending the next few days learning about the innovative ways the people of Massachusetts are tackling climate change,” he added.\n\nThe couple were then joined by Mayor Michelle Wu and Massachusetts Governor-elect Maura Healey to help formally start the city’s Earthshot celebrations, and with the push of a button lit the civic building and other landmarks in green.\n\nAhead of the lighting ceremony, the senior royals had an audience with Mayor Wu inside City Hall. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nTheir busy schedule on Wednesday saw them attend a Boston Celtics game against Miami Heat in downtown Boston. They were seated courtside for the game alongside Healey.\n\nResetting royal perceptions\n\nWhile William and Kate’s stateside trip is not an official royal tour, the senior royals aren’t simply parachuting in for a glittering ceremony on Friday night. Instead, they have a jam-packed three-day visit during which they will turn their spotlight onto initiatives in some of Boston’s most hard-pressed communities and meet with local indigenous leaders.\n\nA Kensington Palace spokesperson told CNN the couple were eager for more time in Boston so they could get to know communities and learn about the climate-related challenges facing the coastal city.\n\nBefore the fresh racism row emerged, the couple’s trip had also being seen by some as an opportunity to reset perceptions in the US after a damaging few years. New seasons of Netflix show “The Crown” have revived old criticisms of the monarchy, while the Duke and Duchess of Sussexes’ 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey tarnished the family’s reputation.\n\nThey claimed family members had made racist remarks and the institution had abandoned Meghan when she admitted contemplating suicide while pregnant with their first child, Archie. William subsequently defended the monarchy, stating, “we’re very much not a racist family.”\n\nMayor of Boston Michelle Wu; Governor-elect Maura Healey; Prince William; Catherine, Princess of Wales; Emilia Fazzalari and her husband Celtics owner Wyc Grousebeck watch the Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat play on November 30, 2022.

The Sussexes were recently named as recipients of the 2022 Ripple of Hope award by the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization (RFKHR). They join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky among others being honored this year.\n\nAnnouncing the accolade last month, RFKHR President Kerry Kennedy said the couple “has always stood out for their willingness to speak up and change the narrative on racial justice and mental health around the world.”\n\n“They embody the type of moral courage that my father once called the ‘one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world that yields most painfully to change.’”\n\nThere are no plans for the brothers and their spouses to catch up while in the same country. Their priority is Earthshot and they are savvy enough to know a family gathering would overshadow their objectives.\n\nInstead, the senior royals will be hoping to focus the public’s attention on the causes they champion and the work they do during their stay in the US.\n\n“The prize has become the prince’s Superbowl moment of the year, and he looks forward to continuing to use the platform each year to shine a light on some of the most impactful projects doing amazing things around the world to save our planet’s future,” a Kensington Palace spokesperson said.\n\nOne meeting that is on the cards is a catch-up with the US President Joe Biden, who will greet the pair while visiting Boston for a fundraiser on Friday, according to the White House.\n\nStar-studded prize ceremony\n\nThe visit to the US culminates in the star-studded Earthshot ceremony grand finale on Friday, which will unite innovation with entertainment.\n\nSingers Annie Lennox, Billie Eilish and Ellie Goulding will perform, and the five winners will be announced by presenters that include Oscar winner Rami Malek, actress Shailene Woodley and Catherine O’Hara of “Schitt’s Creek” fame.\n\nBritish broadcaster Clara Amfo will return to co-host the awards with actor Daniel Dae Kim. British veteran broadcaster, naturalist and all-round national treasure David Attenborough is also set to feature in the glittering extravaganza.\n\nThe awards will be broadcast in the UK on Sunday on BBC at 5:30 p.m. GMT.

Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nThe Earthshot Prize, an ambitious initiative founded by Prince William to help tackle some of the planet’s most pressing environmental challenges, has unveiled its 15 finalists for the 2022 edition.\n\nThey include Mukuru Clean Stoves from Kenya, which are said to create 70% less pollution than traditional stoves by using a fuel consisting of charcoal, wood and sugarcane, and Fleather from India, a sustainable alternative to plastic, made from floral waste.\n\nThe five winners will be selected from the shortlist at a glitzy ceremony in Boston on December 2, with each receiving a prize of £1 million (about $1.12 million). The organizers say that by 2030 at least 50 ideas aimed at resolving environmental problems will have been funded by the project, which they describe as “the world’s most prestigious environmental prize.” The initiative is funded by global organizations and philanthropic donations.\n\n“We feel a great sense of urgency and we see great optimism and that’s because at the Earthshot Prize, we scour the planet and the ocean for solutions that if scaled could help to repair the planet,” Hannah Jones, CEO of the Earthshot Prize, told CNN.\n\n“Every day, we are given solutions that we see inspiration in, being driven by determined people from around the world who want to make a difference.”\n\nCharlot Magayi is the founder of 2022 finalist Mukuru Clean Stoves. Earthshot Prize\n\nInspired by US President John F. Kennedy’s call to do “not what is easy but what is hard,” which prefaced the 1969 moon landing, the Earthshot Prize aims to support “seemingly impossible” environmental schemes.\n\nThe new Prince of Wales is well aware of how royal support can help generate interest in a subject or cause but the initiatives that he and wife Catherine have established over the years, such as the Earthshot Prize, have been designed with longevity and long-term impact in mind. William doesn’t just want to be a presence at engagements to bring media coverage with him but to encourage lasting transformation in communities.\n\n“The innovators, leaders, and visionaries that make up our 2022 Earthshot Finalists prove there are many reasons to be optimistic about the future of our planet,” William said in a statement. “They are directing their time, energy, and talent towards bold solutions with the power to not only solve our planet’s greatest environmental challenges, but to create healthier, more prosperous, and more sustainable communities for generations to come.”\n\nThe competition is based around five “Earthshots” or environmental goals: “Protect and Restore Nature,” “Clean Our Air,” “Revive Our Oceans,” “Build a Waste Free World,” and “Fix Our Climate.” Three finalists are attached to each Earthshot, with one winner per category.\n\nAmong the hopefuls is UK company Low Carbon Material, whose submission is known as OSTO and could reduce carbon emissions from the construction industry. Made from a mixture of waste material from landfills and by-products, it’s an environmentally friendly alternative to aggregate, one of concrete’s main ingredients.\n\nScott Bush and Natasha Boulding of Low Carbon Materials, a UK-based company which is another of the 2022 finalists. Earthshot Prize\n\n“It just offers us complete validation of what we’re doing on a massive global platform,” the company’s CEO, Natasha Boulding, told CNN. On the Earthshot Prize, she said: “I think it’s put the climate crisis on the biggest platform that it possibly could and I think it really highlights the urgent need for solutions. And that can really inspire younger generations to do something similar because there’s so many solutions that are yet to be materialized.”\n\nAlso making the shortlist are Hutan, a grassroots wildlife research and conservation organization working toward a peaceful coexistence between nature and people in Malaysia; the Ampd Enertainer, an electric battery energy storage system that powers construction sites without fossil fuels; Roam, a Kenya-based company that makes electric vehicles in Africa, designed for the African market; the Great Bubble Barrier, a device that can be placed on a riverbed to create a curtain of bubbles that trap plastic waste for easier collection; and Oman-based 44.01, a company named after the molecular weight of carbon dioxide, which removes CO2 from the air by permanently mineralizing it into peridotite, a type of rock very common in Oman but found throughout the world.\n\nThe finalists will be judged by the Earthshot Prize Council, which includes naturalist and documentary maker David Attenborough, actor Cate Blanchett and Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan, as well as Prince William himself.\n\nPrince William is seen on stage during the first Earthshot Prize awards ceremony at Alexandra Palace in London last October. Yui Mok/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe winners will be announced on December 2 at the MGM Music Hall in Boston and we’ll be sure to bring you there with us in a future edition of this newsletter.\n\nSharing his enthusiasm ahead of the event, William added: “I am so excited to celebrate these 15 Finalists and see the five winners of The Earthshot Prize announced in Boston – the hometown of President John F. Kennedy, who shared The Earthshot Prize’s belief that seemingly impossible goals are within reach, if we only harness the limitless power of innovation, human ingenuity, and urgent optimism.”\n\nHead here to learn more about the finalists or check out Call to Earth, CNN’s initiative to help drive awareness, action and education around key issues, while inspiring a blueprint for a more environmentally conscious life.\n\nDON’T MISS\n\nThen-Prince Charles speaks at an event on the sidelines of COP26 last November in Glasgow, Scotland. WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nThis week saw new UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak U-turn on his decision to skip the upcoming UN COP27 climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. His attendance had been ruled out the week before with Downing Street citing “other pressing commitments.” Soon after, many wondered if King Charles might also change his mind.\n\nWe asked the palace, who reiterated that there were no changes to the King’s diary. “As has been made clear previously, in unanimous agreement with Government, His Majesty will not be attending COP27,” a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said.\n\nInstead, they pointed to a pre-COP reception the King is throwing at Buckingham Palace on Friday “where senior business leaders, experts and NGOs can discuss the important work of the summit and explore ways in which public-private partnership can help tackle climate change.”\n\nThe spokesperson added: “His Majesty looks forward to hosting the Prime Minister and other global leaders at the event.”\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nThe family hail British sporting heroes.\n\nAthletes who won bronze, silver and gold at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, as well as the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, were warmly welcomed to Buckingham Palace on Wednesday. More than 200 medallists attended the event, held by the King and Queen Consort, where the royal family helped celebrate their success. Team GB has triumphed at a cluster of recent tournaments, coming fourth in the overall rankings for the Tokyo Olympics and second in the Paralympics.\n\nVolleyball player Emma Higgs, canoeist Robert Oliver and diver Tom Daley were among those congratulated by the King. Kin Cheung/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nKate reaches out to those struggling with addiction.\n\nThe Princess of Wales shared a touching message of support over the weekend, urging those battling addiction to ask for help as attitudes around dependence shift. The royal spoke in a video to mark Addiction Awareness Week, organized by The Forward Trust, which was one of her first patronages in 2012. The charity said this year’s campaign was especially urgent due to the increased demand for help arising from lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Addiction is a serious mental health condition that can happen to anyone,” Kate said in the video. “The only way to help those suffering is to try to understand what has led them to addiction. To empathize with them, and to be compassionate to their struggles.” She added: “Please know that addiction is not a choice… Recovery is possible.”\n\nKing Charles sends condolences to South Korean President.\n\nThe King expressed his condolences to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol following the Halloween crowd crush that killed 156 people in Itaewon, Seoul, on Saturday. “I wanted you to know how deeply shocked and saddened both my wife and I are to hear of the many people who have lost their loved ones as a consequence of the recent, tragic incident,” Charles wrote. “However inadequate this may be under such heartbreaking circumstances, we extend our deepest possible sympathy to all the bereaved families.” The King recalled the President’s “gracious” visit to London to attend Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral, and assured him that “the United Kingdom stands in solidarity with the people of the Republic of Korea at such a time of national mourning.”\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nKing Charles is seen at a Buckingham Palace reception marking 50 years since thousands of Ugandan Asians were resettled in Britain after being forced out by former Ugandan President Idi Amin. Isabel Infantes/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nLast week, journalist and author Sathnam Sanghera told us about his feelings at seeing King Charles III with the UK’s first prime minister of color. Sanghera praised the monarch’s “long history of interfaith, interracial community relations” when he was prince and shared his hope that Charles would continue to use his role as King to “bring people together.”\n\nProof that this is in fact what King Charles III intends to do was evident this week when he hosted a reception at Buckingham Palace to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the resettlement of British Asians from Uganda in the UK. In 1972, some 60,000 Ugandan Asians were forced to leave the country by former Ugandan President Idi Amin amid widespread anti-Asian prejudice. Almost half of these people arrived in Britain. Thousands of volunteers worked to house, clothe, feed and teach English to the refugees.\n\nThe King mingled with refugees and volunteers who reunited at the event, which was presented by British broadcasting grandees Jon Snow and Jonathan Dimbleby. Back in 1997 on the 25th anniversary of the resettlement, a thanksgiving service was held at Westminster Abbey. Attendees received a letter from Charles, then the Prince of Wales, which contained these touching words: “You are today commemorating not an expulsion but an arrival; not a trauma, but a magnificent recovery. Twenty-five years on, the Ugandan Asian Community in Britain have proved to be one of our great successes and a tremendous asset to this country to which you fled.”\n\nIN THE ROYAL DIARY\n\nKate tries her hand at rugby at Twickenham, the national rugby union stadium in London. Kate Green/Getty Images\n\nIt’s going to be a sporting Saturday for Kate who will head to the quarterfinal of the Rugby League World Cup where England face Papua New Guinea at the DW Stadium in Wigan, northwest England. The Princess of Wales is patron of English Rugby. England is hosting the 2021 tournament, which was meant to be held last year but was postponed due to the pandemic. The host nation have made a strong start to the tournament, and will face a resilient Papua New Guinea side that recently beat Wales 36-0. Simon Johnson, chair of the Rugby Football League, said in a tweet the sport is “Delighted and honored to welcome the Princess of Wales for the first time as Patron,” adding “her presence will enhance a special occasion for our sport… and for the famous rugby league town of Wigan.”\n\n“It is vital that we do everything in our power to halt the frightening decline in species that our planet has witnessed over the last 50 years.” William, Prince of Wales.\n\nThe Prince of Wales spoke at the 10th Tusk Conservation Awards, where he is a patron, in a ceremony held at Hampton Court Palace on Tuesday. The awards celebrate African-based conservation leaders and wildlife rangers in the continent that is – in the words of previous Tusk award winner David Attenborough – “on the frontline of conservation.” Four winners were chosen this year for work in Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique and Zambia.

But no one yet knows what kind of monarch King Charles III – the title he has taken, ending years of speculation – will become.\n\nAs CNN’s royal correspondent, I’ve reported on Britain’s new King for many years and traveled around the world with him.\n\nOne of the best insights I had was when I was invited with a group of other journalists to Dumfries House, his stately home near Glasgow in Scotland, in 2018 ahead of his 70th birthday. I spent two days there and was given unusual access to Charles and many of those closest to him. I was treated to tours of the estate, high tea, dinners and a spectacular bagpiping performance beside a roaring open fire.\n\nThis is the place that brings it all together for the new King, all his greatest passions and causes – from music to rare breeds protection, apprenticeships for disadvantaged youth and organic farming. The whole estate is buzzing with activity, and I could see what a thrill it gave him to walk around and ask questions of his staff.\n\nEvery Friday night, wherever he is in the world, Charles is sent a hefty report updating him on the estate’s work and he has it back to them first thing Saturday morning with notes. His wife Camilla will tell you he’s up late every night reading, writing and responding to requests for support and advice.\n\nWhere many of his predecessors saw his former role of Prince of Wales as a ticket to a playboy lifestyle and a guaranteed income, Charles professionalized it and made it his own. He wanted a legacy, but he didn’t want to wait until he was King. In my experience, he’s impatient and driven, and gets incredibly frustrated if one of his projects isn’t working or bearing fruit.\n\n“The signs were there from young adulthood,” Kenneth Dunsmuir told me during the visit to Dumfries House. Dunsmuir runs The Prince’s Foundation, an educational charity set up by Charles to help teach traditional arts and skills. “His concerns about social issues in the community and ecological issues were all there and all that’s happened is that he has got more and more involved and has had the time to do that.”\n\nDumfries House is Charles' stately home near Glasgow in Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nDunsmuir’s comment points to the other reason Charles achieved so much during his tenure: he was the longest-serving Prince of Wales ever due to the longevity of his mother’s reign. Dunsmuir thinks of Dumfries House, he said, as a “fantastic physical legacy to that work that will always be here and always remain.”\n\nCharles has often struggled to contain his passion for his work, expressing his hopes and fears during speeches over the years and often sounding more like a campaigner than a constitutional monarch-in-waiting. That prompted accusations that he was threatening the independence and impartiality of the monarchy. Take climate change, on which he has been speaking out since 1968. It’s since become a mainstream issue and, for some, a political one. Charles was a prominent backer of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord and discussed the subject with Donald Trump over tea in December 2019, as the then-president prepared to pull the United States out of the pact.\n\nCharles, the Prince of Wales, poses for an official portrait in November 2008.

Whitby/Getty Images In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next The following month, at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Charles gave a powerful speech, asking: “Do we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink in time to restore the balance when we could have done? I don’t want to.” I sat down with Charles for an interview that day and he insisted the Paris Accord was still achievable. “We can’t go on like this, with every month another record in temperatures being broken. If we leave it too long, and we have done, just growing things is going to become difficult,” he said. Despite criticism – and at times ridicule – over his fight to be the royals’ ecowarrior, Charles has continued to be a pioneer in green issues in recent years.

It’s made him a more divisive figure than his mother, who barely cracked an expression during her reign, let alone expressed an opinion.

I’m not that stupid.” In all the conversations I have had with members of the family and their aides, there has never been talk of the more popular Prince William leapfrogging his father to the throne either. Charles has spent his whole life preparing to be sovereign and has proved beyond doubt that he isn’t work-shy. William has never been in a rush to take the crown meanwhile, preferring to build his royal portfolio steadily whilst focusing on his young family and developing his own set of interests and causes. Charles and William came together personally and professionally when Prince Harry dispensed with his royal duties in 2020, leaving the remaining senior royals a much more compact group. The relationship between the new King and his heir will now be key to the future stability of the monarchy, as will the dynamic between the new King and his wife. I’ve seen what a tower of support Camilla has always been to Charles. I’ve seen how fractious and frustrated he can become when he faces an obstacle in his work, and she has a unique talent for dissipating any tension with a sense of humor and charisma that doesn’t come across on camera.

Within five years, she would be Queen – and she’d go on to be the longest serving monarch in British history.\n\nThe speech was given in Cape Town on April 21, 1947 during a tour of South Africa – when it was still a British colony – and it speaks to several key themes of her reign.\n\nFirstly, Elizabeth II dedicated herself to lifelong service. This explains why she never abdicated, even as many of her younger contemporaries did. Between February 2013 and June 19, 2014, four European monarchs stepped down: Pope Benedict XVI of Vatican City; Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands; King Albert II of Belgium; and King Juan Carlos I of Spain.\n\nElizabeth, a devout Christian who rarely missed a Sunday at church, resisted the exodus because of the promise she made not just to her subjects but to God. There’s a clue to that at the end of her 21st birthday speech: “I shall not have strength to carry out this resolution alone unless you join in it with me, as I now invite you to do: I know that your support will be unfailingly given. God help me to make good my vow, and God bless all of you who are willing to share in it.”\n\nEven when her husband, Prince Philip, retired in 2017, Elizabeth continued public engagements and brought in other members of the family to accompany her as needed. Just days after Philip’s death in 2021, she resumed official duties with the appointment of new ambassadors to the UK.\n\nRetaining an international footprint\n\nSecondly, in that 1947 speech, she devoted herself to the “great imperial family,” by which she meant the British empire. The UK was losing world dominance at the time. It was the year India declared independence and ousted her father, King George VI, as head of state.\n\nDozens more were to follow suit over the following decades, across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. By the time of her death, Elizabeth was head of state in 14 countries besides the UK.\n\nElizabeth came to see that as an opportunity rather than a threat. India had asked to remain part of the Commonwealth and two years later the request was granted, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting of 1949. The monarch’s role in India was redefined as “the symbol of the free association of the independent Member Nations and as such Head of the Commonwealth.”\n\nThat was a model later adopted by other newly independent states, as British rule came to an end across Africa, Asia and other regions of the world.\n\nWhen the Queen inherited the title of Head of The Commonwealth from her father, she embraced it – which is why she is often credited with the “managed decline of the empire.” She may have lost her empire, but she retained her international footprint and reinforced it by traveling more than any of her predecessors.\n\nShe visited every one of the Commonwealth nations apart from Rwanda and Cameroon and made sure she attended key Commonwealth meetings to show her support. As she got older, she cut back on international travel but called on her eldest son, Prince Charles, to represent her instead.\n\nThen-Prince Charles speaks during the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, Rwanda on June 24. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nIn November 2021, Barbados severed its last imperial ties to Britain, removing the Queen as head of state as it marked its 55th anniversary of independence. Like others before it, the island nation has remained part of the Commonwealth.\n\nOn Saturday, Antigua and Barbuda signaled it could be the next country to go its own way, with the prime minister saying he wanted to hold a referendum to become a republic within three years.\n\nBeyond that, the republican movements in Australia and Jamaica have perhaps the most momentum, but their biggest obstacle was always the Queen herself.\n\nIn July 2017, then-Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull – a co-founder of the Australian Republican Movement – summed it up when he was granted an audience at Buckingham Palace. “Although I am a Republican, I am also an Elizabethan,” he tweeted. “It was an honour to meet Her Majesty today at Buckingham Palace.”\n\nKeeping public loyalty\n\nOver the decades, the Queen did as she promised and devoted herself to the service of the British people. This, coupled with her ability to adapt with the changing times and make sure she remained in the public eye, meant she largely kept their loyalty despite painful upheaval within the royal family.\n\nAs a result, the British republican movement gained little traction during Elizabeth’s reign except for two periods. The first was in 1992, which she herself described as her Annus Horribilis, or “terrible year.” Two of her children, Charles and Andrew, announced their separations and her daughter, Anne, got divorced. Her favored home, Windsor Castle, also went up in flames.\n\nA fire in 1992 wreaks havoc in Windsor Castle, causing major structural damage. AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Nineteen-ninety-two is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,” she told an audience at Guildhall in November of that year. “In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an ‘Annus Horribilis.’ I suspect that I am not alone in thinking it so.”\n\nHer other big low was after the death of daughter-in-law, Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. There was a backlash when people noticed the flag hadn’t been lowered over Buckingham Palace. Newspapers questioned why the Queen hadn’t returned to London from her holiday home in Scotland. She had her reasons. That flag had never been lowered even on the death of a monarch and she stayed in Scotland because she was helping to care for Diana’s children, Princes William and Harry.\n\nEventually, she returned to the capital and paid tribute to Diana in a live broadcast. She also had the flag lowered for Diana’s funeral.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip view the floral tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales, at London's Buckingham Palace, on September 5, 1997. Pool/AP\n\nNonetheless, Elizabeth’s approval rating didn’t fully recover until the blockbuster wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey in 2011. William was given free rein on whom he wanted to marry – and he chose a commoner. This turned the story into a fairytale and the whole world tuned in to watch.\n\nWilliam was also given free rein on whom he invited to the ceremony. He told a documentary team in 2012 how he was handed an official guest list and didn’t recognize anyone on it, so he had a word with his grandmother. “There was very much a subdued moment when I was handed a list with 777 names on, not one person I knew or Catherine knew,” he said. “I went to her and said: ‘Listen, I’ve got this list, not one person I know. What do I do?’ and she (The Queen) went: ‘Get rid of it. Start from your friends and then we’ll add those we need to in due course. It’s your day.’”\n\nThe Queen was allowing the younger generation to do things their own way and appeal to people their own age.\n\nAfter the wedding, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge – as they were then styled – were also granted considerable freedom to set up William’s own court at Kensington Palace.\n\nBut that was nothing compared to the leeway his younger brother was allowed with his wedding to Meghan Markle. Not only was she a biracial, American actress, feminist and divorcee but she wasn’t a member of the Church of England, though she was brought up an Anglican.\n\nAs important as it was for all these elements to be reflected on her big day at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, it was also important for the monarchy – and the Queen knew it. The gospel choir; the sermon from Episcopalian bishop Michael Curry; the way Meghan walked herself down the first part of the aisle: she made the royal family relevant to so many people it wasn’t relevant to before and it was a triumph all round.\n\nEveryone involved was a winner, just as they all lost when Meghan and Harry felt they couldn’t carry on in their royal roles and moved to North America two years later. They gave their reasons why in an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, accusing “the firm” of failing to support them and accusing an unnamed family member of making a racist remark about their son’s skin color.\n\nWhilst Harry was scathing in the interview about his father, he said he continued to have respect for his grandmother.\n\nAnother major challenge for the Queen in recent years was the scandal surrounding her son, Prince Andrew, and his connection to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew stepped back from royal duties in late 2019 amid the furor.\n\nIn January 2022, the Queen stripped Andrew of his remaining military titles and charities, as well as his right to be called His Royal Highness, as her son vowed to battle on in a civil sex abuse case brought against him in the United States. The following month the prince reached a deal with his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. Andrew repeatedly rejected the allegations against him.\n\nThe Queen largely avoided becoming the target of public anger over the saga, though questions remain over how her son was able to afford the undisclosed legal bill, which was expected to run into the millions.\n\nAlthough the palace would not comment on the settlement at the time, insiders believed the move would have been welcomed by the institution ahead of the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations later that summer.\n\nMembers of the royal family watch an RAF flypast on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade on June 2, 2022, as part of the Queen's platinum jubilee celebrations. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nHarnessing the power of media\n\nThe Queen’s ability to adapt was perhaps best exemplified by her unquestionably historic visit to the Republic of Ireland in 2011, the first by a British monarch in a century. Mary McAleese, the Irish President, described the visit as the culmination of the success of the peace process. A transient politician would never have lent the occasion the same weight.\n\nThe Queen received a standing ovation after a speech at Dublin Castle and plaudits from across the political divide. The following year, she followed up with a visit to Northern Ireland where she put aside the murder of her cousin, the Earl of Mountbatten, by the IRA in 1979, to shake hands with Martin McGuinness. He was allegedly an IRA commander at the time of Mountbatten’s death.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II shakes hands with Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, left, watched by First Minister Peter Robinson and Prince Philip at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on June 27, 2012. Paul Faith/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe result: one handshake caught on camera and another footnote in history with the Queen at the center of it.\n\nElizabeth understood the power of the media from an early age, and harnessing it was to become another key theme of her reign. That speech on her 21st birthday was recorded not just for radio but also for the emerging medium of television. At her coronation in 1953, she personally requested that cameras be allowed in to Westminster Abbey to broadcast the ceremony live.\n\nPeople famously went out to buy television sets so they could watch. It was a sacrosanct moment the public had never before been able to witness; they remembered where they were and who they watched with. The Queen had inadvertently invented event television. All she wanted was for as many people as possible to feel part of it.\n\nA phrase often attributed to Elizabeth was that “you have to be seen to be believed.” She understood that it wasn’t enough to go out in public, but she had to be seen there. Television gave her a bigger audience and when color was introduced, she wore brighter shades so she would stand out.\n\nShe allowed cameras into her day-to-day engagements too, whether it was opening a hospital or attending a local event of some sort. Instead of walking past the crowds of well-wishers, she stopped and talked to them, something which was almost unheard of at the time. Those “walkabouts” would appear in the media and show her amongst the people, not hidden behind palace walls. She supported hundreds of charities and good causes so she could get out and meet even more people.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II visits the set of the long-running television series \"Coronation Street,\" on July 8, 2021 in Manchester, England. Scott Heppell /WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nPlaying the long game\n\nWhen the digital revolution arrived, the Queen embraced it with her own website. She established a social media presence long before her children or grandchildren did. The internet presented her with another way of connecting with her public and making herself relevant to their lives. She didn’t have to say anything. She never gave an interview. She understood that she just needed to be present.\n\nThis was a woman playing the long game. Headlines came and went.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II appears on a large video screen accompanied by Bond actor Daniel Craig during the Opening Ceremony for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London. MCT via Getty Images\n\nIf Elizabeth gave a speech, she wouldn’t show any expression, or offer an opinion. This approach meant she retained broad public support, including in parliament, which was the one body that had the power to dethrone her.\n\nIf she had a particular talent, it was knowing when to step in and take center stage. Who can forget her “parachuting” into the London Olympics opening ceremony with James Bond?\n\nAt times of crisis, such as the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, she addressed the country in her role as “Head of the Nation” and expertly articulated the national mood and offered reassurance. She said the UK “will succeed” in its fight against the virus and she praised those who had been following government guidelines and come “together to help others.”\n\nEvoking wartime language to place the scale of the crisis in context, she added: “We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on April 17, 2021. Jonathan Brady/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nAs the lockdown continued in the United Kingdom, the Queen and her family had to find a way to continue to “be seen” when they weren’t able to go out and meet people anymore. So, they did what everyone else did. They video-conferenced into public engagements and released the video to the media.\n\nIt showed a more personal side to the Queen and her family which one doesn’t see when they are surrounded by people and cameras. Photographers were also allowed into Windsor Castle to capture Prince Philip’s funeral, delivering a poignant and profound image of the Queen grieving on her own in the chapel, as she followed social-distancing rules like her subjects around the nation.\n\nIf any monarch’s primary role is to secure and strengthen the Crown for the next generation, then Elizabeth did so with her constant presence, but always adapting and keeping the institution relevant.\n\nOver the course of her long reign, she transformed and updated the brand more than people realize and kept it fit for purpose. It’s up to her heir, an altogether more divisive figure, to honor that legacy and do the same in his own way.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/09/uk/royal-family-king-charles-iii-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Royal family: As King Charles III takes the throne, big changes lie ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGod save the Queen, long live the King.

Hugo Burnand/Royal Household 2023/AP In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next\n\nThe moment Elizabeth II died, her eldest child, Charles, automatically became monarch. As sovereign, he has chosen to take the name King Charles III.\n\nAll rights and responsibilities of the Crown now rest with King Charles III.\n\nHe becomes head of state not just in the UK but in 14 other Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada. He will become head of the 56-member Commonwealth, although that is not a hereditary position, after his succession to the role was agreed by Commonwealth leaders at a meeting in London in 2018.\n\nHe has become head of the British Armed Forces, the judiciary and the civil service, and he is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He is the Fount of Honour, which means all honors, such as knighthoods, will now be given in his name.\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution, so the role of monarchy is defined by convention rather than law. He has a duty to remain politically impartial, which means he will come under greater scrutiny if he continues to express the views he is known for.\n\nHe has championed alternative medicines and organic farming techniques. In 1984, he hit out at the “glass stumps and concrete towers” of modern architecture. He has spent decades warning of the dangers of climate change. In the so-called “black spider” memos, he raised the issues he was concerned about directly with ministers.\n\nIn a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Charles acknowledged having ruffled feathers with his past interventions. But he promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once sovereign, saying he would operate within “the constitutional parameters.”\n\nElizabeth stayed “above politics” and never expressed herself in any way on any issue and as a result she rarely divided opinion. She managed to retain popular support and cross-party support in parliament, which was the one body with the power to dethrone her.\n\nWe will never know what she discussed in her regular audiences with her prime ministers, beginning with Churchill, but Charles is a more outspoken character. Will he go quiet on policy matters in public but continue to lobby in private? Will the prime minister act on it?\n\nThe prime ministerial audiences are one of several constitutional duties to which King Charles III will be expected to step up and they will bring him in regular contact with policymakers. He appoints the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, approves legislation and official appointments, receives the credentials of foreign ambassadors and hosts world leaders on state visits.\n\nCharles has also adopted the symbolic position as Head of Nation, meaning he becomes the symbol of national identity, unity, and pride. He represents continuity and celebrates excellence on behalf of the country. That’s why we see the monarch opening national events and leading commemorations.\n\nPeople would look to Elizabeth in times of crisis, but will they rally around King Charles III in the same way? He is more divisive not just because of his honest views but also because of the bad taste still left from his acrimonious divorce from his immensely popular first wife, Diana.\n\nAll the official royal residences including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will now be under his control. There are also other residences such as Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk which the Queen owned privately – and the nation will have to see to whom she leaves them in her will.\n\nEither way, Charles’ wealth has ballooned. By far the biggest slice of the family’s fortune, the £16.5 billion ($19 billion) Crown Estate, now belongs to him as reigning monarch. But under an arrangement dating back to 1760, the monarch hands over all profits from the estate to the government in return for a slice, called the Sovereign Grant.\n\nThe estate includes vast swathes of central London property and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It has the status of a corporation and is managed by a chief executive and commissioners — or non-executive directors — appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\nThe grant, which covers the cost of his official duties and amounted to £86.3 million ($99.2 million) for the 2021/2022 financial year. He will take charge of the Royal Collection, which includes one of the most valuable art collections in the world. He also picks up the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate dating back to 1265, which was valued at about £653 million ($764 million) according to its most recent accounts. Income from its investments cover official costs not met by the Sovereign Grant, and helps support other Royal family members.\n\nKing Charles III has become one of the richest men in England overnight.\n\nCamilla\n\nCharles and Camilla attend the Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel on June 13, 2022 in Windsor, England. Toby Melville/Getty Images\n\nFor years, the big question around Charles’ wife surrounded her title. At the time their wedding was announced in February 2005, the official statement said: “It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH The Princess Consort when The Prince of Wales accedes to The Throne.” That was a very clear signal that Camilla would not use the title of Queen. Her office at Clarence House distanced itself from that statement in the intervening years, however, saying it was a matter for the reigning monarch.\n\nThen, in February 2022, the Queen expressed her desire for her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort when Charles became King in a message marking the start of her platinum jubilee year – a statement that appeared to resolve the issue for good.\n\nThe Queen’s wishes were welcomed by the couple themselves. That same weekend, a statement released by a spokesperson said they had been “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”\n\nWhere will the couple live? Well, traditionally the new monarch would move into Buckingham Palace but in 2011, the BBC reported that Charles was considering moving his entire court to Windsor and turning Buckingham Palace into an events center. That would be a dramatic and controversial shift but might also assert King Charles III as the new boss.\n\nWilliam and Catherine\n\nWilliam and Catherine are pictured with their children, George, Charlotte and Louis, and the Queen, Charles and Camilla at Buckingham Palace during platinum jubilee celebrations on June 5, 2022. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nUp until now, Charles has been responsible for covering the costs of his heir, Prince William.\n\nWilliam has now inherited his father’s titles of The Duke of Cornwall, which comes with an estate which last year delivered an income of £23 million ($26 million). That money now goes straight to William and he becomes independently wealthy.\n\nHis new title is HRH The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge and tradition dictates that, as first in line to the throne, he also becomes Prince of Wales. And Catherine becomes Her Royal Highness, The Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nWilliam and Catherine will be able to solidify their own independent court, which is currently based at Kensington Palace in west London, in an apartment that was refurbished shortly after their marriage. It seems unlikely that William would want to move, so the King’s former residences, including Clarence House and Birkhall in the Scottish Highlands, will likely remain vacant until Charles offers them to other members of the family, or finds an alternative use. The family resides at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor during school term time.\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will follow their parents’ titling. They are now Their Royal Highnesses Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cornwall and Cambridge. Colloquially they are likely to be known as George, Charlotte and Louis Wales.\n\nHarry and Meghan\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry react as they attend the annual One Young World Summit in Manchester, north-west England on September 5, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt’s unlikely that Charles’ second son, Harry, will be offered a royal office unless he and wife Meghan return to their royal duties, and the King would also need to confirm that they can continue to use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, which is part of the royal estate. They currently live with son Archie and daughter Lilibet in California but were allowed to continue using Frogmore as their official residence during the Queen’s reign.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced in early 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties, they said they would “work to become financially independent.” The terms of the split stipulated that while the pair would always remain part of the family, they would no longer use their HRH titles.\n\nAs grandchildren of the monarch, Archie now automatically becomes Prince Archie of Sussex while Lilibet will be Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Whether they use those titles will only become known the first time their parents refer to them publicly.\n\nPrince Andrew and other family members\n\nKing Charles III also becomes responsible for distributing roles, responsibilities and resources to other members of the royal family.\n\nCharles has never been close to his brother Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties over his links to the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022 he was stripped of his HRH title, as well as others associated with the military and charity roles. That raises the question of whether the new King continues to allow Andrew to use his Buckingham Palace apartment and offers financial support.\n\nThen there are his other siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and more distant relatives such as the Gloucesters and Kents who retain royal residences at Kensington.\n\nPrincess Anne attends a service at St Giles' Cathedral on June 30, 2022 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nCharles will need to decide how much family support he needs to carry out his duties and who he wants to offer it. Then he can reveal what support he offers in return. Many of these decisions would already have been taken and the first telling signs of where his loyalties lie will be seen in who gets to keep which residences and especially who gets an upgrade.\n\nAnne and Edward, and his wife Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, are expected to continue with their public duties following decades of dedicated service but the new King needs to balance that against pressure for a slimmed down monarchy in austere times.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/business-food/king-charles-duchy-originals-waitrose/index.html", "title": "King Charles: How Duchy Originals became a top organic food ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nFor years, King Charles was preparing to step into the role of monarch following Queen Elizabeth’s history-making reign. In the meantime, he was holding down another job: Owner of a profitable business.\n\nCharles — long a passionate advocate of environmental causes — founded Duchy Originals in 1990 when he was the Prince of Wales to market produce from his farm. It’s since grown into the largest organic food and drink brand in the United Kingdom, according to the company. In the year through March 2021, Duchy Originals earned nearly £3.6 million ($4.1 million) before taxes.\n\nThe brand has had its ups and downs. But it’s thrived since entering into a partnership with Waitrose in 2009. The upmarket grocery chain now has the exclusive right to sell products under the Duchy name, and shoppers can find salmon, sausages, milk, carrots and blueberries bearing the “Waitrose Duchy Organic” name at its stores.\n\n“It’s turned into a very successful business,” said Andrew Bloch, a London-based public relations expert. “You can sense with this brand, it has heart and soul behind it.”\n\nThe future is uncertain, though. Control of the Duchy Originals brand is up in the air during a period of national mourning culminating in the Queen’s state funeral on Monday.\n\n“We will liaise with the Royal Household on future arrangements when the time is right to do so,” a spokesperson for Waitrose said.\n\nPackets of Prince Charles' brand of products line shelves at a Waitrose supermarket in central London. Johnny Green/Pool/Reuters\n\nOwnership of Duchy Originals will most likely pass to Charles’ eldest son Prince William, who also inherits the separate Duchy of Cornwall estate — worth about £1 billion ($1.2 billion). And while the prince has studied organic farming, he’s likely to be less hands-on than his father.\n\n“He’ll be interested, but he’ll entrust others to run it,” said Sally Bedell Smith, a biographer and author of the book “Charles: The Misunderstood Prince.”\n\nA passion project\n\nCharles spent decades preaching the benefits of organic farming and protecting the environment, even before such issues became mainstream causes.\n\nIn 1985, he converted Home Farm, near his Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire, into a fully organic system. The Duchy Originals venture emerged five years later.\n\n“Since the beginning of the 1980s, when I first had responsibility for managing some land in my own right at Highgrove, I have wanted to focus on an approach to food production that avoids the impact of the predominant, conventional system of industrialized agriculture, which, it is increasingly clear to see, is having a disastrous effect on soil fertility, biodiversity and animal and human health,” Charles told Country Life magazine in 2021.\n\nThe first Duchy Originals product was an oaten biscuit sold in 1992. Initially, items bearing the brand were only found in high-end shops such as Harrods and Fortnum & Mason, though they later expanded into outlets like Waitrose, which caters to wealthier shoppers but has many more locations.\n\nThe business was on rocky ground in its early days, Smith wrote in her book. It took on too much debt, and Duchy Originals had to look for new producers and manufacturers once it became too big to rely solely on Highgrove.\n\nIts fortunes later improved, according to Smith. She reported that when Charles visited the British embassy in Spain in 2004, he burst in with gift-wrapped products, announcing, “I’m a self-made millionaire, you know!”\n\nWaitrose steps in\n\nAn ill-fated attempt to expand into the United States, however, combined with the onset of the global financial crisis, pushed the business to the brink of collapse.\n\nFacing millions of pounds in losses in 2009, Charles turned to Waitrose, which threw him a lifeline by agreeing to serve as exclusive distributor.\n\nIt marked the end of the prince’s ambitions for a large presence in the US market, but the start of a robust turnaround in the outlook of the business.\n\n“The Waitrose rescue during the financial crisis in September 2009 was absolutely vital,” Smith said.\n\nBy 2017, 25 years after the oat biscuit’s debut, the line had expanded to 300 products, including fruits, vegetables, meat and beer, and annual sales reached £200 million ($231 million). More than 30 countries around the world, including the United States, Germany, Japan and Australia, have received exports of select products.\n\nPrince Charles and his wife Camilla visit a Waitrose supermarket in central London in 2009. Johnny Green/Pool/Reuters\n\nCharles has access to vast personal wealth through his portfolio of land and property, but he has never directly profited from the Duchy Originals business. All royalties collected from Waitrose have been donated to charitable causes. In its annual report for 2019, the firm said it had raised more than £30 million ($35 million) since striking the licensing deal with Waitrose.\n\n“It has provided a very substantial income stream into his foundation and has helped to fund his charitable work as well as to promote organic products,” Smith said.\n\nStill, the venture hasn’t been without controversy. A range of herbal remedies, including the “Herbals Detox Tincture” blend of artichoke and dandelion, was accused by an expert on alternative medicine as based on “outright quackery.” A regulatory agency later said online advertisements for two of the line’s herbal medicines were misleading and instructed Duchy Originals to change the wording.\n\nWilliam’s new venture?\n\nChanges have been underway in recent years as Charles prepared to take the throne. In 2020, his team said he wouldn’t renew the lease on the sprawling Home Farm, but would continue to farm organically at the late Queen’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk that he had started managing in 2017.\n\nObservers now believe William will take the reins of Duchy Originals and its partnership with Waitrose, part of his new responsibilities as the Duke of Cornwall.\n\n“I think there will be a tension between his new role as King Charles III and what he can and can’t do,” said Bloch, who also has worked on a voluntary basis with Charles’ Prince’s Trust charity. “It’s likely that Prince William will take over.”\n\nPrince Charles looks at produce during a reception in 2013 to celebrate the anniversary of Duchy Originals. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nIn his first address to the nation as king, Charles acknowledged that his responsibilities will change.\n\n“It will no longer be possible for me to give so much of my time and energies to the charities and issues for which I care so deeply,” he said. “But I know this important work will go on in the trusted hands of others.”\n\nWilliam spent lots of time on the Highgrove estate growing up and enrolled in an agricultural management course at the University of Cambridge in 2014. Still, Smith doesn’t think he’ll be as involved in the details of the business.\n\n“I wouldn’t imagine he’ll get into the minutiae of it that Charles did,” she said.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/africa/royal-news-newsletter-06-24-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Prince Charles says 'time has come' to confront legacy of ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in the June 24 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.\n\nKigali, Rwanda CNN —\n\nBetter late than never. That was the general reaction to Prince Charles’ opening speech at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali on Friday.\n\nThe prince will succeed his mother as head of the organization – an association of independent states that emerged out of the ashes of the British Empire. That empire will forever be associated with slavery, and Prince Charles made it clear in his opening remarks that he wants to change the status quo and begin a dialogue about it.\n\n“While we strive together for peace, prosperity and democracy I want to acknowledge that the roots of our contemporary association run deep into the most painful period of our history,” he told delegates. “I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many, as I continue to deepen my own understanding of slavery’s enduring impact. “\n\nThose delegates coming out after the speech appeared moved and heartened by the prince’s words. A more resounding “sorry” would have suited some better but that would open the way for reparation claims and that’s a government issue, not one for the monarchy.\n\nCharles said the Commonwealth needs to “find new ways to acknowledge our past. Quite simply, this is a conversation whose time has come. Your Excellencies, conversations start with listening.”\n\nYusuf Keketoma Sandi was part of the Sierra Leone delegation. Tens of thousands of Africans were kidnapped and brought to Sierra Leone, to be traded and put on slave ships bound for the Americas. It later became a British colony.\n\nHe told us: “Slavery has not been part of the conversation, so the fact that we have the prince today talking about slavery and to see how we want to start that conversation… Sierra Leone is looking forward to that and we hope that when it starts he will pay a visit to Sierra Leone and go and see some of the scars left in Sierra Leone.”\n\nThere are still 15 countries that have Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. Barbados only replaced her with a locally appointed president last year. The Prime Minister of Jamaica voiced the desire to do the same a few months ago.\n\nIn Kigali, Charles made clear he would not stand in the way of countries cutting ties with the monarchy. He said: “The Commonwealth contains within it countries that have had constitutional relationships with my family, some that continue to do so, and increasingly those that have had none. I want to say clearly, as I have said before, that each member’s constitutional arrangement, as republic or monarchy, is purely a matter for each member country to decide.”\n\nThe scars of slavery run deep across the planet. It couldn’t be a more sensitive subject. Royals may have shied away from it in the past but Prince Charles now wants to talk about it and he wants the Commonwealth to be the platform. He wants to be part of the solution instead of a symbol of the problem.\n\nROYAL TEA BREAK\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prince Charles attend the CHOGM opening ceremony in Kigali. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nCharles and UK Prime Minister avoid awkward run-in during Rwanda trip.\n\nSpeculation has been rife in the past few days of possible tensions between Prince Charles and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Johnson’s government is pressing ahead with a policy to send some asylum seekers arriving in the UK to Rwanda for processing and possible resettlement. British newspaper the Times reported that the royal had described the plan as “appalling.” With a bilateral meeting between the two on the fringes of the Commonwealth leaders’ summit in Kigali in the cards on Friday, British media were watching to see if any of the reported tension was visible. However, hours before the event, Johnson made it clear that any conversation he might have with Charles would remain private. “I wouldn’t comment on anything that I say to the Queen or the Queen says to me. Nor will I say anything about what the heir to the throne might say to me or what I might say to him. And that’s never happened and Prime Ministers never talk about that and quite rightly,” Johnson told reporters on Friday morning. For its part, Clarence House said it won’t be commenting on any supposed remarks except to say the prince is politically neutral.\n\nJOIN THE TOUR\n\nAn emotional first day.\n\nPrince Charles arrived in Rwanda on Tuesday night – the first member of the royal family to visit the country. While he’s here to represent the Queen at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), he organized a series of engagements around the main event.\n\nThe first day of the visit was heavily focused on learning more about the 1994 genocide and included a journey to Nyamata Church, in and around which at least 45,000 people were massacred. A spokesperson for Clarence House said the royal couple were struck by how important it is never to forget the horrors of the past. But they were also “deeply moved as they listened to people who have found ways of living with and even forgiving the most appalling crimes,” the spokesperson added.\n\nWatch Max’s report:\n\nBloodstained shorts and machetes: Prince Charles visits memorial to Rwanda genocide 03:04 - Source: CNN\n\nDON’T MISS\n\nCamilla, Duchess of Cornwall makes a speech as she attends a Violence Against Women and Girls event at the Kigali Convention Centre on Thursday. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nOne of Camilla’s strongest speeches yet.\n\nThe Duchess of Cornwall took center stage at the Commonwealth meeting on Thursday, as she pressed leaders to step up their efforts to prevent domestic violence. “There is power in this alliance. In the strength of our unity, we, the women and men of the Commonwealth, stand with victims and survivors, who, despite the temptation to hide away in silence, speak up so that others know they aren’t alone – whether in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Pacific or the Caribbean and Americas,” the future Queen said in her address. “In so doing, we have the opportunity to end gender-based violence and those laws and practices that discriminate against women. And each one of us must take personal responsibility not to let this opportunity be lost.”\n\nCarrie Johnson, the wife of the UK Prime Minister, was among the attendees at the Kigali Convention Centre. While there may be reported tensions between their husbands, the two seemed delighted to see each other. Johnson warmly greeted the Duchess when she came over to her table during the event, the pair appearing relaxed as they chatted and laughed together.\n\nWhile she is only here in the capacity of accompanying Prince Charles, the speech showed Camilla is already living up to her future title of Queen Consort and showing the same commitment to the Commonwealth as her mother-in-law.

The global organization was established in 2015 and has supported more than 45,000 young people in returning to education and preparing for their own careers.\n\nHere in Rwanda, the charity has been working with local partners since 2020 and the Prince of Wales appeared delighted to speak to some of those he has been helping support. The royal made his way around several stalls featuring local products from young entrepreneurs and chatted animatedly with students before posing for a group photo.\n\nSpeaking before the event, 24-year-old hospitality student Regis told us it “means a lot” to welcome Charles on Thursday.\n\n“I think it’s a privilege and honor for the prince to organize (to see) those people who he’s helping to get jobs,” he said with a huge grin on his face. “A lot of people want to meet him but they are not going to.

Prince William, who attended the opening ceremony with the Duchess of Cambridge, praised the generation while acknowledging that “discrimination remains an all too familiar experience for Black men and women in Britain in 2022.” Some members of the Windrush generation, who were invited to come to the UK to rebuild the country in the 1940s and 1950s, were targeted or deported by the government in 2017 in what became a painful political scandal. “It is also important to acknowledge the ways in which the future they sought and deserved has yet to come to pass,” William told the crowd at Waterloo on Wednesday.\n\nPrince William speaks during the unveiling of the National Windrush Monument at Waterloo Station in London on Wednesday.

The painting shows Kate in a flowing emerald dress and William in a dark suit, his hand tucked in his pocket. The painting was commissioned as a gift to the people of Cambridgeshire, and features subtle nods to the region in its background colors. “It’s quite big,” William remarked as it went on display at Cambridge’s Fitzwilliam Museum, according to PA Media. He also told the artist, Jamie Coreth, that it was “amazing.” In an interview with the Big Issue magazine earlier this week to mark his 40th birthday, William said he was a fan of Renaissance-era paintings and studied “a bit” of art history at university, but gave it up because he “kept falling asleep in the lectures.” Learn more.\n\nThe official joint portrait of the Cambridges.

Environmental experts are using Thursday to draw focus to restoring the world’s ecosystems through natural processes, emerging green technologies and innovative thinking.\n\nIf you're looking for ways to make a difference, these celebrity-backed environmental causes – some of them brand-new initiatives, others helpful reminders from longtime activists – from stars including Jane Fonda, Bill Nye, Hayley Hasselhoff, Justin Bieber and Prince William are helpful places to start.\n\nMore:After a critical year for COVID-19 and climate, Earth Day 2021 is Thursday\n\nBill Nye stars in 'Earth Day! The Musical'\n\nCause: Bill Nye teaming up with Justin Bieber and other major names in Hollywood to raise awareness on how to restore the planet? Facebook Watch presents \"Earth Day! The Musical\" (Thursday at noon EST) in what we can only hope feels like a present-day musical iteration of \"Bill Nye The Science Guy\" episodes. The star-studded cast includes Ben Platt, Charli and Dixie D'Amelio, Desus Nice and The Kid Mero, Fortune Feimster, Gaten Matarazzo, Idina Menzel, Jack Harlow, Jasmine Cephas Jones, Justin Bieber, Maluma, Nick Kroll, Phoebe Robinson, Retta, Steve Aoki, Tori Kelly, and Zac Efron.\n\nWhat they've said about it: \"Please vote,\" Nye said to USA TODAY last October. \"I’ve been whining and complaining about climate change for 40 years, and we’ve hardly done anything about it, but now we have an opportunity.\"\n\nHow you can take part: During the special, viewers can join the #RestoreOurEarthChallenge, during which they'll be invited to share photos, videos and social media posts about how they plan to take action against climate change on Thursday.\n\nEnvironmental action:Bill Nye talks viral TikTok, reflects on 'Science Guy' success\n\nJane Fonda's Fire Drill Fridays\n\nCause: Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Fonda, along with Greenpeace and other environmental activism allies, launched the Fire Drill Fridays initiative to protest weekly in the nation's capitol, with the goal of drawing attention to the climate crisis. When COVID-19 made gathering in-person difficult, she pivoted to video chats and virtual rallies, featuring prominent political, social and activist figures and fellow celebrities. Last week, Fonda hosted a special pre-Earth Day episode with youth climate experts to discuss how to build a more sustainable future.\n\nWhat they've said about it: “The scientists are very clear: We have to cut our fossil fuel emissions in half by 2030. They say we have the technology to do it, we have the money to do it, we have everything we need to do it except enough people to force the government to actually do it.”\n\nHow you can take part: Fire Drill Fridays still takes place virtually every week on Facebook Live. The organization also invites others to get involved by calling on politicians at all levels to support bills and initiatives that experts say will fight climate change and environmental racism.\n\n'I was slipping into despair':Jane Fonda finds hope, purpose in climate change activism\n\nPrince Harry highlights importance of national parks\n\nCause: Prince Harry has been outspoken about environmental issues, particularly in Africa, to which he has said he feels a deep connection after visiting for the first time in 1997 following the death of his mother, Princess Diana, that same year. He highlighted on Thursday the importance of supporting national parks and protected areas in order to preserve clean air and water, food security and more in a video for nonprofit African Parks, for which he has served as president since 2017.\n\n'No one can deny science' on climate change: Prince Harry says during royal tour of Africa\n\nWhat they've said about it: “On this Earth Day, I reflect on generations of conservation champions, including my late grandfather, and feel proud and energized to continue doing my part in this legacy.”\n\nHow you can take part: The organization urges others to visit national parks to support the parks, which in turn supports both their environmental endeavors and the stability of local economies.\n\nPrince William encourages innovation\n\nCause: Prince William, a longtime supporter of environmental causes, last year co-founded the Earthshot Prize, an award meant to \"incentivize change and help to repair our planet over the next 10 years.” On Thursday, the prince, along with Cate Blanchett and Sir David Attenborough, signed an open letter calling on the world to tackle environmental issues with the \"same spirit of innovation and possibility from the fight against COVID.\"\n\nWhat they've said about it: “According to the experts, it really is the point of no return,” William told Sky News last year. “We have 10 years to fundamentally fix our planet.”\n\nHow you can take part: The Earthshot prize offers awards in five areas to innovative conservationists: protect and restore nature, clean our air, revive our oceans, build a waste-free world, and fix our climate. For the rest of us at home, the organization offers ideas like working to eliminate food waste and single-use plastics, and encouraging community and business leaders to end practices that contribute to land, air and water pollution.\n\nMore:Prince William, David Attenborough launch environmental award, the Earthshot prize\n\nRosario Dawson wants you to 'save the soil'\n\nCause: In 2019, Dawson narrated and executive produced the documentary film \"The Need To Grow,\" which highlights the importance of healthy soil, which experts then estimated the earth had only about 60 years worth left. The actress also recently spoke at the virtual Amazon Climate Forum, where she showed support for those who \"risk their lives to protect the environment, land and indigenous rights.\"\n\nWhat they've said about it: “We have to put pressure on companies and the government, because sweeping change is necessary,\" Dawson told Elle last year.\n\nHow you can take part: The official website for \"Grow\" offers explanations and tips on how to begin composting and starting school gardens, and recommends supporting local farmers' markets when possible to cut down on the energy consumption and air pollution it takes to transport produce across the country or internationally.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix makes good on his 2020 Oscars speech\n\nCause: The day after actor Phoenix won his first Academy Award last year, he joined nonprofit Farm Sanctuary to help free a calf and her mother from a Los Angeles slaughterhouse. He reunited with the two cows more than a year later in a video the organization released Thursday, reflecting on the negative impact of animal agriculture on the environment.\n\nWhat they've said about it: \"I think that we've become very disconnected from the natural world,\" Phoenix said in his 2020 Oscars acceptance speech. \"And many of us, what we're guilty of is an egocentric world view: The belief that we're the center of the universe. We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. And then we take her milk that's intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal.\"\n\nHow you can take part: Farm Sanctuary suggests adopting a plant-based lifestyle to cut back on the \"incredible strain on natural resources\" that modern animal agriculture places on the earth.\n\nShailene Woodley fights against pollution\n\nCause: Woodley has been outspoken about a variety of environmental causes throughout her career in the public eye. In 2016, the actress was arrested while leaving a protest at a construction site for the Dakota Access Pipeline, which she and others worried would have harmful implications for local ecology and climate change, particularly for the nearby Native American populations. She also partnered a few years later with Greenpeace to study the impact of plastic and pollution on marine life. Last month, she partnered with eyewear brand Karün for a line of sustainable sunglasses.\n\nWhat they've said about it: \"You can’t address environmentalism without recognizing the intersectionality that exists between all forms of social and environmental injustice,\" she wrote for Time in 2019. \"If we all continue to find a little more space in our hearts for kindness, we may just be able to sway our global leaders to conserve 30% of our oceans by 2030, and in turn, continue the evolution of the human race.\"\n\nHow you can take part: Some initiatives Woodley has previously recommended include urging local stores to re-evaluate their single-plastic usage, calling local representatives and local CEOs to ban products such as plastic water bottles from the area, and personally replacing your own single-use plastic products with a stainless steel water bottle and reusable travel utensils.\n\nHayley Hasselhoff, Cara Delevingne 'turn the tide'\n\nCause: In order to restore oceans to fight climate change, U.K.-based charity Project Zero is enlisting the help of stars including models Hasselhoff and Delevingne to \"turn the tide.\" Ambassadors plan to get the word out on social media on how to better protect the ocean.\n\nWhat they've said about it: \"At every stage in the lifecycle of plastics, there are harmful climate impacts,\" Delevingne wrote on Instagram last year in support of the Break Free From Pollution Act. \"Plastic waste is killing wildlife and damaging our environment.\"\n\nHow you can take part: Project Zero invites others to \"become protectors of the ocean by adopting their very own ocean coordinate\" – $10+ contributions will get participants their own section of the ocean to \"look after\" and share on social media to encourage others to donate, too.\n\nContributing: Barbara Vandenburgh and Doyle Rice, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/12/16/elon-musk-twitter-spacex-drought-abortion-miss-america/10901950002/", "title": "Daily Briefing: Musk's Twitter suspends journalists", "text": "Twitter's new owner Elon Musk has suddenly suspended some news reporters from the social media platform without explanation.

The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California imports about half of its water from the Colorado River and the northern Sierra Nevada via the State Water Project – a complex system of dams, canals and reservoirs that provides drinking water for much of the state. But it's been so dry the past three years that those water deliveries have hit record lows. Read more\n\nMore news to know now\n\n🌤 What's the weather today?

U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Texas stayed the termination until legal challenges by Texas and Missouri are settled but didn’t order the policy reinstated. The impact on the program wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nMore context: Under President Donald Trump, about 70,000 asylum-seekers were forced to wait in Mexico for U.S. hearings under the policy introduced in January 2019. President Joe Biden — who said it “goes against everything we stand for as a nation of immigrants” — suspended the policy on his first day in office.\n\nBiden's suspension set off a long legal path. Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee in Amarillo, ordered that the policy be reinstated in 2021. The Biden administration complied with the order after agreeing to changes and additions demanded by Mexico.

But MPs have refused to share the estimated costs of the scheme, and it faces local opposition even within the Conservative Party.\n\nHow much does it really cost to house asylum seekers?\n\nHome Office estimates in February found there were “more than 45,500 asylum seekers in hotels costing the UK taxpayer £5.6 million a day”, approximately £2 billion a year. This was more than in 2022, when the department said the £1.5 billion-a-year system was costing “the highest amount in over two decades”.\n\nThe Daily Express claimed in March that “taxpayer funded hotels” were costing £6.8 million a day. But this ignores “that around £1.2 million of this cost goes towards providing ‘bridging accommodation’ for Afghan refugees who arrived in the UK via legal resettlement schemes”, said Full Fact, backing the government figure of £5.6 million a day.\n\nSunak said in December that this would have to stop in his proposals for the stringent new Illegal Migration Bill. But the expectation, said The Telegraph, is that hotels will be used until 2025, even after the bill becomes law.\n\nIn 2022, the government spent almost £3.7 billion supporting refugees in the UK, including asylum seekers and those already granted refugee status, according to the House of Commons Library. This represented 29% of its overall aid budget and was a marked increase on the £1 billion spent in 2021.\n\nThe government has acknowledged that “the costs of supporting those arriving from Ukraine, the resettlement of Afghans, and other asylum applications has put pressure on its aid budget for 2022”, it said.", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden"], "publish_date": "2023/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/961378/quiz-of-the-week-17-23-june", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 17 - 23 June | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Those people granted asylum would then be allowed to resettle in Rwanda. The government insisted the program was aimed at disrupting people-smuggling networks and deterring migrants from making the dangerous sea journey across the Channel to England from France.\n\nAdvocacy groups had initiated multiple legal challenges to stop the aircraft, including an appeal that was rejected by the Court of Appeal in London on Monday. Several dozen asylum seekers saw their tickets canceled, Care4Calais refugee charity said, leaving just seven people due to be deported by Tuesday morning.\n\nBut on the evening that the plane was expected to depart, the ECHR issued a series of rulings in the cases of the last Rwanda-bound asylum-seekers, ordering the British government not to remove them.\n\nA Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo said the country is “not deterred” after the UK deportation flight to Rwanda was grounded.\n\n“We are not deterred by these developments. Rwanda remains fully committed to making this partnership work,” Makolo said in a statement sent to CNN Wednesday.\n\n“The current situation of people making dangerous journeys cannot continue as it is causing untold suffering to so many. Rwanda stands ready to receive the migrants when they do arrive and offer them safety and opportunity in our country,” Makolo added.\n\nIn its ruling for one Iraqi national, the ECHR said: “The European Court has indicated to the UK Government that the applicant should not be removed to Rwanda until three weeks after the delivery of the final domestic decision in his ongoing judicial review proceedings.”\n\nThe ECHR essentially found that that asylum seeker had not exhausted all legal proceedings in the UK, with British courts planning to hear the applicant’s judicial review challenge in July, and should not be removed until having done so.\n\n“BREAKING: Last ticket cancelled,” tweeted Care4Calais, upon news of the flight cancellation. “NO ONE IS GOING TO RWANDA.”\n\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan also reacted, tweeting: “Tonight’s inhumane deportation of asylum seekers to #Rwanda has been stopped by the ECtHR - minutes before it was due to depart. Sending people fleeing violence to a country thousands of miles away was already cruel and callous. It’s now potentially unlawful too.”\n\nThe development is a rebuff to the UK government, after Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the deportation flight would depart regardless of how many people were on board.\n\nUK Home Secretary Priti Patel said Tuesday evening that she was “disappointed” that the flight had been halted, and that her office was reviewing the legality of the decision. The government plans to move forward with the project, she also said.\n\n“Access to the UK’s asylum system must be based on need, not on the ability to pay people smugglers. The demands on the current system, the cost to the taxpayer, and the flagrant abuses are increasing, and the British public have rightly had enough,” Patel said.\n\n“I have always said this policy will not be easy to deliver and am disappointed that legal challenge and last-minute claims have meant today’s flight was unable to depart,” she added.\n\nDespite the government’s attempts to justify the scheme, criticism of the plan has continued to grow. Church of England leaders on Tuesday called it an “immoral policy that shames Britain” in a joint letter to The Times newspaper.\n\n“Rwanda is a brave country recovering from catastrophic genocide. The shame is our own, because our Christian heritage should inspire us to treat asylum seekers with compassion, fairness and justice, as we have for centuries,” the letter reads.\n\n“Many are desperate people fleeing unspeakable horrors. Many are Iranians, Eritreans and Sudanese citizens, who have an asylum grant rate of at least 88 per cent,” it continued. “We cannot offer asylum to everyone, but we must not outsource our ethical responsibilities, or discard international law – which protects the right to claim asylum.”\n\nIn response, Truss told Sky News that the Rwanda flights policy was “completely moral” and that critics “need to suggest an alternative policy that will work.”\n\nDemonstrators protest outside of an airport perimeter fence against a planned deportation of asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda, at Gatwick Airport on June 12, 2022. Toby Melville/Reuters\n\n‘Incredibly dangerous’ journey\n\nAccording to data from the UK Home office, 28,526 people arrived to the United Kingdom on small boats in 2021. The vast majority of them, 23,655, were men and nearly two thirds came from just four countries: Iran (7,874), Iraq (5,414), Eritrea (2,829) and Syria (2,260).\n\nCare4Calais said the reason the majority of refugees are male is the result of fleeing their homelands where “young men may be killed to stop them rebelling against the government, or forced into military service.”\n\nIt also explained the journey to Calais is “incredibly dangerous” and that “many families will not risk their daughters safety on a journey to Europe. The hope is the men who escape will then help them to safety.”\n\nAlmost all of the people who come on small boats – 98% off those who arrived in 2020 – have applied for asylum.\n\nThe Refugee Council said that most people arriving by small boats across the Channel are likely to be genuine refugees fleeing persecution.\n\nStatistics from the Home Office show that people arriving to the UK from Iran (88%), Eritrea (97%) and Syria (98%) have generally high chances of being granted asylum.\n\nThe chances are significantly smaller for Iraqi citizens – only 48% of the decisions made in 2021 were positive.\n\nThe Refugee Council said that overall, around 75% of initial asylum decisions made in the year to March 2022 were positive and that of those who were rejected, about half were allowed asylum appeal.\n\nMore recently, the number of people coming on small boats has been increasing. The Home Office said 4,540 people arrived in the first three months of the year, more than three times higher than the same three months in 2021.\n\nThe number of people arriving was boosted by much higher numbers of people coming from Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover last summer.\n\nThe Home Office said 1,094 Afghan citizens came to the UK in the first quarter of 2022, almost as many as arrived over the entire 2021.\n\nAn average £183,000 per flight\n\nThe UK has said it will pay Rwanda £120 million ($145 million) over the next five years to finance the program. On top of that, the UK has also promised to pay for the processing and integration costs for each relocated person, covering the cost of legal advice, caseworkers, translators, accommodation, food and healthcare.\n\nAccording to a parliamentary research briefing, the British government said it expects these will be similar to asylum processing costs in the UK, which stand at around £12,000 per person.\n\nThe UK has refused to disclose the cost of the flights it will charter to transport deportees to Rwanda. The Home Office said in its latest annual report it paid £8.6 million to charter 47 deportation flights carrying 883 people in 2020. While the cost of individual flights varied depending on the destination, the figures mean that on average, the Home Office spent £183,000 per flight or £9,700 per person.\n\nBecause there is no cap on the number of migrants, thousands could potentially pour into the capital Kigali within the first five years of the plan.\n\n‘We’re doing this for the right reasons’\n\nAhead of the aircraft’s previously-scheduled departure, the Rwandan government said it was standing ready to receive asylum-seekers from the UK and that it will do its best “to make sure the migrants are taken care of.”\n\n“We are asking that this program be given a chance,” said Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo at a press conference in the Kigali on Tuesday.\n\nMakolo responded to the Church of England leaders’ condemnation saying, “we don’t think it’s immoral to offer a home to people – something we have done here for more than 30 years.”\n\n“Where we’re coming from, we’re doing this for the right reasons. We want this to be a welcoming place and we’ll do our best to make sure the migrants are taken care of and that they’re able to build a life here,” she added.\n\nAlthough Rwanda is offering to help with migrants’ resettlement to a third country by providing travel transportation if they manage to obtain legal residence, “the primary objective [of the scheme] is to fully integrate them into Rwandan society,” said Doris Uwicyeza Picard, the chief advisor to the Minister of Justice.\n\n“There are legal paths to citizenship for migrant workers and for refugees provided they are eligible for citizenship,” she added.\n\nThe scheme will last five years, but Rwanda intends to turn it into a binding treaty at a later stage, said Picard.", "authors": ["Lauren Said-Moorhouse Sharon Braithwaite Arnaud Siad Ivana Kottasová Bethlehem Feleke", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Sharon Braithwaite", "Arnaud Siad", "Ivana Kottasová", "Bethlehem Feleke"], "publish_date": "2022/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/14/europe/uk-rwanda-migrant-deal-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "UK announces controversial plan to send asylum-seekers to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPeople seeking asylum in the UK could now be relocated to Rwanda under a controversial new scheme blasted by international human rights groups as “shockingly ill-conceived” and contrary to international obligations.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the scheme an “innovative approach, driven by our shared humanitarian impulse and made possible by Brexit freedoms,” on Thursday, saying that with the UK’s help, Rwanda will have the capacity to resettle “tens of thousands of people in the years ahead.”\n\nSpeaking at a joint news conference in the Rwandan capital Kigali on Thursday, UK Home Secretary Priti Patel said that people relocated to Rwanda “will be given the support including up to five years of training, integration, accommodation, health care, so that they can resettle and thrive.”\n\nPatel also called the plan a “joint new migration and economic development partnership,” saying that the UK is “making substantial investment in the economic development of Rwanda.”\n\nPatel insisted the aim of the agreement was to improve the UK asylum system, which she said has faced “a combination of real humanitarian crises and evil people smugglers profiteering by exploiting the system for their own gains.”\n\nWhen a reporter asked what the criteria would be for relocation, Patel said “we are very clear that everyone who enters the UK illegally will be considered for resettlement and being brought over to Rwanda, I’m not going to divulge specific criteria for a number of reasons.”\n\nRwandan Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta said Rwanda was pleased to work with the UK.\n\nWhen asked whether Rwanda has the infrastructure to host the influx, Biruta said the country has the capacity to receive migrants and will invest in new infrastructure to educate and house migrants with the UK’s support.\n\nBiruta added that the program will only be for people seeking asylum in the UK and who are in the UK, and that they would “prefer not to receive people from immediate neighbors like the DRC, Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania.”\n\n‘Traded like commodities’\n\nThe United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) expressed “strong opposition and concerns” about the plan and urged both countries to reconsider.\n\n“People fleeing war, conflict and persecution deserve compassion and empathy. They should not be traded like commodities and transferred abroad for processing,” UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioner for Protection Gillian Triggs said in a statement.\n\n“UNHCR remains firmly opposed to arrangements that seek to transfer refugees and asylum-seekers to third countries in the absence of sufficient safeguards and standards. Such arrangements simply shift asylum responsibilities, evade international obligations, and are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Refugee Convention,” Triggs said.\n\nUNHCR also said that the plan would increase risks and cause refugees to look for alternative routes, putting more pressure on front line states.\n\n“Experience shows that these agreements are eye-wateringly expensive usually. They often violate international law. They don’t lead to solutions, rather to widespread detention or to more smuggling,” UNHCR Senior legal officer Larry Bottinick told British radio station Times Radio on Thursday.\n\nHuman Rights Watch was fiercely critical of the plan, issuing a strongly-worded statement.\n\n“Rwanda’s appalling human rights record is well documented,” it said.\n\n“Rwanda has a known track record of extrajudicial killings, suspicious deaths in custody, unlawful or arbitrary detention, torture, and abusive prosecutions, particularly targeting critics and dissidents. In fact, the UK directly raised its concerns about respect for human rights with Rwanda, and grants asylum to Rwandans who have fled the country, including four just last year,” it said, adding, “At a time when the people of the UK have opened their hearts and homes to Ukrainians, the government is choosing to act with cruelty and rip up their obligations to others fleeing war and persecution.”\n\nAmnesty International UK’s Refugee and Migrant Rights Director Steve Valdez-Symonds described the plan as “shockingly ill-conceived.”\n\n“Sending people to another country – let alone one with such a dismal human rights record – for asylum ‘processing’ is the very height of irresponsibility and shows how far removed from humanity and reality the Government now is on asylum issues,” Valdez-Symonds said in a statement.\n\nAs part of the new plan, the British Royal Navy will take over operational command from Border Force in the English Channel “with the aim that no boat makes it to the UK undetected,” Johnson said.\n\nIt also allows UK authorities to prosecute those who arrive illegally, “with life sentences for anyone piloting the boats,” he said.\n\nThe English Channel, a narrow waterway between Britain and France, is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. Refugees and migrants fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty in the world’s poorest or war-torn countries risk the dangerous crossing, often in dinghies unfit for the voyage and at the mercy of people smugglers, hoping to claim asylum or economic opportunities in Britain.\n\nLast November, 27 people drowned in bitterly cold waters off the coast of France after an inflatable boat carrying migrants bound for Britain capsized, in one of the deadliest incidents in the English Channel in recent years.", "authors": ["Radina Gigova Sharon Braithwaite Jorge Engels Sarah Diab Bethlehem Feleke", "Radina Gigova", "Sharon Braithwaite", "Jorge Engels", "Sarah Diab", "Bethlehem Feleke"], "publish_date": "2022/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/13/uk/uk-rwanda-deportation-flight-court-appeal-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "First UK flight sending asylum-seekers to Rwanda to go ahead after ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe United Kingdom’s controversial plan to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda as early as Tuesday is set to go ahead after the Court of Appeal in London confirmed an earlier decision to deny an injunction to block the first flight.\n\nBritain’s government announced in April that it had agreed a deal to send asylum-seekers to the east African country. Those granted asylum would then be allowed to resettle in Rwanda.\n\nThe government insisted the program was aimed at disrupting people-smuggling networks and deterring migrants from making the dangerous sea journey across the Channel to England from France.\n\nThe plan sparked a wave of criticism from charities, religious leaders and international human rights groups, including the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). A small crowd of protesters gathered in front of the court on Monday.\n\nUNHCR Commissioner Filippo Grandi condemned the British government’s plan during a press conference in Geneva on Monday.\n\n“We believe that this is all wrong. This is all wrong, this deal. For so many different reasons,” he said.\n\nGrandi, while adding that the UK was signatory to the Refugee Convention, said “to export that responsibility to another country runs contrary to any notion of responsibility sharing of international responsibility.”\n\nHe also cast doubt on the UK’s rationale for the deportations, adding: ” I mean saving people from dangerous journeys is great, is absolutely great. But is that the right way to do it? Is that the real motivation for this deal to happen? I don’t think so.”\n\nGrandi continued that the UK had made the job of his agency “very difficult” and expressed concern that other countries might want to follow suit.\n\n“What am I going to tell [other countries] if they say you know, a rich country like the UK, is sending them abroad, I’ll do the same. I’ll close my border, I say, you know, I want to save them from a dangerous journey and they can go to another country. The precedent that this creates is catastrophic for a concept that needs to be shared, like asylum,” Grandi said.\n\nA separate legal case brought by the charity Asylum Aid was dismissed by the High Court on Monday. Asylum Aid was seeking an urgent injunction to halt the flight to allow judicial review of the plan to be heard.\n\nJustice Swift rejected the refugee organization’s application saying that the balance of convenience remains and “nothing has been said to make him reconsider.”\n\nAccording to data from the UK’s Ministry of Defence, 28,526 people arrived in the UK on small boats in 2021.\n\nThe legal challenge to block the deportation flights was brought by human rights groups Care4Calais and Detention Action, along with the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), a trade union that represents some of the UK Home Office workers who would be responsible for carrying out the deportations, as well as several of the asylum-seekers facing deportation to Rwanda.\n\nThe organizations claimed the policy was “unlawful on multiple bases,” and sought an injunction to stop the plane from taking off. A full court hearing on whether the plan is legal or not is scheduled to take place next month. The three groups argued no deportation flights should take place before that hearing.\n\nThey also challenged UK Home Secretary Priti Patel’s legal authority to carry out the removals, the “rationality” of her claim that Rwanda is generally a “safe third country,” given its human rights record, the adequacy of malaria prevention in the country and whether the policy complied with the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe head of the PCS, Mark Serwotka, said in a statement that the union was “very disappointed with today’s decision, and the position in which it places our members who will have to carry out these forced removals.”\n\n“Today’s judgement does not make the removal lawful – that will be decided next month. In the meantime, our members are being instructed to do something tomorrow that might be unlawful in a few weeks,” he added.\n\nSeparately, Detention Action also said it was disappointed with the ruling.\n\nIt is unclear how many people would be on the first flight on Tuesday, because many of the individuals scheduled to be deported launched their own individual legal challenges.\n\nCare4Calais said Friday that it was working with 113 people who were facing deportation to Rwanda. The charity said on Monday that only eight of the 31 people initially due to be deported to the country on Tuesday were still due to be deported, after 23 “had their Rwanda tickets canceled.”\n\nRaza Husain, who was representing the coalition that has launched the appeal, told the court that one person scheduled to be on the flight on Tuesday received a decision on Monday that they were still going to be deported despite being a torture victim, on the grounds that “Rwanda has a functioning health care system and it doesn’t raise any issues.”\n\nBritish newspaper the Times reported on Saturday that Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, privately described the plan to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda as “appalling.”\n\n“He said he was more than disappointed at the policy,” the Times reported, quoting an anonymous source. “He said he thinks the government’s whole approach is appalling.”\n\nCNN has not independently verified the Times’ report.

But it also criticized Home Secretary Suella Braverman for failing to properly assess the circumstances surrounding individual people set to be moved under the scheme.\n\nBraverman “must decide if there is anything about each person’s particular circumstances which means that his asylum claim should be determined in the United Kingdom or whether there are other reasons why he should not be relocated to Rwanda,” Lord Justice Lewis said in his ruling.\n\nShe “has not properly considered the circumstances of the eight individual claimants whose cases we have considered,” the judge continued. Those eight cases will be sent back to the Home Office for Braverman to reassess, he said.\n\nThe UK government’s partnership with the East African country has been the subject of fierce criticism since it was announced by former UK Home Secretary Priti Patel in April.\n\nIt has been backed by ex-Prime Minister Boris Johnson, his successor Liz Truss and current leader Rishi Sunak, along with most of the ruling Conservative party.\n\nBut it has a host of critics, including dozens of refugee rights groups, international agencies, British lawmakers on both sides of the House of Commons, the head of the Anglican church and some Rwandan opposition politicians.\n\nThe first flight to Rwanda was set to take off on June 14, but the European Court of Human Rights stepped in at the eleventh hour, and months of legal challenges have stalled the program in the months since.\n\nThe UK says it will pay Rwanda £120 million ($145 million) over the next five years to finance the scheme.\n\nBraverman welcomed the Monday verdict, saying in a statement that she is “committed to making this partnership work.\n\n“My focus remains on moving ahead with the policy as soon as possible and we stand ready to defend against any further legal challenge,” she said.\n\nBut the ruling was met with disappointment from campaigners, who have long contended that the plan is unethical and ineffective.\n\n“We are very disappointed in the outcome of this case.

However, it inevitably raises the question: if China tries to take Taiwan, are the United States and its allies able to stop it?\n\nAnd the alarming answer is: Quite possibly not. Analysts say China has more troops, more missiles and more ships than Taiwan or its possible supporters, like the US or Japan, could bring to a fight. That means that if China is absolutely determined to take the island it probably can.\n\nBut there’s a caveat; while China could likely prevail, any victory would come at an extremely bloody price for both Beijing and its adversaries.\n\nMany analysts say an invasion of Taiwan would be more dangerous and complex than the Allied D-Day landings in France in World War II. US government documents put the number of killed, injured and missing from both sides during the almost three-month-long Normandy campaign at almost half a million troops.\n\nAnd the civilian carnage could be far, far worse.\n\nTaiwan’s population of 24 million people is packed into dense urban areas like the capital Taipei, with an average of 9,575 people per square kilometer. Compare that to Mariupol, Ukraine – devastated in the war with Russia – and with an average of 2,690 people per square kilometer.\n\nDespite its numerical advantages in sea-, air- and land-based forces in the region, China has Achilles heels in each arena of war that would force Beijing to think long and hard about whether an invasion is worth the overwhelming human cost.\n\nHere are some scenarios of how a Chinese invasion might play out:\n\nThe naval war\n\nChina has the world’s largest navy, with around 360 combat vessels – bigger than the US’ fleet of just under 300 ships.\n\nBeijing also has the world’s most-advanced merchant fleet, a large coast guard and, experts say, a maritime militia – fishing boats unofficially aligned with the military – giving it access to hundreds of additional vessels that could be used to transport the hundreds of thousands of troops that analysts say China would need for an amphibious invasion.\n\nAnd those troops would need massive amounts of supplies.\n\n“For Beijing to have reasonable prospects of victory, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) would have to move thousands of tanks, artillery guns, armored personnel vehicles, and rocket launchers across with the troops. Mountains of equipment and lakes of fuel would have to cross with them,” Ian Easton, a senior director at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote in The Diplomat last year.\n\nGetting a force of that size across the 110 miles (177 kilometers) of the Taiwan Strait would be a long, dangerous mission during which those vessels carrying the troops and equipment would be sitting ducks.\n\n“The thought about China invading Taiwan, that’s a massacre for the Chinese navy,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThat’s because Taiwan has been stocking up on cheap and effective land-based anti-ship missiles, similar to the Neptunes Ukraine used to sink the Russian cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea in April.\n\n“Taiwan is mass-producing these things. And they’re small, it’s not like (China) can take them all out,” O’Brien said.\n\n“What’s cheap is a surface-to-ship missile, what’s expensive is a ship.”\n\nThe Chinese guided-missile destroyer Changsha returns to a port in Sanya City, China, in March 2017. Zeng Tao/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nStill, China could – given its numerical advantage – simply decide the losses were worth it, pointed out Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine captain and now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n“There’s gonna be hundreds if not thousands of (Chinese) vessels there to soak up those (Taiwanese) missiles,” Shugart said.\n\nMissiles aside, China would face massive logistical hurdles in landing enough soldiers. Conventional military wisdom holds that an attacking force should outnumber defenders 3 to 1.\n\n“With a potential defending force of 450,000 Taiwanese today … China would need over 1.2 million soldiers (out of a total active force of more than 2 million) that would have to be transported in many thousands of ships,” Howard Ullman, a former US Navy officer and professor at the US Naval War College, wrote in a February essay for the Atlantic Council.\n\nHe estimated such an operation would take weeks and that despite China’s maritime strength, it “simply lacks the military capability and capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan for the foreseeable future.”\n\nAircraft carrier killers\n\nSome of the problems that would face China’s navy in Taiwan would also face any US naval force sent to defend the island.\n\nThe US Navy sees its aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, bristling with F-35 and F/A-18 jets, as its spear in the Pacific and would have a numerical advantage in this area. The US has 11 carriers in total, compared to China’s two. However, only about half are combat ready at any one time and even these might be vulnerable.\n\nO’Brien and others point out that the People’s Liberation Army has more than 2,000 conventionally armed missiles, many of which it has developed with the US Navy’s prized aircraft carriers in mind.\n\nOf particular concern would be China’s DF-26 and DF-21D – touted by Beijing’s state-run Global Times tabloid in 2020 as “aircraft carrier killers” and the “world’s first ballistic missiles capable of targeting large and medium-sized vessels.”\n\nAs O’Brien puts it, “The US better be careful thinking about, in any kind of war environment, sending carrier battle groups close to China … If you’re fighting a state-to-state war, you’re going to stay far away from shore.”\n\nOthers are more confident in the US carriers.\n\nRear Adm. Jeffery Anderson, the commander of the US Navy’s Carrier Strike Group Three centered on the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, recently told CNN his ships are more than ready to deal with the kind of missiles that sank the Moskva.\n\n“One thing I do know about our US ships is they’re extremely survivable. Not only are they lethal, but they are extremely survivable,” he said.\n\nA Chinese air force fighter jet takes off during training exercises in 2017.

They learned very carefully from what we did in Desert Storm and Kosovo.”\n\nBut even in the air China would face significant difficulties.\n\nA guided-missile-armed J-20 stealth fighter jet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force performs at Airshow China 2018. Shu ying/Imagine China/Reuters\n\nRussia’s failure to quickly seize control of the skies in Ukraine initially dumbfounded many analysts. Some put the failure down to the cheap antiaircraft missiles Western militaries have supplied to Kyiv.\n\nTaiwan has deals with the United States to supply it with Stinger antiaircraft missiles and Patriot missile defense batteries. And it also has been investing heavily in its own missile production facilities over the past three years in a project, when completed this summer, will see its missile production capabilities triple, according to a Janes report in March.\n\nOn the other hand, China would have an advantage over the US due to its closeness to Taiwan.\n\nA recent war game run by the Center for a New American Security concluded that an aerial conflict between the US and China would likely end in stalemate.\n\nCommenting on the result to Air Force Magazine, Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, US Air Force deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said that while the US was used to dominating the skies some factors weren’t in its favor.\n\nChina had “invested in modern aircraft and weapons to fight us,” he noted, and US forces would also face the “tyranny of distance” – most of the US air power used in the war game operated out of the Philippines, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) away.\n\nThe war game simulated Chinese forces beginning their campaign by trying to take out the nearest US bases in places like Guam and Japan.\n\nHinote likened that move to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, saying China would be motivated by “many of the same reasons.”\n\n“The attack is designed to give Chinese forces the time they need to invade and present the world with a fait accompli,” he told the magazine.\n\nChina has a growing arsenal of short-, medium- and intermediate range ballistic missiles that can reach these far-flung targets.\n\nAs of 2020, the PLA had at least 425 missile launchers capable of hitting those US bases, according to the China Power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nA Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldier fires an anti-tank rocket during a live-fire military exercise in Wuzhong, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China in 2019. Reuters\n\nThe ground war\n\nEven in a scenario where China was willing to take these risks and managed to get a significant amount of troops ashore, its forces would then face another uphill battle.\n\nTaiwan has about 150,000 troops and 2.5 million reservists – and its entire national defense strategy is based on countering a Chinese invasion.\n\nLike their counterparts in Ukraine the Taiwanese would have the advantage of home turf, knowing the ground and being highly motivated to defend it.\n\nFirst, the PLA would need to find a decent landing spot – ideally close to both the mainland and a strategic city such as Taipei with nearby port and airport facilities. Experts have identified just 14 beaches that would fit the bill and Taiwan is well aware of which ones those are. Its engineers have spent decades digging tunnels and bunkers to protect them.\n\nTaiwan’s troops would also be relatively fresh compared to their Chinese counterparts, who would be drained from the journey over and would still need to push through the island’s western mud flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, toward Taipei.\n\nChinese troops could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely.\n\nAnother problem for Chinese troops would be their lack of battlefield experience. The last time the PLA was in active combat was in 1979, when China fought a brief border war with Vietnam.\n\nSoldiers of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fire a mortar during a live-fire military exercise in Anhui province, China May 22, 2021. cnsphoto/Reuters\n\nIn that effort, China “really got a bloody nose, it was not very successful operation,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n“So China’s military today is not battle tested, and it could suffer great losses, if it indeed attacked Taiwan,” Glaser said.\n\nOthers pointed out that even battle-tested troops could struggle against a well-motivated defensive force – noting that the Russian military was bogged down in Ukraine despite its recent fighting experience in Syria and Georgia.\n\nStill, as with the other scenarios, it is not only Chinese forces that might be handicapped by a lack of experience. Taiwan’s troops have also not been tested, and depending on the scenario, there are holes in even the US’ experience. As Shugart put it: “There is not a single US naval officer who has sunk another ship in combat.”\n\nWhat are the chances China attacks?\n\nGlaser, the German Marshall Fund analyst, thinks a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is unlikely.\n\n“I think that the PLA lacks full confidence that it can seize and control Taiwan. The PLA itself talks about some of the deficiencies in its capability,” she said.\n\n“And obviously, the war in Ukraine highlights some of the challenges that China could face; it is certainly much harder to launch a war 100 miles across a body of water than it is across land borders, (such as those) between Russia and Ukraine,” she said.\n\nShe noted that the strong Ukrainian resistance may be giving Taiwan’s people reason to fight for their land.\n\n“Given how Ukraine has really demonstrated a very high morale and willingness to defend its freedoms … I think that this is likely to change the calculus of not only military leaders in China, but hopefully also of (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping personally,” she said.\n\nO’Brien, the University of St. Andrews professor, wrote in The Spectator this year that any war over Taiwan would lead to devastating losses on all sides, something that should make their leaders tread carefully before committing troops.\n\n“If the Ukrainian war teaches us anything, it is that war is almost always a rash choice. Don’t underestimate your opponent, and don’t assume your systems will all work that well.”\n\nA Chinese amy tank takes part in military drills in 2018. Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAny other option?\n\nOf course, the PLA has options other than a full-blown invasion.\n\nThese include taking outlying Taiwanese islands or imposing a quarantine on the main island, Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow wrote last year in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nResidents of Taipei on edge about China after Russia invades Ukraine 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPossible PLA targets could be Taiping Island, Taiwan’s most far-flung outpost in the South China Sea; the tiny Pratas Island, a small outpost 170 nautical miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Hong Kong; Kinmen and Matsu islands, tiny territories just a few miles off mainland China’s coast; or Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWhile a PLA victory of any of the four is almost assured, it could come at the cost of galvanizing support for Taiwan in the rest of the world – much as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has united the West against it.\n\nBlackwill and Zelikow said the quarantine option might be more effective.\n\n“In a quarantine scenario, the Chinese government would effectively take control of the air and sea borders of Taiwan,” they wrote. “The Chinese government would run effectively a clearance operation offshore or in the air to screen incoming ships and aircraft. The screeners could then wave along what they regarded as innocent traffic.”\n\nAnything regarded as belligerent, such as US military aid for Taiwan, could be blocked or confiscated as a violation of Chinese sovereignty, they say. Meanwhile, China could allow the Taiwan government to function as normal except for foreign affairs.\n\nThis option would have an advantage in China’s eyes: the ball would be in the US’ court as to whether to use force to end the quarantine. Then it would be the US that would have to consider whether to risk a war that could cost countless lives.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Ivan Watson", "Brad Lendon", "Ivan Watson"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/22/africa/tunisia-mother-migrant-crisis-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Desperation and hope drive migrants onto 'boats of death' in Tunisia ...", "text": "Tunis, Tunisia CNN —\n\nA photograph of Fadi’s smiling face is emblazoned on his mother’s t-shirt. The then-20-year-old is pictured standing near the shores of the Mediterranean Sea in Tunisia.\n\nAbove her son’s image, 53-year-old Samia Jabloun has written the words “Dove Sei?” – “Where are you?” in Italian – in permanent marker.\n\nSamia often carries the scraps of IT student Fadi’s life, and the clues she’s gathered to his disappearance, in a pink plastic folder.\n\nShe says the desperate hunt for her son consumes her every waking hour: “I will search for him all my life. I will search for him everywhere. I will search for him until I know the truth.”\n\nSamia Jabloun holds up a t-shirt with a photo of her son Fadi who went missing in the Mediterranean on February 17, 2021, while he was on an undocumented migrant boat heading to Italy. David McKenzie/CNN\n\nSamia says she last saw Fadi in February 2021. Her son had traveled to the family’s home in the seaside town of Kelibia – Tunisia’s closest point to Pantelleria, an Italian Island that is a magnet for migrants trying to reach Europe.\n\n“For those few days he was acting strangely,” she says.\n\nHe told her he was going on a fishing trip with his cousins, but never came back.\n\nThe last images Samia has of Fadi come from a mobile phone video recorded at sea by another passenger on the boat. The Italian coast rises in the distance, as Fadi smiles and quotes a verse from the Quran.\n\nOne of the migrants on the smuggling boat later told Samia that he and Fadi both started swimming for shore a few miles from Pantelleria. The man said he made it to land, but that he didn’t know what had happened to her son. Beyond that, Samia has few details.\n\n“I try to get information about him every day,” she says. “I don’t know why he went. He had everything.”\n\nA migrant surge\n\nThousands of people follow the migrant trail to Tunisia each year, lured to its 700-mile-long coast by the dream of a better life just across the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe central Mediterranean is the deadliest migration route on the planet, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM): More than 24,000 people have gone missing on it since just 2014.\n\nAfter a massive peak in 2015, the number of people crossing the Mediterranean was on a downward trend – but since 2021 the number of those trying to make the journey has been climbing again and the journeys are becoming more deadly, according to the IOM.\n\nMany migrants who hope to reach Europe end up in Tunisia's capital, Tunis. Ghazi Balkiz/CNN\n\nThe United Nations and Tunisian officials say they are now witnessing the biggest surge in illegal migration to Europe since the Arab Spring began in 2011.\n\nAnd while millions of Ukrainians fleeing the war in their homeland are welcomed with open arms in countries across Europe, migrants coming from across the African continent pay unscrupulous smugglers and cram into overcrowded boats to make the treacherous voyage across the Mediterranean. Many will die in the attempt.\n\nThe recent surge in migration is good news for the criminal gangs who control the people smuggling trade along Tunisia’s coast.\n\n‘Boats with no holes’\n\nIn a hardscrabble neighborhood of Tunis, near a strip of beach where migrant boats depart, a smuggling kingpin, who connects migrants with skippers, outlines his brutal calculations in human lives. Migrants pay up to USD $2,000 each for a space on a boat to Italy.\n\n“If we organize six trips and two are caught, then four make it through,” says the smuggler, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity because of the severe criminal penalties he faces if caught and convicted for organizing departures. “There are no guarantees at sea. The authorities could catch you. Unless you die. Then death is your destiny.”\n\nA smuggling kingpin, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the trips he organizes are dangerous. Ghazi Balkiz/CNN\n\nThe vessels are often handmade in warehouses and garages in Tunis, he says.\n\n“We make sure that we have new engines and boats with no holes,” he boasts. “If the weather is good, it is like a swimming pool.”\n\nBut the Mediterranean is no pool. Migrant charities say the journey can take eight to 10 hours – if the boats make it anywhere near the coast of Italy at all.\n\nThe people smuggler says he plans to send his wife and young daughter across to Italy next year.\n\n“People leave our country because it is bad, Tunis is bad because there is no money, there is no work, there is nothing. When people go to Europe, at least they can live,” he says.\n\nPromises unmet\n\nIn the heady days of the Jasmine Revolution that helped launch the Arab Spring, many Tunisians hoped a change was on the way. But more than a decade on, that promise has been shattered.\n\n“Tunisia today is going through political, economic and social crises,” says Ramadan Bin Omar, from NGO the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights. “The Covid pandemic also resulted in even more poverty and marginalization and … pushed thousands to take the boats of death.”\n\nLast month, the Tunisian government secured a USD $130 million emergency loan from the World Bank to buy wheat for subsidized bread.\n\nAn IMF loan is on the table, but it will require significant reforms – such as reducing the public wage bill and reforming bread subsidies – that will be politically painful for President Kais Saied.\n\nTunisia imports more than 60% of the soft wheat it needs to make bread from Ukraine and Russia, an official told CNN. David McKenzie/CNN\n\nNext week, Tunisians will vote in a referendum on a draft constitution that could give President Saied more sweeping powers – such as the ability to rule by decree – and might potentially lead to protracted instability. The referendum has no minimum participation requirement and most analysts believe it has a strong chance of passing\n\nMatt Herbert, senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, says Tunisia is experiencing “increasingly fragile politics, increasingly poor economic prospects … all of these are getting worse in Tunisia.”\n\n“In part, because of this, we are likely to see the highest levels of irregular migration from and through Tunisia that we have seen since 2011,” Herbert says.\n\nIn a report released this week, the group found that migrant interceptions in the first half of 2022 by both Tunisian and Italian security forces are “well above the levels recorded during the same period in 2021.”\n\nTunisian Coastguard boats patrol the Tunisian shores looking for migrant boats. Ghazi Balkiz/CNN\n\nFrom rescue to recovery\n\nIn Bizerte, near the northernmost tip of the African continent, Col. Ayman Mbarki of the Tunisian Coastguard says even with the latest boats – funded with help from the European Union and the United States – it is impossible to stop the flow of migrants.\n\nHe says his teams try to spot the people smugglers’ boats with radar and regular patrols, but all too often they arrive on the scene to find bodies, not survivors.\n\n“We find a lot of migrant bodies of all nationalities: Tunisians and other Africans. We see elderly, we see young, we even see babies,” he says. “This affects my teams.”\n\nMbarki says that even when his teams catch migrants, once released they often try to make the crossing again.\n\n“No matter how much you train or what equipment you have, if you do not cure the deep causes of the illegal migration, then this will just continue,” he says.\n\nCol. Ayman Mbarki, commander of the Bizerte sector of the Tunisian Coastguard, says his teams often find bodies, rather than survivors. Ghazi Balkiz/CNN\n\nA continental draw\n\nMigrants flood into Tunisia from across Africa, often working for years to save enough money to pay the people smugglers.\n\nWhen authorities in Libya clamped down on migration routes and smuggling syndicates there, Tunisia became a more attractive through-point, officials here say.\n\nAnd because Tunisian smuggling rings are more decentralized, they are harder to stop, according to Herbert. Increasingly, both Tunisian and other African migrants are even smuggling themselves.\n\n“This route is the best way,” says Deborah, an Ivorian migrant who asked CNN to use an assumed name because of fears for her safety. “Here in Tunisia, it is bad, we live illegally. When we get to Europe we will live illegally too. But the conditions will be better, we have no liberty here.”\n\nDeborah hopes to make the crossing to Europe with her four-month-old daughter by saving up to use a smuggler.\n\nWhile young men used to be the most common demographic making the journey, now entire families are trying to reach Europe, in the hope that their children will be given asylum.\n\nA group of migrants from Ivory Coast agreed to talk to CNN in a thicket of scrub by the sea. Despite the risks, they hope to take the boat dangerous trip across the Mediterranean to Europe. Ghazi Balkiz/CNN\n\nDeborah meets us in a thicket of scrub near the beach where she and her daughter are hiding with four other migrants, afraid of alerting Tunisian authorities.\n\nShe works as a maid, the other adults as laborers. Their work leaves them in a precarious position – one of the migrants says their Tunisian bosses can cut off their contracts without paying them.\n\nNone of them can swim.\n\n“Often I’m afraid, but sometimes I am not afraid because I see the problems I am going through,” says Deborah, “When I see our future in my dreams, my fears vanish.”\n\nShe says that Ukrainian migrants are let into Europe more freely because they are European.\n\nBin Omar, from the Tunisian NGO, is more direct: “Political systems still look at humans based on their color, gender, religion and ethnicity and don’t look at them as people who are entitled to the same rights and at the same level.”\n\nA modest protest\n\nOutside the IOM’s compound in the Tunisian capital, Tunis, a group of about 50 asylum seekers from several African nations try to find a spot in the shade. Many of them have been here for months, waiting for help from the IOM.\n\nMultiple CNN attempts, by phone and email, to reach out to the IOM in Tunisia failed, as did knocking on the door of the compound.\n\nAbuboker Juma, originally from Darfur in Sudan, was among a group of about 50 migrants from several African nations seen outside the IOM compound in Tunis. Ghazi Balkiz/CNN\n\nAbuboker Juma sleeps on a mattress laid out under a tree nearby and tries to make a living selling materials plastic bottles for recycling.\n\nOriginally from Darfur in Sudan, he says his family was attacked during the genocide there; several of his relatives died and the rest of the family scattered.\n\nJuma fled to Libya, hoping to make it to Europe from there, but got caught up in Libya’s civil war and ended up in a series of detention camps.\n\nNow he’s in Tunis, desperate for somewhere safer to sleep, and something to eat.\n\n“As far as I know, refugees are all the same and are supposed to be treated equally, but somehow, I have a gut feeling that the UN is only made for European guys I think,” says Juma.\n\nForever searching\n\nFor those left behind in Tunisia, the wait and the search are agonizing.\n\nSamia Jabloun banded together with other mothers of missing sons to try to agitate for help. Together, they have protested at the foreign ministry and pleaded for help from the Tunisian government. Sometimes they get a hearing, but they have yet to see any results.\n\nLast year, Samia traveled to Italy with some of the other mothers to try to find Fadi. She has reached out to Tunisian and Italian NGOs for help, asking them to look for him in prisons and morgues. So far, there is no trace of him.\n\nSamia stands by a mural of her son in their hometown of Kelibia. She said his friends, who regularly visit her, painted it. The drawing has his face, the date of his disappearance, a map of Tunisia and says \"Fadi always in our hearts.\" Ghazi Balkiz/CNN\n\n“I hate El Harka,” she says, using the local term for illegal migration, “I don’t encourage people to go. The mother suffers when the son goes. The mother suffers a lot.”\n\nDespite everything, Samia is convinced that Fadi is still alive somewhere. Photos of him are dotted throughout her house, near the harbor he left in that small boat.\n\nShe often passes by a mural with a striking painting of her son next to a map of Tunisia.\n\nEvery night, she says, he visits her in her dreams. “When I am asleep, I always see him. He says to me: ‘My mother, I am not dead. I am alive, wait for me, I will arrive, I will arrive.’”", "authors": ["David Mckenzie Ghazi Balkiz", "David Mckenzie", "Ghazi Balkiz"], "publish_date": "2022/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/956349/uk-offshore-migrant-processing-plans", "title": "The UK's offshore migrant processing plans | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.
