Buhle, who was married to Hunter Biden for 24 years, told People in an interview if she is questioned about his business affairs as part of the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into his businesses, she feels she would not be consequential.\n\n“Whether or not I’m questioned, I couldn’t be of any help. I kept my head so deeply buried in the sand on our finances,” said Buhle.\n\nThe couple divorced in 2017. Buhle says she does not receive alimony from Hunter Biden. As for her current relationship with President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, Buhle says things have changed since her divorce, and now the focus is on her three daughters. “We were all really close and it was painful. It was hard for a long time,” she said.\n\nNeither the White House nor a lawyer for Hunter Biden immediately responded to CNN requests for comment on Buhle’s book and the excerpts released Wednesday.\n\nIn various excerpts about Hunter Biden from her book, Buhle discusses the tenuous state of their finances when the two were married.\n\n“He started many ventures … a real estate investment fund and then a technology company. I didn’t understand any of it, or what pieces of his businesses actually generated income for us. I worried that we lived above our means, but I did nothing to change it. The way that Hunter and I handled money was that whenever I needed any, I called Hunter. More than once my debit card was declined at a store. I’d have to call Hunter to transfer money into my account. Hunter and I drove nice cars and had a beautiful home, but we were running fast on that hamster wheel and barely staying on,” writes Buhle.\n\nIn another excerpt, Buhle says after Beau Biden’s death from brain cancer in 2015, Hunter Biden’s addiction and compulsive behavior spiraled.\n\n“In the fall of 2015, I called and texted Hunter compulsively. From my computer, I watched his every move. There were charges at Lake Tahoe at a nail salon and a charge for two lift tickets. I found a credit card charge for $10,000 at a hot tub store in Los Angeles. I found hundreds at liquor stores and strip clubs. The whole time, he told me he was healthy and sober – and I was crazy. I continually told him that I was the one person actually trying to get him sober. It became my own kind of addiction. I didn’t want to admit, to myself or anyone else, how unhealthy our relationship had become, so my struggle was just one more secret,” she writes.\n\nBuhle said Hunter Biden started to spend more time in Delaware with Beau Biden’s widow, Hallie Biden, and her two children.\n\n“After the funeral, I saw a purpose in Hunter’s work to set up the Beau Biden Foundation with Hallie and his parents. But he started spending most of his time at Hallie’s house. Our therapist told me Hunter needed to be up there, helping Hallie. ‘But what about his sobriety?’ I asked her. ‘He needs routine. He needs to be home with us.’ (The therapist) held firm that being with Hallie and her kids was an important part of Hunter’s grieving.”\n\nIn November 2016, Buhle learned of the affair Hunter Biden was having with Hallie Biden, his brother’s widow and Kathleen’s sister-in-law. Buhle details how she found out via her daughters, who had discovered the relationship by seeing text messages on their father’s phone.\n\nIn 2019, Buhle changed her married name back to her maiden name.\n\n“In many ways, my last name became a crown and shield to me; it wasn’t easy to consider giving it up. Changing my name had been as frightening as anything I’d ever done before. I was no longer a Biden.”\n\nBuhle resides in Washington, DC, where she works developing a non-profit that supports women.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/23/us/five-things-january-23-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know on January 23, 2022: Start your week smart ...", "text": "Did you go on a health kick during the pandemic?

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen Michelle Obama took the stage at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, she had a clear mission: to inject some inspiration into what had been a challenging campaign. The tensions within the Democratic Party, represented by Sen. Bernie Sanders’ unexpectedly strong showing in the primaries, had been roiling the convention since it began, and Hillary Clinton’s team had struggled to find the balance between the inspiring firsts of her nomination and the dark, chaotic energy of Donald Trump’s candidacy.\n\nIt was Obama who struck that balance, in a speech full of both urgency and possibility. The most memorable line would become a rallying cry for liberals: “When they go low, we go high.”\n\nCourtesy Nicole Hemmer\n\nFrom another speaker, such a line might have carried a whiff of liberal smugness, more high-horse than high-ground. But from Obama, someone who had not sought the spotlight and remained torn about her role in politics, it was a reminder not to follow Trump down onto the low road, to model the world in which you wanted to live.\n\nIt was also a sign that Obama might someday produce a book like her latest. “The Light We Carry” comes four years after her memoir, “Becoming,” a book that sold 10 million copies in its first months on the market.\n\nBut “The Light We Carry” is not a follow-up memoir. It’s a self-help book, one that reflects all the conventions of the genre and shows that Obama understands her appeal: not as a former first lady who has done things few people will ever be able to do, but as a person who has faced familiar challenges despite her unusual circumstances. She has an intuitive sense of how blurred the lines have become between not only the personal and the political, but between influencer and politician. In this book, Obama shows her desire to use that tangle of emotion and power to bring people together, but the ease with which feelings and politics now blend is also a reminder of how easily it that combination could also be used to divide.\n\n“The Light We Carry” grew out of both the “we go high” moment and the book tour around “Becoming.” If “we go high” became a marker of Obama’s role as a moral authority for millions of Americans, “Becoming” became a conduit through which they came to see her as someone who shared and understood their struggles.\n\nIn her new book, Obama writes about the tour that followed her memoir’s publication, when she spoke to sold-out stadiums and living-room-sized book groups. “With the space and energy to write a book and for the first time in decades being unharnessed from the political world my husband inhabited, I found myself putting in the left-out parts,” she writes about “Becoming.” “With the book, I showed myself from the inside out, less guarded than I had ever been, and I was surprised to find how quickly others dropped their guards in response.”\n\nThe moments where she felt connection were not over the glamorous bits of her life as first lady – “Nobody came up to me at book events desperate to talk about the time they’d worn a ball gown or interacted with a senator or done a White House tour” – or even her many professional accomplishments. Rather, they emerged over shared experiences of a parent living with multiple sclerosis, or an untrainable dog, or a lunch hour spent huddled in a car, the only place where, as parents of young children, they could find quiet and solitude.\n\nThat idea that her experiences could not only create connections but could be mined for useful advice became the basis for “The Light We Carry.” Though Obama is famously skeptical of politics, she is still invested in creating change. The way she thinks about change should be familiar: change first starts within, then happens in the home, then spreads to the wider community. “One light feeds another,” she writes. “One strong family lends strength to more. One engaged community can ignite those around it. This is the power of the light we carry.”\n\nFamiliar is a good way to describe this new book. Not just because it calls back to pieces of her memoir – Obama assumes you’ve likely already read “Becoming” – but because it follows the conventions of the modern self-help genre. She bolsters her advice not only with personal experiences, but also a mix of scientific studies, anecdotes and stories from both ordinary people and big-name celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda and Toni Morrison. The emotions she explores are also central to the genre: vulnerability, anxiety, authenticity.\n\nWhat makes the book so unusual, and worth reading, is that it is a first lady rather than a life coach reaching into her experiences and emotions to write it. Not because she is the only first lady to have offered advice, but because the way she packages her advice shows how much the genre has changed.\n\nFor 20 years, Eleanor Roosevelt wrote an advice column called “If You Ask Me,” which doled out practical advice on political, cultural and even romantic questions. The column ran in Lady’s Home Journal and then McCall’s, two women’s magazines that were popular in mid-century American culture. But it was a product of both its author and its time: practical, thoughtful, but also reserved – Roosevelt did not open up her innermost thoughts and private life to her readers. “There are some things in life which one should be allowed to keep to oneself,” she wrote.\n\nThe first lady, Mrs. Gerald Ford, holds a press conference is the state dining room of the White House. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nBut US culture would become more therapeutic in the years that followed, creating more space for public discussion of emotion and personal struggles. That became clear when First Lady Betty Ford divulged her struggles with addiction and disclosed that she had seen a therapist. It was both a sign of how much things had changed – such personal details about such public figures, especially political ones, had rarely been willingly disclosed in earlier eras – but also how new such sharing was that time. Ford’s disclosures startled Americans, while also helping create a culture that enabled people to talk more openly about their own struggles.\n\nSelf-help writing changed along with the culture, though it was not an area first ladies after Ford engaged with. First ladies wrote books that were not memoirs. Barbara Bush wrote a children’s book from the perspective of the first dog, Millie; Hillary Clinton wrote the policy-focused book “It Takes a Village”; Laura Bush wrote children’s books and a book on women in Afghanistan – but none like “The Light We Carry.”\n\nObama’s decision to write this book speaks both to her unusual position as, for some, a voice of moral uplift and guidance, but also her post-White House career. Through podcasting and documentaries, Obama has developed a particular brand, weightier than a lifestyle brand and more personal than a political brand. That, too, speaks to this particular culture and economic moment, when to stay engaged with people, celebrities must open the doors to their personal and emotional lives.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.

And her ultimate mission and goal, responsibility, is the institution … she’s going to go on the advice that she’s given,” Harry said.\n\nThe pair describe throughout the new episodes how, in their view, their position within the royal family became untenable after constant hounding from Britain’s media and repeated disregard for the couple’s wellbeing inside palace walls.\n\nBuckingham Palace reiterated it will not comment on the documentary on Thursday. Royal engagements are meanwhile continuing, with King Charles and Camilla, the Queen Consort, set to visit a community kitchen in London and attend a carol service with the Prince and Princess of Wales and other members of the family.\n\nHarry hinted that there was jealousy from other royals towards Meghan given the amount of media attention she was initially receiving. “The issue is when someone who is marrying in, who should be a supporting act, is then stealing the limelight or is doing the job better than the person who is born to do this,” he said.\n\n“That upsets people. It upsets the balance. Because you have been led to believe that the only way that your charities can succeed and your mission can grow is if you are on the front pages of those newspapers.”\n\nThe series also touches on Meghan’s deteriorating mental health and her miscarriage in July 2020. “I was pregnant. I really wasn’t sleeping. The first morning that we woke up in our new home is when I miscarried,” Meghan said.\n\nShe described experiencing suicidal ideation, telling the filmmakers she believed “all of this will stop if I’m not here. And that was the scariest thing about it, it was such clear thinking.”\n\n“The lies, that’s one thing. You kind of get used to that when you live within this family,” Harry added. “But what they were doing to her, and the effect it was having on her… enough. Enough of the pain, enough of the suffering.”\n\n“I just did everything I could to make them proud, and to really be a part of the family,” Meghan said in the fifth episode, speaking of her relationship with the other royals. “And then the bubble burst.”\n\n“I realized that I wasn’t just being thrown to the wolves, I was being fed to the wolves,” she said.\n\nThe couple described the breakdown in their relationship with the royal institution. Courtesy of Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\n\nA family and business ‘in direct conflict’\n\nThe highly anticipated Netflix documentary marks the Sussexes’ latest attempt to reclaim the narrative surrounding their departure from royal life.\n\nIt features details on the increasingly tense relationships between Harry and his brother, WIlliam, and his father, King Charles III. And it emphasizes the suggestion that the royals wanted to sideline and isolate the couple, often through the planting of negative media reporting, rather than have them dwarf more senior royals in popularity.\n\n“My dad said to me: ‘Darling boy, you can’t take on the media. The media will always be the media,” Harry said, describing the palace’s relationship with news outlets as a “dirty game.”\n\nThe culmination of the breakdown between the royal institution and Harry and Meghan, who were once touted by parts of the media as the modernizing force the monarchy needed, was their historic and controversial decision in early 2020 to quit as working royals and leave the UK.\n\nHarry said he spoke to Queen Elizabeth II and arranged to meet her, with Meghan, before that split was finalized.\n\n“She knew that we were finding things hard. I’d spoken to her many times about it,” Harry said. But as the meeting approached, Meghan said they received a message from an aide telling them they were not allowed to see the monarch.\n\n“I’ve actually been told that I’m busy all week,” the Queen then told Harry, according to his recollection. “I was like, wow,” Harry said. “This is when a family and a family business are in direct conflict … really what they’re doing is blocking a grandson from seeing his grandmother,” added Meghan.\n\nThe couple were critical of the Queen’s aides but again were again complimentary of the late monarch herself, who died aged 96 in September, shortly after filming concluded for the series.\n\nTheir documentary, and Harry’s upcoming memoir, focus more attention on the difficult relationship between the prince and his father, King Charles.\n\nThursday’s release follows last week’s batch of episodes, in which Prince Harry criticized “unconscious bias” inside the family.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the venture will enhance the reputation of the couple as they look to sculpt their post-royalty personas.\n\nSix in 10 Brits believe it was a bad idea for the duke and duchess to release the Netflix documentary, according to a Savanta poll of 2,250 British adults carried out online between December 9 and 11, between the release of the first and second parts of the series.\n\nThe same poll found that Harry and Meghan both have negative approval ratings among the British public – -3 and -19 respectively, when subtracting those with a negative opinion from those with a positive one – unlike the high popularity of Prince William (+60) and Charles III (+36).\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 to connect with a trained counselor or visit the NSPL site.

Three large granite markers were put up in Gillsburg in 2019, but until the exit signs were recently added, many people had to guess how to find the site in a wooded area near the Louisiana state line.\n\n“People were always asking where the crash site is. It’s very difficult to get to and there are no markings,” said said Bobby McDaniel, president of the Lynyrd Skynyrd Monument Project.\n\nThe monument has become one of the biggest tourist attractions in southwest Mississippi, since drawing 4,500 people from 13 countries, 39 states and five Canadian provinces. And that was without directions leading to the remote site 8 miles (13 kilometers) west of Interstate 55 — in a place with no cellphone service for navigation.\n\nOf the 26 people on the plane, 20 survived. Those killed were singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, his sister and backing vocalist Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary and co-pilot William Gray.\n\nMississippi legislators passed a bill requiring the state to provide exit signs for the crash monument.

Watch exclusively on CNN Sunday, November 20 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nCNN —\n\nI have a tormentor. And that tormentor is never far away. That tormentor is always ready to strike. That tormentor is me.\n\nThe torment is self-doubt. I’m a so damn tired of it. It is not always present. It tends to coyly creep in and then grow like a weed that strangles creativity, originality, motivation, novel ideas and, most of all, self-confidence.\n\nIt jabs me with cruelty, whispering in my ear that I don’t belong, that I can’t do it, that I am an imposter. It never recognizes accomplishments. It tells me my achievements are not mine but the result of luck or someone else’s brilliance.\n\nWhen it beats me down to a feeling of almost nothingness before I disappear into despair, something inside me leaps up and fights like hell against it. That is what saves me from its grip.\n\nI trick myself into believing that I am alone in this struggle with myself. It seems like everyone else has it together.\n\nAnd then I sat down with three of the world’s most recognized, powerful, wealthy, well-educated and fierce women and asked them if they had ever experienced self-doubt.\n\nThey answered with stunning honesty that hit me like a defibrillator to the heart.\n\n“Yes, every other moment I feel self-doubt,” former first lady Michelle Obama said matter-of-factly.\n\nShe did not stop there:\n\n“Society intentionally does that to women and girls. It starts at a very early age. We question our value, our worth, we question how we look, how we talk, where we’re from. There are people with power who want us to stay small, they want us to stay doubtful, and so our culture reinforces that.”\n\nObama then offered her advice to young girls in particular who are struggling with self-doubt:\n\n“The one thing I want young girls to understand is that those feelings are real, they are not crazy. They are indoctrinated in us all and we carry them around with us our entire lives,” she said. “I don’t care how far you go (in life), whether you go to the White House, you are constantly battling away those negative messages of being not enough. And yes, I deal with that too.”\n\nA reminder of just some of the things that Michelle Obama has accomplished:\n\nAfter growing up in Chicago’s South Side, she graduated cum laude from Princeton. She is a Harvard educated lawyer. At a Chicago law firm, she was a mentor to a man named Barack Obama who would later become her husband and the first African-American US president. She became America’s first Black first lady. She is a world traveler, a New York Times best-selling author, a philanthropist and a mother of two.\n\nI’m exhausted just writing down all the things she has done so far in her life and yet she battles doubt too.\n\nMelinda French Gates co-founded one of the world’s largest private charitable organizations. She was a general manager at Microsoft and a computer scientist. She holds an MBA from Duke University. She is consistently ranked as one of the world’s most powerful women by Forbes magazine.\n\nAnd yet doubt finds a place in her life, too.\n\n“I think it’s important to tell all girls that you can be whatever you want to be. You can be a mom and a working mom or a working woman and not a mom. Or be a mom and stay home. All of these choices are OK,” French Gates said.\n\nShe shared advice that she would have given to herself when she was younger:\n\n“I would say to my 25-year-old self, you knew in high school who you were. And you let go of some of that for lots of reasons: situations, college, people around you,” French Gates said. “You knew who you were. And once you learn to ‘re-be’ the girl you were in high school, is when you grew into the full woman that you could be.”\n\nAmal Clooney emigrated to England as a toddler with her family during Lebanon’s 15-year civil war. Clooney, a lawyer, has become a force in the international courts representing victims of genocide, war crimes, mass atrocities and political persecution. She literally goes after war criminals.\n\nAnd it turns out sometimes self-doubt comes along on her journeys to get justice. But she overcomes it with this mindset:\n\n“I would say define failure as not trying.

Instead of identifying as a girl, Amelia began to feel different. About six months after turning 12, Amelia was ready to lean into a new life. The young person celebrated with new pronouns: they/them.\n\n\"My pronouns now put me at a place where I can decide between different genders,\" says Amelia, 13. Courtesy Amelia Blackney\n\n“I didn’t feel like a girl, but I never really felt like a boy, so I had to find something that was in the middle of both,” Amelia said. “I settled on pronouns that didn’t represent a gender but instead put me between two genders. That way it’s like I’m not a part of any gender or I can be both genders at the same time. My pronouns now put me at a place where I can decide between different genders. That feels right.”\n\nAmelia, who now identifies as nonbinary, isn’t the only young person changing pronouns these days; across the country tweens and teens are embracing nongendered iterations of these familiar words.\n\nWhile it’s hard to find data on people who are changing pronouns, anecdotal evidence suggests that more are ditching gendered words for those that are less gender-specific and more flexible across the board. And some parts of society are keeping up: Many people in educational institutions and corporate life are including their chosen pronouns in their email signatures (some with links to why they matter), and Zoom has room for people to show their pronouns in their name listings.\n\nExperts say three main factors are driving the phenomenon: More information about gender fluidity on the internet, a spike in the number of high-profile celebrities such as Demi Lovato and Nico Tortorella embracing nongendered pronouns, and pronouns showing up more frequently in communication technology.\n\n“I’m seeing more young people pause and assess who they are separate from who people expect them to be,” said Justine Ang Fonte, a health and sex educator based in New York City. “It’s a powerful pause, a powerful reflection and exercise. It’s leading to some important realizations for everyone involved.”\n\nWhat’s in these words?\n\nAt first glance, words such as he, him, she and her seem insignificant; they’re short and monosyllabic, and they’re not nearly as formal as the proper nouns they represent.\n\nFor those grappling with gender identity, however, pronouns are a lot more than a group of words that can function as nouns, Fonte said. Using someone’s correct personal pronouns is a way to respect them and create an inclusive environment, just as using a person’s name can be a way to show that person you see and appreciate them.\n\nWhat’s more, actively choosing to ignore the pronouns someone has stated they use could imply that intersex, transgender, nonbinary and gender-nonconforming people do not or should not exist. Many who change pronouns go from the binary he/him or she/her to something more expansive such as they/them. Others opt for different versions of these traditional words — pronouns such as ey/em, ze/zir, xe/xir and more.\n\nWhile some call these alternate pronouns “neopronouns,” other experts say they’re not new at all.\n\nDennis Baron, professor emeritus of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has spent more than 40 years researching the quest for a gender-neutral, third-person singular pronoun in English, and his 2020 book, “What’s Your Pronoun? Beyond He and She,” spotlights this very subject.\n\nBaron’s interest in pronouns has uncovered more than 200 coined pronouns over time. He noted that William Shakespeare regularly used the singular “they.”\n\n“We tend to think of pronouns as a closed category, but throughout time they have been very open,” said Baron, who uses he/him. “They are common words. We tend to treat them as not very important. And yet they are powerful.”\n\nFluidity is in\n\nA growing subset of young people is taking another approach: They are adopting identities for which any pronouns will work.\n\nTake Sylvia Chesak, for example. The 14-year-old from Cincinnati said they use “any pronouns,” which is a conscious decision to accept any pronoun at any time — a reflection of a gender identity Sylvia said is rich, deep, complicated and beautiful.\n\n\"People my age talk about gender/sexuality identity very openly,\" says Sylvia, 14. Courtesy Sylvia Chesak\n\n“With my old pronouns I just struggled to imagine myself as she/her and I struggled to just hear she/her,” Sylvia wrote via text message. “When I realized that I was uncomfortable thinking of myself like that I began exploring more pronoun options. I saw someone online who used any pronouns and started imagining myself as identifying like that. It was the first time I felt comfortable imagining myself and who I was, and I decided to feel good about myself (so) I would start using any pronouns.”\n\nSylvia added that roughly one-third of their fellow ninth graders have changed pronouns in the last year or two.\n\n“People my age talk about gender/sexuality identity very openly, often asking unprompted about people’s pronouns,” Sylvia wrote. “I’m glad to be in a community that understands how important pronouns are, while also willing to discuss them in any environment.”\n\nThese sorts of comments make Ignacio Rivera happy.\n\nRivera, who uses they/them pronouns, is founder and director of the HEAL Proect, a Somerville, Massachusetts-based nonprofit that teaches kids about healthy living.\n\nRivera noted nongendered pronouns apply to all people, not just those in the queer and gender-nonconforming communities. They added that it’s critical to encourage young people to explore their own identities in a variety of ways.\n\n“Denying young people that right only speaks to the power and control adults have over young people; it doesn’t allow for them to experience life on their terms,” Rivera said.\n\nBroadening the conversation\n\nPronouns certainly have become part of the zeitgeist in the modern era.\n\nActors, singers and celebrities who have come out as nonbinary or gender fluid in recent years include Lovato, Tortorella, Cara Delevingne, Ruby Rose and Sam Smith.\n\nPronouns also are popping up in books for children and for young adults.\n\nThe 2021 children’s book “What Are Your Words?” focuses squarely on the topic, presenting it in a way that is accessible and understandable for children as young as age 4.\n\nAuthor Katherine Locke wrote the words to the book, hoping that it will spark conversations between kids and adults about gender and pronouns overall.\n\n“I want kids and parents to understand that pronouns can change, just as we can change,” said Locke, who uses they/them. “Many adults don’t have the language to talk about pronouns and gender. Kids innately do. The book is a moment for kids to model behavior for their parents. It’s a chance to learn that who children are discovering themselves to be is worth celebrating.”\n\nMaia Kobabe, a nonbinary author and illustrator who uses e/em/eir pronouns, turned eir life story into the 2019 autobiographical graphic novel, “Gender Queer.” The book contains images that prompted school boards in 11 states to ban or challenge it last year. By the end of the narrative, Kobabe has taken readers through a journey to gender independence.\n\n“I began to think of gender less as a scale and more as a landscape,” Kobabe wrote. “Some people are happy to live in the place they were born, while others must make a journey to reach the climate in which they can flourish and grow.”\n\nSparking conversations with others\n\nIt’s one thing for tweens and teens to embrace new pronouns; it’s something entirely different for the grown-ups in their lives to embrace the new words.\n\nFonte, the sex educator, suggests grown-ups can incorporate a simple query about pronouns into their standard greeting when meeting a young person for the first time.\n\n“In addition to asking, ‘What’s your name?’ you can ask, ‘What are your pronouns?’ ” she said. “We can’t assume a specific pronoun or gender identity because someone is wearing a skirt, or they play football.”\n\nFor parents of kids who change pronouns, the initial response is everything.\n\nData from the Family Acceptance Project, an ongoing research effort at San Francisco State University, indicates that how parents and families react to kids when they come out or share information about their gender identities has lifelong impacts on children’s mental health, wellness and physical health.\n\nRivera, from the HEAL Project, said the best way to digest news of new pronouns is with curiosity.\n\n“You can say, ‘Wow! Thanks for telling me. What do these new words mean to you?’ ” they said. “If you’re curious about something, that means the young person will be comfortable responding to you. If you’re interested in what they have to say, they’ll feel safe and continue sharing.”\n\nJessica Carroll, director of programs at Positive Images, an LGBTQ center serving kids in Sonoma County, California, said parents can admit they likely will “mess up” a child’s new pronouns many times before incorporating the words into everyday parlance. Carroll added that the burden is on parents to adapt.\n\n“Don’t wait to be corrected. Make the effort to fix mistakes,” she said. “Showing you are committed to embracing a young person’s pronouns will go a long way to making that child feel heard and seen.”", "authors": ["Matt Villano"], "publish_date": "2022/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/04/opinions/heartstopper-queer-teen-love-story-wellness-hetter/index.html", "title": "Opinion: \"Heartstopper\" is the queer teen love story I didn't know I ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Katia Hetter is CNN’s senior editor for science and wellness.

View more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nI am happily paired off with my partner, out to my family and in my workplace, and to you, dear reader. And yet I am sitting in my house with my family, holding back tears while watching “Heartstopper,” the queer teen love story I didn’t know I needed.\n\nBy now you probably know of Alice Oseman’s powerful Netflix adaption of her graphic novel, “Heartstopper,” which tells the story of two boys, Charlie and Nick, played by Joe Locke and Kit Connor, who fall for each other in the sweetest possible way in vaguely present-day Britain.\n\nIt’s an innocent love story that so many of my out peers and I wish we had had growing up. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, I didn’t know how to deal with what was inside me in the conservative California town where I grew up – even though I attended a performing arts school where many boys (but no girls) were out.\n\nThere were no Buzzfeed quizzes or social media influencers to tell me what I always knew to be true. Thankfully, there was always art and culture, and I eventually found the comics of Alison Bechdel; the books of Rita Mae Brown, Dorothy Allison and Armistead Maupin; the ache of “Brideshead Revisited” on PBS; and later, movies like “Go Fish” and “The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love.” I saw some aspects of my teen and young adult life in those books, shows and movies, and it showed me there was a world where I might fit in.\n\nI came out my senior year in college, surrounded by fellow students who had come out before me. They became my own #Heartstopper crowd – my Darcy, Tara, Tao and Isaac – and I loved them for supporting me and really saving my life. They shared their wisdom and compassion and spoke up in their classes, despite physical threats and a lack of protections for their rights.\n\nAlthough plenty has changed in the intervening decades since I was in college – marriage is legal in the United States (for now), modern television shows have out characters and most major metropolises have pride parades – the bullying can be just as intense for anyone who steps outside the norms of their school or community, as Oseman and her cast and crew know.\n\nSome 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide over the past year, according the Trevor Project’s annual survey, which was released in May. But parents can make a difference: LGBTQ youth who felt high social support from their family said they attempted suicide at less than half the rate of those who felt low or moderate social support.\n\nActor Olivia Colman plays Sarah Nelson, Nick Nelson's mom, in the Netflix series \"Heartstopper.\" Netflix\n\nLuckily for me, I did have a supportive mother who embraced me when I came out to her, just like Nick’s mom did in “Heartstopper.”\n\nSusan Nelson, played by the Oscar award-winning-actor Olivia Colman, reacts positively to the news and tells him, “Oh, baby. Thank you for telling me. I’m sorry if I ever made you feel like you couldn’t tell me that.”\n\nThat scene reminded me of my own mother, who told me, “I didn’t want it to be hard for you,” before noting her struggles growing up in 1940s Cuba as a bespectacled girl who wanted more and sharing her own journey immigrating to the US.\n\nIn that one conversation, my mother Rebecca Hetter jumped on board. Within a short time of me coming out to her, she was coming out for me everywhere, appearing on local Spanish language TV to explain loving her lesbian child. She even proudly outed me to fellow customers at the local car wash – where frankly, I didn’t see the need.\n\nAnd that’s where parents and guardians come in. Throughout my life, my mom told me how much she loved me, “no matter what.” She marked my soul with her love from birth. I knew in my bones that I could do anything, and she’d still be there for me.\n\nA research psychologist, she knew what love could do. She said the same thing to many of my high school friends, many of them straight, who struggled with abuse, absent parents and bullying. She loved them, too.\n\nShe’s 85 and still says it: Love your children and your children’s friends, and support them, even if you don’t get it at first. You’ll be saving their lives, and they will return the love to you and the world they inherit.\n\nIt’s what I think “Heartstopper” creator Oseman, director Euros Lyn, executive producer Patrick Walters, LGBTQ+ consultant Jeffrey Ingold and so many more people gave to the cast and crew of “Heartstopper” in all of their trans, lesbian, gay, bisexual, Black, Asian (and more) glory. And it’s what the entire “Heartstopper” team gave to all of us.\n\n“Mom,” I said on a recent phone call. “There’s a mom just like you in this new Netflix show, and she’s played by Olivia Colman.”\n\nCrickets. As it turns out, seeing someone play a great parent supporting her child wasn’t so interesting to her. (She prefers Tom Selleck in “Blue Bloods.”) Of course, you should love your children, she thinks, and support them.\n\nSo it goes, to my own child. “I love you as you are, and you don’t need to do anything to earn that love.” It’s something I’ve said for years and still say every chance I get. Cue the bored look from the teen (who did give “Heartstopper” five stars). But still, I wash, rinse, repeat.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced in early 2020 that they were stepping back from their roles as “senior” royals, effectively quitting the royal family, they described a culture of familial tension, relentless scrutiny and certain misogyny. They no longer wished to be trailed by the media, obsessed over, watched. Harry didn’t want to be constantly reminded of his mother’s tragic death every time he and Meghan were photographed; Meghan didn’t want to be tabloid fodder for what she wore, how she did her hair, where she was from or how much she did or didn’t enjoy the spotlight. They wanted to reach financial independence, live as regular people, raise their children in private.\n\nCourtesy of Peggy Drexler\n\nAnd yet, here they are, taking part in — co-producing, in fact — “Harry & Meghan,” a new six-part docuseries whose first three episodes dropped this week, detailing their lives with a never-before-seen look into the couple’s “personal archive,” commentary from close friends and family members speaking out for the first time and lots of direct access to Harry and Meghan themselves in interviews filmed over the last few years. The series opens with individual self-taped video diaries by Harry and Meghan from back in 2020 — the first clue that perhaps they never really intended to keep their private life private after all.\n\nIndeed, what we learn from “Harry & Meghan” is that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are less interested in staying out of the spotlight than in staying in complete control of how that spotlight makes them look. But, well, that’s just not how celebrity works.\n\nWhich is just one reason “Harry & Meghan” is a royal disappointment. The couple quit the family because they didn’t want the attention. But, very clearly, what they didn’t want was the negative attention, or any criticism whatsoever — a very primitive (and, ironically, very royal) attitude. In life — in real life — there is no good without the bad. The production, then, is an effort not to be revealing in an honest and genuine way, to reveal “the full truth” that “no one knows” — as Harry says in the film’s opening few minutes — but to drum up sympathy for themselves. Indeed, when asked why she wanted to make this documentary, Meghan answers, “When you feel like people haven’t gotten any sense of who you are for so long, it’s really nice to just be able to have the opportunity to let people have a bit more of a glimpse into what’s happened and also who we are.”\n\nBut who’s to say that people haven’t gotten a glimpse of who they are? What makes their version — a heavily produced, edited and controlled version — more honest than any version of their lives that’s come before? It’s striking how much the filtered version of events functions in the series as their version of real life. Meghan recalls how when she first got connected with Harry, she wanted to review his Instagram feed as a way to get to know him, and social media posts comprise a significant portion of the archive that guides their narrative together.\n\nNetflix\n\nHarry and Meghan’s fatal flaw — both the couple’s and the film’s — is in thinking they can control how others see them. None of us can. And that the couple keeps trying, despite also asking to be left alone, reflects a naive outlook and disingenuous attitude that viewers will pick up on, especially against the fact that the documentary strives to portray them as “more grounded” than the rest of the royal family. In reality, they may be the most out of touch of them all.\n\nJust as disappointing is the series’ content, which is a lot of the same we’ve already seen or heard. There are some new aspects — friends who’ve never commented, photos we’ve never seen — but otherwise there’s little payoff and little to change people’s minds about them. It’s self-promotional, self-aggrandizing and, frankly, a little boring. They do not come off as more likeable and, in fact, perhaps a lot less so. Notably, it’s perhaps the first time that much of the dislike is directed toward Harry, instead of just Meghan.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.

With “Harry & Meghan,” it’s clear that he’s willfully chosen to see what he wants to see.\n\nIn fact, if “Harry & Meghan” is a ploy to get people truly disinterested in their comings and goings, well, that’s the one area where they may have succeeded. “I just really want to get to the other side of all of this,” says Meghan to the camera in the opening minutes of the first episode.

Chris Christie is expected to enter next week at an event in New Hampshire.\n\nTrump mocked some presidential hopefuls who are \"polling at 1 or 2 percent.\"\n\n\"I don't know what they're doing,\" he said. \"Some of them are pretty stupid. They say they're running for VP or the cabinet, maybe they are. Some of them won't get that.\"\n\nMore:5 times Ron DeSantis took some pointed jabs at Donald Trump in Iowa while campaigning\n\nIn the days leading up to his arrival in Iowa, Trump and his allies have attacked DeSantis on a range of issues, from Social Security and Medicare to ethanol.\n\nHis campaign has shored up his support among Iowa state lawmakers, sending out a press release with quotes from three who have endorsed him; another lawmaker, Rep. Shannon Lundgren, endorsed Trump on Tuesday, citing his record on anti-abortion policies in a column for the Register.\n\nAs he ended his speech in Urbandale, Trump acknowledged the primary battle would likely grow ugly in the months leading up to the caucuses.\n\n\"We have a nasty race ahead of us,\" he said.\n\nGalen Bacharier covers politics and the Trump campaign in Iowa for the Register.

And he also fought against Social Security,” Trump said, calling DeSantis “Ron DeSanctus.”\n\nTrump leaned into the attacks after appearing to hesitate, suggesting, “Maybe I shouldn’t mention this part. But we have to!”\n\nDeSantis made his first trip to Iowa last week, holding events in Davenport and Des Moines, where several Republican attendees said they had previously supported Trump but were interested in someone who could take the party in a new direction.\n\nHe made few references to the former president, instead focusing on his agenda in Florida.\n\nDeSantis has previously supported repealing the Renewable Fuel Standard, which mandates how many gallons of biofuels must be blended into the nation’s fuel supply each year — a key component of Iowa’s ethanol industry.\n\nHe also previously embraced a 2012 plan by then-U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan that would have made changes to Medicare and Social Security. However, more recently, DeSantis told Fox News, “We’re not going to mess with Social Security as Republicans.”\n\nTrump made a similar vow Monday: “I will not be cutting Medicare, and I will not be cutting Social Security,” he said to applause.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds introduced the former president at the Adler Theater in downtown Davenport and watched his speech from the front row of the audience. She said Trump never turned his back on middle America.\n\n“In short, he delivered for Iowa,” she said.\n\nTrump was joined onstage by a group of Republicans who announced their endorsements of the former president earlier Monday. They included former acting U.S. Attorney General Matt Whitaker, former 1st District U.S. Rep. Rod Blum and state Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, a Republican from Wilton who is serving as a senior adviser to Trump’s Iowa campaign.\n\nTen other eastern Iowa legislators offered their endorsements of the former president Monday.\n\nTrump was met by a large, boisterous crowd that cheered, chanted and sang as he took the stage. Many more who could not get in waited outside and snapped photos in the cold as Trump’s motorcade arrived at the theater.\n\nSome in the audience relished Trump’s attacks on DeSantis. But the biggest applause came as the former president railed against some of Democratic President Joe Biden’s policies and promised to enact more conservative ones around issues such as banning vaccine mandates, putting restrictions on transgender athletes and supporting parents’ rights in education.\n\nAt one point, Trump marveled at the huge response he received for talking about education issues.\n\n“I basically said, ‘Parents you have rights,’ and the place goes crazy,” he said. “Because our country has gone crazy with this nonsense.”\n\nDonald Trump tries a taste of retail politics in Davenport\n\nTrump’s return to the Iowa caucus campaign trail mirrored his 2015 effort in many ways, including a focus on his place in the polls, the size of his crowds and biting invectives against the media.\n\nBut it also included a few notable departures from his previous playbook.\n\nAfter his plane touched down at the Quad Cities International Airport in Moline, Illinois. about 4:30 p.m., Trump traveled by motorcade to the Machine Shed restaurant in Davenport where he mingled with Iowans who happened to be eating dinner.\n\nHe was met with cheers, and he posed for photos with a trio of people wearing \"Trump won\" T-shirts and red \"Make America Great Again\" hats.\n\nHe asked the group whether they planned to attend his evening rally, and he promised them it would be a big crowd — \"A lot bigger than last week's crowd. A lot bigger than the guy that just showed up,\" he said in an apparent jab at DeSantis.\n\nIt's the kind of retail politicking that has made Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses famous, but which Trump eschewed in his 2016 run.\n\nHe doubled down on that approach, opening his event to audience questions at the conclusion of his speech — another feature of typical caucus campaigns that Trump rarely engaged in during his previous run.\n\nHe was asked about transgender athletes, supporting farmers and more.\n\nDonald Trump suggests he may not need to be ‘too aggressive’ to do well in Iowa\n\nTrump returns to Iowa as a clear leader in national polling of the presidential primary field, and his campaign is hoping to cash in on years of campaigning in the state and a built-in well of support.\n\nBut he was slower to arrive than some of his rivals, trailing declared and potential rivals such as U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, former Vice President Mike Pence and DeSantis, who have all made appearances in the first-in-the-nation caucus state this year.\n\nA new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll, released last week, shows that while he retains substantial support among Iowa Republicans, it has begun to erode.\n\nThe poll showed that the percentage of Iowa Republicans who say they would “definitely” vote for Trump if he were the GOP nominee in 2024 has fallen by 22 percentage points, from 69% in June 2021 to 47% today.\n\nHe is viewed favorably by 80% of Iowa Republicans — but that’s down from 91% in September 2021. At the same time, Trump’s unfavorable numbers have climbed, with the percentage of Iowa Republicans viewing him unfavorably more than doubling — from 7% in 2021 to 18% now.\n\nThere’s nothing locked in about Iowa for Donald Trump,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., which conducted the poll.\n\nIowa Poll:Trump’s Republican support erodes as DeSantis' favorability starts strong\n\nStill, Trump suggested he may not need to aggressively campaign in Iowa in order to do well.\n\n“I wouldn't think I'd have to really be too aggressive,” he told reporters ahead of his Monday speech. “We've done a good job for the farmers. No president has ever done more for the farmers than I have. Nobody.”\n\nHe pointed to his stronger poll numbers.\n\n“Well, we have a much bigger crowd and I think we have much better poll numbers as you've probably seen — much better,” he told reporters. “And they love me in Iowa, and I love them.”\n\nDeSantis has emerged as the early favorite to take on Trump, according to national polling. A Real Clear Politics rolling average of national polls shows 43% of respondents say Trump should be the Republican nominee for president, while about 28% say it should be DeSantis.\n\nIowa caucuses:Where and when are presidential candidates visiting Iowa?\n\nNo other potential candidate is currently polling in double digits.\n\nTrump said during his speech that Iowans can help him “Make America great again.”\n\n“America will be a free nation once again and with your support in these caucuses — we will always keep you there — we're going to complete our mission,” he said. “We're going to see that job through.”\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

He added: \"You know, Hezbollah is very smart ... They’re all very smart.”\n\nTrump additionally criticized Netanyahu in an interview with Fox News Radio over the Hamas attack. \"He was not prepared,\" Trump said. \"He was not prepared and Israel was not prepared.\"\n\nDuring his Iowa appearances, Trump did not mention Netanyahu and Hezbollah. He focused instead on Iran and President Joe Biden, blaming both for the outbreak of more violence in the region earlier this month.\n\nTrump first sought to clean up the damage with social media posts and written statements over the weekend. In a Truth Social post, Trump included the hashtags #IStandWithIsrael” and “#IStandWithBibi.\"\n\nRepublican criticism of Biden over Israel\n\nTrump's opponents for the Republican presidential nomination have spent days denouncing his comments on Israel, saying they undermined an ally in the midst of a crisis and could embolden Iran.\n\n“He’s a fool,\" said former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. \"Only a fool would make those kinds of comments. Only a fool would give comments that could give aid and comfort to Israel’s adversary.”\n\nFormer South Carolina governor - and United Nations ambassador - Nikki Haley said Trump's comments underscore that he is out of touch. \"It's why I continue to say it is time for a new, generational leader,\" Haley said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, speaking on Fox News, said Trump seems to have a personal beef with Netanyahu because the Israeli prime minister called Biden to congratulate him on winning the 2020 election, despite Trump's protests about the race.\n\nSaying that \"attacking Bibi was a huge mistake\" from Trump, DeSantis argued that it was \"personal for him to come out and take shots at Bibi just days after Israel had suffered the worst terrorist attack in its history.\"\n\nTrump enjoys big leads in state and national polls, including ones conducted in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nTrump's gag order\n\nIn both speeches on Monday, Trump again criticized his criminal prosecutions and civil trials, though he held off on specifying Justice Department prosecutor Jack Smith and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan.\n\nHours earlier, Chutkan issued a gag order that puts limits on what Trump can say about prosecutors, witnesses, and court personnel. The judge said Trump did not have the right to use his campaign to mount a \"smear campaign\" against legal officials.\n\nWhile Trump did not single out individuals, he did claim that \"they've weaponized the Justice Department and the FBI,\" and he protested the new order. This order does not apply to the charges he faces in Georgia over allegations he tried to steal the election in the Peach State.\n\n\"I'll be the only politician in history that runs with a gag order where I'm not allowed to criticize people,\" Trump said during his first speech in Adel, Iowa.\n\nIn his second set of remarks, in Clive, Trump did not mention Chutkan by name, but said: \"The judge doesn't like me too much.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/01/trump-iowa-hannity-desantis-biden/70279359007/", "title": "Trump's Hannity town hall: Attacks on DeSantis and Biden in Iowa", "text": "Former President Donald Trump on Thursday combined two familiar venues − Sean Hannity's talk show and the state of Iowa − to lay out some campaign themes, particularly attacks on President Joe Biden, a variety of criminal prosecutors and Republican challenger Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\n\"I really go after the one who's second,\" Trump said of DeSantis during a friendly town hall in Clive, Iowa, located near Des Moines.\n\nA week after DeSantis officially entered the race, Trump also referenced the importance of the Iowa caucuses and protested the litany of investigations into his past conduct.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nTarget DeSantis − ignore others\n\nCheered on by an enthusiastic pro-Trump crowd, the ex-president repeatedly mangled DeSantis' name, joked about his recent run-in with a reporter and indicated he would continue to attack the Florida governor for as long as he stays competitive in the Republican nomination race.\n\n\"I don't think he's going to be second that much longer,\" Trump said at one point. \"I think he's going to be third or fourth.\"\n\nDonald Trump draws a huge field of 2024 opponents: Here's why that could help and hurt him\n\nTrump also mocked some of his other opponents, citing low polling numbers for challengers like former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.\n\n\"I don't understand what they're doing,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier in the day, DeSantis told a New Hampshire radio show that Trump's name-calling is turning off voters.\n\n\"I think it’s so petty,\" DeSantis said. \"I think it’s so juvenile. I don’t think that’s what voters want. And honestly, I think that his conduct, which he’s been doing for years now, is one of the reasons he’s not in the White House now.\"\n\nAre more indictments coming?\n\nTrump appeared to brace his supporters for the possibility of more criminal charges in the future, describing the series of investigations against him as political \"election interference.\"\n\nTrump, who is under investigation over taking classified documents and attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss, has made the same arguments for months − including before his March indictment in New York City over false reporting of hush money payments to a former mistress.\n\nThe former president did not discuss the specifics of the latest allegation: A CNN report that he discussed classified information about a prospective attack on Iran with two people who helped former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows with his memoir.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it,\" Trump told Hannity. \"All I know is this, everything I did was right.\"\n\nThe Iowa caucuses are crucial\n\nThrough the hour-long event, Trump kept referring to issues of importance to Iowa voters, whose caucuses early next year will open the Republican delegation selection process. Topics ranged from abortion to agriculture policy in a state where religious conservatives and farmers are key voters.\n\n\"There's no way I lose Iowa,\" Trump said, echoing comments he made while campaigning earlier in the day.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, cited Trump's boast that his appointees to the Supreme Court voted to strike down Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"In what was mostly an incoherent, rambling appearance full of recycled lies on Fox News, Donald Trump told the truth at least once in his safe space − no one did more to pave the way for abortion bans across the country than him,\" the DNC said.\n\nHitting Biden\n\nTrump, responding to Hannity's questions, spent more time attacking Biden than his Republican opponents.\n\nThat included Biden's age, as the Fox host asked about the 80-year-old president's trip-and-fall and speech delivery during graduation ceremonies at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nTrump claimed he asked Hannity not to joke about Biden's situation, but did say the Air Force incident was \"sad\" and that Biden \"doesn't understand what is happening in the world.\"\n\n\"That was a bad fall,\" said Trump, who is 76 years old himself.\n\nBiden got right back up after he tripped over a sandbag left on the stage. After returning to the White House hours later, he joked to reporters that \"I got sandbagged!\"\n\n'You need six months'\n\nTrump continued to make big promises, saying again that he could stop the Russia-Ukraine war \"in 24 hours,\" a claim that members of both parties have denounced as irresponsible.\n\nDuring his discussion of the war, Trump found time to again criticize DeSantis for saying he would need two terms to \"slay the deep state\" and address problems caused by bureaucracy.\n\n\"You need six months,\" Trump said during the town hall, repeating statements he made earlier in the day.\n\nAsked about Trump's claim, DeSantis said: \"My question to him would be: Well, you already had four years, why didn’t you slay it then?”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2023/07/28/iowa-gop-lincoln-dinner-draws-2024-contenders-to-des-moines-friday/70457582007/", "title": "13 GOP presidential candidates speak at 2023 Iowa Lincoln Dinner", "text": "A full slate of Republican presidential candidates, including former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov.

He highlighted his administration's tariffs on China that directed money to U.S. farmers, his reworking of a North American trade deal and his support of ethanol and E-15 fuel.\n\n\"Iowa has never had a better friend in the White House,\" he said to begin his remarks.\n\nTrump criticized Biden's withdrawal from the war in Afghanistan, arguing it \"was the incentive for Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine.\" He waved off his multiple pending civil and criminal court cases, saying that \"if I weren't running, I would have nobody coming after me.\"\n\nHe continued to cite baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election was \"rigged,\" and he ticked off a number of polls that showed him with significant leads in the early states.\n\n\"There's only one candidate, and you know who that candidate is,\" Trump said. \"He's going to get the job done.\"\n\nVivek Ramaswamy promises to shut down federal agencies, bring about a ‘revolution’\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy promised Republicans to take on the “bureaucratic deep state” by shutting down a swath of federal agencies if elected president.\n\n“When you have an agency that should not exist, an agency that has become so corrupt that it has abandoned the rule of law, from the U.S. Department of Education to the FBI, to the IRS, to the ATF, to the CDC, we will not just reform them, we will shut them down,” Ramaswamy said. “That is how we restore the integrity of a constitutional republic.”\n\nRamaswamy said there are “good people” in the Republican presidential race who will advocate for reforming federal institutions. But that is “a false promise,” he said.\n\n“They don’t know it’s a false promise,” he said. “But when those institutions, when that government, when that deep state has become so rotten we can no longer just fix it from the top. This is not a moment for reform. I don’t stand for reform. I stand for revolution.”\n\nLarry Elder says MLK wanted a 'colorblind society'\n\nConservative radio talk show host Larry Elder said he’s running for presidency to address the issues that just aren’t “being talked about.”\n\nThere’s an “epidemic” of children growing up without fathers, said Elder, who anchored his speech around his father's journey from the segregated South to California.\n\nElder told guests that his father, a lifelong Republican, was an eighth-grade dropout who later joined the Marines but struggled to get a job after he completed his service. The only job Elder's father was able to find, he said, was one that involved cleaning toilets.\n\nBut over the years, Elder said his father later came to own a restaurant, the property next door to his business and a home — which is still in his family.\n\n“Not too shabby,” he said.\n\nDuring his speech, Elder promoted school choice, saying that public education especially in cities like Chicago and Baltimore is a “disaster” and that initiatives driving diversity, equity and inclusion are “opposite” of what civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. called for.\n\n“He wanted a colorblind society, not a color-coordinated one,” he said.\n\nRyan Binkley urges Republicans to look ‘beyond 46’\n\nRyan Binkley, a businessman and pastor from Texas, urged Republicans to look “beyond 46” to the future for new ways to grow the GOP after Joe Biden is out of office.\n\nBinkley, a little-known candidate, contrasted himself against some of his better-known opponents.\n\n“I’m not standing on this stage and I’m not in this race because I want to extend a brand name,” he said. “I’m not selling a book. I don’t have any other mission. I’m not looking for another position. Literally, some words came to my heart about eight years ago from God for our country.”\n\nHe said it’s time for America to have an economic and spiritual revival by going “beyond 46.”\n\nHe said the phrase has a few meanings, and “the first one is obvious.”\n\n“It means going beyond our 46th president of the United States, President Joe Biden,” Binkley said. “I’m sure you’re in agreement with that. President Biden has led us to really one of the greatest places of disunity in our lifetime.”\n\nBut, he said, Republicans also need to find a way to grow the party after electoral losses in major cities and among young people.\n\n“This is the open door for the Republican Party,” he said. “We have a chance to grow our party. We have a chance to lead a movement ... to change the culture of our country and to secure our economic freedom. But the question remains: are we going to do it?”\n\nFrancis Suarez touts Miami's growth, decrying 'Bidenomics'\n\nSuarez, aiming to make the jump from mayor of Miami to the White House, spent much of his remarks criticizing the Biden administration's approach to the economy while touting his city's growth and approach to law enforcement.\n\n\"We never got into the defund police nonsense, the no cash bail nonsense,\" said Suarez. \"We are a city of law and order.\"\n\nThe U.S. \"needs the personality of someone who is a solver of problems, someone who can bring people together,\" he said. He pointed to what he viewed as existential threats — the \"rising threat of China\" and the \"national crisis\" of fentanyl.\n\nHe referenced Sound of Freedom, a Christian film currently in theaters that focuses on sex trafficking and has faced criticism for its depiction of trafficking and perceived ties to the QAnon conspiracy movement.\n\nSuarez acknowledged that his campaign didn't have the resources of those polling well ahead of him but still urged attendees to give him consideration.\n\n\"I don’t have a fancy bus, I don’t have a private plane,\" he said. \"But we do have these amazing towels with my name on them for the Miami heat that I've brought up here.\"\n\nWill Hurd says Donald Trump is only running for president 'to stay out of prison'\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Will Hurd said former President Donald Trump is running for another term in the White House for one reason: “to stay out of prison.”\n\n“Donald Trump is not running for president to make America great again,” said Hurd, whose remarks were received with boos from the crowd. “… But if we elect Donald Trump, you’re willingly giving Joe Biden four more years in America.”\n\nHurd explained to guests the reason why the \"red wave\" didn't materialize and why Trump lost the last election. It's because, he said, Trump \"failed\" to grow the Republican party and reach voters who are \"women with college degrees, Black and brown communities and people under the age of 30.”\n\n“We need leaders who like your Gov. Reynolds went to places that people didn’t expect — and that’s how y’all turned red,” he said.\n\nMike Pence calls for ban on transgender troops and new leadership for the Republican Party\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence sought to create a break from his former running mate, Donald Trump, during his speech at the dinner.\n\n“I believe we must resist the politics of personality and the siren song of populism unmoored to conservative values because different times call for different leadership,” Pence said, a line he has delivered before. “To defeat Joe Biden I believe we must give the American people new Republican leadership, leadership with a proven commitment to the conservative agenda.”\n\nPence has repeatedly led the Republican field in calling for more restrictive abortion bans around the country.\n\n“We can end Biden’s radical abortion agenda by doing just what you all did recently here in Iowa, and that is promoting pro-life laws in states across the country,” Pence said. “And I believe the time has come for a minimum national standard of a 15-week ban at the federal level.”\n\nBut despite an enthusiastic response from Reynolds when she mentioned the state’s new abortion law, Pence’s line drew little applause from the crowd.\n\nHe got his best response of the night by promising to ban transgender troops from serving in the U.S. military.\n\n“We can end the political correctness at the Pentagon including reinstituting a ban on transgender personnel in the United States military,” Pence said.\n\nDoug Burgum hones in on personal background, navigating 'global economy'\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum focused on introducing himself to the crowd of Iowans, touting his youth holding blue-collar jobs and his rise through the global economy as the head of a software startup.\n\n\"Imagine a president who knows what it takes to compete and win in a global economy,\" Burgum said, after criticizing Biden on his approach to foreign affairs and the country's financial health.\n\nHe called for a robust energy-independent United States to \"beat China in the cold war,\" urging the country to \"stop buying energy from our enemies and start selling it to our allies.\" And he pointed to his rise in a 2016 Republican primary for governor, where he oversaw tax cuts and other conservative policies in North Dakota. References to small-town living permeated much of his remarks.\n\n\"'Woke' is something we used to do every day when we got up at 5 a.m.,\" Burgum said. \"Some of our big cities could use some small town values.\"\n\nAnd he earned some half-hearted boos, and then laughs, when he referenced North Dakota State's previous wins over Iowa and Iowa State in basketball.\n\n\"Too soon? Too soon?\" he asked jokingly.\n\nPerry Johnson calls out Vivek Ramaswamy on following similar platforms\n\nAmid his usual stump about the economy, longshot presidential candidate Perry Johnson called out one of his opponents — Ohio tech executive Vivek Ramaswamy — for following his lead on specific platforms.\n\nJohnson, a Michigan businessman, said he's publicly shared with voters his plans to dismantle the FBI and pardon former President Donald Trump — and that Ramaswamy has promoted similar ideas afterward.\n\nAs Johnson spoke of impeaching President Joe Biden, he said Ramaswamy is going to \"go along with this one, too.\"\n\nThroughout his speech, the 75-year-old shared tidbits of his childhood, growing up in a middle-class family and facing eviction notices while in graduate school. He pushed forward a message about the American dream – one that he wants his three teenage children to be able to see.\n\n\"I want them to have the American Dream available to them,\" he said.\n\nTim Scott describes the values he learned from his grandfather: ‘kneel to the Father’ and ‘stand for the flag’\n\nU.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina focused on his history, describing his upbringing with his grandparents and the lessons they taught him.\n\nHis grandfather, he said, taught him two lessons: to “kneel to the Father in prayer” and to “stand for the flag in respect.”\n\n“He said, ‘Son, you can be bitter or you can get better. But you can’t be both,’” Scott said. “These were valuable lessons.”\n\nScott said he also learned his values from his mother, who worked long hours as a nurse’s aide.\n\n“She taught me that there is dignity in all work and that if you’re able-bodied in America, you work,” Scott said. “That’s called America. If you take out a loan, you pay it back. And if you commit a violent crime, you go to jail. And if God made you a man, you play sports against men.”\n\nThen he turned his focus to Joe Biden.\n\n“These are simple, common-sense lessons of America,” Scott said. “But Joe Biden and the radical left, he is attacking the values that made this possible.”\n\nAs president, Scott said he would support law enforcement, protect the Southern border and invest in critical industries in America.\n\nScott said he is “living proof” that anything is possible in America.\n\n“Protecting the values of America is protecting the rungs on the ladder that allow the poorest, most vulnerable students in this nation to climb,” he said. “We must protect our values. I’m running for president because I know America can do for anyone what she’s done for me.”\n\nRon DeSantis gets standing ovations, attacks Kamala Harris in ongoing fight over Florida slavery curriculum\n\nDeSantis, delivering remarks at the dinner after a multiple-day bus trip through Iowa, received the best reception of the night thus far.\n\nAs he ticked through the pivotal aspects of his campaign message — his record in Florida, his aims to halt \"weaponization\" of the federal government and his pledge to \"rip the politics out\" of the military — he received consistent applause from the crowd. He took and left the stage to standing ovations from a portion of those in attendance.\n\n\"I'm running for president because we as Republicans cannot be content with simply managing the decline of our country a little better than the Democrats,\" DeSantis said.\n\nHe also attacked Vice President Kamala Harris, who has criticized new educational standards in Florida that she and others say undermines critical conversations around slavery, in part instructing that enslaved people \"developed skills\" for \"personal benefit.\"\n\nDeSantis' defense of his state's new curriculum has drawn criticism from several Black Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, whom he said this week are siding with \"the left\" and the vice president. He said Harris was creating \"phony narratives\" about the new standards.\n\n\"We have beaten the left's agenda in the state of Florida, so she thinks she can come down and lie about what we're doing,\" DeSantis said. \"I'm not budging an inch. We are going to fight back against these people, and we are not letting them take over our schools any longer.\"\n\n2024 Iowa caucuses:Ron DeSantis says Tim Scott, DC Republicans are buying the left's lies on slavery lessons\n\nAsa Hutchinson calls to move on from Trump, pending legal battles\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson took a direct line of attack at Trump, proposing that the Republican Party needs a \"serious\" leader.\n\n“We need a new direction for America and for the GOP,” the 72-year-old said just before his mic was cut off at the 10-minute mark. “We are a party of individual responsibility, accountability and support for the rule of law. We must not abandon that. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln. We are the party of Ronald Reagan, and we think it’s time for serious leaders to meet the serious challenges.”\n\nHutchinson, like Haley, voiced concerns about border policies and a \"struggling\" economy and touted pivotal points in his career, including being the youngest state's attorney.\n\n\"This last week, they announced that we're going to have higher interest rates that impact your pocketbook, your mortgage payment, your ability of your children to buy their first home, and so we have to get the economy back on track. It is a result of too much spending by the administration,\" he said.\n\nReferencing Mitch McConnell, Nikki Haley again calls for mental competency tests for politicians over 75\n\nFormer U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley spoke first, rattling off a string of policy proposals, including term limits for the presidency and members of Congress.\n\n“If this week didn’t prove it to you, we’ve got to have mental competency tests for anyone over the age of 75,” Haley said, repeating a position she’s advocated on the campaign trail.\n\nThis week, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 81, froze for nearly 30 seconds during a news conference and seemed unable to speak for several seconds. He later returned to answer reporters’ questions and said he was fine.\n\n“That’s not being disrespectful,” Haley said of the competency test proposal. “These are people who are making decisions on our national security. They’re making decisions on our economic policy.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden is 80 years old and former President Donald Trump is 77.\n\nThe questions on the tests are simple, Haley, 51, said, like “how many grandchildren do you have?” It was an apparent reference to President Joe Biden belatedly acknowledging his 4-year-old granddaughter living in Arkansas, who his son Hunter Biden fathered out of wedlock.\n\n“What?” she said, as the crowd laughed. “I don’t know what y’all are laughing at.”\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds thanks lawmakers for in-person caucus law\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds spoke ahead of the crowd of presidential candidates, saying she wanted to give \"a heartfelt huge thank you to our legislators that are here tonight for passing legislation that really prevented Democrats from holding a primary and going ahead and Hampshire.\"\n\nReynolds signed a law earlier this year to require the Iowa caucuses to take place in person. Iowa Democrats have proposed allowing mail-in participation in their party's caucuses.\n\nShe addressed New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, who was in the audience.\n\n\"Now, my colleague is somewhere out there, Gov. Sununu. And this is a collaboration and partnership that we've held for a long time, our first-in-the-nation caucus, our first-in-the-nation primary. I hope, Chris, you know that we've gone to great lengths to make sure that we keep that intact.\"\n\nA prayer and a Jason Aldean shout-out begin the night\n\nAttorney General Brenna Bird began the event by leading the crowd in prayer. Then the crowd gave the Pledge of Allegiance and heard a rendition of the national anthem.\n\nRepublican Party of Iowa Chair Jeff Kaufmann brought up the controversial Jason Aldean song \"Try That in a Small Town\" by referencing Iowa small-town traditions and praising Gov. Kim Reynolds.\n\n\"In Iowa small towns we stand up for the anthem,\" Kaufmann said. \"In Iowa small town we protect women's sports. In Iowa small towns we believe in the power the people to make decisions with their own money. And in Iowa small towns, we support leaders led by a governor, the best governor in the United States of America.\"\n\nThe song has received criticism for lyrics that some have said contain elements of racism, but conservatives have rallied around the tune, boosting its place on the charts.\n\nEvent marks first time Trump, DeSantis will appear on same Iowa stage\n\nThe event marks the first time Trump and DeSantis both have attended the same event in Iowa. While DeSantis has appeared at events like U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst's Roast & Ride and The Family Leader's annual summit, Trump has opted to skip them — instead returning every few weeks for Fox News town halls and stops at restaurants and campaign volunteer events.\n\nMore:Candidates try to clear GOP debate fundraising hurdles. Is it changing their Iowa strategy?\n\nDeSantis' appearance and remarks at the dinner follow an Iowa bus tour put on by his super PAC Never Back Down, as the governor's campaign moves forward from a \"reset\" that included significant staff layoffs and a pivot in messaging and strategy.\n\nTrump, who in recent weeks has attacked Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for her declining to endorse ahead of the caucuses, remains the far-and-away frontrunner in the race. He's widely expected to be indicted soon in a third case, as his campaign operation continues to pay his legal bills amid attempts by his challengers to chip away at his polling lead.\n\nDemocrats trash Republicans' record in morning news conference\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz held a news conference Friday morning with Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart criticizing Trump's record and touting Democratic leadership.\n\n\"We still have more work to do, but the contrast between the results we’ve seen under Democratic versus MAGA Republican leadership could not be more stark,\" Walz said. \"Every single Republican candidate for president on stage tonight is proposing an extreme agenda that would hurt our economy and take us backwards.\"\n\nHart accused the Republican candidates of peddling \"divisive rhetoric and extreme policies.\"\n\n\"Iowans remember just how difficult Donald Trump’s agenda made life for us and understand that we can’t afford four more MAGA years no matter who the candidate ends up being,\" Hart said. \"Farms went bankrupt. Jobs were shipped overseas. All the while the ultra-wealthy and corporations lined their pockets on our backs.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2023/09/20/trump-visiting-eastern-iowa-as-campaign-plans-increased-stops/70892177007/", "title": "Donald Trump campaigns in Maquoketa, Dubuque, Iowa amid ...", "text": "DUBUQUE, Iowa — Former Republican president Donald Trump took credit for ending Roe v. Wade while campaigning in Iowa Wednesday, but he cautioned that Republicans can't win in 2024 unless they \"learn how to properly talk about abortion.\"\n\n\"You have to follow your heart. You can’t do it for just the election,\" he said at a campaign event in Dubuque. \"But you have to follow your heart. At the same time, you have to win elections, otherwise, we’ll be back where we were.\"\n\nHe reiterated his belief that abortion hindered Republicans' chances in 2022 — comments that have rankled some Iowa faith leaders.\n\n\"This issue cost us unnecessarily but dearly in the midterms,\" he said. \"It cost us dearly, really, and unnecessarily.\"\n\nHis visit comes after he gave a controversial interview to NBC's Meet The Press, where he criticized Florida's six-week abortion ban as \"a terrible mistake.\" That law closely mirrors Iowa's six-week abortion law, which Republicans have cheered.\n\nThe comments have frustrated prominent conservatives, including Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, who posted to social media Tuesday that “It’s never a ‘terrible thing’ to protect innocent life.\"\n\nMore:Donald Trump to campaign in Iowa amid Republican backlash to his recent abortion comments\n\nTrump didn't discuss a six-week ban or other policy proposals while campaigning Wednesday. But he said Republicans must be willing to cast Democrats as the \"radicals\" on abortion.\n\n\"Like Ronald Reagan before me, I believe in the three exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother,\" Trump said. \"I believe in that. I think it’s very important. Without the exceptions, it is very difficult to win elections. We would probably lose the majorities in 2024 without the exceptions and perhaps the presidency itself.\"\n\nBut even as some Republicans express concern that Trump may be backtracking on his support for the anti-abortion movement, Democrats have been adamant that his past record should indicate what he's likely to support in the future.\n\nTrump, who appointed three U.S. Supreme Court justices and laid the path for the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, has drawn fire from anti-abortion activists for saying \"I think both sides are going to like me\" on the issue.\n\nOne prominent group has called on Republican presidential hopefuls to support at least a 15-week federal ban on abortion.\n\nCraig Kolwaski of Dubuque, who attended Wednesday, told the Register that he is \"pro-life\" and the former president's comments were concerning but wouldn't be enough to stop supporting him in the caucuses.\n\n\"I'd like to agree with him on 100% of the things,\" said Kolwalski, who is hosting a \"President Trump Unity Rally & 2020 Election Denial Conference\" next week in Wisconsin. \"It's not gonna happen. But on the big ones, you know, in the MAGA base ain't moving.\"\n\nThat was a common sentiment among others who attended Wednesday's events.\n\nMary and Wayne Wagoner, who attended the Maquoketa rally, both said they were hoping to \"hear more\" from him on the issue of abortion, which he did not mention. But he remained their first choice in the caucuses.\n\nDonna Jean Knickrehm of Eldridge, when told about Trump's recent comments, referenced his history on abortion during his first term and said she believed he would remain a leader on the issue.\n\n\"I'm confident that he will be the right man, absolutely,\" she said. \"I mean, he sorted us out previously. He will do the same.\"\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Ronald Horan of Maquoketa, who acknowledged that there was \"room for negotiation\" on the issue of abortion when it comes to exceptions for the mother's health, rape and incest.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident he's still going to do what we want to do,\" said Horan, who supports Iowa's abortion restrictions that start at around six weeks.\n\nDeSantis said in an interview with Radio Iowa on Monday that Trump's remarks on abortion show \"the danger\" in reelecting him — an uncommon instance of direct, named criticism from the governor who has previously closely allied himself with Trump on policy and politics.\n\nThe frontrunner is set to skip the second presidential debate Sept. 27 as he did the first, instead planning to visit Detroit to address auto workers as the UAW strikes against major manufacturers.\n\nAugust's Iowa Poll found that Trump holds a commanding lead over the remainder of the field — a more than 2-to-1 lead over his closest challenger in DeSantis.\n\nAhead of Trump's visit Wednesday, Iowa Democrats criticized Trump, with chair Rita Hart arguing that he was \"facing the reality that his unpopular abortion record isn't defensible.\"\n\n\"In Iowa, we almost saw a near-total ban go into effect because Donald Trump nominated the three justices that realized the MAGA goal of overturning Roe v. Wade and stripping away the constitutional right to abortion that Americans have relied on for nearly 50 years,\" Hart said.\n\nIn Maquoketa, Donald Trump turns his attacks on Joe Biden\n\nEarlier in the day at a Maquoketa campaign stop, Trump criticized President Joe Biden on both policy and personality here Wednesday as he rallied supporters to prepare for what he believed would be a \"historic\" turnout and victory.\n\n\"We want to get through the caucus, we want to get through it right away,\" Trump told several hundred supporters who gathered at an event center on the Jackson County Fairgrounds. \"We're going to win the Iowa caucuses in a historic landslide.\"\n\nTrump's speech, the first of two he was delivering in eastern Iowa Wednesday, showed he remains confident in his frontrunner status in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, continuing to lead the pack over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other rivals.\n\nAnd while he did criticize DeSantis — attacking the Florida governor's record on ethanol and cuts to Social Security and Medicare with the nickname \"DeSanctimonious\" — much of his ire was directed at Biden and the wider Democratic Party. His Republican challengers, he said, had \"crashed and burned.\"\n\nHe lamented the Biden administration's approach to immigration and foreign policy, declaring that Democrats are \"no good at policy, they're no good at borders,\" while promising to bring back \"the greatest economy\" with lower gas prices and a hard line on international affairs.\n\n\"We have stupid people running our country, very stupid,\" Trump said.\n\nAnd he mocked Biden's energy and approach to the press, touting his recent interviews during which Trump said he sat for an hour and took \"32 questions.\"\n\n\"Biden can't do that,\" Trump said, before holding up a binder, squinting at it and reading the ABCs.\n\n\"Isn't it nice when you have a president who doesn't have to read a script?\" he said.\n\nGalen Bacharier covers politics for the Register.

Joni Ernst's second annual Roast and Ride fundraiser at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. And although he skipped the \"ride\" portion of the event — a 42-mile, 400-person motorcycle ride through central Iowa — Trump joined a slew of Iowa Republicans for a rallying of the political troops and a family-friendly pork barbecue.\n\n“We will use immigration law to prevent crimes,\" he said, delivering his remarks off a teleprompter. \"And we will not wait until some innocent American has been harmed or killed before taking action. We will move justly, but we will move fast, believe me. And we will move tough.”\n\nOBRADOVICH: Trump in Iowa: Clinton 'doesn't look presidential'\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee later welcomed to the stage the family of Sarah Root, a 21-year-old Council Bluffs woman who was killed in a vehicle crash caused by an immigrant in the country illegally.\n\nTrump's appearance comes after a week in which he acknowledged a possible \"softening\" of his immigration stance, talking broadly about approaching the issue in a more \"humane manner.\"\n\nTrump has built his campaign on a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States to keep out undocumented immigrants while also calling for the mass deportation of those in the country illegally. He's pledged to unveil his immigration policy over the next week.\n\n“I am with him 1,000 percent on immigration,” said Diane Brock of Newton, a retired airline operations manager who echoed the sentiments of many attendees. “The illegal alien criminals have got to go. It is not fair to the people who have been waiting to get into this country legally.”\n\nOthers said that even if Trump has somewhat softened his stance, they would be unconcerned with a possible reversal in his policy.\n\n\"It would be too hard to send everybody back,\" said Gale Livingston, a retired Ames resident who plans to vote for Trump in November. \"He had to soften his stance. It doesn’t make me think less of him. In fact, it makes me think more of him.”\n\nTrump also took some time to give a rhetorical nod to Iowa’s agriculture industry, touching on issues such as the Renewable Fuel Standard, environmental regulations and threats to family farms.\n\n“Family farms are the backbone of this country,” he said, promising to end the \"EPA intrusion\" into family farms.\n\nTrump promised to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard and corn-based ethanol, eliminate burdensome regulations like the Waters of the United States rule (“which is a disaster”) and provide tax relief.\n\n“President Obama lied to you about his support for the Renewable Fuel Standard,” Trump said. “And you can trust Hillary Clinton far less than you could even Obama.”\n\nBarack Obama campaigned in Iowa on his support of the RFS. But his administration’s Environmental Protection Agency has rolled back the level of ethanol that must be blended into the nation's gasoline.\n\nDemocrats, in turn, criticized the gathering, with Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Andy McGuire saying in a statement: \"While other Republicans have distanced themselves from Trump’s candidacy and warned of the dangers of his leadership, Iowa Republicans, up and down the ticket, choose to stand with Trump and continue to condone his divisive rhetoric and rationalize his unpredictable behavior.\"\n\nIn advance of the event, the Clinton campaign issued a joint statement from Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Patty Judge and U.S. House candidates Rep. Dave Loebsack, Jim Mowrer and Kim Weaver that said of Trump: “No matter what he says, he can’t revise his history of attacking veterans, women, African-Americans, Latinos and Americans with disabilities. This is who Donald Trump is.\"\n\nALSO SATURDAY: Ashton Kutcher to Iowans: Clinton is one of us\n\nThe Roast and Ride event was intended to boost support and enthusiasm for Iowa Republicans as they enter the final stretch of the election cycle. Trump praised those Iowa Republican representatives who were on hand, including Ernst; U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley; U.S. Reps. Rod Blum, David Young and Steve King; Gov. Terry Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds.\n\n“A lot of states would like to have that roster, believe me,\" Trump said.\n\nLast year's inaugural event drew seven Republican presidential contenders to Boone, though Trump was not among them. At the time, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was leading the pack of potential candidates, and Iowans still had nearly eight months to decide whom to caucus for.\n\nSaturday, some Iowans said they were still deciding whether they would vote for Trump.\n\n“As far as his overall politics that he has, I’m pretty on board with that,\" said Carla Davis, a 64-year-old Altoona resident and a registered nurse. \"I would just say it’s more personality, demeanor. He’s just so rough around the edges that, you know, it scares me to have him sitting by that red button.”\n\nDavis said she is a registered Republican and won't vote for Democratic nominee Clinton, but she would consider voting for a third-party candidate over Trump.\n\nThis was Trump's fourth Iowa event since accepting the GOP nomination last month in Cleveland, and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, also has made two solo stops.\n\nUp for grabs are Iowa's six electoral votes, with recent polling indicating a too-close-to-call race. A Real Clear Politics rolling average of August polls shows Clinton with a slim advantage of 1.5 percentage points — well within the margin of error.\n\nFull speech: Donald Trump at Ernst’s Roast and Ride\n\nErnst told reporters that if she could give the Trump campaign advice as he courts Iowa voters, it would be to focus on policy issues and Clinton's record.\n\n“Hillary Clinton has given us so much to talk about, really, with the email scandal, her really bad policies overseas,\" she said. \" ... That’s not acceptable — to be doing the name-calling back and forth. They need to focus on the issues.\"\n\nAnd Trump remained largely on message Saturday, targeting his attacks to Clinton's policies, resorting only once to personal insult to say he didn’t think Clinton looked presidential — a remark that was not included in prepared remarks released to the media.\n\nThe response from those in the audience was largely favorable.\n\n“I thought his comments were pretty good,\" said John Nahas, a steelworker and Des Moines resident. \"We don’t have a country if we don’t have a border. Sanctuary cities are ignoring the law. I think he is a just person and he wouldn’t ignore the law.”\n\nFunds raised at the event will benefit SoldierStrong, a charity for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Last year's event raised about $15,000 for America's Fund.\n\nDes Moines Register reporter Bill Petroski contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/07/desantis-trump-indictment-attack-fbi/70541629007/", "title": "DeSantis, GOP candidates stay quiet on Trump charges, attack FBI", "text": "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa − Days after former President Donald Trump was indicted on conspiracy charges relating to attempts to overturn the 2020 election, Republican presidential candidates in Iowa called for massively changing − or dissolving − the Department of Justice and the FBI.\n\nBut, despite their fervor against federal agencies, the candidates shied away from specifically discussing Trump’s latest charges.\n\nSeven GOP hopefuls converged in Cedar Rapids on Sunday night, speaking at a fundraiser for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson. Hundreds of Iowa Republicans mingled with the candidates over a pulled pork dinner, then settled in for two hours of speeches.\n\nHinson was the only member of Iowa’s D.C. delegation to post on social media after Trump’s latest indictment was unveiled Tuesday. She told a cheering crowd Sunday that she “will not stand for the un-American politicization of our justice system under President Joe Biden.”\n\nA federal grand jury indicted Trump on charges of conspiring to overturn Biden's election, including actions that resulted in the insurrection Jan. 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIowa Republicans attending the Hinson fundraiser and weekend campaign events for Gov. Ron DeSantis had mixed opinions about the latest Trump charges − the third criminal case he faces. Some denounced Trump, arguing his legal troubles hurt his candidacy.\n\nKevin Brezina, a 66-year-old Tama resident who attended a DeSantis event Saturday, said he feels sorry for the former president, but his top choice for 2024 is DeSantis.\n\n“I don’t think (Trump is) going to make it,” Brezina said. “I wish he’d bail out … because of all this stuff that’s going on.”\n\nOthers rallied behind Trump and decried the charges.\n\n“They’re just trumped-up charges to try to get people to become weary of Trump,” said Susie Burns, 74, of Fairfax. “And I’m not gonna let them win. … I’m more convinced now that I’m not going to let the Democrats destroy Trump to the point where I’m going to vote for somebody else. No, he’s got my vote for sure.”\n\nRepublican presidential candidates target Justice Department, 'deep state' corruption\n\nTrump’s name was hardly mentioned at Sunday’s “cattle call” of candidates, but four of the seven who showed pledged to overhaul or dissolve the Justice Department and the FBI, eliciting cheers from the crowd.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy and Perry Johnson, both of them businessmen and newcomers to politics, pushed for a complete shutdown of agencies they say are overcome by corruption.\n\n“I am going to shut down the FBI,” Johnson said. “The reason I say that is that we have too much corruption − it’s been going on for literally 45 to 50 years. I say we end it. The Department of Justice, that has to be dismantled, because we have corruption there, too.”\n\nJohnson was the only presidential candidate Sunday night to mention Trump’s legal troubles. He reminded the crowd that he pledged in March to pardon Trump if he is elected.\n\n“I think that it’s unfair that we start picking on our candidates and letting the Democrats decide who should be running. This is not right,” Johnson said.\n\nEven before criminal charges were brought against Trump, Ramaswamy had proposed a dissolution of federal agencies far beyond law enforcement. He reiterated his plan to a supportive crowd in Cedar Rapids.\n\n“When there are government agencies that should not exist, that have become so corrupted that they have lost their original purpose − from the FBI to the ATF to the IRS to the CDC to the U.S. Department of Education − we will not just reform those agencies, no,” Ramaswamy said Sunday. “We will get in there and we will shut them down.”\n\nDeSantis pledged to “slay the administrative state,” though he did not call for shutting down any agencies.\n\n“You’re going to get a new FBI director on day one. You’re going to get the DOJ cleared out,” DeSantis said. “There’s going to be a single standard of justice in this country again, and we are going to stop the weaponization of federal power.”\n\nHinson’s event was the final stop on DeSantis’ three-day swing through Iowa. DeSantis told reporters Friday that Trump’s claims that the 2020 election was stolen were “unsubstantiated.”\n\nDeSantis also announced his 40th Iowa legislative endorsement Sunday night: Republican state Rep. Tom Gerhold.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump, said he would reform the FBI and the Justice Department.\n\n“We are a party that believes in our justice system, but we want it to work fairly, we want it to work rightly for the people of our country,” he said.\n\nHutchinson did not go on the attack against the former president, as he did at a GOP fundraising dinner in late July. There, Hutchinson told Iowa Republicans they will be caucusing “while multiple criminal cases are pending against former President Trump,” and he urged them to chart “a new direction for America and for the GOP.”\n\nRadio personality Larry Elder, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley stayed far away from discussion of the U.S. justice system or Trump’s entanglement with it.\n\nElder spoke about his family history and decried the “epidemic of fatherlessness,” which he attributes to government welfare programs.\n\n“We’ve incentivized women to marry the government,” Elder said. “We’ve incentivized men to abandon their financial and moral responsibility.”\n\nBurgum criticized Biden’s policies on energy, the economy and national security.\n\n“D.C. needs more small-town values,” he said. “They need more understanding of what’s going on in America in small towns.”\n\nHaley focused her entire speech on national security, saying the country was “totally distracted” from foreign threats by “a bunch of other things that don’t even matter.”\n\n“All of these issues are big issues,” she said. “But if we don’t have national security, none of it matters.”\n\nIowa Republicans diverge on opinions of latest indictment\n\nRepublicans who attended political events this weekend had a wide range of opinions about the criminal charges against Trump.\n\nOn one end of the spectrum was Roger Lutes, 62, a farmer from Ferguson who called Trump a “dictator.”\n\n“If Trump gets in, he’ll try to take it over like he did the last time,” Lutes said at a DeSantis event in Tama. “He admires Putin, he admires the Chinese guy, because he’s a dictator himself. Nobody ever tells him no.”\n\nSome Republicans said that they were following the Trump news but that it wouldn’t necessarily sway their decision in the caucuses.\n\n“It doesn’t really bother me much. It doesn’t change my opinion of him,” said Danette Spurgeon, 48, a nurse from Hiawatha who attended the Hinson fundraiser. “It seems like there’s always something that is going after Trump.”\n\nDawn Coffman, 69, from Williamsburg, said she was following the indictment news and the misdemeanor charges against Hunter Biden.\n\n“I believe it’s a circus on both sides,” said Coffman, who saw DeSantis in Grinnell. “I’m tired of it.”\n\nLynn O’Connell, 74, of Cedar Rapids, said at the Hinson fundraiser that the indictments were “playing dirty.”\n\n“Every time I hear another indictment, I’m like, 'Yeah, now I’m really going to vote for Trump.'”\n\nKatie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register.

She's pursued an ambitious and polarizing legislative agenda over the past year while also acting as a liaison for the large presidential field, appearing alongside a number of candidates courting support for the caucuses.\n\nFrustrations with Reynolds on the part of Trump and his campaign, first reported by The New York Times, bubbled to the surface in the former president's post. It prompted criticism from prominent Iowa leaders and Republican insiders, who argued it could hurt Trump's standing in the critical first caucus state.\n\nOn Thursday, Iowa state Sen.

Jeffery Strugg, 31, was discovered missing from community-based facility in Prichard on Sunday, according to a notice from the Alabama Department of Corrections. The agency didn’t release any information about how Strugg got out. He surrendered without any violence in Mobile County, corrections officials said. Strugg was 18 when he was sentenced to 29 years in prison after being convicted in the 2007 killing of Dewone Smiley, 15, in Selma, court records show. Strugg was accused of entering an apartment and shooting Smiley, a student at Selma High School, to death in front of two witnesses. Strugg is eligible for parole consideration Dec. 1, prison records show.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state House on Saturday voted against accepting a spending package passed by the Senate that included payments of about $5,500 to residents. The vote to concur with the Senate package failed, with 18 members in favor of accepting the Senate plan and 22 against. The vote sets the stage for a conference committee, with the regular legislative session set to end by Wednesday. In a conference committee, House and Senate negotiators are tasked with hashing out differences between the state budgets that passed each chamber. The House, in its version of the budget, included a dividend of about $1,250 plus a $1,300 “energy relief” check. The Senate plan called for a dividend of about $4,200 from Alaska’s oil wealth fund, an amount in line with a long-standing formula last used in 2015. The Senate plan also included a $1,300 energy check. Some lawmakers have argued the state is benefitting from high oil prices and can afford to help Alaskans who are struggling. But critics of the higher payments to residents say oil prices are volatile, and the oil price in the state revenue forecast can’t be assured.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A federal appeals court has upheld a judge’s ruling overturning a federal agency’s approval of Toronto-based Hudbay Minerals Inc.’s plan for a new open-pit copper mine in southeastern Arizona. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the U.S. Forest Service’s approval of a permit for the Rosemont Mine project in a valley on the eastern flank of the Santa Rita Mountains near Tucson went beyond what is allowed under a federal mining law. The appellate court cited the planned use of Coronado National Forest land for long-term storage of waste rock, not actual mining, and the lack of valuable minerals on that property. Hudbay Minerals officials said in a statement Thursday that they were reviewing the ruling and would continue to pursue alternative plans for mining part of the Rosemont copper deposit on nearby private lands. A coalition of environmental and tribal groups challenging the mining hailed the appellate court’s decision, the latest in a series of legal obstacles to the project. “This momentous decision makes it clear that Hudbay’s plan to destroy the beautiful Rosemont Valley is not only a terrible idea, it’s illegal,” said Allison Melton, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. Hudbay has another mine project in the works on the western flank of the Santa Ritas.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A raccoon ran loose in the stands during Arkansas baseball’s Friday matchup with Vanderbilt, but a fan came to the rescue. Fayetteville native Grant Harmon grabbed the raccoon with his bare hands and held it up to cheers from the crowd at Baum-Walker Stadium as members of the Commodores’ bullpen looked on from left field. The incident was dubbed by fans on social media as the “rally raccoon,” as the Hogs came back to tie the game after being down 5-0 and then 6-5. Despite that, the rallies ultimately fell short as Vanderbilt won 9-6 in 10 innings. After grabbing the raccoon, Harmon continued to carry it out of the stadium. “The opportunity just came about, and I guess I just took action and grabbed it,” he said. “That was a first. I have no prior experience grabbing raccoons.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nModesto: The state will acquire a sprawling former farm property in the San Joaquin Valley and create a new state park for the first time in 13 years. Dos Rios Ranch, where the San Joaquin and Tuolumne rivers meet southwest of Modesto, will become California’s 280th state park and the first new one since Fort Ord Dunes near Monterey in 2009, the Modesto Bee reports. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday earmarked $5 million for the new park as part of his revised budget proposal for the fiscal year starting July 1. The nearly 4-square-mile expanse featuring willows and valley oaks will be donated by River Partners, a conservation group that’s spent the past decade restoring the site. State Parks Director Armando Quintero said Friday that the property will serve “a park-poor region” – the San Joaquin Valley – and help address inequities in access to state recreation sites. “Everyone deserves to have close access to vibrant parks, and this opportunity is an exciting one,” Quintero said. Dos Rios could get trails, picnic areas, restrooms and other basics within five years, state parks officials said. Campgrounds could follow within another five years, the Bee reports.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The city is enacting a fire ban after a series of blazes have spread quickly in hot and dry conditions, including a fatal one caused by smoking. Under the ban taking effect Monday, smoking and grilling will be banned in parks in Colorado’s second-largest city. People grilling at home will only be able to use gas or liquid fuel, not charcoal or wood, and chain saws must have spark arresters. Welding or torching work may still be allowed but only with a permit, the Colorado Springs Fire Department said. A woman died in a fire Thursday at a mobile home park that was blamed on “the improper disposal of smoking materials,” city spokesperson Natashia Kerr said. Eight homes were destroyed. Under the ban, smoking materials must be disposed of in a non-combustible container with a lid. Meanwhile, a wildfire in the foothills southwest of the city that also started Thursday has burned 2.4 square miles. The fire near the former mining town of Cripple Creek was 27% contained Monday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A former assistant police chief’s lawsuit claiming he was defrauded out of the police chief’s job can go forward, a state appeals court has ruled. James Nardozzi’s lawsuit stemmed from the hiring scandal that landed the city’s police chief and personnel director in prison last year. Nardozzi claimed former Chief Armando Perez and former personnel director David Dunn conspired with Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim to fix the selection process so Perez would be selected as chief, the Connecticut Post reports. Prosecutors said Perez, 65, received confidential information about the police chief’s examination that was stolen by Dunn, including the questions for an oral examination and the scoring guide for written essays. Perez, who was the acting chief at the time, also admitted that he had two officers complete his essays, passed the work off as his own and lied to federal authorities in an effort to cover up his actions. Last April, Perez was sentenced to a year in prison, and Dunn received a four-month term. Both have since been released, according to the Courant. The appeals court ruled Friday that Nardozzi’s suit can proceed even though the city had paid him to settle a previous lawsuit after he was fired by Ganim in 2016. The case could go to trial later this year.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State lawmakers have introduced bipartisan legislation that would put state law enforcement officials in charge of background checks for gun purchases. A bill filed Friday would resurrect Delaware’s Firearm Transaction Approval Program, which was eliminated more than a decade ago when lawmakers voted to rely on the federal government’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. That vote came amid concerns then that Delaware’s background check system was not providing the federal NICS with information about mentally ill individuals prohibited from buying or possessing firearms. The bill authorized state agencies to provide such information to NICS, created a federally mandated program allowing individuals previously deemed mentally ill to reestablish eligibility for gun ownership, and abolished the state’s existing background check system. Lawmakers now want to return responsibility for firearm transactions background checks in Delaware to the State Bureau of Identification. The SBI would be the point of contact between gun dealers and the federal databases checked by the FBI. The SBI would thus become responsible for determining whether a person is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm and would be able to search other databases other than NICS in making that determination.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In 100 years, if nothing is done, the historic Tidal Basin may be underwater, WUSA-TV reports. In 500, the Jefferson Memorial will be accessible only by boat. A combination of rising waters and a sinking human-made Tidal Basin puts the entire area – cherry blossoms, memorials, walking paths – at risk. But it’s not inevitable. The Trust for the National Mall and the National Trust for Historic Preservation have teamed up to create the Tidal Basin Ideas Lab, an initiative to plan out what the reservoir could become in the next century. It was once just a part of the Potomac River, but after the great flood of 1881, city planners got to work dredging up the river and Washington Channel to build the Tidal Basin. Teresa Durkin, executive vice president for the Trust for the National Mall, said the gates that engineers installed to control the water flow are no longer doing their job. “The gates have actually silted shut. So the water keeps coming through, but with it, it’s bringing all this silt and debris. So over time, it literally cannot open and close anymore. It doesn’t function as it was designed to,” Durkin said. “A lot of that sediment, because it’s not flushing out of the out gates, is also settling in the Tidal Basin itself. So it has likely raised the water.”\n\nFlorida\n\nVero Beach: A food truck exploded during a seafood festival Saturday, sending one person to the hospital with severe burns, according to authorities. The Vero Beach police said state and local fire officials are investigating the cause of the explosion. The department posted photos of the scene on Facebook that showed the sides and roof of the truck blown off the vehicle. One person was flown to a hospital burn unit in Orlando. There were no other injuries, and the festival continued as authorities secured the scene of the explosion, police said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A group of voters who challenged U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s eligibility to run for reelection said Monday that they have filed an appeal of the Georgia secretary of state’s decision that she can appear on the ballot. The five voters from Greene’s district in March filed a complaint with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger alleging that the Republican congresswoman played a significant role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. They argued that puts her in violation of a seldom-invoked part of the 14th Amendment having to do with insurrection and makes her ineligible to run for reelection. Georgia Administrative Law Judge Charles Beaudrot last month held a daylong hearing that included arguments from lawyers for the voters and for Greene, as well as extensive questioning of Greene herself. He then sent his decision to Raffensperger on May 6. Beaudrot found that the voters hadn’t produced sufficient evidence to back their claims. Raffensperger affirmed that decision, writing that whether Greene’s political statements and actions disqualify her from office “is rightfully a question for the voters of Georgia’s 14th Congressional District.” Under state law, the voters are allowed to appeal that decision in Fulton County Superior Court.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines is exploring electric aircraft technology with an eye toward using the vehicles for interisland travel, Hawaii News Now reports. A Boston-based company called REGENT is designing “seagliders” that would each carry up to 100 people. Hawaiian hasn’t committed to purchasing any of the aircraft but is exploring the possibility. A news release from REGENT said Hawaiian agreed to strategically invest to support the initial design of the company’s next-generation seaglider. Hawaiian is the first airline to partner with the company, which hopes to have its Monarch seagliders in the air by 2028. “We look forward to working with REGENT to explore the technology and infrastructure needed to fulfill our vision for convenient, comfortable and environmentally sustainable interisland transportation,” said Avi Mannis, chief marketing and communications officer at Hawaiian Airlines. REGENT’s seagliders fly through the air close to the water’s surface. The company said the aircraft will service routes up to 180 miles with existing battery technology and routes up to 500 miles with next-generation batteries. The company said the seagliders will move at the speed of an airplane but have the operating cost of boats and will use existing dock infrastructure.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials have agreed to a $119 million settlement with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and three major distributors over their role in the opioid addiction crisis. Republican Gov. Brad Little and Attorney General Lawrence Wasden said in an announcement Friday that it’s the second-largest consumer settlement in state history, trailing only the 1998 national tobacco settlement. An Ada County judge on Wednesday approved the settlement that includes all 44 Idaho counties, 24 cities and the state’s seven health districts. The money will address damage wrought by opioids, which the federal government declared a public health emergency in 2017. Johnson & Johnson and the three distributors agreed to a national $26 billion settlement in February. “Idaho has made significant strides in recent years in combatting the opioid crisis, and the culmination of our legal action against opioid manufacturers – led by Attorney General Wasden and his team – now offers additional resources,” Little said in a statement. Wasden is continuing legal action against other opioid makers as well as the Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharma. “This settlement holds some of those most responsible for the opioid crisis accountable and provides significant funding for treatment, recovery and prevention in Idaho,” he said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot tightened a citywide curfew for young people Monday, a day after she restricted access by unaccompanied minors to downtown’s Millennium Park following the weekend shooting death of a 16-year-old boy near “The Bean” sculpture at the park. The citywide weekend curfew for minors now will begin each night at 10 p.m., instead of the 11 p.m. curfew in place since the 1990s, Lightfoot said. At Millennium Park, which is a popular stop for tourists and Chicago residents, minors will not be allowed in the park after 6 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays without an adult. “We need to make sure they are safe and importantly that our young people understand and respect basic community norms, respect for themselves, respect for each other, and we must ensure that every one of our residents and visitors – no matter who they are or where they come from or how old they are – are able to safely enjoy our public spaces,” the mayor said at a news conference. Lightfoot said she hoped and expected that people would abide by the restrictions and that it would not lead to widespread arrests. She said officials “don’t want to arrest children,” but those who break the law will be.\n\nIndiana\n\nNoblesville: A tiny community garden that provided 1,500 pounds of free food over five years to people in need was bulldozed by city crews after a nuisance call about overgrown grass. City officials said the lease with the nonprofit that managed the garden expired more than a year ago, and there was no sign that the land had been maintained since. The overgrown six parcels next to Southside Park posed a safety risk, officials said. Garden caretakers said they were in talks with the city about entering a new contract and weren’t given a warning the plot would be flattened and its furniture removed. Hidden underneath the pollinators and overgrowth were viable shrubs and plants, said Renee Rule, coordinator of the garden since its founding. The plot is messy when it’s not growing season but was a little more scraggly this year because bad weather had delayed volunteers who were to prepare it for planting, Rule said. “I wish they would have given us a call, and we could have saved some of the plants,” Rule said. The garden has provided free tomatoes, green beans, zucchini, onions and lettuces to neighborhood families and served as an instructional farm for college students and Girl Scouts alike. Families rented plots so they could grow vegetables to eat. Schoolchildren were given pumpkins in the fall. A beekeeper gave demonstrations at a beehive.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: School districts across the state are up against a federal deadline that will end a pandemic-era free meals program for students next month. While many school officials are waiting to see if federal or state lawmakers will extend the program, at least one district, Des Moines Public Schools, is working to continue offering most of its students free meals next school year. Students have faced repeated upheavals since March 2020, when schools across the country closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to help districts feed students during the health crisis – whether they were at school or home – the U.S. Department of Agriculture temporarily relaxed rules that tied who received free lunch to family income and neighborhood poverty levels. As the June 30 deadline draws near, school district officials and school nutrition advocates are asking state and federal lawmakers to intervene by either extending the relaxed rules or offering free meals to all students permanently. If no legislation is passed, students who qualify for free or reduced-price meals will still receive those services. Educators and advocates stress that studies show students do better academically when they are not hungry. School meals reduce both hunger and anxiety about it.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A federal judge is blocking a public school’s policy preventing teachers from outing transgender students to their parents after a teacher raised religious objections. Fort Riley Middle School math teacher Pamela Ricard sued USD 475 Geary County Schools over LGBTQ anti-discrimination policies that conflicted with her Christian beliefs. District Judge Holly Teeter issued a preliminary injunction Monday blocking the school from disciplining Ricard if she reveals preferred names and pronouns of her transgender students when communicating with their parents. “The Court relies on Plaintiff’s statements that she does not intend to communicate with a parent for the sole purpose of disclosing a student’s preferred name and pronouns,” Teeter wrote. Ricard has two transgender students in her class, the judge wrote, neither of whom has authorized the district to disclose a preferred name and pronouns to parents. While Ricard uses their preferred names in class and avoids pronouns, she has emailed parents using a student’s legal name and biological pronouns. “Plaintiff believes that addressing students one way at school and a different way when speaking to their parents is dishonest,” the opinion said. “Being dishonest violates her sincere religious beliefs.” Teeter was appointed by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: A judge entered a not guilty plea Monday for a man accused of fatally shooting the daughter of a former state lawmaker during a home invasion. Shannon Gilday, 23, appeared in Madison Circuit Court for a continued arraignment on charges of murder, attempted murder, assault, burglary and criminal mischief, news outlets report. His attorney tried to enter a plea of guilty but mentally ill on his behalf last week, but the prosecution argued against it, and the judge continued the hearing. Meanwhile, prosecutors filed a notice of aggravating circumstances seeking enhanced penalties upon a conviction, which stopped defense attorney Tom Griffiths from trying to enter a plea of guilty but mentally ill, news outlets report. Gilday allegedly broke into a multimillion-dollar Madison County home owned by former lawmaker C. Wesley Morgan and shot Jordan Morgan while she was asleep, according to court records and statements from Morgan. Gilday also exchanged shots with Morgan during the Feb. 22 break-in. State police investigators said Gilday told them he was determined to get access to a bunker in the home. He was arrested in Madison County about a week after the shooting.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Child drownings are on the rise in Louisiana, according to the state Department of Health, which says inability to swim, lack of supervision, and unfenced pools, spas and water bodies are top causes of drownings among babies and children under 15 years old. “As temperatures heat up and families return to water activities, it is important for parents and families to stay aware of the precautions they can take to prevent child drownings,” the department said in a news release. The agency said the number of drownings among children had fallen steadily for years, from 26 in 2015 and 2016 to 15 in 2019. But the total rose 60% in 2020, to 24. And preliminary data indicates that last year’s total was 25, it said. The department’s most recent Louisiana Child Death Review Report, covering 2017 through 2019, found that an average of 17 children drowned each year. That made drowning the No. 3 cause of injury-related death in children up through age 14, behind vehicle crashes and homicide. It found that 96% of them could not swim, 72% were unsupervised, and 54% died in water that hadn’t been fenced off. It found that 60% drowned in a pool, hot tub or spa. Looking at all drownings including adults, Louisiana had the nation’s third-highest rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A proposed order from the state’s Board of Environmental Protection would let stand a permit issued for a $1 billion electric transmission corridor to serve as a conduit for Canadian hydropower. The draft order was written by environmental agency staff ahead of a hearing this week that was postponed because of COVID-19 illnesses. The board was supposed to meet Tuesday to decide whether to hold a public hearing or to begin deliberations the following day. The permit was suspended by Maine Environmental Commissioner Melanie Loyzim after voters rebuked the project in a statewide referendum. Because the permit was not permanently revoked, the Board of Environmental Protection was required to issue a final decision on consolidated appeals. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court, meanwhile, is weighing a lawsuit aimed at overturning the referendum on constitutional grounds, as well questions about the legality of a state lease for a small portion of land. Funded by Massachusetts ratepayers, the New England Clean Energy Connect would supply up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower – enough electricity for 1 million homes – to the regional power grid. Supporters say bold projects are necessary to battle climate change. Critics say the benefits are overstated, and it would destroy woodlands.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen says he has suffered a minor stroke and is being treated at George Washington University Hospital. The Maryland Democrat said he has been told there are no long-term effects or damage. In a statement Sunday night, Van Hollen said he has been advised by doctors to remain under observation at the Washington, D.C., hospital for a few days out of an abundance of caution. Van Hollen, 63, was elected to the Senate in 2016 after serving seven terms in the U.S. House. The senator said he experienced lightheadedness and acute neck pain while delivering a speech in western Maryland. On the advice of a physician, he sought medical attention upon his return home. An angiogram indicated a minor stroke in the form of a small venous tear at the back of his head, Van Hollen said. “I look forward to returning to work in the Senate later this week and thank the medical team for their excellent care,” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Chelsea Millsap, 32, who can trace her ancestry to the Pilgrims, is the first woman named sexton in the nearly 300-year history of Boston’s Old North Church. The critical job involves caring for and maintaining the parish buildings and equipment, including an 18th-century clock, the 75-piece chandeliers and the crypt where more than 1,100 people have been laid to rest. One of her first tasks will be managing a major renovation and restoration of the crypt. The church, still home to an active Episcopal congregation, is famous as the place where in 1775, two lanterns in the steeple signaled British soldiers were heading to Concord and Lexington, sending Paul Revere on the ride that sparked the American Revolution. One of the people who hung the lanterns was Robert Newman, the sexton at that time. “What an incredible opportunity to be able to sit in the very same pew as Robert Newman and in a world that is so divided to work in a place that welcomes all people from Bostonians to world dignitaries, like the Queen,” Millsap, a Detroit native and former firefighter with experience in fire prevention, security technology and project management, said in a statement. “I could have been the one to hang the lanterns 247 years ago. It is such an honor to show women that they too can hold these sorts of jobs.” Millsap is a descendant of teenage Mayflower passenger Mary Chilton, buried at nearby King’s Chapel.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A man walking on a footbridge to a Detroit Tigers game said he fell 15 feet to the ground when part of the concrete collapsed. Ely Hydes said the incident occurred May 9, but the bridge still was open until the Detroit News reached out to the state Transportation Department on Sunday. The Spruce Street pedestrian bridge is above M-10, also known as the Lodge Freeway. Hydes said he was walking to Comerica Park with a friend when “the bridge just collapsed under my feet.” “I remember thinking, ‘I hope I’m not over the freeway.’ I landed about 6 feet from the traffic. … After I hit the ground, I got the wind knocked out of me pretty good,” Hydes, 36, told the newspaper. He informed police, then resumed his walk to the Tigers game, a 2-0 loss to Oakland. Hydes went to a hospital a few days later. “I’m a giant walking bruise right now,” he said. The Transportation Department said it wasn’t aware of the hole in the bridge until notified by the newspaper. “The Spruce pedestrian bridge was built in 1953, and based on its age and condition, it is on a yearly detailed bridge inspection that is due this month,” spokeswoman Diane Cross said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nLutsen: Communities in northeastern Minnesota are preparing to deal with more flooding and are calling for volunteers to help with sandbagging. Near Voyageurs National Park, most docks are underwater at area lakes, and some 200 homes and resorts are at risk. Kabetogama Township Supervisor John Stegmeir said his area is bracing for a record-breaking flood. Stegmeir said more volunteers are needed, especially since the average age of volunteers sandbagging right now is 65. The volunteers, along with some staff from Voyageurs National Park, have been working since last Tuesday, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. “I think we’ve filled 8,000 bags this week, which isn’t big when you talk about the flooding on the Red River – they’re talking millions of bags – No. 1, we couldn’t do that, and the people who have been coming out to bag are older, you know,” he said. Volunteers are asked to check in at the town hall and to bring a shovel if possible. A flood warning is in effect for many communities in the Rainy River Basin of far northern Minnesota. In Cook County, the owner of Lutsen Resort on Lake Superior is hoping the iconic bridges on the property can be saved. Recent high water levels sent debris rushing down the Poplar River, damaging the bridges.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state has revised its landlord-tenant law to give renters time to gather their belongings from a home before being forced to leave, after a federal judge ruled that the previous law was unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills wrote in his Nov. 30 order that the old law was “unpredictable and absurd,” saying it went further than eviction laws in any other state. He wrote that it violated an occupant’s right to due process. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed the new law April 21, and it took effect immediately. It passed with broad bipartisan support. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the new law gives a tenant seven days to gather belongings and vacate a home after an eviction notice. An exception is made for emergencies. If the occupant does not leave during the initial order, a judge could issue a separate one authorizing law enforcement to remove a tenant. That would give the person another 72 hours to gather their belongings. The previous law allowed landlords to immediately seize and dispose of a delinquent occupant’s personal property. The impetus for his order was a lawsuit by Samantha Conner, a Columbus woman who sued her landlord after he took nearly everything she owned when she was evicted in 2019.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The state has retained a dubious distinction for the 10th time, topping the Humane Society’s list of the worst puppy mill problem. In their annual list of worst dog breeders in the country, the advocacy group listed Missouri as having 26 of the most abusive puppy mills. Since the “Horrible Hundred” list was first published 10 years ago, Missouri has topped the list each year. This year the Show-Me State garnered 26 spots on the list, compared to just 17 in Iowa, 12 in New York, and seven each in Kansas and Wisconsin. That Missouri has so many puppy mills is no surprise, according to Humane Society Stop Puppy Mills campaign senior director John Goodwin. “Missouri has always been at the heart of the puppy mill industry since the beginning,” Goodwin said. “The post-World War II era was a time period where there was a lot of consolidation in agriculture, and a lot of small farms closed. This industry was seen as a solution in Midwestern states, and Missouri became the epicenter of large-scale puppy mills.” That evolution was aided by state regulations allowing the mills to flourish, Goodwin said. That would have changed in a 2010 proposition approved by voters that would have required large-scale breeders to provide “sufficient food, clean water, housing and space” to the dogs under their care, along with “necessary veterinary care; regular exercise and adequate rest between breeding cycles.” After the initiative was passed, the Legislature changed the language of the regulations.\n\nMontana\n\nCrow Agency: Little Big Horn College, a tribal college on the Crow Reservation, in partnership with the Crow Language Consortium, will host the 10th annual Crow Summer Institute on June6-24. The three-week program offers free Crow language and culture classes. Participants must be at least 18 years old, and registration is now open, according to a news release. The institute offers two options, one for beginners and one for intermediate learners. Learners will have access to resources developed by Crow elders, speakers and knowledge keepers, including textbooks, flashcards, dictionaries and multimedia apps. The Crow Summer Institute is offering $100 gas cards to some early registrants and Crow dictionaries for those who complete the program. Participants may also earn college credit through Little Big Horn College. Ishkoochìia Chiiakaamnáah (Jacob Brien), a Crow language learner who attended past Crow Summer Institutes, said the program helped him “realize different connections and patterns within the language.” “It really helped me understand Crow jokes and, by extension, Crow culture, which of course usually doesn’t translate, as many subtleties of the language don’t work in English,” he said in a statement. For more information, visit summer.crowlanguage.org.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state has agreed to pay $479,000 to the family of a “talkative” Scottsbluff man who was strangled to death in 2017 by a fellow inmate who didn’t want a cellmate. The lawsuit, filed by Terry Berry Jr.’s family against prison officials they argued were responsible for the 22-year-old’s death because they put him in the same cell as Patrick Schroeder, was dismissed last week after both sides agreed to the settlement. Berry was nearing parole on a sentence for forgery and assault when he was placed with Schroeder, who was serving a life sentence for killing a 75-year-old man and dumping his body in a well. The Lincoln Journal Star reports Schroeder later pleaded guilty to killing Berry and was sentenced to death. Berry’s family argued in the lawsuit that prison officials should have known there would be problems if they placed the two men together, and a caseworker at the prison even warned co-workers involved in the decision that Schroeder didn’t want a cellmate and wouldn’t likely tolerate Berry well because he was known to be “very talkative and bothersome.” Back in 2019, a federal judge dismissed the head of the state Department of Correctional Services and the prison’s warden as defendants, but the case had been allowed to move forward against several prison employees involved.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A proposed ballot initiative seeks to amend the state constitution to establish open top-five primaries and ranked-choice voting for general elections, though it isn’t without its critics. The Nevada Voters First political action committee is spearheading the initiative and must collect 140,777 signatures from registered Nevada voters by June 29 to qualify the measure for the 2022 general election ballot. Approval in November would call on the Legislature to institute the changes to the Nevada Constitution by July 1, 2025. In ranked-choice balloting, voters are directed to mark candidates in order of preference and to mark as many choices as they want. A voter may also choose only one candidate. The proposal would establish open primary elections, including all candidates regardless of party affiliation, squaring off in ranked-choice fashion. The top five finishers would advance to the general election, which would also be conducted using ranked-choice voting. About 30% of registered voters in Nevada list themselves as nonpartisan, and about 40% aren’t registered as Republican or Democrat, said Sondra Cosgrove, a representative with Nevada Voters First and a past president of the League of Women Voters of Nevada. “That’s a lot of people who are being shut out of important races,” she said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former Trump administration official running for Congress did not violate state law by voting twice during the 2016 primary election season, the New Hampshire attorney general’s office said Thursday without taking a position on whether federal law was broken. The Associated Press reported in April that Matt Mowers cast ballots in both the Feb. 9, 2016, New Hampshire presidential primary and the New Jersey primary four months later. Legal experts said Mowers could have a violated federal law that prohibits “voting more than once” in “any general, special, or primary election.” That includes casting a ballot in separate jurisdictions “for an election to the same candidacy or office.” Though the article did not allege violation of state law, the attorney general’s office investigated based on the report and complaints from voters. After reviewing Mowers’ voting history, rental and property records, driver’s license documents and other material, it concluded he did not violate New Hampshire’s law against double voting. Mowers is a leading candidate for the GOP nomination in the state’s 1st Congressional District, though New Hampshire has yet to complete its redistricting process and finalize the congressional map. He was the nominee in 2020 but lost to Democratic incumbent Rep. Chris Pappas.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: The Ocean County Board of Commissioners plans this week to wade into the contentious debate over the state’s new health and sex education curriculum. While the five-member, all-Republican board has no legal authority to determine what is taught in schools, its bully pulpit is seen as influential in a county that is a bastion of conservatism in an otherwise progressive state. Commissioner Virginia E. Haines, who is also a Republican National Committee member, circulated a draft resolution among her colleagues last Wednesday to establish a “Parents’ Bill of Rights.” If approved as expected, the resolution would put the full weight of the county government behind a grassroots effort to establish such a bill of rights by providing political, administrative and legal support. The text of the draft resolution authorizes and directs the county commission director, the county administrator and county general counsel to organize parents, community leaders and unspecified professionals to develop the framework for such a document. The framework for such a declaration would then be used to marshal local school districts and county schools into adopting their own bills of rights.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s Asian American community is testing a new way to bolster security for Asian-owned businesses in the wake of two deadly shootings. KOAT-TV reports an Albuquerque startup is trying out an online service that connects armed security guards with Asian-owned businesses. Businesses would report suspicious activity to toServo. The service would utilize GPS-enabled mobile technology to put them in touch with a private security team, and the security on call would respond within minutes. It is part of an initiative established by the Asian Business Collaborative. The nonprofit started a Good Neighbor Program to check up on shops and restaurants. For now, four businesses will be chosen for the service. But there are hopes to expand its use by the end of the year. Collaborative organizers say the city’s Asian community has been on edge since shootings at two Asian-owned spas. In January, the female owner of one spa was shot and killed during an attempted robbery. Two men have been charged in her killing. Less than a month later, another woman of Asian descent was killed inside another massage business during a robbery. The suspect was killed in a police pursuit 10 days later.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City health officials issued an advisory Monday urging New Yorkers to wear masks in all indoor public settings as the city approaches “high risk” COVID-19 alert status. Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said everyone “regardless of vaccination status or past COVID-19 infection” should wear face coverings at all times in settings such as grocery stores, offices and building lobbies. People at high risk of severe illness from the virus, such as those over 65 years old, should avoid crowded settings and nonessential gatherings, he said. Vasan said he was issuing the guidance as the city approaches the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “high” level of COVID-19 alert, representing high community spread and increasing pressure on the health care system. New York City has been averaging about 3,600 reported new cases of COVID-19 per day over the past week – a number that is likely an undercount because it doesn’t include positive tests done at home. The daily case counts have been rising slowly since March but have leveled off somewhat recently. The CDC risk level for Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island is currently “medium,” while the Bronx is still “low.” But much of the surrounding metropolitan area has already moved into the CDC’s “high risk” category.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction in the shooting death of an endangered red wolf in North Carolina. The wolf was found in a muddy field in Tyrrell County on April 15, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The News & Observer reports it had been shot in the spine and collapsed in the mud – some of which was found in its lungs. Killing a red wolf is illegal, except under special circumstances. Red wolves once ranged across the Southeast, but after decades of habitat loss and killing by humans, they were nearly extinct by 1980. The Fish and Wildlife Service gathered up the remaining wild wolves and began a captive breeding program. The first captive wolves were reintroduced to the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in eastern North Carolina in 1987. By 2006, as many as 120 red wolves were thought to be living in the wild. Since then, wolf populations have declined again. Last year, the Biden administration abandoned a proposal made under President Donald Trump to scale back the areas where red wolves are protected and allow the killing of wolves found outside federal land.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Hoping to head off an explosion of electronic pull tab machines at gas stations and liquor, grocery and convenience stores, state regulators want to change the definition of a bar to make clear where the wildly popular Las Vegas-style games that mimic slot machines will be allowed. The state attorney general’s office, which oversees gambling in North Dakota, has identified a handful of gas stations and convenience stores that have begun selling and serving booze and are now “masquerading” as bars so that they can put the machines in their businesses, Attorney General Drew Wrigley said. Wrigley and Deb McDaniel, North Dakota’s top gambling regulator, said the idea for the rule change is to clarify and preserve what they believe the intent of the Legislature was when it defined a bar as a “retail alcoholic beverage establishment where alcoholic beverages are dispensed and consumed.” The amended language specifies that a bar does not include gas stations or liquor, grocery and convenience stores. A bar in a hotel, bowling alley or restaurant could still have the machines, under the new definition. The North Dakota Gaming Commission scheduled a Thursday meeting at the state Capitol to discuss the proposed changes and to take public comments.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state took the formal step of signaling interest in expanding Amtrak passenger rail in Ohio, though it is far from saying yes to the idea. Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the Ohio Rail Development Commission to work with Amtrak to study potential new routes, according to Dan Tierney, a spokesperson for the governor’s office. The move was first reported by Cleveland.com. “It’s not to the point where we’re ready to go jump up and ‘yippee,’ but it’s significant, and we’re optimistic,” said Stu Nicholson with All Aboard Ohio, an advocacy group for rail. Amtrak wants to build a line connecting Columbus, Cleveland, Dayton and Cincinnati. The company agreed to cover the cost of construction, track upgrades and operating costs for at least five years, then split the estimated $17 million to $20 million annual operating costs with the state. The roughly $100 million cost to build the line would come from a massive infrastructure package Congress passed into law. The approach could better entice Ohio to expand rail given much of the upfront cost will be covered, advocates said. Nicholson said recent guidance allows the state to use other sources outside its general revenue, such as private grants, to go toward its share.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: New laws signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt will increase funding for local enforcement of the medical marijuana industry and target illicit sales of cannabis. Each of the bills moved through the Legislature last week, and as a result county sheriffs are now able to receive grant funding to dedicate a full-time deputy to assist with compliance visits conducted by the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority. The intent of the law is to allow enforcement officers to help the medical marijuana authority in situations where licensed cannabis businesses are not willing to allow inspections of their property. According to the bill’s authors, compliance inspectors were denied access 181 times between April 2021 and February of this year. “This bill is not meant to threaten anyone. We just want to make sure our compliance inspectors can safely do their jobs,” said state Rep. David Hardin, R-Stilwell, the House author. “This is a very important piece of legislation that will help rein in illegal marijuana operations and give Oklahomans the safe, fair, free market for medical marijuana that they voted for in 2018.” Logistics of the bill create a revolving fund, provided by the medical marijuana authority, that sets aside an annual $5 million for county sheriffs to dedicate an officer for one year to the medical marijuana authority.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Criminal defendants who have gone without legal representation for long periods of time amid a critical shortage of public defense attorneys filed a lawsuit Monday that alleges the state violated their constitutional right to legal counsel and a speedy trial. The complaint, which seeks class-action status, was filed as state lawmakers and the Oregon Office of Public Defense Services struggle to address the huge shortage of public defenders statewide. The crisis has led to the dismissal of dozens of cases and left an estimated 500 defendants statewide – including several dozen in custody on serious felonies – without legal representation. Crime victims are also affected because cases are taking longer to reach resolution, a delay that experts say extends their trauma, weakens evidence and erodes confidence in the justice system, especially among low-income and minority groups. “There is a public defense crisis raging across this country,” said Jason D. Williamson, executive director of the Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law at New York University School of Law, who helped prepare the filing. “But Oregon is among only a handful of states that is now entirely depriving people of their constitutional right to counsel on a daily basis, leaving countless indigent defendants without access to an attorney for months at a time.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Mehmet Oz is stepping up his criticism of far-right candidates gaining traction ahead of Tuesday’s primary election. After spending much of the campaign steering clear of fellow Republican Senate contender Kathy Barnette, Oz on Saturday said she was out of step with the GOP and would be unable to win the general election in November. In an interview, he took issue with a 2015 tweet from Barnette in which she wrote that “Pedophilia is a Cornerstone of Islam.” Oz, who would be the nation’s first Muslim senator, described the comments as “disqualifying.” “It’s reprehensible that she would tweet out something that is defamatory to an entire religion,” Oz told the Associated Press. “This state was based on religious freedom. I’m proud as a Pennsylvanian to uphold those founding beliefs that every faith has its merits.” The Barnette campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier in the week, Barnette told NBC News that she did not make the statement, which was still live on her Twitter feed Monday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A congressional candidate recently arrested on a menacing charge in another state has dropped out of the race. Michael Neary said in a statement Friday that he was seeking medical treatment for non-epileptic seizures following his arrest in Ohio in March. He said the decision followed “careful consultation and prayer.” Neary, 28, was among a large field of candidates seeking the Democratic nomination in Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District following incumbent Democrat Jim Langevin’s announcement in January that he’s retiring. Neary has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor charge of menacing by stalking March 23, as well as drug counts after marijuana and drug paraphernalia were allegedly found in his car. He’s previously said he’d remain in the race despite the charges. The Columbus, Ohio, resident, who grew up in Rhode Island, was stopped by police after another driver reported having been followed from Columbus to Troy, more than 60 miles away. Police said the driver reported that Neary’s car mimicked their every move, matching speed and lane changes and even stopping at a rest area after they did. Authorities said Neary told them he had recently returned from Rhode Island, was very stressed and had been focusing on the vehicle’s Ohio registration.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Grace Church has purchased a dormitory building from Greenville Technical College to convert into affordable housing as part of a special program to address the local housing crisis. The church will serve as the landlord for the property, and rent will be adjusted to fit families’ income. Rent prices will range from $450 for a single room to $1,000 for a three-bedroom unit. The goal, according to Grace Church’s care and recovery ministry director LeeAnne Cavin, is that the average family will pay in the $900 range for a unit. “We do have a crisis of housing,” Cavin said. “Our whole community is really starting to desire collaboration.” The units are expected to open for rent the first week of June, and the church already has almost 40 families ready to move in. The program will accept emergency housing vouchers through the Greenville Housing Authority but not Section 8 vouchers or extra subsidy from the federal government that goes directly toward rent. To sign a lease in one of the units, families agree to be a part of a Grace Church housing program that offers medical coverage, dental care, a savings matching program, mental health support, car maintenance, financial education, cooking classes, self-defense classes, and job and interview preparation.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The ongoing drought in South Dakota has been hard on the state’s wildlife. The U.S. Forest Service says the grouse population in the Fort Pierre National Grassland has declined by 15% in 2022, largely because of the dry conditions. The total grouse population has averaged about 300 since the mid-1980s. Over the past twenty years, both greater prairie chicken and sharp-tailed grouse populations have primarily remained stable or have grown. “The thing that I think was really damaging to us last year was we had record-high and record-dry conditions in early June, right when those birds started incubation or, for the earlier semester, to hatch. And, boy, that’s just so tough on a chick to thermoregulate and be able to find sufficient moisture,” District Ranger Dan Svingen said. Greater prairie chickens and sharp-tailed grouse both nest on the ground and require tall grass to hide their nests, the Capital Journal reports. Because they start laying eggs as early as April, before sufficient grass growth, they’re dependent on dead grass from the previous year as cover. However, the drought prevented extensive grass growth in 2021, leaving them more exposed to predators in 2022. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a little more than 76% of South Dakota is experiencing some kind of drought.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: In its quest to redefine tourism at the gateway to the Great Smoky Mountains, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has inked a deal to bring an international entertainment company to the United States for the first time. Tribal Council and international theme park company Puy du Fou have signed a letter of intent to develop a new “spectacular immersive show” as part of a 200-acre development located at Exit 407 south of Interstate 40 on the way to the Smokies. The Tribal Council approved $75 million May 4 for phase one development of “The 407: Gateway to Adventure.” Its leaders are seeking world-class attractions to appeal to the record-breaking crowds flocking to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The 407 partners have estimated the development could attract 6.7 million visitors in the first year after phase one is complete. That’s expected sometime in 2024. “We are excited to take the first steps towards developing this world-class attraction that will help support our nation economically while creating a new platform to share dimensions of Cherokee history many have never heard,” said Chairman of the Tribal Council Richard French. Puy du Fou is known worldwide for its immersive experiences inspired by history.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Two people were killed and three more taken to a hospital with injuries after a shooting Sunday at a bustling flea market, authorities said. The shooting at the open-air market arose from an “altercation” that involved at least two guns and all five of the people, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. He said no “innocent bystanders” were injured. Investigators believe one of the people hospitalized was among those who opened fire, and two more suspected shooters were detained at the scene, a sheriff’s deputy told KTRK-TV. Thousands of people were shopping at the market 14 miles north of Houston’s downtown when the shooting began around 1 p.m. Sunday, Gonzalez said on Twitter. The sheriff said multiple shots were fired, and deputies recovered two pistols from the scene. Authorities did not immediately provide further information about what led to the shooting but said all the people involved were men in there 20s who appeared to know each other.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A copper mining company will begin manufacturing a rare mineral used in solar panels that used to be discarded along with the other mine tailings. Rio Tinto officials and Gov. Spencer Cox unveiled the plan Wednesday at the Kennecott refinery west of Salt Lake City where the tellurium will be produced, FOX-13 news reports. The company says it is one of two in the U.S. to produce tellurium, which is listed as a “critical mineral” by the U.S. government. Most of the tellurium produced comes from China and other countries. Rio Tinto is working with the U.S. Department of Energy on ideas to produce more tellurium. The company said it hopes to produce 20 tons of the tellurium each year. “If we can produce it here, we are all going to be better off,” said Cox, a Republican. “We desperately need more of it.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott signed legislation into law Monday that creates an advisory committee to make recommendations on how to spend the state’s share of settlement money with drug manufacturers and distribution companies over the toll of prescription opioids. The number of opioid-related overdose deaths in Vermont jumped 33% in 2021 to a record 210 fatalities, the Vermont Health Department reported last month. The committee will be made up of the state’s health commissioner; a member each from the state Senate and House; health care providers; two people who lived through the experience of opioid use disorder; an assistant judge; and representatives from municipalities. Each year, the committee will make recommendations to the Vermont Department of Health and legislative committees for expenditures from a special opioid abatement fund. The health commissioner is expected to call the first meeting of the panel to occur on or before June 30.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A professor whose research on pedophilia created a stir at Old Dominion University has landed a new job with Johns Hopkins University’s Moore Center for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse. Allyn Walker stepped down from ODU in November after using the phrase “minor-attracted person” instead of “pedophile” in research, leading to an outcry on campus and social media, as well as threats of violence. The Virginian-Pilot reports the Moore Center announced last week that Walker, who uses the pronoun they, would be joining the center as a postdoctoral fellow. The center said in a series of tweets that it was excited to welcome Walker and that they would be working on research and new projects to develop a “comprehensive public health approach to addressing child sexual abuse and effective prevention programs.” On its website, the center says it works “to change the way the world thinks about child sexual abuse, from inevitable to preventable.” In the series of tweets, the center referred to Walker as “a leader in the field of perpetration prevention research.” Walker was an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice before more than 15,500 people signed an online petition calling for their removal from ODU in the fall. That came after a controversial interview about “A Long, Dark Shadow: Minor-Attracted People and Their Pursuit of Dignity,” a book focused on people who do not act on their sexual attraction to children and strategies to prevent them from acting on the attraction.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amtrak will postpone restoring its Cascades passenger-train service between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., until possibly December because of a lack of personnel. The service gap occurred despite the Biden administration’s much-hyped $66 billion allotted in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to catch up on maintenance and spread Amtrak’s national railway service to new cities, The Seattle Times reports. Janet Matkin, rail spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Transportation, said transportation officials in the state hoped the trains would roll again by summer or even late spring. Amtrak doesn’t have enough conductors, mechanics and onboard service staff yet to operate the trains, though new classes of conductors are in training, according to a letter to Washington and Oregon rail directors from Ray Lang, an Amtrak vice president. Pre-pandemic, about 159,000 people per year rode between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., or 290,000 when including stations between the cities, Matkin said. Passenger fares traditionally cover about two-thirds of operation costs, while states cover the rest.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWelch: Gov. Jim Justice visited the site of a planned $147 million highway project that will connect Welch to the Coalfields Expressway. The 5-mile stretch of highway is expected to be completed in 2026. “This announcement today means we are one step closer to bringing this area of West Virginia to the world once and for all,” Justice said in a media release. “We have waited and waited in southern West Virginia for way too long.” Justice announced Friday that Bizzack Construction of Lexington, Kentucky, won the bid to build the new highway. The governor’s office said plans are in the works to build a 5-mile stretch of the Coalfields Expressway from Mullens to Twin Falls State Park and a 3-mile link from Twin Falls toward Pineville. The four-lane Coalfields Expressway that runs from Raleigh County to Wyoming County opened in 2020.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSparta: The popular Elroy-Sparta State Trail officially reopened over the weekend following several years of flood-related repairs. Summer flood damage in 2018 closed the 32-mile-long trail which had about 60,000 visitors a year. The state Department of Natural Resources said the western Wisconsin trail needed two complete bridge replacements and landslide repairs, among other work. According to the DNR, $2.3 million needed for repairs came from the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the state. State Sen. Howard Marklein, of Spring Green, and state Rep. Tony Kurtz, of Wonewoc, spearheaded efforts in the Legislature to secure funds for the trail’s repairs, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “The easy part was the funding,” the DNR’s Missy VanLanduyt said. “The more difficult part was just the sheer amount of infrastructure that needed to be replaced, and designing all of that, and then going through the bidding process and then finally a very long construction period as well.” While repair work is largely complete, a 1-mile section of the trail was closed as of Friday because of bridge safety concerns. VanLanduyt said it’s set to reopen after Memorial Day weekend, with a permanent bridge replacement coming in late 2023 or early 2024.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis apologized Monday after getting booed and heckled for remarks she made on sexual identity during a University of Wyoming graduation speech. A first-term Republican from deep-red Wyoming, Lummis said in Saturday’s speech in Laramie that human rights are derived from God but that government seeks to redefine many of them. “Even fundamental, scientific truths such as the existence of two sexes, male and female, are subject to challenge these days,” Lummis said. She paused and smiled while many in the crowd responded with boos and heckling. “And I challenge those of you,” she said, without completing that thought, saying: “I’m not making a comment on the fact that there are people who transition between sexes.” Lummis is a former congresswoman, state treasurer and University of Wyoming graduate who’s been prominent in Wyoming politics for decades. Until now, at least, she has been less outspoken than many Republicans who’ve made a major issue of gender and sex identity. The stir happened in a community known for the murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in 1998, a watershed event in LGBTQ activism. A college town of about 32,000 people, Laramie leans left compared to the vast majority of Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}]}

Darrian Traynor/Getty Images\n\nThe incident demonstrates the lingering pain felt by Australia’s First Nations people since the occupation of their country by British settlers in 1788. In other Commonwealth Nations, the Queen’s death has prompted rumblings – some louder than others – of moves to abandon the British monarchy for a republic. But in Australia, despite Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s pro-republic views, there’s no concerted push in that direction.\n\nIn interviews and press conferences since the Queen’s death, Albanese has repeatedly said now is not the time to time to be talking about a republic. And on Tuesday, the Australian Republican Movement seemed to agree, suspending its campaign on the issue until after the period of mourning “out of respect for the Queen.”\n\nBut for Albanese, the reluctance to push for a republic right now is not just a matter of respect for the late monarch. The Labor leader made a pre-election promise to hold a referendum to recognize Australia’s First Nations people in the constitution within his first three-year term, if he won office.\n\nWhen asked about it on Monday, Albanese said: “I said at the time I couldn’t envisage a circumstance where we changed our Head of State to an Australian Head of State but still didn’t recognize First Nations people in our constitution and the fact that we live with the oldest continuous culture on Earth. So that’s our priorities this term.”\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attends the Proclamation of King Charles III, on the forecourt of Parliament House on September 11, 2022 in Canberra, Australia. Mick Tsikas/Getty Images\n\nA resounding ‘no’\n\nChanging the constitution requires the majority of Australian people across the country, as well as the majority in most states to vote “yes” in a referendum, a notoriously difficult task. Since Federation in 1901, only eight of 44 proposals for constitutional change have been approved.\n\nThe last rejection came in 1999, when the country’s citizens were asked if they wanted to replace the Queen and Governor-General with a President.\n\nBack then, campaigning focused on cutting ties with an archaic monarchy and moving forward as a bold new multicultural nation intent on forging its own path. Indigenous issues weren’t high on the agenda, though Australians were asked a second question, to approve a new preamble to the constitution that honored First Nations people for their “kinship with their lands.” That failed too, with Aboriginal elders of the day complaining they hadn’t been consulted on the wording.\n\nAn Aboriginal land rights protest in Spring Street, Melbourne, 1971. Fairfax Media/Getty Images\n\nIt wasn’t a surprise. Indigenous people had long complained their voices hadn’t been heard by successive governments, so much so that in 1999, Yawuru man Peter Yu, now Vice President First Nations at the Australian National University (ANU), took the advice of a local elder to take their message to the Queen.\n\n“A very old senior leader said, ‘You better go and see that old girl overseas … because they call her name the wrong way over here,’” Yu recalled. The old man meant that the only time Aboriginal people heard the Queen’s name was when they were arrested, Yu told CNN. “They felt that, given the community’s respect for the Queen, her name was being sullied and her reputation being besmudged, and that therefore we needed to go and explain the situation,” he said.\n\nSo they did.\n\nYu and an delegation met Queen Elizabeth for around 30 minutes in Buckingham Palace, and received a much warmer welcome from the monarch than either government in the UK or Australia, he said.\n\nToday, Yu says views within the Australia’s Indigenous community on the Queen are mixed – as they are in most communities.\n\n“There are strong emotions,” he said. “And we are continuing to suffer the full force of the consequences of colonization. But do we hold her personally responsible for it? I don’t,” he said. “Who I hold responsible for it is the Australian government … governments who deliberately neglected their duty of care. That’s what I’m angry at.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth II watches an Aboriginal cultural performance near Cairns, March 2002. Torsten Blackwood/AFP/Getty Images\n\nVoice to Parliament\n\nBy the end of his first term, Albanese has promised a referendum on the Voice to Parliament – a body enshrined in the constitution that for the first time would give Indigenous people a say in laws that affect them.\n\nJohn Warhurst, Emeritus Professor of political science at ANU and former chair of the Australian Republic Movement, says a referendum on the Voice to Parliament is “undoubtedly the first priority” over a republic.\n\n“You won’t get argument about that among republicans,” he added.\n\nAn image of Queen Elizabeth II looks down from the sails of Australia's Opera House, September 9, 2022. Robert Wallace/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Voice to Parliament is important for a number of reasons, said Warhurst. “It’s a line in the sand about Australia’s colonial past. It’s a line in the sand about race relations in Australia … and I think the message internationally would be a shocking one, too, if we fail to pass this referendum.”\n\nHowever, not all Indigenous people back the concept.\n\nTelona Pitt, a Ngarluma, Kariyarra, and Meriam woman of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island descent, is the admin of the “Vote no to constitutional change” Facebook group, which has 11,000 members.\n\nShe believes not enough Indigenous people were given a say in drafting the document that led to plans for a Voice to Parliament. And she says the government is already aware of Indigenous problems but hasn’t done enough to fix them – and that won’t change with a referendum on a Voice to Parliament.\n\n“All it’s going to do is just disempower Aboriginal people and power up the Parliament against us,” she said.\n\nProtesters take part in an \"Invasion Day\" rally in Sydney on January 26, 2022. Steven Saphore/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPitt says a referendum should be held among Indigenous people to see who supports the change before any questions are put to the wider public.\n\nWarhurst says approving the Voice to Parliament would ease the passage of further constitutional change – but on the flip side, rejecting it could mean a longer road to a republic.\n\nHe said after the Voice to Parliament passes, Australia may be ready to consider life after the monarchy.\n\nThat may not happen for another five to 10 years, but campaigning on the issue would have to start early “from scratch” as Australia is not the same place it was in 1999, he said.\n\nPotentially, convincing Australians that it is time for a republic may be easier by then, as the nostalgia of a lifetime under the reign of the Queen will have passed for older generations, who grew up with much closer ties to the British monarchy.\n\n“Queen Elizabeth’s presence was influential for some in sticking with the status quo,” Warhurst said. “So I think now that we’ve moved on to a new King, part of the reluctance in the Australian community has gone.”\n\nHowever Yu, from ANU, said the issue of Australia’s Indigenous people must be addressed before any talk of a republic.\n\n“How can you have a republic without settling the matter with the First Peoples?” he asked. “For me, It’s a nonsense. It has no integrity. It has no sense of moral or soul.”", "authors": ["Hilary Whiteman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/22/australia/australia-election-results-new-government-explainer-five-things-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Anthony Albanese and Australia's new left-leaning government ...", "text": "Brisbane, Australia CNN —\n\nAfter almost a decade of conservative leadership, Australian voters turned their back on the ruling coalition, instead backing those who campaigned for more action on climate change, greater gender equality and political integrity.\n\nNew Labor Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was sworn in on Monday before his departure to Japan for his first meeting with allies including US President Joe Biden.\n\nFor much of its history, Australian politics has been dominated by the two major parties: the Liberals on the center-right and Labor on the center-left. But this election threw all the balls up in the air, tossing more than a few to minor parties and Independents who were fed-up with the two-party system.\n\nHere’s what we learned.\n\nAustralia’s coming in from the climate cold\n\nElection results showed a strong swing towards Independents who campaigned on issues relating to the climate.\n\nThe candidates – many first-time entrants to politics – were seeking cuts to emissions of up to 60% – more than twice as much as promised by the ruling conservative coalition (26-28%) and also more than Labor (43%). Known as teal candidates, they targeted traditionally blue Liberal seats with more green-leaning policies.\n\n“Millions of Australians have put climate first. Now, it’s time for a radical reset on how this great nation of ours acts upon the climate challenge,” said Amanda McKenzie, CEO of the research group the Climate Council, on Saturday’s election result.\n\nAustralia has long been known as the “lucky country,” partly due to its wealth of coal and gas, as well as minerals like iron ore, which have driven generations of economic growth.\n\nBut it’s now sitting on the frontier of a climate crisis, and the fires, floods and droughts that have already scarred the country are only expected to become more extreme as the Earth warms.\n\nThe ruling conservative government had been called a climate “holdout” by the United Nations Secretary-General after outlining a plan to get to net zero by 2050 by creating massive new gas projects. Incumbent Scott Morrison had said he would back a transition from coal to renewable energy, but had no plans to stop new coal projects.\n\nLabor Party leader Anthony Albanese promised to end the “climate wars,” a reference to the infighting that has frustrated any efforts to push for stronger action on climate over the past decade and even cost some prime ministers their jobs.\n\nLabor has pledged to reach emission net zero by 2050, partly by strengthening the mechanism used to pressure companies to make cuts.\n\nBut research institute Climate Analytics says Labor’s plans aren’t ambitious enough to keep the global temperature rise within 1.5 degrees Celsius, as outlined in the Paris Agreement.\n\nLabor’s policies are more consistent with a rise of 2 degrees Celsius, the institute said, marginally better than the coalition’s plan.\n\nTo speed up the transition to renewable energy, Labor plans to modernize Australia’s energy grid and roll out solar banks and community batteries. But despite its net zero commitment, Labor says it’ll approve new coal projects if they’re environmentally and economically viable.\n\nWomen are being seen and heard\n\nMorrison’s popularity with women plummeted after several scandals involving his ministers.\n\nMorrison himself was accused of lacking empathy when he responded to an allegation of a sexual assault in Parliament House by suggesting his wife, Jenny Morrison, had made him realize the gravity of the accusation.\n\n“She said to me ‘You have to think about this as a father first. What would you want to happen if it were our girls?’ Jenny has a way of clarifying things. Always has,” he said.\n\nThousands of women later marched around the country calling for stronger measures to ensure women’s safety – which snowballed into demands for greater gender equality.\n\nThe teal Independents were mostly older women who under other circumstances may have joined the Liberal Party.\n\nAlbanese read the room and promised to improve gender equality. He was even endorsed by his former boss, Australia’s first and only woman Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who famously ripped into her Liberal rival with the words: “I will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man.” Gillard fronted the media the day before the vote to say she was “very confident” an Albanese government will be a “government for women.”\n\nIndigenous voices will be amplified\n\nAmong the first words Albanese uttered when he walked onto the stage to claim victory Saturday was the promise to enshrine the voice of Indigenous people in Parliament.\n\n“I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we meet. I pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging. And on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I commit to the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full,” he said.\n\nIndigenous groups across Australia are calling for the constitution to be changed so they’re formally consulted on legislation and policies affecting their communities. That would require a national referendum, which needs political support before a yes-no question is put to the Australian people.\n\nAlbanese’s Labor government is giving that support. The last time Australians voted in a referendum on Aboriginal rights was in 1967, when 90% of the country supported a move to include Indigenous people in the Census.\n\nAlbanese said during his acceptance speech: “All of us ought to be proud that amongst our great multicultural society we count the oldest living continuous culture in the world.”\n\nAustralia is prioritizing Asia and the US\n\nOne of the first tasks for Albanese will be to head to Tokyo to meet his counterparts from the United States, Japan and India at the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) summit.\n\nBeside him will be Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, a seasoned Labor politician of Asian descent who has long been a respected voice in the Senate.\n\nThe new Labor government promises to create stronger ties with Asia. Albanese said one of his first ports of call after Japan will be Indonesia, which he said will “grow to be an economy that’s substantial in the world.”\n\n“We live in a region whereby in the future we will have China, India and Indonesia as giants. We need to strengthen that economic partnership and one way that we can do that is by strengthening people-to-people relations as well,” Albanese said.\n\n“Indonesia is an important nation, for our economy, for those social relationships as well…We need to really strengthen the relationship with Indonesia and that’s why it would be an absolute priority for me.”\n\nAnalysts say Australia’s new Prime Minister faces a tough challenge when it comes to China – especially after a bitter election campaign that has put Chinese President Xi Jinping and his intentions front and center.\n\nAustralia’s relations with China have deteriorated under the coalition’s stint in government – which started at the same time as Xi’s rule. Relations soured further in 2020 when the Australian government – then led by Morrison – called for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19. China responded with sanctions against Australian exports, including beef, barley, wine, and rock lobster.\n\nChina’s reaction hardened public attitudes in Australia and pushed Canberra to lead the charge against China’s coercive actions.\n\nThe coalition has suggested Labor will be soft on China, but on paper, Labor’s position on China seems little different from that of the conservatives. Labor says it’s committed to the AUKUS security pact, the deal Morrison struck with the United States and United Kingdom, to the detriment of Australia’s relations with France. It has also voiced strong support for the Quad.\n\nMoney can’t buy votes\n\nOne of the big losers in this election was Clive Palmer, the mining magnate who reportedly spent close to $100 million on advertising for his United Australia Party for next to no influence.\n\nThe man Palmer had touted as “the next Prime Minister,” Craig Kelly, a renegade from the Liberal Party who was reprimanded for spreading Covid-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories, lost his seat after securing just 8% of the primary vote.\n\nPalmer, who has been dubbed “Australia’s Trump,” campaigned on the issue of freedom and opposing Covid-19 vaccine mandates and lockdowns.\n\nThis is not the first time Palmer has tried to win elections with big money.

It also would have provided full gender parity and added designated seats for indigenous representatives.\n\nThe document was rejected in all of Chile’s provinces, including the more progressive capital of Santiago and its metropolitan area, where voters had overwhelmingly supported Boric last December during the presidential election.\n\nBoric responded to the defeat in a live televised address to the nation after the close of polling on Sunday.\n\n“Today the people of Chile have spoken, and they have done so loudly and clearly,” Boric said. “They have given us two messages. The first one is that they love and value their democracy … The second one is that the people of Chile was not satisfied with the proposed constitution and, therefore, has decided to reject in a clear way at the polls.”\n\nImages from Santiago on Sunday show a sombre mood among supporters of the constitution, while others celebrated the news it had been voted down.\n\nThe constitution currently in place was written under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, who ruled Chile with an iron fist from 1973 to 1990. Proponents of the new constitution wanted a break from Chile’s authoritarian past and a document that reflected the interests of communities that, according to them, had been ignored.\n\nSome waved flags as they celebrated the rejection of the proposed constitution. Pablo Sanhueza/Reuters\n\nWhy change the constitution?\n\nThe proposed change was initiated in 2020 when then-president Sebastien Piñera called a referendum on creating a new constitution amid social turmoil and popular discontent sparked by a metro fare increase in October 2019.\n\nIn October 2020, more than 78% of Chilean voters approved a plebiscite that proposed constitutional change, and in June 2021, they cast their ballots again to pick the members for a constituent assembly.\n\nThe Constitutional Assembly was the first in the world to have full gender parity and the first in the country´s history to include designated seats for indigenous representatives.\n\nSupporters were hopeful its progressive stance would be reflected in a new, updated constitution.\n\nAnd the constitutional process itself was praised internationally for giving the country an institutional way out of a social crisis, and for responding to modern Chileans’ demands for more equality and a more inclusive and participatory democracy.\n\nAccording to University of Chile professor Robert Funk, removing remnants of the past imposed by Pinochet was a key driver for creating a new constitution.\n\n“The existing constitution in Chile was written originally in 1980 under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Since then, it was amended many, many times; but it was always questioned because it was imposed during a dictatorship,” Funk said.\n\nPath to rejection\n\nAfter much deliberation, the final draft of the revised constitution was submitted to Boric, Piñera’s successor, in July this year.\n\nBut although most Chilean voters supported the idea of constitutional change back in October 2020, divisions appeared over the proposed draft.\n\nSoon after the draft was made public, different polls began showing an increasing trend toward the rejection of the charter, with the government publicly recognizing that scenario.\n\nThe defeated constitution would have been one of the most progressive in the world, giving the state a front-line role in the provision of social rights.\n\nThe draft put a strong emphasis on indigenous self-determination and on the protection of the environment, and would have dismantled the highly privatized water rights system. It had required gender equality in all public institutions and companies, and enshrined the respect for sexual diversity. It also envisaged a new national healthcare system.\n\nBut the project became bitterly divisive.\n\nThe right argued the draft would shift the country too far left, or that it was too ambitious and difficult to turn into efficient laws. In the lead-up to the vote, even some of its supporters on the left wanted adjustments made, with their slogan “approve to reform.”\n\nThe opposition has vowed to begin a new process to rewrite the constitution, promising voters the next one will better reflect their interests.\n\nIn his speech Sunday, Boric signaled this was not the end of efforts toward reform.\n\n“This decision by Chilean men and women requires our institutions and political actors to work harder, with more dialogue, with more respect and care, until we arrive at a proposal that interprets us all, that is trustworthy, that unites us as country,” Boric said.", "authors": ["Rafael Romo Maija Ehlinger Marlon Sorto Simone Mccarthy", "Rafael Romo", "Maija Ehlinger", "Marlon Sorto", "Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/21/australia/australia-election-results-morrison-albanese-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Australian voters deliver strong message on climate, ending ...", "text": "Brisbane, Australia CNN —\n\nAustralian voters have delivered a sharp rebuke to the center-right government, ending nine years of conservative rule, in favor of the center-left opposition that promised stronger action on climate change.\n\nAustralian Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese claimed victory Saturday, though it was unclear as counting continued if his party would have the 76 seats required to form a majority.\n\nEarly counting showed a strong swing towards Greens candidates and Independents who demanded emissions cuts far above the commitments made by the ruling conservative coalition.\n\nAmanda McKenzie, CEO of the research group the Climate Council, declared climate action the winner of the vote.\n\n“Millions of Australians have put climate first. Now, it’s time for a radical reset on how this great nation of ours acts upon the climate challenge,” she said in a statement.\n\nOther than climate, this election focused on the character of the leaders. Incumbent Scott Morrison. was deeply unpopular with voters and seemed to acknowledge as much when he admitted during the last week of the campaign that he had been a “bit of a bulldozer.” He was referring to making hard decisions during the pandemic and severing a submarine deal with France, but it reflected claims about his leadership style as being more authoritarian than collaborative.\n\nSpeaking to his supporters late Saturday night, Morrison said he had called Albanese and congratulated him on his election victory. “I’ve always believed in Australians and their judgment, and I’ve always been prepared to accept their verdict,” he said.\n\nJust before midnight, Albanese walked out to to cheers from his supporters and said he would seek to unite the nation. “I will work every day to bring Australians together. And I will lead a government worthy of the people of Australia.”\n\nHe added: “I can promise all Australians this no matter how you voted today, the government I lead will respect every one of you every day.”\n\nScott Morrison, flanked by his wife and daughters as he concede defeat to Labor leader Anthony Albanese. Asanka Ratnayake/Getty Images\n\nWhat Albanese will do as Prime Minister?\n\nOne of Albanese’s first priorities as Prime Minister will be to rebuild relations with foreign leaders he says Morrison has neglected in recent years. They include Pacific Island leaders, including the Solomon Islands whose leader signed a security pact with Beijing, stoking fears that China plans to build its first military base in the Pacific.\n\nOn Tuesday, Albanese intends to travel Tokyo with Foreign Minister Penny Wong for talks with Quad members from the United States, India and Japan, where they’ll discuss priorities to safeguard free passage in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe climate crisis was one of the defining issues of the election, as one of the few points of difference between the coalition and Labor, and a key concern of voters, according to polls.\n\nMarija Taflaga, lecturer in politics and international relations at the Australian National University, said the swing towards the Greens was remarkable. “I think everyone has been taken by surprise by these results…I think it will mean there will be greater and faster action on climate change more broadly.”\n\nLabor has promised to cut emissions by 43% by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2050, partly by strengthening the mechanism used to pressure companies to make cuts.\n\nBut research institute Climate Analytics says Labor’s plans aren’t ambitious enough to keep global temperature rise within 1.5 degrees Celsius, as outlined in the Paris Agreement.\n\nLabor’s policies are more consistent with a rise of 2 degrees Celsius, the institute said, marginally better than the coalition’s plan.\n\nTo speed up the transition to renewable energy, Labor plans to modernize Australia’s energy grid and roll out solar banks and community batteries. But despite its net zero commitment, Labor says it’ll approve new coal projects if they’re environmentally and economically viable.\n\nIn inner-city seats, results show voters threw their support behind Independents, mostly highly-educated female candidates standing on a platform of higher cuts to greenhouse emissions and integrity in government. They targeted traditionally safe Liberal seats, challenging voters to take a stand on decades of government inaction.\n\nAlbanese is supporting a rise in the minimum wage of 5.1%, though he doesn’t have the power to impose it, only leeway to submit a recommendation to the Fair Work Commission that the minimum wage keeps pace with inflation.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his wife Jenny cast their votes at a polling booth in Sydney on Saturday. Mark Baker/AP\n\nA modest upbringing to PM\n\nAlbanese often refers to his background as the son of a single mother to demonstrate his commitment to making life better for struggling Australians.\n\nHis mother, Maryanne, suffered rheumatoid arthritis and lived on disability benefits while she raised him alone in council housing in the 1960s.\n\n“It gave me a determination each and every day to help the people like I was growing up to have a better life. And I think that’s what Australians want,” he told the National Press Club in January.\n\nAlbanese repeatedly credited his mother for her strength during his campaign, most recently on Friday when he paid tribute to a “incredible woman.”\n\n“She’d be proud as punch because she made the courageous decision in 1963 to keep a child that she had out of wedlock,” he said.\n\nAlbanese’s father was a steward on a cruise ship, and the new Australian Prime Minister was born of a brief liaison that was scandalous at the time for a single Catholic woman.\n\nSo she told him that his father had died to spare him the truth, he said.\n\n“That was a tough decision,” he said. “It says something about the pressure that was placed on women and pressures that are still placed on women when faced with difficult circumstances. The fact that that young kid is now running for Prime Minister says a lot about her and her courage, but it also says a lot about this country.”\n\nAlbanese may have won over Australians, but one of his challenges as Prime Minister will be to unite the factions of his party, said Zareh Ghazarian, a lecturer in politics at Monash University.\n\n“He’s presented himself as someone who’s going to be a level-headed leader. The challenge that he will have is getting on top of and keeping on top of the Labor party caucus,” he said.\n\nAlbanese served as a minister in the previous Labor government under prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, before taking over as Labor leader after the party’s most recent election loss in 2019.\n\nThat loss knocked the wind out of Labor and they returned to this election campaign with more modest promises to avoid scaring off voters worried about radical change.\n\nPaul Williams, a political scientist with Griffith University, said Albanese lacked experience in major portfolios but predicted he would “grow into the job.”\n\n“I think it will be a steep learning curve for Albanese because he hasn’t had a very senior portfolio like treasurer or foreign affairs minister. And he’s going to be thrown into the mix of the Quad meeting next week. So it’s going to be baptism by fire,” he said.\n\nAlbanese said he hoped his win would show young Australians that “the doors of opportunity are open to us all.”\n\n“Every parent wants more for the next generation than they had. My mother dreamt of a better life for me. And I hope that my journey in life inspires Australians to reach for the stars.”", "authors": ["Hilary Whiteman"], "publish_date": "2022/05/21"}]}

It follows the House’s bipartisan approval of the legislation last week.\n\nThe legislation now goes to President Joe Biden for his signature. The White House views the removal of the mandate as “a mistake,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday. But she declined to say whether Biden would sign a bill that ends the requirement, noting that the president will “judge the bill in its entirety.”\n\nThe defense bill outlines the policy agenda for the Department of Defense and the US military and authorizes spending in line with the Pentagon’s priorities. But it does not appropriate the funding itself.\n\nThe must-pass legislation, which would authorize $817 billion specifically for the Department of Defense, would provide $45 billion more than Biden’s budget request earlier this year.\n\nThe increase for fiscal year 2023 is intended to address the effects of inflation and accelerate the implementation of the national defense strategy, according to the Senate Armed Services Committee. It would authorize $12.6 billion for the inflation impact on purchases, $3.8 billion for the impact on military construction projects and $2.5 billion for the impact on fuel purchases, according to a bill summary from the committee.\n\nThe NDAA also includes provisions to strengthen air power and land warfare defense capabilities, as well as cybersecurity.\n\nAnd the legislation shows Congress’ continued support for helping Ukraine repel Russia’s invasion, even though several Republican lawmakers have raised questions about the ongoing US aid.\n\n“That’s the important thing – that you don’t see any diminution in the bipartisan consensus about providing support to Ukraine, despite having heard a lot about rising concerns,” said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.\n\nHere are some key provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act:\n\nSupport for service members and their families\n\nThe bill would provide a 4.6% increase in military basic pay for service members, the largest in 20 years. The Department of Defense’s civilian workforce would get the same raise.\n\nIt would also bump up service members’ housing allowance by 2% and require a report on a “more transparent, fair, and flexible way to calculate the basic allowance for housing,” according to a summary from the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nThe legislation would also increase the eligibility threshold for the Basic Needs Allowance, a new supplemental payment for low-income military families, to 150% of the federal poverty line, up from 130%.\n\nThe NDAA would also increase funding for commissaries to help offset higher prices. And it would create a pilot program to reimburse military families for certain child care costs related to a permanent change of station.\n\nIt would authorize the reimbursement of up to $4,000 for pet relocation expenses stemming from permanent changes of station to or from locations outside the continental US.\n\nTo address the issue of suicides among service members, the bill would require the defense secretary to compile a report on suicide rates by military occupational specialty, service and grade. It would mandate that the defense secretary brief the congressional Armed Services committees on the preliminary findings of the review no later than June 1.\n\nSome 519 US service members died by suicide last year, according to the Pentagon. The overall suicide rate per 100,000 active-duty service members has slowly increased from 2011 to 2021.\n\nAid for Ukraine\n\nThe NDAA would extend and modify the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, as well as authorize $800 million in funding in fiscal year 2023, which is $500 million more than was contained in last year’s defense bill.\n\nThe program provides funding for the federal government to pay industry to produce weapons and security assistance to send to Ukraine, rather than drawing directly from current US stockpiles of weapons.\n\nThe funding authorization in the defense bill is intended to supplement additional money for the initiative expected in a future federal spending package, according to Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who wrote the program into law in 2015.\n\nAlso, the defense bill would expedite the delivery of munitions to Ukraine and the replenishment of associated US stockpiles by streamlining acquisition requirements and authorizing multiyear procurement for certain munitions, according to the House Armed Services Committee. The authorization would also provide stocks of munitions to US allies and partners, as well as increase the number of munitions that would be needed if China takes action against Taiwan.\n\nIt would be the largest number of multiyear procurement contracts for munitions that the defense bill has authorized in recent history, if not ever.\n\nOne of the key concerns throughout the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has been whether the industrial bases of the US and other allied nations can meet the demand required to support Ukraine. This measure is focused on reducing bureaucratic red tape to help industry produce those weapons for Ukraine faster.\n\nEnhanced defense partnership with Taiwan\n\nThe NDAA would establish a specific defense modernization program for Taiwan to deter aggression by China, according to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey.\n\nIt would authorize up to $10 billion in Foreign Military Financing grants over the next five years, enhance training and collaboration, and make available up to $2 billion in loans.\n\nIt would also give the president the authority to give Taiwan up to $1 billion in weapons and munitions.\n\nAnd it would create a regional contingency stockpile, which would allow the Pentagon to put weapons in Taiwan for use if a military conflict with China arises, Cancian said.\n\nWary that Russia’s aggression against Ukraine might prompt China to take similar action against Taiwan, Biden has said several times that the US has an obligation to defend the self-governing island should China invade. Under Biden, as well as his predecessors, the US has sold weapons to Taiwan to strengthen its defensive capabilities.\n\nThe bill would end the requirement that troops receive the Covid-19 vaccine. However, it would not reinstate members of the military who were discharged for refusing to get vaccinated – an amendment conservative senators unsuccessfully offered.\n\nThe controversial provision to rescind the mandate was pushed by congressional Republicans. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy said last week that the mandate’s end is “a victory for our military and for common sense.”\n\nBut military officials and experts have warned that it could have adverse ripple effects on military readiness and the ability of service members to deploy around the world.\n\nWhile White House officials have deferred to – and explicitly sided with – Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s opposition to rescinding the mandate, Democrats concluded that including the GOP priority was a necessity in order to get the bill across the finish line. Administration officials have quietly acknowledged that means their opposition to the vaccine language will not get in the way of the bill’s passage.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/politics/spending-bill-congress-omnibus/index.html", "title": "Here's what's in the $1.7 trillion federal omnibus spending law | CNN ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story originally ran December 20. It has been updated to reflect the current status of the legislation.\n\nCNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed into law a $1.7 trillion yearlong federal government spending package on Thursday, after the House and Senate passed it last week.\n\nThe legislation includes $772.5 billion for nondefense discretionary programs and $858 billion in defense funding. That represents an increase in spending in both areas for fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe sweeping package includes roughly $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies, an overhaul of the electoral vote-counting law, protections for pregnant workers, an enhancement to retirement savings rules and a TikTok ban on federal devices.\n\nIt also provides a boost in spending for disaster aid, college access, child care, mental health and food assistance, more support for the military and veterans and additional funds for the US Capitol Police. And the legislation contains several major Medicaid provisions, particularly one that could disenroll up to 19 million people from the nation’s health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nHowever, the law, which runs more than 4,000 pages, left out several measures that some lawmakers had fought to include. An expansion of the child tax credit, as well as multiple other corporate and individual tax breaks, did not make it into the final bill. Neither did legislation to allow cannabis companies to bank their cash reserves – known as the Safe Banking Act – or a bill to help Afghan evacuees in the US gain lawful permanent residency. And the spending package did not include a White House request for roughly $10 billion in additional funding for Covid-19 response.\n\nThe spending law, which will keep the government operating through September, the end of the fiscal year, is the product of lengthy negotiations between top congressional Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCongress originally passed a continuing resolution on September 30 to temporarily fund the government in fiscal year 2023, which began October 1.\n\nHere’s what’s in the law:\n\nMore aid for Ukraine: The spending law provides roughly $45 billion to help support Ukraine’s efforts to defend itself against Russia’s attack.\n\nAbout $9 billion of the funding will go to Ukraine’s military to pay for a variety of things including training, weapons, logistics support and salaries. Nearly $12 billion will be used to replenish US stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine through presidential drawdown authority.\n\nAlso, the law provides $13 billion for economic support to the Ukrainian government. Other funds address humanitarian and infrastructure needs, as well as support European Command operations.\n\nEmergency disaster assistance: The law provides more than $38 billion in emergency funding to help Americans in the west and southeast affected by recent natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. It will aid farmers, provide economic development assistance for communities, repair and reconstruct federal facilities and direct money to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, among other initiatives.\n\nOverhaul of the electoral vote-counting law: A provision in the legislation aims at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, the first legislative response to the US Capitol insurrection and then-President Donald Trump’s campaign to stay in power despite his loss in 2020.\n\nThe changes overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act, which Trump tried to use to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe legislation clarifies the vice president’s role while overseeing the certification of the electoral result to be completely ceremonial. It also creates a set of stipulations designed to make it harder for there to be any confusion over the accurate slate of electors from each state.\n\nFunding for January 6 attack prosecutions: The law provides $2.6 billion for US Attorneys, which includes funding efforts “to further support prosecutions related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol and domestic terrorism cases,” according to a fact sheet from the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe package also gives $11.3 billion to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including for efforts to investigate extremist violence and domestic terrorism.\n\nThe funding measures are part of nearly $39 billion for the Justice Department.\n\nRetirement savings enhancements: The law contains new retirement rules that could make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings – and less costly to withdraw them. Among other things, the provisions will allow penalty-free withdrawals for some emergency expenses, let employers offer matching retirement contributions for a worker’s student loan payments and increase how much older workers may save in employer retirement plans.\n\nTikTok ban from federal devices: The legislation bans TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, from federal government devices.\n\nSome lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China’s national security laws could force TikTok – or its parent, ByteDance – to hand over the personal data of its US users. Recently, a wave of states led by Republican governors have introduced state-level restrictions on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices.\n\nProtections for pregnant workers: The law provides pregnant workers with workplace accommodations – such as additional bathroom breaks, stools or relief from heavy lifting duties – needed for healthy pregnancies. It will prevent them from being forced to take leave or losing their jobs, as well as bar employers from denying employment opportunities to women based on their need for reasonable accommodations due to childbirth or related medical conditions. Also, another provision in the package guarantees workplace accommodations – particularly time to pump – for more nursing workers.\n\nChanges to Medicaid and other health care programs: The law phases out the requirement that prevented states from disenrolling Medicaid recipients as long as the national public health emergency was in effect in exchange for an enhanced federal match. This continuous coverage measure was enacted as part of a Covid-19 relief package passed in March 2020 and has led to a record 90 million Medicaid enrollees, many of whom may no longer meet the income requirements to qualify.\n\nUnder the law, states will be able to start evaluating Medicaid enrollees’ eligibility and terminating their coverage as of April 1. The redetermination process will take place over at least 12 months. Also, the enhanced federal Medicaid funding will phase down through December 31, 2023, though the states will have to meet certain conditions during that period.\n\nUp to 19 million people could lose their Medicaid benefits, according to estimates, though many would be eligible for other coverage.\n\nAlso, under a provision in the law, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, will offer 12 months of continuous coverage for children. This will allow the 40 million children on Medicaid and CHIP to have uninterrupted access to health care throughout the year.\n\nIn addition, the law makes permanent the option for states to offer 12 months of postpartum coverage for low-income mothers through Medicaid, rather than just 60 days. More than two dozen states, plus the District of Columbia, have implemented the measure, which was available on a temporary basis through the American Rescue Plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Another seven states are planning to implement the option.\n\nPlus, the package provides more money for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The funds are intended to speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics and preventive measures, beef up public health activities and strengthen the nation’s biosecurity by accelerating development of medical countermeasures for pandemic threats and fortifying stockpiles and supply chains for drugs, masks and other supplies.\n\nIncreased support for the military and veterans: The package funds a 4.6% pay raise for troops and a 22.4% increase in support for Veteran Administration medical care, which provides health services for 7.3 million veterans.\n\nIt includes nearly $53 billion to address higher inflation and $2.7 billion – a 25% increase – to support critical services and housing assistance for veterans and their families.\n\nThe law also allocates $5 billion for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, which provides additional funding to implement the landmark PACT Act that expands eligibility for health care services and benefits to veterans with conditions related to toxic exposure during their service.\n\nBeefing up nutrition assistance: The legislation establishes a permanent nationwide Summer EBT program, starting in the summer of 2024, according to Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger advocacy group. It will provide families whose children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals with a $40 grocery benefit per child per month, indexed to inflation.\n\nIt also changes the rules governing summer meals programs in rural areas. Children will be able to take home or receive delivery of up to 10 days’ worth of meals, rather than have to consume the food at a specific site and time.\n\nThe law also helps families who have had their food stamp benefits stolen since October 1 through what’s known as “SNAP skimming.” It provides them with retroactive federal reimbursement of the funds, which criminals steal by attaching devices to point-of-sale machines or PIN pads to get card numbers and other information from electronic benefits transfer cards.\n\nHigher maximum Pell grant awards: The law increases the maximum Pell grant award by $500 to $7,395 for the coming school year. This marks the largest boost since the 2009-2010 school year. About 7 million students, many from lower-income families, receive Pell grants every year to help them afford college.\n\nHelp to pay utility bills: The package provides $5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Combined with the $1 billion contained in the earlier continuing resolution, this is the largest regular appropriation for the program, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Home heating and cooling costs – and the applications for federal aid in paying the bills – have soared this year.\n\nAdditional funding for the US Capitol Police: The law provides an additional $132 million for the Capitol Police for a total of nearly $735 million. It will allow the department to hire up to 137 sworn officers and 123 support and civilian personnel, bringing the force to a projected level of 2,126 sworn officers and 567 civilians.\n\nIt also gives $2 million to provide off-campus security for lawmakers in response to evolving and growing threats.\n\nMore money for child care: The legislation provides $8 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, a 30% increase in funding. The grant gives financial assistance to low-income families to afford child care.\n\nAlso, Head Start will receive nearly $12 billion, an 8.6% boost. The program helps young children from low-income families prepare for school.\n\nMore resources for children’s mental health and for substance abuse: The law provides more funds to increase access to mental health services for children and schools. It also will invest more money to address the opioid epidemic and substance use disorder.\n\nInvestments in homelessness prevention and affordable housing: The legislation provides $3.6 billion for homeless assistance grants, a 13% increase. It will serve more than 1 million people experiencing homelessness.\n\nThe package also funnels nearly $6.4 billion to the Community Development Block Grant formula program and related local economic and community development projects that benefit low- and moderate income areas and people, an increase of almost $1.6 billion.\n\nPlus, it provides $1.5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which will lead to the construction of nearly 10,000 new rental and homebuyer units and maintain the record investment from the last fiscal year.\n\nMore support for the environment: The package provides an additional $576 million for the Environmental Protection Agency, bringing its funding up to $10.1 billion. It increases support for enforcement and compliance, as well as clean air, water and toxic chemical programs, after years of flat funding.\n\nIt also boosts funding for the National Park Service by 6.4%, restoring 500 of the 3,000 staff positions lost over the past decade. This is intended to help the agency handle substantial increases in visitation.\n\nPlus, the legislation provides an additional 14% in funding for wildland firefighting.\n\nWhat’s not in the law\n\nEnhanced child tax credit: A coalition of Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates pushed hard to extend at least one provision of the enhanced child tax credit, which was in effect last year thanks to the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Their priority was to make the credit more refundable so more of the lowest-income families can qualify. Nearly 19 million kids won’t receive the full $2,000 benefit this year because their parents earn too little, according to a Tax Policy Center estimate.\n\nNew cannabis banking rules: Lawmakers considered including a provision in the spending bill that would make it easier for licensed cannabis businesses to accept credit cards – but it was left out of the legislation. Known as the Safe Banking Act, which previously passed the House, the provision would prohibit federal regulators from taking punitive measures against banks for providing services to legitimate cannabis businesses.\n\nEven though 47 states have legalized some form of marijuana, cannabis remains illegal on the federal level. That means financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses are subject to criminal prosecution – leaving many legal growers and sellers locked out of the banking system.\n\nCovid-19 response: Lawmakers did not include a White House request for an additional $10 billion in funding for Covid-19, which would have been aimed at continued access to and development of vaccines and therapeutics, among other things. Earlier in the year, the Biden administration unsuccessfully pushed for $22.5 billion in extra funds.\n\nFBI headquarters: There was also no final resolution on where the new FBI headquarters will be located, a major point of contention as lawmakers from Maryland – namely House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer – pushed to bring the law enforcement agency into their state. In a deal worked through by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the General Services Administration would be required to conduct “separate and detailed consultations” with Maryland and Virginia representatives about potential sites in each of the states, according to a Senate Democratic aide.\n\nAfghan Adjustment Act: Also not included in the spending bill was the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would have helped Afghan allies who run the risk of deportation from the US. It would have given those evacuees a pathway to lawful permanent residency before their temporary status, known as humanitarian parole, expires in 2023. Many congressional Republicans raised concerns about vetting and other issues, but the legislation’s supporters, including former US military leaders, argued those worries have been addressed.\n\nLegislation to extend and expand Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who worked with the US during the war there and want to come to America is included in the spending bill.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby Katie Lobosco", "Tami Luhby", "Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/22/china/china-belt-and-road-us-infrastructure-overseas-development-intl-hnk-mic/index.html", "title": "China's Belt and Road is facing challenges.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nAs US President Joe Biden and top American officials traveled the world this summer, promoting a pledge of hundreds of billions of dollars for poorer countries, a largely unspoken motivation loomed in the background: competition with China.\n\nFor nearly a decade, Beijing’s sprawling overseas development initiative, known as the Belt and Road, has poured billions of dollars into infrastructure projects each year – paving highways from Papua New Guinea to Kenya, constructing ports from Sri Lanka to West Africa, and providing power and telecoms infrastructure for people from Latin America to Southeast Asia.\n\nWashington now appears keen to bolster its own role in global infrastructure development as it intensifies its competition with China across the globe.\n\nIn June, Biden and leaders from the Group of Seven advanced economies promised to unleash $600 billion in investment – $200 billion of that from the US alone – by 2027 to “deliver game-changing projects to close the infrastructure gap” between countries.\n\nThis month, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman visited the South Pacific, promoting a new partnership to bolster support for island nations, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a plan aimed at Africa.\n\n“We’ve seen the consequences when international infrastructure deals are corrupt and coercive, when they’re poorly built or environmentally destructive, when they import or abuse workers, or burden countries with crushing debts,” Blinken said during a visit to Pretoria, where he revealed the White House’s new “Sub-Saharan Africa Strategy.”\n\n“That’s why it’s so important for countries to have choices, to be able to weigh them transparently, with the input of local communities without pressure or coercion,” he said in an apparent reference to common criticisms of Chinese-funded projects.\n\nThe challenge from the United States comes at a precarious time for China’s Belt and Road. Even as the initiative has had an impact on a number of countries, funding shortfalls and political pushback have stalled certain projects, and there is public concern in some countries over issues like excess debt and China’s influence. Accusations that Belt and Road is a broad “debt trap” designed to take control of local infrastructure, while largely dismissed by economists, have sullied the initiative’s reputation.\n\nEconomic challenges at home and a changing financial environment globally also have the potential to impact how China’s lenders and policymakers deploy funds, analysts say.\n\nAll this may create an opportunity for Washington to step forward and work with willing partners in need of financing. But major questions hang over the extent to which the US can deliver, both in terms of mobilizing billions and driving infrastructure – areas in which China has long excelled.\n\nBoom or bust?\n\nSince its official launch in 2013, early in the first term of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, funds under the initiative have powered the construction of bridges, ports, highways, energy and telecoms projects across Asia, Latin America, Africa and parts of Europe.\n\nTo do this, China has relied on lending, with capital often coming not only from its development banks but state-run commercial lenders – a stark difference to the American model that’s been largely based on official aid.\n\nOn average, during the first five years of the initiative from 2013 to 2017, China spent about $85 billion financing overseas development projects per year, more than twice as much as any other major economy, AidData, a research lab at William & Mary in the US, which tracks this spending from Chinese government institutions and state-owned entities, said in a 2021 report.\n\nAnd while funding has been welcomed by countries around the world, it has also come with problems.\n\n“We find that 35% of (Belt and Road) projects are suffering from some sort of implementation challenge,” said research scientist Ammar A. Malik, who heads AidData’s Chinese Development Finance Program. He said those issues include environmental incidents, corruption scandals and labor violations, and the 35% figure refers specifically to projects implemented solely by a Chinese entity.\n\nAidData has also reported on what it terms “hidden debts,” referring to cases where the recipients of Chinese loans are entities like private or project companies, not governments themselves, but the terms of the loan require the host government to guarantee it. This can ultimately pass liability to them for repayment if the borrowers fall short, the researchers say.\n\nChina has pushed back on assertions of risky lending or environmental issues in its projects, pointing to its “green” initiatives and saying “such allegations do not reflect the whole picture.”\n\nUganda's Chinese-funded Karuma hydropower plant, pictured here in 2020, remains under construction after set-backs due to Covid-19. Zhang Gaiping/Xinhua News Agency/Getty Images\n\nAnother question concerns the direction of the initiative, especially as China’s own economy flags amid a mortgage crisis and Covid-19 lockdowns, while many developing countries are struggling with rising debt and inflation – making lending a potentially riskier proposition.\n\nBeijing has said it remains dedicated to the initiative, with its top diplomat Yang Jiechi at a trade forum on August 14 calling for Belt and Road to “promote the early recovery and growth of the global economy.”\n\nBut while tracking investments across a wide range of players, and without a central, public Belt and Road data source, is difficult work, there are signs that China’s efforts, especially big-ticket projects, have been slowing in recent years and since the pandemic.\n\nFor example, Chinese loans to Africa dropped 77% from $8.2 billion to $1.9 billion from 2019 to 2020, according to data from the Boston University Global Development Policy Center.\n\n“Potential reasons for this decrease include the Covid-19 pandemic’s deterioration of economic conditions in host countries and a lack of host country demand due to fiscal constraints and debt issues. Limited travel and suspension of several (Belt and Road) projects may have also contributed to preventing financial deal closing,” said data analyst Oyintarelado Moses of the center’s Global China Initiative.\n\n“Before the pandemic, Chinese policy bank finance was already on the decline. The pandemic appears to have accelerated this trend,” she said, adding Chinese institutions would now “take stock” of their strategies.\n\nMore time may be needed to observe whether Belt and Road infrastructure financing has peaked, and to assess the performance of the initiative overall, others say.\n\n“The (initiative) is not even a decade old yet. Labeling it a failure because of delayed or distressed projects would be premature and simplistic, as would deeming it a success for Chinese global influence,” said Austin Strange, an assistant professor of international relations at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nBuild Back Better?\n\nThe US is already the world’s top donor of aid for developing countries. But whether it can mobilize its private sector and a recently revamped development finance arm, known as the US International Development Finance Corporation, to rival China as an infrastructure financier is another question.\n\nThe G7 initiative, originally announced in 2021 under the name Build Back Better World, meanwhile, has gotten off to a slow start, analysts say. The leaders only formally launched the initiative – now called the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment – in Germany this summer.\n\nIn addition to the US pledge of $200 billion from grants, federal financing, and private sector investments, the White House promised the project would “demonstrate how millions of dollars can mobilize tens or hundreds of millions in further investments and tens or hundreds of millions can mobilize billions.”\n\nBut unlike Beijing’s model, where state-run entities play a key role, the US has no such ability to determine the size and scope of investments made by its private sector, analysts say.\n\nThe US also doesn’t have the same kind of domestic dynamics, such as excess capacity in the industrial sector, which made the Belt and Road an ideal outlet for the Chinese economy and enabled it to launch projects quickly.\n\n“This is not the first time that expectation has been built, but it’s going to be quite challenging to get private companies to finance (projects) because at the end of the day, they’re accountable to their shareholders and they want projects that are bankable,” said AidData’s Malik.\n\nBut while US private companies will be looking to return a profit, the plan does have the potential to open up opportunity for the US and partners in developing countries, particularly in certain sectors, analysts say.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken listens as Rwanda's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vincent Biruta speaks during a news conference in Kigali, Rwanda on August 11. Andrew Harnik/Associated Press\n\nOne reason is that US appears poised not to compete with China on the kinds of signature big-ticket items like bridges and railroads its known for, or to seek to push countries to choose it or China – a choice few would likely be willing to make.\n\nInstead, it could use its own model of public-private finance and focus on areas where it may have competitive advantages, analysts say, with Biden laying out energy security and climate resilience, information and communications technology projects, as well as infrastructure that promotes gender equality and strengthens health care systems, as areas of focus.\n\nHowever, the US and its partners will need to do more than in the past to become “strong alternative sources of investment” chosen by partner governments over China, according to Moses at Boston University, who added US strengths in regulatory standards, transparency and environmental or social safeguards could appeal to some partners.\n\nThe US may also need to face perceptions that it retreated from Africa after the end of the Cold War, only to return when there is another great power rivalry at play, according to Christopher Isike, director of the African Center for the Study of the United States at South Africa’s University of Pretoria.\n\n“When these initiatives come, like (the US’ new “Sub-Saharan Africa Strategy”) people are skeptical,” he said.\n\nGovernments on the continent, however, would welcome more sources of funding to meet shortfalls, and there is a perception that the US is more transparent and it has an advantage when it comes to soft power, according to Isike.\n\nAs that great power competition returns to Africa, the question, he said, should not be whether or how countries would choose between the US or China, but if African governments “would be ready to leverage the benefits of having this kind of contest.”", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/politics/fact-check-biden-midterms-2022/index.html", "title": "Fact check: Biden's midterms message includes false and ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been back on the campaign trail, traveling in October and early November to deliver his pitch for electing Democrats in the midterm elections on Tuesday.\n\nBiden’s pitch has included claims that are false, misleading or lacking important context. (As always, we take no position on the accuracy of his subjective arguments.) Here is a fact-check look at nine of his recent statements.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment for this article.\n\nSocial Security, part 1\n\nBiden said at a Democratic fundraiser in Pennsylvania last week: “On our watch, for the first time in 10 years, seniors are going to get the biggest increase in their Social Security checks they’ve gotten.” He has also touted the 2023 increase in Social Security payments at other recent events.\n\nBut Biden’s boasts leave out such critical context that they are highly misleading. He hasn’t explained that the increase in Social Security payments for 2023, 8.7%, is unusually big simply because the inflation rate has been unusually big. A law passed in the 1970s says that Social Security payments must be increased by the same percentage that a certain measure of inflation has increased. It’s called a cost-of-living adjustment.\n\nThe White House deleted a Tuesday tweet that delivered an especially triumphant version of Biden’s boast, and press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre acknowledged Wednesday that the tweet was lacking “context.” You can read a more detailed fact check here.\n\nSocial Security, part 2\n\nBiden said at a Democratic rally in Florida on Tuesday: “And on my watch, for the first time in 10 years, seniors are getting an increase in their Social Security checks.”\n\nThe claim that the 2023 increase to Social Security payments is the first in 10 years is false. In reality, there has been a cost-of-living increase every year from 2017 onward. There was also an increase every year from 2012 through 2015 before the payment level was kept flat in 2016 because of a lack of inflation.\n\nThe context around this Biden remark in Florida suggests he might have botched his repeat campaign line about Social Security payments increasing at the same time as Medicare premiums are declining. Regardless of his intentions, though, he was wrong.\n\nA new corporate tax\n\nBiden repeatedly suggested in speeches in October and early November that a new law he signed in August, the Inflation Reduction Act, will stop the practice of successful corporations paying no federal corporate income tax. Biden made the claim explicitly in a tweet last week: “Let me give you the facts. In 2020, 55 corporations made $40 billion. And they paid zero in federal taxes. My Inflation Reduction Act puts an end to this.”\n\nBut “puts an end to this” is an exaggeration. The Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the number of companies on the list of non-payers, but the law will not eliminate the list entirely.\n\nThat’s because the law’s new 15% alternative corporate minimum tax, on the “book income” companies report to investors, only applies to companies with at least $1 billion in average annual income. (There are lots of nuances; you can read more specifics here.) According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, the think tank that in 2021 published the list of 55 large and profitable companies that avoided paying any federal income tax in their previous fiscal year, only 14 of these 55 companies reported having US pre-tax income of at least $1 billion in that year.\n\nIn other words, there will clearly still be some large and profitable corporations paying no federal income tax even after the minimum tax takes effect in 2023. The exact number is not yet known.\n\nMatthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said in a Thursday email that the new tax is “an important step forward from the status quo” and that it will raise substantial revenue, but he also said: “I wouldn’t want to assert that the minimum tax will end the phenomenon of zero-tax profitable corporations. A more accurate phrasing would be to say that the minimum tax will *help* ensure that *the most profitable* corporations pay at least some federal income tax.”\n\nThe debt and the deficit\n\nBiden said at the Tuesday rally in Florida: “Look, you know, you can hear it from Republicans, ‘My God, that big-spending Democrat Biden. Man, he’s taken us in debt.’ Well, guess what? I reduced the federal deficit this year by $1 trillion $400 billion. One trillion 400 billion dollars. The most in all American history. No one has ever reduced the debt that much. We cut the federal debt in half.”\n\nBiden offered a similar narrative at a Thursday rally in New Mexico, this time saying, “We cut the federal debt in half. A fact.”\n\nThere are two significant problems here.\n\nFirst: Biden conflated the debt and the deficit, which are two different things. It’s not true that Biden has “cut the federal debt in half”; the federal debt (total borrowing plus interest owed) has continued to rise under Biden, exceeding $31 trillion for the first time this October. Rather, it’s the federal deficit – the annual difference between spending and revenue – that was cut in half between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.\n\nSecond, it’s highly questionable how much credit Biden deserves for even the reduction in the deficit. Biden doesn’t mention that the primary reason the deficit plummeted in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 was that it had skyrocketed to a record high in 2020 because of emergency pandemic relief spending. It then fell as expected as the spending expired as planned.\n\nDan White, senior director of economic research at Moody’s Analytics – an economics firm whose assessments Biden has repeatedly cited during his presidency – told CNN’s Matt Egan in October: “On net, the policies of the administration have increased the deficit, not reduced it.” The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group, says the administration’s own actions have significantly worsened the deficit picture. (David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, told Egan that the Biden administration does deserve credit for the economic recovery that has boosted tax revenues.)\n\nThe unemployment rate\n\nBiden said at the Florida rally on Tuesday: “Unemployment is down from 6.5 to 3.5%, the lowest in 50 years.” He said at the New Mexico rally on Thursday: “Unemployment rate is 3.5% – the lowest it’s been in 50 years.”\n\nBut Biden didn’t acknowledge that September’s 3.5% unemployment rate was actually a tie for the lowest in 50 years – a tie, specifically, with three months of Trump’s administration, in late 2019 and early 2020. Since Biden uses these campaign speeches to favorably compare his own record to Trump’s record, that omission is significant.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 3.7% in October; that number was revealed on Friday, after these Biden comments. The rate was 6.4% in January 2021, the month Biden took office.\n\nBiden’s student debt policy\n\nDuring an on-camera discussion conducted by progressive organization NowThis News and published online in late October, Biden told young activists that they “probably are aware, I just signed a law” on student debt forgiveness that is being challenged by Republicans. He added: “It’s passed. I got it passed by a vote or two, and it’s in effect.”\n\nBiden’s claims are false.\n\nHe created his student debt forgiveness initiative through executive action, not through legislation, so he didn’t sign a law and didn’t get it passed by any margin. Since Republicans opposed to the initiative, including those challenging the initiative in court, have called it unlawful precisely because it wasn’t passed by Congress, the distinction between a law and an executive action is a highly pertinent fact here.\n\nA White House official told CNN that Biden was referring to the Inflation Reduction Act, the law narrowly passed by the Senate in August; the official said the Inflation Reduction Act created “room for other crucial programs” by bringing down the deficit. But Biden certainly did not make it clear that he was talking about anything other than the student debt initiative.\n\nGas prices\n\nBiden correctly noted on various occasions in October that gas prices have declined substantially since their June 2022 peak – though, as always, it’s important to note that presidents have a limited impact on gas prices. But in an economic speech in New York last week, Biden said, “Today, the most common price of gas in America is $3.39 – down from over $5 when I took office.”\n\nBiden’s claim that the most common gas price when he took office was more than $5 is not even close to accurate. The most common price for a gallon of regular gas on the day he was inaugurated, January 20, 2021, was $2.39, according to data provided to CNN by Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. In other words, Biden made it sound like gas prices had fallen significantly during his presidency when they had actually increased significantly.\n\nIn other recent remarks, Biden has discussed the state of gas prices in relation to the summer peak of more than $5 per gallon, not in relation to when he took office. Regardless, the comment last week was the second this fall in which Biden inaccurately described the price of gas – both times in a way that made it sound more impressive.\n\nYou can read a longer fact check here.\n\nBiden and Xi\n\nBiden has revived a claim that was debunked more than 20 months ago by The Washington Post and then CNN. At least twice in October, he boasted that he traveled 17,000 miles with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\n“I’ve spent more time with Xi Jinping of China than any world leader has, when I was Vice President all the way through to now. Over 78 hours with him alone. Eight – nine of those hours on the phone and the others in person, traveling 17,000 miles with him around the world, in China and the United States,” he told a Democratic gathering in Oregon in mid-October.\n\nBiden made the number even bigger during a speech on student debt in New Mexico on Thursday, saying, “I traveled 17-, 18,000 miles with him.”\n\nThe claim is false. Biden has not traveled anywhere close to 17,000 miles with Xi, though they have indeed spent lots of time together. Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler noted in 2021 that the two men often did not even travel parallel routes to their gatherings, let alone physically travel together. The only apparent way to get Biden’s mileage past 17,000, Kessler found, is to add the length of his flight journeys between Washington and Beijing, during which, obviously, Xi was not with him.\n\nA White House official told CNN in early 2021 that Biden was adding up his “total travel back and forth” for meetings with Xi. But that is very different than traveling “with” Xi as Biden keeps saying, especially in the context of a boast about how well he knows Xi – and Biden has had more than enough time to make his language more precise.\n\nThe Trump tax cuts\n\nBiden claimed at the Thursday rally in New Mexico that under Trump, Republicans passed a $2 trillion tax cut that “affected only the top 1% of the American public.”\n\nBiden correctly said in various October remarks that the Trump tax cut law was particularly beneficial to the wealthy, but he went too far here. It’s not true that the Trump policy “only” affected the top 1%.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center think tank found in early 2018 that Trump’s law “will reduce individual income taxes on average for all income groups and in all states.” The think tank estimated that “between 60 and 76 percent of taxpayers in every state will receive a tax cut.” And in April 2019, tax-preparation company H&R Block said two-thirds of its returning customers had indeed paid less in tax that year than they did the year prior, The New York Times reported in an article headlined “Face It: You (Probably) Got a Tax Cut.”\n\nThe Tax Policy Center did find in early 2018 that people at the top would get by far the biggest benefits from Trump’s law. Specifically, the think tank found that the top 1% of earners would get an average 3.4% increase in after-tax 2018 income – versus an average 1.6% income increase for people in the middle quintile, an average 1.2% income increase for people in the quintile below that and just an average 0.4% income increase for people in the lowest quintile. The think tank also found that the top 1% of earners would get more than 20% of the income benefits from the law, a bigger share than the bottom 60% of earners combined.\n\nThe distribution could get even more skewed after 2025, when the law’s individual tax cuts will expire if not extended by Congress and the president. If there is no extension – and, therefore, the law’s permanent corporate tax cut remains in place without the individual tax cuts – the Tax Policy Center has estimated that, in 2027, the top 1% will get 83% of the benefits from the law.\n\nBut that’s a possibility about the future. Biden claimed, in the past tense, that the law “affected” only the top 1%. That’s inaccurate.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time Biden overstated his point about the Trump tax cuts. The Washington Post fact-checked him in 2019, for example, when he claimed “all of it” went to the ultra-rich and corporations.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/07/biden-state-of-the-union-sotu-address-updates/11204405002/", "title": "State of the Union 2023 address recap: Biden lays out ambitious ...", "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C — President Joe Biden took credit Tuesday for what he said was the country's economic revival while pushing an agenda of reducing prescription drug costs, protecting abortion rights and banning assault weapons.\n\nThe economy was reeling two years ago, Biden said in his second State of the Union address delivered in a packed House chamber. In a preview of an expected reelection campaign announcement, he noted that the unemployment rate was at 50-year low while inflation has been easing.\n\n“We’ve been sent here to finish the job,” Biden said, invoking a phrase he used several times in his speech.\n\nBut the rancorous atmosphere in the House chamber telegraphed fights ahead, including over budget priorities and avoiding a catastrophic default on the nation’s debt.

Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000.

Biden then announced, “new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.”\n\n“American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables,” he said. “And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.”\n\nBiden’s message echoes former President Donald Trump’s prior State of the Union addresses where he boasted about initiatives to bring back manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the years.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nInsulin costs:Medicare caps insulin costs at $35 a month.

Factories at home closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.”\n\nBiden then spoke about his administration’s accomplishments in the manufacturing sector.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nMore:As Biden prepares 2024 reelection run, Dems worry blue-collar voters are slipping away\n\nBiden: ‘COVID no longer controls our lives’\n\nBiden said the nation’s economy is roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”\n\nBiden said his administration has created 12 million jobs, “more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nA full House – literally – for State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden entered a full House chamber Tuesday.\n\nThe capacity crowd included House and Senate members, current and former Supreme Court justices, family and honored guests.\n\nBiden’s first words were met with a standing ovation, as he honored Republican and Democratic leaders – but also as he described the state of the union.\n\nThe applause came from Democrats and Republicans, and the standing ovations were sometimes led by a row of powerful Senate moderates, including Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Kyrsten Sinema, who recently changed her party affiliation to independent.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nBiden: Pelosi is 'greatest speaker’ ever\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t sitting behind Biden for his address but she got a special call-out from the president anyway.\n\n“I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi,” Biden said.\n\nPelosi stepped down from Democratic leadership after the midterm elections.

That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements. Sixty-two percent of Americans said Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or “little or nothing,\" in the same Washington Post-ABC News poll, while only 36% said he has accomplished \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat to watch for:The State of the Union is Tuesday: Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris chats with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ahead of speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris shook hands with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the two chatted, as they stood behind the rostrum waiting for Biden to enter the House chamber.\n\nThis will be the first State of the Union with McCarthy as speaker since Republicans took control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden heads to the Capitol\n\nBiden left the White House at 8:30 p.m. en route to the Capitol.

That included Rep.

Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the first former White House press secretary to deliver a formal State of the Union response – she is not, however, the first governor of Arkansas to do the honors.\n\nBack in 1985, the Democrats picked a young governor of Arkansas to deliver their response to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis name?

Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/business/egypt-debt-crisis-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Egypt: How the Arab world's most populous country became ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in today’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, CNN’s three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\nEgypt has dug itself a massive hole of debt. On Friday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will extend a $3 billion loan to the country, a fourth aid package in six years, as its financial tailspin continues.\n\nThe loan, along with billions of dollars in cash inflows from Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, are Band-Aids, experts say, designed to keep the Arab world’s most populous country afloat. Without proper reforms, however, Egypt may never be able to shake off its chronic financial woes and break its growing debt addiction.\n\nIn recent months, the Egyptian pound has plummeted, losing 14.5% of its value against the US dollar in October. The prices of vegetables, dairy products and bread skyrocketed. Some families are restricting their diets as their purchasing power shrinks, while others struggle to find imported products once available at their local stores.\n\nIn a country with a long history of political tension and a fast-growing population – currently 104 million people – the repercussions of economic pain can be far-reaching. When millions of Egyptian protesters toppled former President Hosni Mubarak during the 2011 Arab Spring, “Bread, freedom and social justice” was among the most popular chants.\n\nEgypt’s main Gulf Arab backers recognize what’s at stake here. Billions of dollars from Abu Dhabi and Riyadh have poured into the Egyptian economy in recent years. Both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia saw giant windfalls on the back of this year’s high oil prices. They’ve used some of that money to bolster the economies of their allies in the Middle East.\n\nIn August, Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ), one of the emirate’s wealth funds, announced a number of investments in publicly listed companies in Egypt, “building on its long-term commitment to investing in the country’s economic growth through its $20 billion joint strategic investment platform,” it said in a statement.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) also launched the Saudi Egyptian Investment Company (SEIC) in August, a company dedicated to investments in several vital sectors of the Egyptian economy. SEIC has bought $1.3 billion dollars’ worth of shares in four Egyptian businesses.\n\nStill, the Egyptian economy has struggled to shake off its economic woes. Inflation is at a five-year high, making food and other basic goods unaffordable to tens of millions of vulnerable Egyptians.\n\nKicking the can down the road\n\nThe North African state now owes more than $52 billion to multilateral institutions, at least 44.7% of which is owed to the IMF alone.\n\nIts foreign debt “has more than tripled between June 2013 and March 2022, raising the external debt-to-GDP ratio from 15% to approximately more than 35%,” writes Stephan Roll, head of the Africa and Middle East Division at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) in Berlin.\n\n“And there is no end in sight,” he adds.\n\nShoppers browse fresh fruit for sale at a market in Alexandria, Egypt. Islam Safwat/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut how did Egypt get here? The problem, analysts say, lies in Egypt’s apparent inability to change the way its economy works, including easing the tight control exerted by the military and its many enterprises. This is a problem, the experts say, that stunts private sector competition and drives away investment.\n\nEgypt has been on the path to debt-addiction for several years. In 2016, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi sealed a deal with the IMF granting a $12 billion loan. The bailout was granted on condition of Egypt’s currency floating freely, which ultimately slashed its value by half in a matter of weeks and pushed up inflation. Harsh austerity measures – including cuts to subsidies on fuel and electricity – were enforced to try to restore government finances.\n\nDespite the bailout, Egypt struggled to fully pick itself back up, with analysts attributing the repeated failures to revitalize the economy to loose agreements and the mismanagement of loans.\n\n“Not only are they [loans] temporary Band-Aids, they’re not conditioned in a manner that would actually push for the reforms necessary to ever allow the Egyptian economy to recover,” said Timothy Kaldas, a policy fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.\n\n“Recently they [the multilateral lenders] seem to have started to finally notice that, and seem to want to see some of those reforms, but they haven’t successfully gotten the Egyptians to agree to them,” he added.\n\nThe cash-strapped country also spends much of its funds on luxury megaprojects that critics call “unnecessary” when other sectors seem to be in dire need of support, including education and health care. Data pertaining to state spending on these projects is not available to the public.\n\n“Loans were not primarily used to improve the economic framework conditions but to protect the revenues and assets of the armed forces, to finance major projects in which the military could earn significant money, and to pursue an expansive military build-up,” Roll told CNN.\n\nAuthorities have repeatedly defended the state megaprojects, arguing that they improved infrastructure, transportation and telecommunications.\n\n“These are projects that cannot be put to the side, as they are projects needed by the Egyptian citizen,” said Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly in a May press conference. He blamed the Covid-19 pandemic and the effects of the Ukraine war for exacerbating Egypt’s financial problems.\n\nClose to 30% of Egypt’s population is below the poverty line, authorities say. The World Bank in 2019 estimated that “some 60% of Egypt’s population is either poor or vulnerable,” highlighting a growing disparity between the rich and poor.\n\nAuthorities insist they are making progress. Sisi has repeatedly called on military-owned companies to be listed on the stock exchange, but few concrete steps have been taken to liberalize those enterprises.\n\nIn September 2019, brief and rare demonstrations broke out across Egypt, despite a strict ban on protests. They were driven primarily by economic grievances. Protesters also decried the military’s alleged influence over finances. Security forces quickly quelled the demonstrations and more than 4,000 people were arrested.\n\nThe digest\n\nIrish soldier killed in south Lebanon by ‘hostile mob’\n\nAn Irish soldier on a peacekeeping mission in Lebanon was shot and killed on Wednesday when his UN convoy was attacked by a “hostile mob,” according to Irish Defense Minister Simon Coveney. Seán Rooney, 23, was shot and killed in the incident, and another Irish soldier was seriously injured.\n\nBackground: The convoy was conducting a “standard administrative run” between southern Lebanon and Beirut, Coveney said. The group then came under small arms fire, social media footage showed. Lebanon’s Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati has vowed to hold the culprits accountable. According to multiple official statements, the injured troops were taken to Raee Hospital, near the city of Sidon. Rooney was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.\n\nWhy it matters: The United Nations has maintained a multinational peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon since 1978, to bolster security in the tense border area between Lebanon and Israel. Irish peacekeepers have been in the country since the start of the mandate. According to Coveney, Rooney’s death was the first Irish fatality in the country in two decades. There are long-simmering tensions between the peacekeeping mission, known as UNIFIL, and locals in the region where Iran-backed Hezbollah dominates.\n\nIran expelled from UN women’s rights body\n\nIn an unprecedented move, UN member states on Wednesday voted to remove Iran from a UN women’s rights body for violating the rights of women and girls amid ongoing protests across the country.\n\nBackground: Twenty-nine members of the UN’s Economic and Social Council voted in favor of the resolution to remove Iran from the Commission on the Status of Women, which was proposed by the United States. Eight member states voted against the resolution with 16 abstentions. Iran condemned the move, calling it an “illegal request” that weakens the rule of law in the UN.\n\nWhy it matters: Iran had just started a four-year term on the 45-member Commission on the Status of Women, which aims to promote gender equality worldwide. Women in Iran have played a vital role in nationwide demonstrations that erupted in September, but have also allegedly been a target of state violence. Last month, CNN revealed covert testimonies by protesters documenting sexual assault and rape in Iranian detention centers.\n\nIstanbul’s mayor sentenced to jail and faces possible political ban\n\nIstanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu – the most popular rival of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan – was sentenced to nearly three years in jail on Wednesday for insulting public officials. He could face a political ban if the conviction is upheld by an appeals court.\n\nBackground: After the court convicted Imamoglu to two years, 7 months and 15 days in prison, his first response to the ruling was defiant. “A handful of people cannot take away the authority given by the will of the people,” the mayor said. “With God’s will, our struggle begins even stronger.” Imamoglu won a rerun election for Istanbul mayor in June 2019 after the first election was canceled due to irregularities.\n\nWhy it matters: The decision could bar him from running in the 2023 presidential elections, where he would compete with Turkey’s long-time president. Thousands protested the ruling on Thursday, chanting slogans against Erdogan and his AK party, Reuters reported.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nDefending champion France ended Morocco’s 2022 World Cup dream on Wednesday after a 2-0 victory at the Al Bayt Stadium.\n\nTheo Hernández scored on five minutes with an acrobatic finish, with substitute Randal Kolo Muani tapping home late on as France reached its fourth World Cup final just four years after winning in Russia.\n\nBut Morocco, the first African team to reach the semifinal stage of the World Cup, can go home with its head held high after running France close before Kolo Muani’s decisive strike.\n\nHaving captured the hearts and minds of the footballing world, it was a sad end to Morocco’s aspirations. But it gave reigning champion France a run for its money. Morocco leaves the competition knowing it has achieved more than just success on the pitch.\n\nRead more:\n\nA Kenyan security guard who reportedly fell while on duty at Qatar’s Lusail Stadium has died in hospital, his family and officials have confirmed to CNN.

The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine’s government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.\n\n“We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,” SpaceX’s director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter.\n\nAmong the SpaceX documents sent to the Pentagon and seen by CNN is a previously unreported direct request made to Musk in July by the Ukrainian military’s commanding general, General Valerii Zaluzhniy, for almost 8,000 more Starlink terminals.\n\nIn a separate cover letter to the Pentagon, an outside consultant working for SpaceX wrote, “SpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy.”\n\nThe documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a rare breakdown of SpaceX’s own internal numbers on Starlink, detailing the costs and payments associated with the thousands of terminals in Ukraine. They also shed new light on behind-the-scenes negotiations that have provided millions of dollars in communications hardware and services to Ukraine at little cost to Kyiv.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed they received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of the Starlink satellite communications product in Ukraine, a statement from Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Singh confirmed the Pentagon had been in communication with SpaceX but did not say whether it was over the funding of the Starlink satellite communication product.\n\nMusk on Friday said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musk’s Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: “F*** off.”\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musk’s claimed peace plan for Russia’s Ukraine war by saying: “F*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk.”\n\n“We’re just following his recommendation,” Musk said on Friday, responding to a tweet that referenced CNN’s reporting and Melnyk’s comments, even though the letter SpaceX sent to the Pentagon was sent before the Twitter exchange.\n\nReports of outages\n\nThe letters come amid recent reports of wide-ranging Starlink outages as Ukrainian troops attempt to retake ground occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n\nSources familiar with the outages said they suddenly affected the entire frontline as it stood on September 30. “That has affected every effort of the Ukrainians to push past that front,” said one person familiar with the outages who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. “Starlink is the main way units on the battlefield have to communicate.”\n\nThis photograph taken on September 25 shows an antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere was no warning to Ukrainian forces, a second person said, adding that now when Ukraine liberates an area a request has to be made for Starlink services to be turned on.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the outages which resulted in a “catastrophic” loss of communication, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a tweet responding to the article, Musk didn’t dispute the outage, saying that what is happening on the battlefield is classified.\n\nSpaceX’s suggestion it will stop funding Starlink also comes amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musk’s allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nAfter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he “still very much support[s] Ukraine” but fears “massive escalation.”\n\nMusk also argued privately last month that Ukraine doesn’t want peace negotiations right now and that if they went along with his plan, “Russia would accept those terms,” according to a person who heard them.\n\n“Ukraine knows that its current government and wartime efforts are totally dependent on Starlink,” the person familiar with the discussions said. “The decision to keep Starlink running or not rests entirely in the hands of one man. That’s Elon Musk. He hasn’t been elected, no one decided to give him that power. He has it because of the technology and the company he built.”\n\nOn Tuesday Musk denied a report he has spoken to Putin directly about Ukraine. On Thursday, when a Ukrainian minister tweeted that Starlink is essential to Ukraine’s infrastructure, Musk replied: “You’re most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.”\n\n“The gall to look like heroes”\n\nMore than seven months into the war, it’s hard to overstate the impact Starlink has had in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops as well and NGOs and civilians have relied on the nimble, compact and easy-to-use units created by SpaceX. It’s not only used for voice and electronic communication but to help fly drones and send back video to correct artillery fire.\n\nCNN has seen it used at numerous Ukrainian bases.\n\nElon Musk pauses and looks down as he speaks during a press conference at SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Village in South Texas on February 10, 2022. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Starlink has been absolutely essential because the Russians have targeted the Ukrainian communications infrastructure,” said Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. “Without that they’d be really operating in the blind in many cases.”\n\nThough Musk has received widespread acclaim and thanks for responding to requests for Starlink service to Ukraine right as the war was starting, in reality, the vast majority of the 20,000 terminals have received full or partial funding from outside sources, including the US government, the UK and Poland, according to the SpaceX letter to the Pentagon.\n\nSpaceX’s request that the US military foot the bill has rankled top brass at the Pentagon, with one senior defense official telling CNN that SpaceX has “the gall to look like heroes” while having others pay so much and now presenting them with a bill for tens of millions per month.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX figures shared with the Pentagon, about 85% of the 20,000 terminals in Ukraine were paid – or partially paid – for by countries like the US and Poland or other entities. Those entities also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity, which SpaceX says costs $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. (Over the weekend, Musk tweeted there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine.)\n\nIn his July letter to Musk, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Gen. Zaluzhniy, praised the Starlink units’ “exceptional utility” and said some 4,000 terminals had been deployed by the military. However, around 500 terminals per month are destroyed in the fighting, Zaluzhniy said, before asking for 6,200 more terminals for the Ukrainian military and intelligence services and 500 per month going forward to offset the losses.\n\nSpaceX said they responded by asking Zaluzhniy to instead take up his request to the Department of Defense.\n\nOn September 8, the senior director of government sales for SpaceX wrote the Pentagon saying the costs have gotten too high, approaching $100 million. The official asked the Department of Defense to pick up Ukraine’s new request as well as ongoing service costs, totaling $124 million for the remainder of 2022.\n\nThose costs, according to the senior defense official, would reach almost $380 million for a full year.\n\nSpaceX declined repeated requests for comment on both the outages and their recent request to the Pentagon. A lawyer for Musk did not reply to a request for comment. Defense Department spokesman Bob Ditchey told CNN, “The Department continues to work with industry to explore solutions for Ukraine’s armed forces as they repel Russia’s brutal and unprovoked aggression. We do not have anything else to add at this time.”\n\nBreaking down the costs\n\nEarly US support for Starlink came via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which according to the Washington Post spent roughly $3 million on hardware and services in Ukraine. The largest single contributor of terminals, according to the newly obtained documents, is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals.\n\nUS Pentagon in Washington DC building looking down aerial view from above Ivan Cholakov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe US has provided almost 1,700 terminals. Other contributors include the UK, NGOs and crowdfunding.\n\nThe far more expensive part, however, is the ongoing connectivity. SpaceX says it has paid for about 70% of the service provided to Ukraine and claims to have offered that highest level – $4,500 a month – to all terminals in Ukraine despite the majority only having signed on for the cheaper $500 per month service.\n\nThe terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlink’s website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month.\n\nThat’s just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying.\n\n“You could say he’s trying to get money from the government or just trying to say ‘I don’t want to be part of this anymore,’” said the person familiar with Ukraine’s requests for Starlink. Given the recent outages and Musk’s reputation for being unpredictable, “Feelings are running really high on the Ukrainian side,” this person said.\n\nMusk is the biggest shareholder of the privately-held SpaceX. In May, SpaceX disclosed that its valuation had risen to $127 billion and it has raised $2 billion this year, CNBC reported.\n\nLast week, Musk faced a barrage of criticism on Twitter – including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – after presenting in a series of tweets his peace plan to end the war. It would include giving Crimea to Russia and re-do referenda, supervised by the United Nations this time, in the four regions Russia recently illegally annexed.\n\nIt echoed comments he’d made last month at an exclusive closed-door conference in Aspen, Colorado called “The Weekend,” at which Musk told a room full of attendees that Ukraine should seek peace now because they’ve had recent victories.\n\n“This is the time to do it. They don’t want to do it, that’s for sure. But this is the time to do it,” he said, according to a person in the room. “Everyone wants to seek peace when they’re losing but they don’t want to seek peace when they’re winning. For now.”", "authors": ["Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns-released/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump: Key takeaways from six years of former president's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSix years of Donald Trump’s federal tax returns released on Friday show the former president paid very little in federal income taxes the first and last year of his presidency, claiming huge losses that helped limit his tax bill, among other revelations.\n\nThe returns, long shrouded in secrecy, were released to the public on Friday by the House Ways and Means Committee, the culmination of a battle over their disclosure that went to the Supreme Court. They confirm a report issued from the Joint Committee on Taxation that Trump claimed large losses before and throughout his presidency that he carried forward to reduce or practically eliminate his tax burden. For example, his returns show that he carried forward a $105 million loss in 2015 and $73 million in 2016.\n\nThe thousands of pages of documents from the former president’s personal and business federal tax returns – which spanned the years 2015 through 2020 – provide a complex web of raw data about Trump’s finances, offering up many questions about his wealth and income that could be pursued both by auditors and Trump’s political opponents.\n\nHere are key takeaways from the documents reviewed by CNN:\n\nReturns shed light on questionable tax claims\n\nTrump’s returns also show the former president made several claims that auditors may question.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation, which reviewed the returns, flagged that Trump claimed a large number of questionable items on his tax returns, including eyebrow-raising amounts of interest he claims to have received from loans to his children that the bipartisan committee said could indicate Trump was disguising gifts.\n\nThe JCT argued that an auditor should investigate the loan agreements Trump made with his children, including the interest rates. If the interest Trump claims to have charged his children was not at market rate, for example, it could be considered a gift for tax purposes, requiring him to pay a higher tax rate on the money.\n\nIn each year of his presidency, for example, Trump claimed he received exactly $18,000 in interest on a loan he said he gave his daughter Ivanka Trump and $8,715 in interest from his son Donald Trump, Jr.. In 2017 to 2019, Trump said he received exactly $24,000 from his son Eric Trump, and Eric paid him $19,605 in interest in 2020.\n\nThat raises the question of whether “the loans were bona fide arm’s length transactions, or whether the transfers were disguised gifts that could trigger gift tax and a disallowance of interest deductions by the related borrowers,” the JCT said in its report.\n\n“It’s unusual to have interest in round numbers – very rare,” said Martin Sheil, former supervisory special agent for IRS’ Criminal Investigation unit. “An auditor would want to see payments, loan agreements and interest rates.”\n\nThere are also questions about Trump’s returns listing an identical amount of company expenses and income.\n\nFor example, in 2017, Trump claimed his business DJT Aerospace LLC, which operates Trump’s personal helicopter, claimed $42,965 in income. It also claimed the exact same amount – $42,965 – in expenses. In other words, every single dollar – to the dollar – that the company earned was negated by the company’s expenses, such as payroll, fuel and other items. That left the company with zero income – and nothing to tax.\n\n“Total expenses equaling total income is a statistical impossibility,” said Shiel, who added that the figures are not evidence something illegal was done. “It just doesn’t happen.”\n\nThe JCT in its report raised several similar questions. For example, it noted IRS auditors were investigating multiple so-called large unusual questionable items on Trump’s tax returns for which the regulator wanted Trump to provide supporting evidence to back up his claims.\n\nRelease comes after years-long fight\n\nThe returns were obtained by the Democratic-run Ways and Means Committee only a few weeks ago after a protracted legal battle that lasted nearly four years. The committee voted last week to release the tax returns, but their release was delayed to redact sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers.\n\nThe release of the tax returns follows a pursuit for the documents that had typically been made public voluntarily by past US presidents. Trump and his legal team continuously sought to keep his returns secret, arguing that Congress had never wielded its legislative powers to demand a president’s tax returns, which Trump said could have far-reaching implications.\n\n“The Democrats should have never done it, the Supreme Court should have never approved it, and it’s going to lead to horrible things for so many people,” Trump said in a statement following the release.\n\n“The ‘Trump’ tax returns once again show how proudly successful I have been and how I have been able to use depreciation and various other tax deductions as an incentive for creating thousands of jobs and magnificent structures and enterprises.”\n\nOther Republicans also criticized Democrats’ efforts in pursuit of the tax returns as political, with Texas Rep. Kevin Brady – the committee’s top conservative – saying the release would amount to “a dangerous new political weapon that reaches far beyond the former president and overturns decades of privacy protections for average Americans that have existed since the Watergate reform.”\n\nDuring the committee’s closed-door meeting last week, Republicans warned that the release of Trump’s tax returns by Democrats could prompt retribution once Republicans control the House next year – like going after the taxes of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\n“I had countless people tell me of things that they were concerned with President Biden’s family dealings and how they believed that him and his family is enriched because of his political power. And they are begging for oversight and accountability on that,” said Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, according to excerpts the GOP released from the meeting. “Do we need to go down all that? Is that what you all are wishing to do?”\n\nReturns show he held foreign bank accounts while in office\n\nTrump reported having foreign bank accounts between 2015 and 2020, including a bank account in China between 2015 and 2017, his tax returns show.\n\nTrump was required to report the accounts to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The filings show that the former president maintained foreign bank accounts in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and China.\n\nThe China bank account, which was reported by The New York Times in 2020, was tied to Trump International Hotels Management’s business push in the country, Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten said at the time.\n\nThe 2020 disclosure of business dealings in China came as the Trump campaign sought to portray Biden as a “puppet” of China. Biden’s income tax returns and financial disclosures showed no business dealings or income from China.\n\nThe returns also show that Trump paid more in foreign taxes than in US federal income taxes in 2017, the first year of his presidency.\n\nIn 2017, Trump paid just $750 in US federal income taxes because of large carry-forward losses that he claimed in prior years, negating virtually all of his American tax liability. Yet Trump paid nearly $1 million in taxes to foreign countries that year.\n\nThe fact that Trump paid foreign taxes isn’t in itself surprising, but it shows how Trump’s companies and businesses interests span the globe, and how those businesses are subject to local tax laws and regulations.\n\nOn his tax return, Trump listed business income, taxes, expenses or other notable financial items in Azerbaijan, Panama, Canada, India, Qatar, South Korea, the United Kingdom, China, the Dominican Republic, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, Grenada, US territory Puerto Rico, Georgia, Israel, Brazil, St. Maarten, Mexico, Indonesia, Ireland, Turkey, and St. Vincent.\n\nTrump claimed no charitable deductions in 2020\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump pledged he would donate the entirety of his $400,000 salary to charity each year. He frequently boasted about donating parts of his quarterly paycheck to various government agencies.\n\n“While the press doesn’t like writing about it, nor do I need them to, I donate my yearly Presidential salary of $400,000.00 to different agencies throughout the year,” Trump tweeted in March 2019.\n\nIf he donated his 2020 salary, he didn’t claim it on his taxes. Among the six years of tax returns the House Ways and Means Committee released, 2020 was the sole year in which Trump listed no donations to charity.\n\nTrump’s finances took a sizable hit in 2020, probably as a result of the pandemic and the lack of demand for vacations and lodging in his hotels. Trump reported large donations to charity in 2018 and 2019, helping reduce the amount he owed on millions of dollars in income he reported in those years.\n\nBut Trump posted a massive $4.8 million adjusted loss in 2020, a year, which alone wiped out his federal income tax obligation. Trump paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2020.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation raised questions about the accuracy of some enormous charitable deductions Trump claimed in previous years’ tax returns, including large and unsubstantiated cash gifts. Trump also claimed a $21.1 million deduction in 2015 for donating 158 acres of his 212-acre property called Seven Springs in North Castle, New York. That donation, which was made to a land trust, is a focus of the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal investigation of the Trump Organization’s finances.\n\nTrump’s own 2017 tax law appears to have reduced the amount he was able to deduct from tax bill\n\nTrump claimed that the 2017 Republican tax plan he championed and signed would cost him and his family “a fortune.” It’s not clear that it did, but it does appear to have limited the amount that he could claim in one part of his complex tax return.\n\nThe 2017 tax law capped the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, at $10,000 a year. In previous years, tax filers were allowed to deduct more of their SALT payments. Although the law was passed in 2017, it didn’t apply until the 2018 tax year.\n\nIn 2018, Trump listed $10.5 million in state and local taxes, but could deduct just $10,000 of that from his taxes. In 2019, Trump paid $8.4 million in SALT but was capped at $10,000. And in 2020, Trump said he paid $8.5 million in SALT but claimed the maximum allowable $10,000.\n\nBy comparison, in 2016 and 2017, Trump was able to deduct significantly more from state and local taxes. For example, in 2016 and 2017, he deducted $5.2 million each year in SALT payments.\n\nSome Democrats criticized the 2017 tax law’s SALT cap for taking aim at residents in the Northeast and the West who have some of the highest property taxes in the country. The Tax Foundation found that property tax deductions capped in 2017 had previously accounted for about a third of all state and local tax deductions. But Trump defended the provision, saying the cap was necessary even if it would hurt his own finances.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the SALT cap hurt Trump, however. Although that particular deduction was capped, Trump claimed many other deductions that limited the amount of federal income taxes he had to pay.\n\nPresidential audits\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the IRS and writing tax policy, requested the returns under the authority of section 6103 of the US tax code. Their report focused primarily on whether Trump’s tax returns during his time in office were properly audited under the IRS’ mandatory audit program for US presidents.\n\nThe committee found that the IRS opened only one “mandatory” audit during Trump’s term – for his 2016 tax return. And that didn’t take place until the fall of 2019, after Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sent a letter asking the IRS for Trump’s returns and tax information. The report characterizes the presidential audit program as “dormant.”\n\n“The research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was nonexistent,” Neal said last week following the committee vote.\n\nRepublicans on the committee argued that Democrats acknowledged it was “not necessary to publicly release the private tax information to change requirements on the presidential audit program.”\n\nA Republican dissent issued Friday warned that, “Democrats’ dangerous precedent will lead the American public to demand other people’s tax returns to be released.”\n\nLast week, the House passed a bill that would reform the presidential audit process in a largely symbolic vote before Republicans take the majority in the new Congress. The legislation is not expected to be taken up by the Senate before the new Congress is sworn in.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["David Goldman Jeremy Herb Jeanne Sahadi Maegan Vazquez", "David Goldman", "Jeremy Herb", "Jeanne Sahadi", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/09/27/republican-gop-debate-live-fact-check/70934154007/", "title": "GOP debate fact check: What Ramaswamy, Haley got right (and ...", "text": "Republican presidential candidates are on the debate stage tonight for the second time ahead of the 2024 primary.\n\nFollow along here with the USA TODAY Fact Check Team as we dig into candidates' claims and add context on expected campaign themes, including election fraud, the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, the war in Ukraine and more.\n\nMore: Republican debate updates: GOP Candidates face off in California\n\nThe truth, directly in your inbox: Sign up for the Checking the Facts newsletter\n\nHere's some background from our archives on topics we expect to see through the campaign and perhaps this evening:\n\nTim Scott claim: Nikki Haley spent $50,000 on curtains as the UN ambassador\n\n“As the UN ambassador, you literally put $50,000 on curtains.” -Scott\n\nThis is false, and Nikki Haley has a New York Times correction to prove it.\n\nThe Times published an article in September 2018 suggesting Haley made the decision to purchase customized and mechanized curtains for picture windows in the official residence for the ambassador to the United Nations, a role that she was serving in at the time.\n\nThe outlet later issued a correction saying the article and headline “created an unfair impression” about Haley’s involvement in the purchase. Its correction said the purchasing decision was made during the Obama administration and that Haley was not involved.\n\nHaley said as much in responding to Scott, who asked if she sent the pricey curtains back. Haley responded by saying Scott was “scrapping.”\n\n— BrieAnna Frank\n\nMike Pence claim: Trump administration oversaw record-low unemployment for Blacks, Hispanics\n\n\"We saw literally the lowest unemployment ever recorded for Hispanic Americans, lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans.\" - Pence\n\nThe unemployment rates for Blacks and Latinos fell to new lows in 2019 – specifically, 4% for Hispanics or Latinos in September 2019 and 5.3% for Blacks in August 2019.\n\nBut this cherry-picked data ignores that these rates have fallen even lower under Trump's democratic successor.\n\nIn September 2022, the Hispanic or Latino unemployment rate hit a record low of 3.9%, and in April the Black unemployment rate hit a record low of 4.7%, according to Federal Reserve Economic Data.\n\nRead more:\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nNikki Haley claim: China is ‘stealing $600 billion in intellectual property’\n\nHaley is offering a precise figure in an area experts say is difficult to quantify, and her figure is the high extreme of an estimated range.\n\nThe Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, a bipartisan and independent group, estimated in 2018 that Chinese intellectual property theft costs the U.S. between $225 billion and $600 billion annually. The FBI estimated in 2019 that the annual cost of all counterfeit goods, pirated software and theft of trade secrets is between $225 billion and $600 billion.\n\nThe report from the FBI states that China is “the world’s principal infringer of intellectual property, and it uses its laws and regulations to put foreign companies at a disadvantage and its own companies at an advantage.”\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nMike Pence claim: US became net energy exporter under Trump\n\nUnder Donald Trump, \"We became a net exporter of energy for the first time in 75 years.\" - Pence\n\nThis is accurate. The U.S. has been an \"annual net total energy exporter\" since 2019, when Donald Trump was still president, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nThis was a reversal of the prior seven decades.\n\n\"Up to the early 1950s, the United States produced most of the energy it consumed,\" the administration's website says. \"U.S. energy consumption was higher than U.S. energy production in every year from 1958 (to) 2018.\"\n\nIn 2022, the country's total energy exports were the highest on record, having increased more than 9% from 2021.\n\nRead more:\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nVivek Ramaswamy claim: Ukraine banned 11 opposition parties\n\n“Just because Putin’s an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good. This is a country that has banned 11 opposition parties.” - Ramaswamy\n\nThis happened, but Ramaswamy left out key details on why.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy announced in March 2022 that Ukraine suspended 11 political parties because of their ties to Russia, as reported by The Guardian. The announcement came one month after Russia launched its invasion of the country.\n\n“Therefore, the national security and defense council decided, given the full-scale war unleashed by Russia, and the political ties that a number of political structures have with this state, to suspend any activity of a number of political parties for the period of martial law,” Zelenskyy said, according to the outlet.\n\nUkraine’s parliament voted in July to extend the country’s martial law until Nov. 15, Reuters reported.\n\n— BrieAnna Frank\n\nRon DeSantis claim: Toddler died after fentanyl exposure at Florida AirBNB\n\n“In Florida we had an infant, 18 months, parents rented an AirBNB. And apparently the people who rented it before were using drugs. The infant was crawling, the toddler was crawling on the carpet and ingested fentanyl residue and died.” – DeSantis\n\nThe Florida governor was talking about the death of 19-month-old Enora Lavenir.\n\nThe girl died in 2021 while she and her family stayed at a rental property in Wellington, Florida, while they visited from France, according to a report from the Palm Beach Post on the wrongful death lawsuit her family filed in March in Palm Beach County.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the home was not properly cleaned after a party was held there in which fentanyl and other drugs were present.\n\nBut official reports have not yet confirmed that. The county medical examiner’s office ruled her death accidental and said it was caused by acute fentanyl toxicity.\n\nIt is not clear how the child ingested the substance, and an incident report from the county sheriff’s office did not indicate how the toddler was exposed to the drug, according to the newspaper report. She was napping on the afternoon of Aug. 7, 2021, when her mother found her unresponsive. She was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nChris Christie claim: Trump built 52 miles of border wall\n\n\"(Trump) built 52 miles of wall and said Mexico would pay for it.\"\n\nThe length of border wall built by the Trump administration varies based on how it's counted. A count based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection data puts the total at 458 miles, but many of those additions replaced existing barriers.\n\nPolitiFact reported in August that a CBP report says former President Donald Trump's administration built \"52 miles of new primary wall systems and 33 miles of new secondary wall systems where there were none before.\"\n\nSome experts say Trump's replacement barriers shouldn't be set aside because they replaced inferior barriers. For example, nearly 200 miles of short fencing, around 3 to 4 feet high, that is intended to stop vehicles was replaced with 18- to 30-foot steel barriers, according to a Cato Institute report.\n\nRead more:\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nNikki Haley claim: Fentanyl has killed more Americans than the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq\n\nFentanyl has killed more Americans \"than the Iraq, Vietnam or Afghanistan wars combined.\" -Haley\n\nThe number of U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq wars totals about 65,000 people.\n\nIn 2021 alone, there was a total of 106,000 drug overdose deaths reported in the U.S., including about 70,000 involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, which is primarily fentanyl, according to the National Institutes of Health.

The country accounts for at least 85% of the world’s capacity to process rare earth minerals, according to the research firm Adamas Intelligence.\n\nThe research firm reported in September that China upped its mining quotas to 240,000 tons, a 14% increase from last year. Relaxed environmental laws have helped China gain an advantage over other countries in rare mineral production, according to Reuters.\n\nRare earth alloys and magnets are key components in the use of some military equipment, such as missiles, firearms, radars and stealth aircraft, according to Politico. Rare earth materials are also needed for more familiar technologies, including smartphones, electric vehicles and LED lights, according to the Science History Institute.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTim Scott claim: First bill under Biden had $86 billion for union pensions\n\n“We should look back at the first bill in Congress under Joe Biden. The first bill had $86 billion for the union pensions, because they continue to overpromise but underdeliver.” – Scott\n\nScott’s numbers were right, but he was a bit off on his timing. He was talking about the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package that included $86 billion in aid for about 185 union pension plans that were near collapse, The New York Times reported at the time.\n\nBut it wasn’t the first bill during that term, according a search of the Congressional website. Dozens of other bills and procedural actions were introduced first.\n\nIt was first proposed a week before Biden’s inauguration in early January 2021, according to CNN. But it wasn’t until Feb. 24, 2021, that it was formally introduced in the House by Kentucky Democrat John Yarmuth.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTim Scott claim: 6 million illegal border crossings under Biden\n\nData from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection show its agents have had more than 6.2 million encounters at the southwest border since January 2021, when Biden took office. Encounters include both apprehensions, when a person is taken into U.S. custody under Title 8 of the U.S. code, and expulsions, when they are immediately expelled to their home countries or last country of transit without being taken into U.S. custody, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nIllegal border crossings climbed to near-record levels in September, CBS News reported. December 2022 saw more than 250,000 crossings – both the highest number during Biden’s term and the highest number ever recorded.\n\nNikki Haley referenced the same statistic later in the debate.\n\n– BrieAnna Frank\n\nChris Christie claim: Donald Trump added $7 trillion to our national debt\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie touted this stat in asserting a lack of fiscal restraint by Republicans, echoing a claim Nikki Haley made in the August Republican debate. Haley said the figure was $8 billion, which is a little closer.\n\nUsing Treasury Department data, the total public debt, which includes intragovernmental holdings and public debt, increased by approximately $7.8 trillion from the start of Trump’s presidency on Jan. 20, 2017, to when he left office on Jan. 19, 2021.\n\nRead more: False claim Trump increased debt more than any president | Fact check\n\n-Eric Litke\n\nElection integrity a key issue for GOP candidates\n\nA key issue for the candidates is whether they will trust – and abide by – the elections that will decide the winners and losers.\n\nState-level reviews of the 2022 midterm elections found no indication of systemic problems with voter fraud. That’s significant because allegations from Trump and his allies have penetrated the Republican Party and eroded confidence in the process.\n\nSeveral candidates have championed changes to address election integrity.\n\nDeSantis created Florida’s Office of Election Crimes and Security. A year ago, his administration accused 20 felons ineligible to vote in 2020 of illegally casting ballots and charged them with third-degree felonies.\n\nHaley as governor signed a law in 2011 that requires South Carolina voters to show photo ID. Christie vetoed a bill in 2016 that would automatically register New Jerseyans to vote when they obtain or renew their driver’s license, calling it “a cocktail of fraud,” NJ.com reported.\n\nMisinformation has circulated about the integrity of the elections. Here are some that have been debunked:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nUS aid to Ukraine divides Republican candidates\n\nMore than a year and a half after Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, there remain differing views among Republican presidential candidates when it comes to continuing U.S. support for Ukraine's defense.\n\nTrump, who isn’t on the debate stage, has repeatedly suggested the U.S. is providing too much support to Ukraine. He has also refused to say whether he wants Russia or Ukraine to prevail in the conflict.\n\nDeSantis has also been skeptical of U.S. support for Ukraine, saying in a March statement that the war is a \"territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia\" and not one of the country's \"vital national interests.\"\n\nIn a Fox News interview, Ramaswamy said the U.S. has done enough to help Ukraine.\n\nPence, who visited Ukraine in June, has said he supports providing Ukraine with military aid to fight back against Russia. Christie too has said he supports continuing U.S. support for Ukraine, as does Scott.\n\nHaley, though, has said U.S. support should not come in the form of cash or troops on the ground, but through collaborating with allies to be sure Ukraine has \"the equipment and the ammunition to win.\"\n\nThe candidates' varied views seem to reflect public opinion. A poll by the Pew Research Center found 44% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say, as of June, that the U.S. is providing too much aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has frequently been the subject of misinformation, including:\n\n– Chris Mueller\n\nPence makes Jan. 6 a key part of campaign\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots loom large during the campaign because two of that day’s central figures – Trump and Pence – are in the race.\n\nTrump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that Pence had the power to overturn the 2020 election results while he presided over the ceremonial certification process. Pence has made his handling of the day’s events a central theme of his campaign, saying he chose loyalty to the Constitution over demands from Trump to give him the election.\n\nIn the worst attack on the Capitol in 200 years, a mob of thousands of Trump supporters overwhelmed police and raided the building on the day lawmakers formalized Biden’s victory. Some rioters chanted that they wanted Pence hanged.\n\nOther candidates have brought up the attacks, with DeSantis calling it not an insurrection but a “protest” that “ended up devolving, you know, in a way that was unfortunate.” Ramaswamy blamed the riots on “pervasive censorship” and called it “unproductive” to point the finger at Trump – who faces four charges and is accused of organizing a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden.\n\nThree men involved in the riots are asking the Supreme Court to erase part of their indictment. If the justices hear their appeals, their decisions could affect part of the federal indictment Trump faces.\n\nThe attacks have been a consistent source of misinformation during the past 2½ years. Here are some we’ve previously debunked:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nSupporters, foes point to DeSantis’ record in Florida\n\nWith Ron DeSantis in charge, Florida has been anything but calm.\n\nHis five-year record as governor shapes up as a focal point of the campaign – both for his supporters and his opponents.\n\nThere is the “war on wokeness.” The legal feud with Disney that started over the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law. The law he signed that led districts across the state to purge books from their shelves.\n\nAnd then there were the changes to the state’s history standards that say enslaved people “developed skills” they could use for “personal benefit.” That drew direct criticism from Scott.\n\nDeSantis recently added one more debate to his schedule after this one: He will face off against California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Nov. 30.\n\nWe’ve previously debunked numerous claims stemming from the Sunshine State:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nHunter Biden's legal troubles a target for Republicans\n\nThe ongoing legal case involving Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, has already had broad political implications, with many Republican lawmakers looking to tie his business activities to his father.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted Sept. 14 on two federal charges for allegedly lying to a gun dealer and on a federal form when buying a revolver in 2018.\n\nThe case nearly went away in July, but a federal judge refused to accept a plea deal after prosecutors and defense attorneys couldn't agree on the terms. Hunter Biden had previously agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of tax evasion and participate in a pretrial program for a firearm offense.\n\nThe Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also been investigating Biden in an effort to link actions by then-Vice President Joe Biden to his son's business dealings with the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma. Republicans repeatedly alleged that Joe Biden was involved in influence peddling during his time as vice president. The White House has denied that allegation, calling it baseless innuendo.\n\nHunter Biden recently filed lawsuits against the Internal Revenue Service for allegedly releasing his confidential tax information and Rudy Giuliani for allegedly releasing personal information from his laptop.\n\nHere are a few of the Hunter Biden-related claims we’ve previously addressed:\n\n– Chris Mueller\n\nTrump's absence doesn't stop talk of indictments\n\nTrump again won't be on the debate stage tonight, but the former president looms large over the Republican primary in light of both his commanding lead in the polls and his unprecedented legal troubles.\n\nMost recently, Trump and several allies were indicted Aug. 14 by a Georgia grand jury that accused them of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, where Trump lost to President Joe Biden in Georgia by about 12,000 votes.\n\nThe charges against Trump in Georgia are only the latest in a series of prosecutions against him that began in March, when he was indicted for allegedly falsifying business records related to hush-money payments intended to silence two women before the 2016 election. Trump also faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and allegedly conspiring to steal the 2020 presidential election, including his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nWhile recent polls show Trump doesn't seem to have lost support among Republican primary voters as a result of his criminal charges, a general election could be a different story. A poll released Sept. 24 by NBC News found 62% of voters have either major or moderate concerns about Trump’s indictments.\n\nTrump's legal woes have been the subject of an array of false or misleading claims on social media:\n\n– Chris Mueller\n\nAbortion sparks debate, misinformation after Roe. v. Wade ruling\n\nAbortion is expected to be a key issue, having sparked disagreement between parties as well as between the candidates on tonight’s stage.\n\nMore than a dozen states across the country have banned, or attempted to ban, abortion since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in June 2022. The decision eliminated the constitutional right to have an abortion.\n\nDemocrats have sought to use the issue to mobilize voters ahead of the 2024 election. Republican presidential candidates have generally been opposed to the procedure, but vary in how they would try to regulate it if elected.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who will not participate in the debate, has suggested he would work with “both sides” of the abortion issue and has denounced total restrictions on abortions. He criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ signing of legislation banning abortion after six weeks in his state.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence clashed on the topic of a federal abortion ban at the first GOP presidential debate in August. Haley, the only woman on stage, called for finding “consensus” among people across the political spectrum on the issue while Pence responded by saying “consensus is the opposite of leadership.”\n\nBusinessman Vivek Ramaswamy has said he does not support a federal ban on abortion and believes the matter is a state issue, though he does support state bans of the procedure “around the six-week mark” of gestation. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina has advocated for a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks, while former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has called for leaving the matter up to individual states.\n\nAbortion has sparked a flurry of misinformation online:\n\n-BrieAnna Frank", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/27"}]}

The Alabama Education Association sent a letter Thursday to the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners saying it had learned some doctors are writing excuses for students to return to school before mandated quarantine periods expired. Theron Stokes, associate executive director of AEA, said doctors should be aware of the guidelines and follow them. “When students return to school having not completed the entire 14-day quarantine period, they are placing their fellow students and their schools’ employees at risk. For students and school employees who have underlying health conditions, these decisions can be deadly,” Stokes wrote. The group said it is gross negligence to ignore the quarantine guidelines and threatened possible legal action.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s largest city plans to boost enforcement of an expanded mask mandate and restrict gathering sizes in a bid to curb coronavirus cases, officials said Friday. The changes take effect Monday, with masks to be worn, with a few exceptions, in indoor public settings or communal areas and outdoors when distancing from non-household members is not possible. In some cases, such as for individuals with disabilities who cannot tolerate a mask, face shields will be allowed unless wearing one would be impossible, the order says. Masks are to be worn by school-age children older than 5, those who exercise or work at gyms, and athletes, players, coaches and officials who participate in organized sports, according to the municipality directives. Athletes must keep a mask on for indoor sports, but one is not required while “exercising vigorously outdoors,” the directives state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A top hospital official urged Arizonans to help curb the spread of the coronavirus by considering alternatives to traditional Thanksgiving get-togethers. “Congregating in large groups and close contact with others outside of your immediate household put you and those around you at risk,” said Dr. Marjorie Bessell, chief clinical officer of Banner Health. “I know we are asking a lot of you.” Banner operates 23 hospitals in Arizona and several in other states. Arizona health officials on Sunday reported 1,880 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths. State Department of Health Services officials said the latest figures increase Arizona’s totals to 259,264 cases and 6,164 known deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began. Cases and hospitalizations have been steadily increasing in Arizona since late September and throughout October after bottoming out in August after the state was a national hot spot in June and July.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state hit a record one-day increase in coronavirus cases Friday for the second day in a row, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was growing concerned about hospital capacity. The Department of Health said the state’s probable and confirmed virus cases rose by 1,870. The state’s previous one-day high came Thursday, when it reported 1,548 new cases. On Saturday the department reported 1,598 new cases and 12 additional deaths for totals of 120,828 cases and 2,068 deaths since the pandemic began. The department reported 722 hospitalizations, 16 more than Friday’s then-record high. “Today’s numbers show we are not in a good position as we head into the colder months,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday. “I ask all Arkansans to take this virus seriously and to take necessary precautions. Our number of new cases is growing at a rate that worries me in terms of our hospital capacity.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Republican former U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa was victorious Saturday in his race to return to Congress, where he once headed the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and became a GOP favorite for launching a string of investigations of the Obama administration. The former nine-term congressman and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump trailed early in the San Diego-area 50th District. But as more votes were counted after Election Day, he overtook Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. The latest vote count update gave him about 54% of the votes and a 23,000-vote lead. Issa already had declared victory in a statement posted to social media Friday night. Campa-Najjar, a 31-year-old former Obama administration official, was making his second bid for the seat. He received more votes than he did in 2018 and thanked his supporters for “giving a Latino-Arab American a chance to do something special.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: City officials are urging residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in an effort to stem the tide of coronavirus cases, which could overwhelm area hospitals by the end of the year. Mayor Michael Hancock said during a virtual news conference Friday that the “Home by 10 Order,” which will last for at least 30 days, is necessary to avoid another citywide stay-at-home order. He also urged residents not to gather or mix with other households. “I’m not going to mince any words here when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus,” Hancock said. “We’re on a very dangerous path. We’re seeing rapid, significant increases in the numbers of people getting sick, and many of those people ended up in the hospital.” The mayor shied away from calling the order a curfew because he said enforcement would only target the most egregious violations – not, for instance, someone walking their dog or going for a run after 10 p.m.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Several colleges and universities have added new restrictions for students as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the state. Quinnipiac University announced it is instituting a two-week quarantine after recording 155 positive tests on campus since Wednesday. The quarantine means residential students must stay in their rooms, except to pick up takeout meals from the dining hall, and students living off campus can only return for testing. Students in isolation who have tested positive for the coronavirus will have meals delivered to their rooms each night. At Yale University, students residing in Davenport, Hopper, and Saybrook Colleges were ordered to quarantine because of positive coronavirus tests. In Fairfield, Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities have instituted curfews. The state reported Friday that 22 more people were hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total to 402, the highest total in five months.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: For the Rehoboth Beach Film Society, the show (or shows) must go on. The 23rd annual Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival is taking place as scheduled this month with a few modifications for health concerns. Only five films will be shown inside the society’s Cinema Art Theater, with 10 more available to stream at home. “We had the opportunity to carry out this event with the safety of our viewers as a priority,” said Rehoboth Beach Film Society Executive Director Sue Early. “They can watch films at home this year. It’s not the same experience, but there’s some great films to see. And in our theater, we could be showing at 60%, and we’re only going to use 30 out of 104 seats, which is just under 29%. They are well-spaced and cleaned after every screening. So it’s really safe.” Tickets are on sale now for the festival, which runs Nov. 5-15.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of people gathered on the campus of Howard University on Saturday to celebrate their sister Kamala Harris after her announcement as vice president-elect, WUSA-TV reports. “When you come to Howard University, that is a very distinct choice,” said Niambi Carter, associate professor of political science at Howard University. “You are choosing a legacy and a lineage that is great in so many aspects.” A large group of Alpha chapter members of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in front of the sorority’s plot on the yard to cheer for Harris’ election. “I’m so proud of Kamala, and I’m so proud to stand on the grounds where she walked,” alumna Kenya Sumner said. Harris graduated from Howard with a degree in political science and economics in 1986, the same year she became a member of the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black sorority, founded on Howard’s campus.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrange Park: Eight weeks after being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, Henry Bell and his longtime fiancee decided the time was right for a wedding. So the day before his anticipated release from the inpatient rehab center at Orange Park Medical Center, Bell, 63, and Antionette Brown, 48, said their vows in the parking lot Thursday. Brown’s uncle performed the ceremony. “His condition was deadly,” Brown said. “We decided to do it now because we feel they (the hospital staff) are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back.” Bell was admitted to the hospital Sept. 13 and immediately put on a ventilator. Brown and the couple’s seven grown children could only wait and hope for his condition to improve. He spent weeks in intensive care. He entered the hospital’s rehab center Sunday, and his recovery has included learning how to walk again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Athens-Clarke County plans to rent space for jury trials and grand jury proceedings. Grand juries and trials have been on hold in the state since March 14, when state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton declared a statewide judicial emergency because of the coronavirus threat. In subsequent renewal orders, Melton amended them to allow for court proceedings if they could be conducted safely. The best option for holding court proceedings in Athens-Clarke County is by using the Classic Center, said a committee tasked with deciding the issue. The county will pay the Classic Center up to $350,815 to rent space for the proceedings. The price Athens-Clarke will pay includes daily cleaning of the rooms used for trial proceedings, including space to conduct actual trials and a jury deliberation room. The $350,815 amount is based on the cost of 30 jury trials that last an average of five days each.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources reopened a popular scenic spot on Oahu that has been closed to visitors since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside, popularly known as Pali Lookout, was closed to the public at the outset of the pandemic because of budgetary constraints and crowding concerns. There were challenges in maintaining physical distancing at the lookout, State Parks Administrator Curt Cottrell said. Officials announced the park, which is among the most visited spots on Oahu, reopened Wednesday with daily hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The gates to the park’s access roads will be unlocked and secured daily by the Honolulu Police Department. The state set new parking fees of $7 per vehicle for nonresidents. Hawaii residents are not subject to parking and entry fees at any state parks. Tour buses are largely absent from the lookout, making the volume of visitors much lower.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state panel of medical experts is asking the governor for a statewide mask mandate, and hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients, after a week marked with record numbers of new cases and deaths. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday alone, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday. More than 69,500 residents have been confirmed to have the illness since the pandemic began. Idaho hospitals have reported more than 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 every day since Oct. 12. On Nov. 2, the most recent data available, there were nearly 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Jeanie Gentry, CEO of Steele Memorial Medical Center in Salmon, told the Idaho Statesman the facility is short about 40% of its staffers because they’ve been exposed or sickened.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested negative for the coronavirus after learning he may have been exposed during a meeting to someone who tested positive. Members of Pritzker’s staff who attended the meeting last Monday also tested negative for the virus, his office said Saturday in a news release. Pritzker had self-isolated Friday while awaiting test results. They were the second negative test results for Pritzker and staff members who also underwent weekly tests Wednesday, according to his office. Meanwhile, 12,438 newly confirmed and probable cases of the virus and another 76 deaths were reported Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health. More than 10,370 new cases and 49 deaths were reported Friday. Illinois has had nearly 478,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 10,150 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame’s Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in the school president’s failure to wear a face mask at a White House event days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. The Faculty Senate voted 29-13 on Thursday for a resolution expressing disappointment in the Rev. John Jenkins’ failure to wear a mask and practice social distancing at a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor confirmed last month as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Faculty Senate was originally expected to vote on a no confidence resolution, but that was amended. Jenkins tested positive for the coronavirus days after the Rose Garden ceremony, where President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to the high court. Jenkins was seen without a mask, and he shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State prison officials reported Friday that a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly half of the inmates at a prison in Anamosa. Testing last week revealed 476 inmates among 985 at the prison tested positive for the virus, said Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections. A report provided by the department indicates 37 staff members also tested positive. Across the nine institutions the department manages, 601 inmates were infected as of Friday afternoon. The report shows coronavirus has been active in the prison system since testing began in March with more than 21,000 tests administered to inmates. It said 1,252 inmates have recovered, an indication they have at one time tested positive but are no longer symptomatic are believed to be contagious. Four Iowa inmates have died during the pandemic, the report said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw most of a projected budget shortfall melt away Friday with a fiscal forecast that is less pessimistic about the economy and tax collections than a dire estimate issued this spring during a statewide lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. The forecasting group boosted the state’s forecast for tax collections by $463 million, or 6.3%, for the 2021 budget year that began July 1. The group also issued its first calculations for the 2022 budget year that starts in July 2021, and while the forecast predicts a drop in tax collections of 2.1%, or $166 million, that’s due largely to the end of a temporary, pandemic-induced move to help income taxpayers. The Legislature’s nonpartisan research staff now projects a $153 million budget shortfall for the state’s 2022 budget year, an amount that almost can be covered by an internal shuffling of government funds that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly already has proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bar and restaurant operators are getting a break from alcoholic beverage renewal fees in a cost-saving step as they struggle with revenue losses from the pandemic. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is granting a 12-month fee renewal waiver to license holders, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. Bar and restaurant operators who haven’t submitted the renewal fee this year won’t have to pay until 2021, he said. Those who have paid this year will have their fees waived in 2021, he said. “This has certainly been a difficult year for our bars, restaurants and venues, and they deserve this innovative support as we face what could be a very painful winter,” Beshear said. Bars and restaurants have endured capacity limitations to help contain the coronavirus. The fee waiver doesn’t apply to producers, distributors, wholesalers and others able to continue operations throughout the virus-related state of emergency.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to complaints that family and clergy were barred from hospitals and nursing homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, legislators have rewritten state laws to lessen visitation restrictions during public health emergencies. The bills passed unanimously in the special session that ended last month and were signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. They still will give discretion to the Louisiana Department of Health to decide just how wide-open the visitation can be and what safety protections will have to be followed. One measure by Sen. Robert Mills, a Minden Republican, calls on the health department to create rules requiring inpatient health care facilities to allow pastors, priests and other members of the clergy to visit patients during a public health emergency, if the patient asks for the visit.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials on Friday recommended caution at more schools in the state because of the rise in coronavirus cases. The state uses a color-coded system to categorize the level of precaution schools should use. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it’s adding schools in Knox County and Franklin County to the “yellow” category, which is an intermediate level. Those counties join Somerset and Washington counties in the yellow category. All other counties in the state are in the “green” category, the lowest level, though officials said they’re closely monitoring schools in Waldo and Kennebec counties. The state recommends that schools located in counties in the yellow category consider hybrid instruction models to reduce the number of people in schools and classrooms. The change in category for some schools came as cases surged around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is tightening restrictions on restaurants and indoor and outdoor gatherings in response to rising cases of the coronavirus, Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young announced Friday. The changes will take effect Thursday at 5 p.m. Young said numbers of people in restaurants, religious facilities, theaters and malls will be limited to 25% capacity. Young said food service establishments must close indoor dining at 10 p.m. Bars that don’t have a license to sell food will be closed. “I am instituting these restrictions for the public health and to save lives in Baltimore city,” Young said. Also, the city’s health commissioner revised an order to require masks to be worn in public at all times, whether people are inside or outside. Dr. Letitia Dzirasa’s order is effective immediately. “Over the past month Baltimore city has seen our data trends move in the wrong direction,” she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Friday urged more schools to return to full, in-person instruction, saying that only communities with the highest COVID-19 rates should be using any form of remote learning. Under previous guidance, schools were told to shift among remote learning, in-person learning or a mix of the two depending on their area’s infection rate. Areas with moderate spread were advised to use remote or hybrid learning, while only those with the lowest rates were encouraged to bring students back full time. But speaking at a news conference, Gov. Charlie Baker said there’s growing evidence that schools are not a significant source of spread and that keeping students at home hurts their learning and mental health. “We continue to see too many communities with children learning in remote-only models,” he said. “We all know that losing a week, a month, a quarter or more in the life of a kid’s education has real consequences.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Joe Biden reclaimed the Wolverine State for Democrats with a surge of support in urban regions like Detroit and Grand Rapids, offsetting high turnout in rural and exurban areas for President Donald Trump. Biden’s 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids – amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide. Biden won Oakland by 14 points, besting Hillary Clinton’s 8-point edge in 2016. He carried Kent by almost 6 points after Trump netted it by 3 points four years ago. Trump again won traditional bellwether Macomb County outside Detroit, by roughly 8 points – less than his 11-point margin in 2016, however. Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Kent in more than 50 years, after Barack Obama did it in his first run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 is sweeping across the state at an unprecedented pace, breaking records for new cases and daily deaths and raising concerns about the ability of hospitals to keep up. The Star Tribune reports Saturday’s tally of 4,647 new cases – a figure that would have easily set a record during the first eight months of the pandemic – wasn’t even close to the biggest single-day count of the past week. For the seven-day period ending Saturday, Minnesota reported more than 25,000 new COVID-19 cases, or more than 10% of the state’s cases since March. The Minnesota Department of Health reported another 34 deaths Saturday, bringing the week’s total to 168, the second-highest one-week count since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals, meanwhile, are scrambling to treat more COVID-19 patients even as the virus threatens to sideline more health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health has been working around the clock to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the agency will be responsible for starting a statewide medical marijuana program within the next nine months. Uncertified election results showed 74% of Mississippi voters approved the ballot measure that allows doctors to prescribe up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for people who have at least one of more than 20 serious medical conditions. “This vote shows minds are changing,” said Jaqueline Temple Rudder, a homemaker from Madison County who lost her father-in-law to cancer and voted for Initiative 65. “We don’t want our sick suffering.” Both Gov. Tate Reeves and state’s top health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, opposed the initiative. Officials with the Department of Health will have until August to begin licensing treatment centers and certifying eligible patients.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Local health departments in the state don’t have enough staffers to conduct contact tracing for all the COVID-19 cases popping up, so they have been prioritizing the ones they try to trace back to their sources, officials said. The state’s rate of positive tests over the past two weeks is more than double the national average, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Larry Jones, who heads the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, said local health departments are struggling to keep up with contact tracing, which helps determine how a disease is spreading. Missouri on Sunday reported 4,131 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has risen over the past two weeks, from about 1,789 new cases per day Oct. 24 to about 3,126 as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nursing facility in Butte has reported 10 COVID-19-related deaths in less than two weeks, and Gallatin County on Friday enacted stricter measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Montana has hit a record for hospitalizations, and the confirmed number of infection cases was closing in on 38,000, state officials said. The state health department confirmed 986 more cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total for the past week to 6,040, or an average of 863 cases per day. Over the previous week, the daily average was 779. Montana has reported 418 deaths, which may not include all 10 deaths tied to the outbreak at the Continental Care & Rehabilitation nursing facility in Butte. The Gallatin County health board on Friday said bars, restaurants and casinos must close by 10 p.m. instead of 12:30 a.m. They must also limit group sizes at tables to six adults plus children who are with a parent or guardian.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of new coronavirus cases and people hospitalized with the virus. Health officials said the surge in cases over the past month continued Friday with 2,681 new cases and 748 people hospitalized with the virus. Both those were new records, and the state’s rate of new cases was the seventh-highest in the nation. The state said 27 new deaths were reported Friday to give Nebraska 701 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has increased over the past two weeks from 836.71 new cases per day Oct. 23 to 1,408.86 new cases per day Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Also Friday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said nine more staff members had tested positive for the virus to give it a total of 225 staff members who have been diagnosed with the virus. The department said the ill staffers are all isolating themselves at home.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democrats successfully won reelection in the swing state’s two battleground congressional districts. First-term Rep. Susie Lee won reelection to a second term by defeating former professional wrestler Dan Rodimer in the 3rd District. Republicans believed the Las Vegas-area district offered them their best chance at unseating an incumbent. Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford was reelected in the state’s other battleground district, defeating Republican former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Lee and Horsford’s victories cement a six-year hold on Nevada’s swing districts, which Democrats have won in the three most recent elections, and helps Democrats hoping maintain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where many races remain too early to call with votes left to be counted. The result sends Nevada’s existing delegation back to Washington, D.C.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is again putting strict limits on visitors to its hospitals and outpatient clinics in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Effective Friday, visitors are banned under most circumstances. Limited exceptions will be made for pediatric patients, women giving birth, patients at the end of life and those in a few other circumstances. The return to more restrictive policies applies to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon as well as the health system’s outpatient clinics and facilities. Officials said their decision was based on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in both New Hampshire and Vermont. Meanwhile, the state’s court system said it is suspending in-person hearings for a few days after Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday named his associate counsel to lead the commission that will oversee the state’s new recreational marijuana marketplace. Dianna Houenou, who serves as legal counsel to Murphy’s administration, will chair the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. Before working in Murphy’s administration, Houenou was policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey. Murphy, a Democrat, made the announcement just days after New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The amendment goes into effect at the start of next year and calls for state regulators to set up a marketplace for the legal sale of the drug. It’s unclear when marijuana will be ready to hit retail shelves in the state. Advocates for legalization said the soonest they expect it could happen toward the end of 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials have the power to impose civil penalties when enforcing public health orders that call for businesses to restrict their operations amid a public health emergency, the state Supreme Court said Friday. The unanimous written opinion details the legal reasoning for an oral decision made by the court in August in a case brought by businesses that challenged health orders issued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had petitioned the court to resolve the dispute. Lujan Grisham has warned that more restrictions could be imposed as early as this week as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. She also said she has been disappointed in enforcement, pointing to businesses and country clubs in Albuquerque and elsewhere that hosted Halloween parties despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Restrictions in some New York City pandemic hot spots will be rolled back, even as the state prepares to combat coronavirus flare-ups upstate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The governor said he’s considering imposing additional social distancing restrictions in “microcluster” zones in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas because of rising infection rates. The addition of more of those zones upstate reflect the shifting state strategy as COVID-19 becomes a worsening problem beyond New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic. The governor also said the National Guard will increase its presence at airports to help make sure travelers from non-neighboring states can provide proof of a negative coronavirus test. “In general, downstate New York is doing better than upstate New York, which is a total reversal from the first phase of COVID,” Cuomo said during a telephone briefing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed state election officials Friday to make public more information about the number of outstanding ballots from last week’s election that could be counted. Nearly a dozen Election Day races in North Carolina, including those for president and U.S. Senate, remained too early to call because as many as 172,000 ballots had either yet to be counted or rejected, or could trickle in before this week’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day. The actual number of ballots that will arrive is likely to be less, however, because many people who requested absentee ballots ended up voting on Election Day or perhaps didn’t vote at all. And past elections show a significant portion of the 41,000 provisional ballots cast Tuesday will be rejected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A child with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have a rare condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body, state health officials said Friday. The child, who was discharged from the hospital and is resting at home, is the first confirmed case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the state. “This development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 can impact people of any age, even children,” Dr. Joan Connell, Department of Health field medical officer and pediatrician, said in a statement. “The best way to help prevent your child from getting MIS-C is to take action to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and teach your child how to do the same.” MIS-C – short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children – can inflame the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Children with it have experienced persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Long-term effects are unknown.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has continued to spike despite pleas from the governor for people to help slow the spread. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 2,084 new cases per day Oct. 22 to 3,748 new cases per day Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in the state has also risen over the past two weeks from 4.96% on Oct. 22 to 7.93% on Thursday, according to the tracking hub. The Health Department on Friday reported 5,008 probable and confirmed cases, another daily record high. Ohio has reported more than 240,000 probable and confirmed cases to date, including 5,494 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he planned to announce additional measures soon to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the state Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, and the Department of Health said a backlog of cases and possibly duplicate reporting were the reason. There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks. “We have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,” which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Following a record-breaking day of COVID-19 cases in the state, officials announced new restrictions Friday that will be implemented in at least five of the state’s counties as part of a two-week pause on social activities. The updated safety measures, which begin Wednesday, include halting visitations to long-term care facilities, reducing the capacity of indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, encouraging all businesses to mandate working from home, and urging Oregonians not to gather with people who do not live in their household – but if they do to limit it to six people. If people have multiple get-togethers, which is discouraged, it should be the same social circle of six people. “Let me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,” Gov. Kate Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bail has been set at $750,000 each for two men authorities said were armed with loaded handguns when they were arrested near the city’s convention center where votes were being counted. Joshua Macias, 42, and Antonio LaMotta, 61, traveled from the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area in a Hummer and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said. They were charged with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and carrying a firearm on a public street. The men were stopped Thursday about a block from the vehicle, Macias with a .40-caliber Beretta handgun inside his jacket and LaMotta with a 9 mm Beretta in a holster, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. An AR-style rifle and ammunition were found inside the vehicle, Outlaw said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: Protesters gathered near a prison that houses federal detainees Friday, denouncing the facility’s contract with U.S. immigration authorities and pointing to a surge in coronavirus infections among detainees. Demonstrators blocked roads leading to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where authorities say more than 150 detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Activists have repeatedly called for Wyatt’s closure, saying conditions are subpar. The publicly owned but privately operated lockup has about 540 inmates in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit seeking the release of dozens of detainees, saying the virus was spreading “uncontrollably.” More than two dozen detainees subsequently were freed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two days after his opponent proclaimed victory in South Carolina’s 1st District, freshman U.S. House Rep. Joe Cunningham conceded defeat Friday, saying he was proud of the work he had done in his single term in Congress and pledging to continue to work toward bipartisan progress as a private citizen. Standing in front of the U.S. Customs House in Charleston, Cunningham told supporters that he had called Republican Nancy Mace to offer support and congratulations. “She’s now my representative,” Cunningham said. “I’m rooting for her.” The Associated Press called the race for Mace early Wednesday morning, but Cunningham did not concede, citing scanning issues with absentee ballots in one of the district’s counties. In her victory, Mace, 42, becomes the first Republican woman elected to Congress in South Carolina and only the second-ever woman from the state elected to a full House term.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 100 state residents have died of complications due to the coronavirus in the first eight days of November, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health confirmed 13 deaths in the past day, for a total of 111 this month and 536 since the start of the pandemic. The overall death count is the 24th-highest per capita in the country in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. The state reported 1,426 positive tests for COVID-19 since Saturday. South Dakota ranks second in the country behind North Dakota in the number of new cases per capita in the past two weeks. The top five counties with the most cases per capita in that time are Bon Homme, Dewey, Buffalo, Potter and Sanborn, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are 546 people being treated in hospitals in the state, up 31 in the past day. Of those, 96 are in intensive care units, and 69 are using ventilators.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: Health officials in northeastern Tennessee say they do not have enough nurses to combat COVID-19 inside the region’s hospital system. “There are no longer enough nurses to fill the need that we have,” Ballad Health Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Lisa Smithgall told WJHL-TV. According to Ballad Health, the hospital system is looking to hire 350 registered nurses to fill its nurse shortage. “In the last eight weeks, we’ve had more than 900 patients admitted to COVID-19,” said Ballad Health Chief Administrative Officer Eric Deaton. After hitting 200 inpatients last week, the health care system has adjusted its COVID-19 surge plan to receive 300 inpatients. “These numbers represent lives; they’re non-encouraging,” Deaton said. “In fact, it’s really becoming a tragedy in the increased rates that we’re seeing.”\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A district judge on Friday upheld an order from El Paso County’s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso’s 34th District Court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region at the request of the state. The county’s top elected official, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, ordered a two-week shutdown of nonessential activities late last month. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early part of the 20th century, city and county elected officials had authority to respond as they “thought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities.” Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, said the state would appeal.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s largest teachers union called for the governor to move all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas to remote learning Friday as the state reported a single-day record of 17 COVID-19 deaths. The Utah Education Association also called for Republican Gov. Gary Herbert to suspend all extracurricular activities that can’t comply with social distancing guidelines in high transmission areas from the Thanksgiving holiday throughout winter break. “We are now seeing multiple schools repeatedly shift back and forth from in-person to at-home learning due to outbreaks,” the union wrote in a statement. “This cycle is obviously not helping to control the virus spread and, as educators, we can unequivocally state the continual interruptions are not in the best interest of student learning.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that comments by President Donald Trump casting doubts on the integrity of the election process are hurting society. Scott said all legal votes cast in the 2020 election need to be counted, including mail-in votes. Scott’s comments came a day after President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud in the ballot-counting process for the presidential election. Scott said that the president’s comments are “inciting a lot of rhetoric” and that many of his followers take him at his word. “I don’t believe any of the statements he made last night are true, and I do believe it is hurting our society and our ability to work together,” Scott said. After voting Tuesday, he said he had cast his presidential ballot for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said he had never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate before but had to put “country over party.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger has kept her seat in a competitive congressional race in the Richmond suburbs. The former CIA operations officer defeated Republican challenger and state House delegate Nick Freitas in a close race that was called Sunday. Spanberger is considered one of Congress’ more moderate Democrats and was part of a wave of women who helped Democrats retake the U.S. House in 2018. But Freitas had tried to tie Spanberger to her party’s leadership and said it was out of sync with constituents. Spanberger spent nearly a decade with the CIA, working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases. She is one of two moderate Virginia Democrats who held on to U.S. House seats they flipped from red to blue two years ago, as Democrats’ strength in the Old Dominion continues to grow.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state set a daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 1,777 new confirmed cases announced Saturday, and the state Department of Health warned that COVID-19 cases are spreading in the Puget Sound region. In a statement, the health agency said the high numbers the state has seen over the past week reflect an overall surge that started in mid-September. King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are currently the hot spots in the region, officials said. “COVID-19 is currently spreading very quickly in Washington state,” said Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “We are very concerned that disease transmission will only grow over the next few weeks with the holidays coming up. The threat to overwhelming not just our hospital systems, but our ability to do contact tracing, is real. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported surging COVID-19 case numbers Saturday along with 15 newly reported deaths from the virus. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources reported 655 newly reported cases as of 10 a.m. Saturday for a total of 27,742 total cases and 502 deaths since the pandemic reached the state. The daily case count set a record for the state, a day after West Virginia saw a new peak of 540 cases over 24 hours. On Friday, several government staff and officials including Gov. Jim Justice were tested for the virus after a staffer in the Capitol building tested positive Friday morning. The attorney general’s office later said the employee believed to have the virus tested negative Friday night. Justice said he was tested for the virus minutes before a noon news conference Friday, where he announced the record high of new cases. He also urged West Virginians to get tested at sites around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials reported a new daily high of more than 7,000 new COVID-19 cases – another new daily record. Saturday’s total of 7,065 confirmed infections is more than 900 cases higher than the previous record, set Friday with 6,141 cases, according to the state Department of Health Services. The state first passed 6,000 daily cases Friday, and Tuesday and Wednesday of this past week also saw record-setting numbers of new cases. The 7,065 positive cases made up 37% of the 18,928 test results reported Saturday by the state health department. The seven-day average of new cases also rose again, hitting 5,394, which is the highest weekly average to date, according to DHS. The state health department also reported 45 more people have died, bringing the state’s death toll to 2,301.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State health officials reported 646 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the second-highest single-day total of the pandemic in the state. The Department of Health listed 966 new cases Friday, the highest single-day total. The Casper Star-Tribune reports at least 114 people have died of the coronavirus, and more than 14,690 people have tested positive. The new totals come amid a rapid surge in the numbers of cases in Wyoming and throughout much of the U.S. Gov.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nAuthorities in China have imposed a de facto international travel ban, forbidding citizens from going overseas for “non-essential” reasons, as the government ramps up efforts to enforce its zero-Covid policy.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the Chinese National Immigration Administration said it would tighten its reviewing process on issuing travel documents such as passports, and strictly limit those looking to leave.\n\nThe administration justified the measures by claiming it was necessary to “reduce the risk of infection when leaving the country, and of carrying the virus when entering the country.” Travel will only be permitted for “essential” purposes, defined by the administration as resuming work, study, business and scientific research, as well as seeking medical care.\n\nThose who need to go abroad to help with fighting the pandemic, or transporting disaster relief resources will have their applications expedited, according to the announcement.\n\nOfficials did not reveal how they might enforce the new restrictions, or prevent would-be travelers in possession of valid travel documents from leaving.\n\nThe new measures represent China’s most stringent restrictions on outbound travel in decades, placing further strain on a population that has endured more than two years of draconian Covid-19 controls including citywide lockdowns, mass testing and mandatory quarantine.\n\n“Don’t go out unless necessary, don’t leave the country unless necessary, don’t be born unless necessary,” read one popular comment in reaction to the news on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo.\n\nOthers speculated officials might be cracking down on travel because more people are looking to escape as fears rise over new government-enforced lockdowns – especially in the capital Beijing, where Covid cases are rising. These fears have only been exacerbated by the chaos and dysfunction that has engulfed locked-down cities such as Shanghai.\n\nCovid workers check the travel information of passengers at a high-speed railway station in Huai 'an, China, on May 11.

Chinese citizens made 670 million overseas trips in 2019, the last normal travel year before the pandemic, according to the country’s Immigration Administration.\n\nBut that number has plunged since then, with just over 73 million inbound and outbound trips in 2021.\n\nEven before Thursday’s announcement, traveling in or out of China had become immensely difficult. The borders are still largely shut to outsiders, with only Chinese citizens returning from overseas and those with special visas or residence permits allowed to enter. Flights are limited and expensive – and all those wishing to enter usually face a strict quarantine of up to 21 days.\n\nChina has further discouraged travel by dramatically scaling back the number of travel documents issued. It only issued 7.98 million documents in 2021, less than 6% of the documents issued in 2019, according to the Immigration Administration – which also announced it would stop renewing passports for “non-essential” travel in February.\n\nThursday’s restrictions deal a blow to Chinese residents married to foreign nationals. It might also prove another roadblock for students wishing to attend university overseas – who already faced disappointment this week after the United States College Board announced it would cancel Advanced Placement (AP) tests – often considered an important part of college applications in the US – in several locations, citing “widespread Covid restrictions.”\n\nSix weeks of lockdown\n\nPublic frustration has been growing steadily over the past few months as authorities across the country imposed lockdown measures – sometimes over just a handful of cases.\n\nAt least 32 cities across China are now under full or partial lockdown, impacting up to 220 million people, according to CNN’s calculations.\n\nThe most notable among them is Shanghai, the wealthy financial hub, which has been under citywide lockdown since late March. Throughout April, residents stuck at home reported being unable to access food, medicine or other essential supplies.\n\nIn recent days, complaints have surfaced on social media over community workers forcibly entering people’s homes without permission and damaging their personal belongings during disinfection. One viral video showed residents arguing with police officers trying to take them from their homes; it’s unclear under what policy the residents were being forcibly removed, or where they were being sent.\n\nPeople wait in long lines at a supermarket on May 12 in Beijing, China.

Beijing authorities have encouraged residents to stay home, and began rolling out several new rounds of mass testing – prompting panic buying at supermarkets, with photos showing long lines as residents rushed to stock up on supplies in case of a lockdown.\n\nBeijing officials refuted claims of an impending lockdown on Thursday and urged the public not to hoard food, asserting there were enough supplies available. But their reassurance may do little good, with public trust already frayed – especially since Shanghai’s citywide lockdown had come just days after authorities there denied any such plans.\n\n“This is a familiar picture,” one Weibo user remarked under a video showing Beijing officials trying to calm the public.

After South Korea, Pelosi will travel to Japan.\n\nShe met South Korean National Assembly Speaker Kim Jin Pyo and other senior members of Parliament on Thursday. After that hourlong meeting, Pelosi spoke about the bilateral alliance, forged in blood during the 1950-53 Korean War, and legislative efforts to boost ties, but didn't directly mention her Taiwan visit or the Chinese protests.\n\nPelosi in Taiwan:Pelosi gives strong backing to Taiwan's democracy; US braces for Chinese military drills\n\n\"We also come to say to you that a friendship, (the) relationship that began from urgency and security, many years ago, has become the warmest of friendships,\" Pelosi said in a joint news conference with Kim. \"We want to advance security, economy and governance in an inter-parliamentary way.\"\n\nNeither Pelosi nor Kim took questions from journalists.\n\nKim said he and Pelosi shared concerns about North Korea's increasing nuclear threat. He said the two agreed to support their governments' push for denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula based on both strong deterrence against North Korea and diplomacy.\n\nPelosi and her delegation later spoke by phone with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on the alliance, foreign policy and other issues. Yoon is on vacation this week, but critics accuse him of intentionally shunning a face-to-face meeting with Pelosi in consideration of ties with China, South Korea's biggest trading partner. Yoon's office said it had reviewed national interests and that Yoon's vacation plan had already been set up when, about two weeks ago, Pelosi's side contacted his office about a possible meeting.\n\nDuring the phone conversation, Pelosi and other members of her congressional delegation didn't bring up the Taiwan issue, and Yoon also didn't raise the matter, Yoon's office said.\n\nIn recent years, South Korea has been struggling to strike a balance between the United States and China as their rivalry has deepened. Yoon, a conservative, took office in May with a vow to boost South Korea's military alliance with the United States and take a tougher line on North Korean provocations.\n\nPelosi expected to visit North Korean border\n\nLater Thursday, Pelosi was to visit a border area with North Korea that is jointly controlled by the American-led United Nations Command and North Korea, South Korean officials said. If that visit occurs, Pelosi would be the highest-level American to go to the Joint Security Area since then-President Donald Trump visited in 2019 for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nYoon said Pelosi's visit to the JSA would demonstrate \"a strong deterrence against North Korea\" by the allies, said Kim Tae-hyo, a deputy presidential national security adviser.\n\nSouth Korean media, citing no sources, later reported that Pelosi visited the JSA but gave no further details. The U.S. Embassy in Seoul, the U.N. Command and the South Korean Defense Ministry couldn't immediately confirm the reports.\n\nSitting inside the 2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, a buffer created at the end of the Korean War, the JSA is the site of past bloodshed and a venue for numerous talks. U.S. presidents and other top officials have often traveled to the JSA and other border areas to reaffirm their security commitment to South Korea.\n\nAny statement critical of North Korea by Pelosi is certain to draw a furious response. On Wednesday, the North's Foreign Ministry slammed the United States over her Taiwan trip, saying \"the current situation clearly shows that the impudent interference of the U.S. in internal affairs of other countries … (is) the root cause of harassed peace and security in the region.\"\n\nChinese launch military exercises\n\nThe Chinese military exercises launched Thursday and planned to last until Sunday involve its navy, air force and other departments. They include missile strikes on targets in the seas north and south of the island in an echo of the last major Chinese military drills aimed at intimidating Taiwan's leaders and voters in 1995 and 1996.\n\nChina's official Xinhua News Agency said the exercises are joint operations focused on \"blockade, sea target assault, strike on ground targets, and airspace control.\"\n\nTaiwan has put its military on alert and staged civil defense drills, while the U.S. has numerous naval assets in the area. Taiwan's Defense Ministry called the Chinese drills \"unreasonable actions in an attempt to change the status quo, destroy the peace and stability of the region.\"\n\nChina views Taiwan as a breakaway province to be annexed by force if necessary. It considers visits to Taiwan by foreign officials as recognizing its sovereignty.\n\n\"Today the world faces a choice between democracy and autocracy,\" Pelosi said in a short speech during a meeting with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday. \"America's determination to preserve democracy, here in Taiwan and around the world, remains ironclad.\"\n\nThe Biden administration and Pelosi have said the United States remains committed to the \"one-China policy,\" which recognizes Beijing as the sole, legitimate government of China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. The administration discouraged but did not prevent Pelosi from visiting.\n\nPelosi noted in Taiwan that congressional support for Taiwan is bipartisan, and she praised the island's democracy. She stopped short of saying that the U.S would defend Taiwan militarily and emphasized that Congress is \"committed to the security of Taiwan, in order to have Taiwan be able to most effectively defend themselves.\"\n\nTsai said at her meeting with Pelosi that \"facing deliberately heightened military threats, Taiwan will not back down.\"\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Wednesday that U.S. officials \"don't believe we're at the brink now, and there's certainly no reason for anybody to be talking about being at the brink going forward.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations called for calm in the Taiwan Strait, which separates mainland China and Taiwan, and urged the avoidance of any \"provocative action.\" ASEAN foreign ministers, who are meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, for a regional forum, said they were concerned the situation could \"destabilize the region and eventually could lead to miscalculation, serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers.\"\n\nPelosi's focus has always been the same, she said, going back to her 1991 visit to Beijing's Tiananmen Square, when she and other lawmakers unfurled a small banner supporting democracy two years after a bloody military crackdown on protesters at the square. That visit was also about human rights and what she called dangerous technology transfers to \"rogue countries.\"\n\nChina and Taiwan, which split in 1949 after a civil war, have no official relations but multibillion-dollar business ties.\n\nWu reported from Taipei, Taiwan.

While nothing is more powerful than real physical human connection, the digital virtual tech-driven world was the big story for media and entertainment in 2021.\n\nIn particular, 2021 marked the coming out party for the blockchain – a kind of transformational decentralized Web 3.0 world. In the world of media, the headline blockchain story took its form in so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Will the blockchain’s adoption in media accelerate in 2022?\n\nMy Magic 8-Ball says “Signs point to ‘YES’.”\n\n►What's an NFT:A guide to what they are and why someone spent $69 million for one\n\nHere are 10 predictions for the coming year in which we hope that we finally get COVID under some kind of real long-term control.\n\n1. Blockchain blows up in 2022\n\nAfter early experimentation in 2021, 2022 will mark the year creators truly begin to embrace and leverage the power of the blockchain at scale. Just like iPhones ushered in a whole new mobile-first world of content 15 years ago, so-called Web 3.0 ushers in a whole new transformational world for originators of intellectual property, or IP, to directly reach and monetize their audiences. In the process, creators take back at least some of the power of mega tech platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Apple that built their trillion-dollar-plus valuations on their backs.\n\n2. NFTs a new venue for fans\n\nAnd 2022 will mark the year superfans will use their collective decentralized power to fuel creativity from their favorite artists via blockchain-related opportunities. Most in the entertainment world still focus on Beeple’s $69-million digital art NFT as being the blockchain’s poster child.\n\nBut instead they should be thinking of NFTs as new direct and directly monetizing channels of super-fandom – opening up membership into exclusive new clubs. If few in the world of media now know of CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and DAOs in general (decentralized autonomous organizations), that changes in 2022. The blockchain, NFTs and DAOs are no momentary fads. They are long-term game-changers. Like it or not, the Los Angeles-based Staples Center’s new “Crypto.com Arena” moniker is here to stay. Hey, brands out there, you better claim your \".eth\" web address now. (Here's why.)\n\n►Decoding the lingo:10 cryptocurrency terms people use every day\n\n►Crypto tithes:With fewer young parishioners carrying cash, more churches accept bitcoin as offering\n\n3. Big action to come against Big Tech\n\nThe new mega-media platforms of Facebook (or Meta, actually), Google, Apple, and Amazon face a more immediate threat than the blockchain and related new decentralized social platforms in 2022, as big government finally takes big action against big tech in advance of 2022’s mid-term elections. Facebook and Zuckerberg are first to feel the pinch, as the Feds force Facebook to shed Instagram (and perhaps set some real rules to limit unbridled ad and AI-driven algorithmic devastation, both on young people and society itself). These “unlockings” of tech conglomerates will unlock more content innovation across more competing tech platforms.\n\n►The Facebook Papers:Facebook fed posts with violence and nudity to people with low digital literacy\n\n4. Apple leads the way to the metaverse\n\nFaced with these threats, Facebook tries to run and hide with its new Meta moniker (the quintessential “lipstick on a pig”), but real metaverse innovation comes from others, including Apple. Yes, Apple’s AR glasses ultimately will drive some of that innovation. But Apple already sports the ultimate wearable – AirPods (now a $20-billion business by itself). AirPods will become the first major gateway into the metaverse – outside of the games industry – much like Apple drove mass consumer adoption in the mobile world with the iPhone. Expect micro-cameras to be incorporated into higher-end, extremely expensive versions of AirPods that will enable visual experiences. I can see you lining up at your local Apple store already.\n\n►What is the metaverse anyway? Everyone wants to own the metaverse including Facebook and Microsoft\n\n5. Games + crossovers = metaverse magic\n\nSpeaking of games, that industry will continue to lead all other categories of entertainment content by an order of magnitude and increasingly show the way for artists and creators to emerge and build audiences. Before the tragedy of Astroworld, Travis Scott broke out into the metaverse in 2020 via \"Fortnite\" to the tune of 50 million viewers who drove a No. 1 hit. Ariana Grande shattered those numbers this past year, and the marriage of games and music grows stronger in 2022 as music licensing for games becomes a massive new revenue stream.\n\n►From Facebook to Fortnite:The metaverse is calling. Are we ready?\n\n6. Get paid to play\n\nMedia and tech business models will continue to fundamentally evolve, particularly in light of the havoc wreaked by ad-driven business models from the two major culprits of Facebook and Google. We’ve already seen the shift from single transactions to subscription-based recurring revenue bundles (Amazon Prime, Apple One, Disney+). That will accelerate in 2022. And move over “free to play” business models in the world of games. Now, thanks to the blockchain, welcome to an entirely new “play to earn” model that literally pays players to play (and gives them fractional ownership in the games they play). Why work when you can play? Other parts of the entertainment industry will continue to look to the world of games for inspiration and innovation, because that’s where it’s happening.\n\n7. In battle for screen dominance, Disney beats Netflix\n\nDisney+ will grow more rapidly than Netflix – and begin to close the gap in terms of global paid members – as the Mouse House begins to unlock significantly more dollars to produce originals. And don’t forget Disney’s “special sauce” that Netflix can’t touch – Disney’s priceless crown jewels of content – i.e., the Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Avengers, and Disney Princess franchises. Just imagine the NFTs Disney can (and will) create with those timeless characters (which, in turn, will drive more Disney+ subscriptions/memberships). Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple will also quietly raise their own originals ante as they too accelerate their media ambitions – but for decidedly different ends. Amazon and Apple use content as marketing and to drive customer loyalty – to draw us in and create an ongoing customer relationship so we spend more time (and cash) in their walled gardens. And in the thirst for new content, expect more media production company acquisitions in 2022. The big buy in 2021 was Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine. Indie idol A24 will be the big prize for 2022.\n\n8. Musicians to harness the power of NFTs\n\nMusic will continue its double-digit growth – fueled by accelerating streaming via broader global broadband connectivity, entirely new royalty-paying platforms (Facebook, TikTok, Peloton), the growing ubiquity of smart speakers and, yes, transformational blockchain-fueled opportunities like NFTs. Perhaps most notably – and most notably absent in the minds of most executives still today – superfans will directly drive significantly more dollars into the pockets of their favorite artists. Billions have been left on the table in the past. Not any longer.\n\n►Making music and history:In her return, singer Shontelle deploys NFTs in song of empowerment\n\n9.You could help finance the next big Hollywood entertainment project\n\nExpect the retail market – that's you and me, the superfans – to directly finance and even buy fractional pieces of content from our favorite artists. In a world of content increasingly being “king,” private equity has pumped billions of dollars into the world of music acquisitions for the likes of Stevie Nicks and Bob Dylan. But that kind of content ownership will not be just for the “big boys” in 2022. NFTs will help fuel the way. And superfan-fueled crowd-funding and IP ownership aren’t just for the world of music. The retail market will open up an entirely new world of financing for producers of film and television. Hey, Hollywood, check out “The Chosen.” If you don’t know about it, you should.\n\n10. Live entertainment is back, but forever changed\n\nMusic festivals and other mega-live entertainment experiences will continue to open up in 2022 due to pent up demand for real, physical interaction and lasting shared experiences in our increasingly heads-down digital, virtual world. But these large-scale live events are forever changed as a result of the twin tragedies of COVID and Astroworld. Crowd control, mitigation and broader safety and security efforts and focus will transform overall planning and execution – not to mention the overall “festival experience” for those who attend.\n\nThere you have it – 10 predictions for our increasingly tech-driven world of media and entertainment in 2022.\n\nPeter Csathy is the chairman of CREATV Media & Deep Cuts Media, a media, entertainment & tech-focused business development, M&A and advisory firm.

Twenty-eight projects were selected in all for a total of $30.1 million in funding from the state. The largest amounts of $2 million each are going to the cities of Saraland, Springville and Houston County. Some local governments are providing about $9.5 million total to assist with the work. A statement from Ivey’s office said every citizen will see benefits from infrastructure spending.

Officials said Alaska Airlines passengers will also no longer be able to use miles for award travel on American flights. The airlines said Alaska plan holders will still be able to earn mile-for-mile value on American flights with Alaska flight numbers to locations in the Midwest, the East Coast and parts of Canada. Before the announcement, American Airlines was Alaska’s final domestic mileage plan partner, meaning Alaska plan members will not have another major carrier on which to use miles.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:There have been 16 deaths in Arizona this year attributed to the West Nile virus, nearly half of the 35 deaths reported nationwide. Arizona has had not only more deaths but more total cases of West Nile infection than any other state in the nation this year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Maricopa County is driving the high case numbers and deaths. All but one of the 16 deaths statewide were in Maricopa County. In 2018, the state health department recorded six deaths from the West Nile virus. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds. Infected mosquitoes then spread the West Nile virus to people and other animals by biting them, the CDC said. Investigators are looking at the local ecology, bird and mosquito populations, rainfall and disease patterns, among other factors. The total case count of West Nile virus in Maricopa County is 153 this year, which is a 750% jump over the same time last year, county data showed. Other mosquito-borne diseases were also up in Maricopa County this year. St. Louis Encephalitis, Dengue and Chikungunya infections have all increased over last year's case count, county data says.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: Officials in this economically struggling city are redirecting tax money meant for a revitalization plan to bolster city budgets. Residents passed a sales tax in 2017 that was projected to generate almost $32 million in seven years. The City Council voted Monday to divert $2.1 million of its projected $4.5 million in extra annual revenue, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. It includes allocating $300,000 each to the Police Department, youth and community resources, the convention center, in addition to $200,000 to the Fire Department. Another $1 million will be allotted to drainage needs. Nonprofit organization Go Forward Pine Bluff, established in 2015 and governed by an independent committee, is working with the city government to improve the town and economy. Unless Mayor Shirley Washington vetoes the resolution, the group could lose around $10.5 million in subsidies.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Hotels in the nation’s most populous state will have to stop giving guests small plastic shampoo bottles under a new law set to take effect starting in 2023. Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday he signed a law banning hotels from giving guests plastic bottles filled with shampoo, conditioner or soap. It takes effect in 2023 for hotels with more than 50 rooms and 2024 for hotels with less than 50 rooms. Violators could be fined $500 for a first offense and $2,000 for subsequent violations. The law follows similar actions by some of the world’s largest hotel chains. Marriott International has said it plans to stop using small plastic bottles in its hotel rooms by December 2020. IHG, which owns Holiday Inn, Kimpton and other brands, said it will eliminate about 200 million small bottles by 2021. Last year, Walt Disney Co. said it would get rid of small plastic shampoo bottles at its resorts and cruise ships. The law comes as California officials are trying to reduce the amount of plastic waste. The state already bans grocery stores from giving customers single-use plastic bags without charging a fee. Last year, former Gov. Jerry Brown passed a law allowing restaurants to hand out plastic straws only upon request. The Personal Care Products Council opposed the legislation, arguing it would hurt personal care product manufacturers.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A group opposed to hydraulic fracturing announced a lawsuit seeking to halt new oil and gas drilling permits until updated regulations are in place. Colorado Rising attorney Joe Salazar said the Denver District Court complaint alleges the state is issuing drilling permits under rules made obsolete by a new law. The law requires the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to put public health and safety ahead of production in considering permits. It’s devising rules to comply. A group of Broomfield residents contends, in part, that the agency didn’t afford them the right to raise health and environmental objections afforded them under the new law as the agency considered a well location permit. Commission spokeswoman Megan Castle noted that the agency repeatedly has advised the public that it will conduct business, including considering permit applications, under the new law while it devises new rules.\n\nConnecticut\n\nKillingly: Students at Killingly High School have chosen a replacement for their Native American-themed athletic mascot. Superintendent Steve Rioux told The Norwich Bulletin that about 80% of students who voted selected Red Hawks to replace Redmen. The other finalist was Razorbacks. The new nickname is subject to approval by the town’s Board of Education. The change is the culmination of a yearslong process that began with citizen complaints to the board about the offensive nature of the former mascot. The board decided to make a change during the summer, when the Nipmuc Tribe, based in the area, stated their opposition to it. The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation also condemned the mascot as “racist and stereotypical.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Officials on Thursday recovered the body of a 6-year-old boy who went missing when an SUV carrying five young people plunged into the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal on Sunday morning. There was only one survivor in the accident, a 16-year-old girl. The bodies of three boys – two brothers and their cousin – were recovered shortly after, but officials had been searching for the body of 6-year-old Ethan Lindsey since then. He was found at about 8:45 a.m. Thursday, police said. State police said they received a 911 call from someone who saw the body in the water near the north bank of the canal, about a quarter-mile from the west end of the William V. Roth Jr. Bridge. Ethan's father, Willis Lindsey Sr., posted an update on Facebook, saying the boy had been located. Willis Lindsey said he and his family were traveling from Wilmington to Easton, Maryland, in separate cars for a youth football game when both vehicles took a wrong exit and ended up on a gravel road along the C&D Canal. It is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and used to access the waterway and bridges to perform maintenance and repairs. Lindsey was driving with his wife; 10-year-old son, Donald; and 2-year-old daughter to Donald's football game. In the other car, his eldest son, Willis Jr., 18, was driving a 16-year-old female friend; his brothers Kyree, 16, and Ethan, 6, and their 12-year-old cousin, Eric Lindsey. The elder Lindsey, 40, said he and his son turned their vehicles around and were headed back to the main road when he lost sight of his son's car after rounding a slight bend. Lindsey Jr. helped the female passenger get safely to shore, and jumped back in to try and rescue the three boys. Authorities found Lindsey Jr.'s body in the water near the site of the crash. They found the bodies of Kryee and Eric just before 5 p.m. Sunday, when the vehicle was removed from the water.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The D.C. Council has voted to temporarily change the name of Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples’ Day. WTOP-FM reported the council on Tuesday passed the “Indigenous Peoples’ Day Emergency Declaration Act of 2019.” Supporting Councilman David Grosso told lawmakers that the federal holiday honors Christopher Columbus despite him having “enslaved, colonized, mutilated and massacred thousands of indigenous peoples.” He called the legislation overdue, saying D.C. struggles with respecting indigenous people and referencing the Washington Redskins. The legislation requires Mayor Muriel Bowser’s signature to go into effect. It also requires congressional approval to become permanent. Without it, the holiday will revert to Columbus Day next year. Councilman Jack Evans, who’s under federal investigation, abstained from the vote, saying he supports Indigenous Peoples’ Day, “but not replacing Columbus Day.”\n\nFlorida\n\nPalm City: Authorities said they arrested a man who provoked a small alligator into biting his arm and poured beer into the animal’s mouth. News outlets reported 27-year-old Timothy Kepke and 22-year-old Noah Osborne were charged last week with unlawfully taking an alligator. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officers began investigating in August following a complaint of Osborne catching the alligator in Palm City and handing to Kepke. Kepke appears in a video to let the reptile bite his forearm. The video also shows Kepke feeding the alligator beer as it struggles. When officers interviewed Kepke last month, he reportedly acknowledged that he was in the video and said the gator was alive when they released it. The men were released on bond. Jail records didn’t list attorneys for them.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDuluth: Most of the mall heavily featured in the latest season of Netflix’s “Stranger Things” is going up for sale. News outlets reported Moonbeam Capital Partners is ready to sell its portion of the long-struggling Gwinnett Place Mall, which has been so empty that a body went unnoticed near the food court for about two weeks in 2017. A senior vice president for real estate firm Colliers International Atlanta, Tony D’Ambrosio, said no asking price has been set for the mall’s interior retail portion and much of its parking lots. The mall’s anchor tenants and their surrounding parking spaces, including Macy’s and a now-shuttered Sears store, are owned separately.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Hawaii will consider whether to restrict access to a nature reserve where rock-climbing activities are threatening native plant species, officials said. The state Board of Land and Natural Resources is expected to consider restricting portions of the West Maui Natural Area Reserve, The Maui News reported Wednesday. The state Division of Forestry and Wildlife asked the board to limit access to cliff areas in the Lihau section of the reserve for up to two years. The board is expected to consider the request during its meeting on Friday in Honolulu. Rock climbers have installed hardware and footholds in cliffs in the area, officials said. Modifying geological features including chipping rock for footholds is prohibited under state law, according to land and natural resources board documents. The changes affect threatened and endangered plants such as the Maui chaff flower and the Menzies’ schiedea. Climbers hiking to the rock walls also are affecting West Maui’s only known population of yellow hibiscus, which is in danger of trampling or breakage, officials said. The dry cliff ecosystem is home to vegetation that grows on steep slopes in areas receiving less than 75 inches of rainfall per year, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The forestry and wildlife division proposed installing signs explaining to rock climbers why the activity threatens the rare plants.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An early deep freeze has potato and onion farmers rushing to harvest crops or hoping the buried vegetables will survive the frozen nights this week. Travis Blacker with the Idaho Potato Commission said an estimated 15% to 20% of Idaho’s potato crop remained in the ground Wednesday. The Idaho Department of Agriculture said onion growers are in similar straits and working overtime to finish the harvest. Other crops at risk include sweet corn and dry beans. Blacker said harvesting during freezing temperatures can hurt the quality of the potatoes, and rushing can lead to accidents. National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Wojcik said a low-pressure system from Canada is causing the high winds, low temperatures and snow. He said Boise’s temperatures were about 20 degrees below average on Wednesday.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A preservation group is struggling to find a developer to save a historical coal-fired power plant the owner said is deteriorating and presents safety concerns. Preservation Chicago is making its last attempt to prevent the demolition of Union Station Power House, which sits along the Illinois River in the South Loop. The power plant was built in the 1930s to supply the massive amount of energy needed to run Union Station and its surrounding infrastructure. The Amtrak-owned plant closed in 2011 when that power was no longer needed. Ward Miller, who heads the preservation group, told the Chicago Sun-Times that the power house is an example of the city’s industrial roots and a monument to its history as a transporter of people and freight. Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said that although the company hasn’t made its final decision on what to do with the building, the structure is deteriorating rather quickly and has safety issues. He noted that Amtrak has made significant progress in planning for the demolition, but because preservationists have expressed an interest in reusing the structure, the company is open to preservation proposals, though there have been none.\n\nIndiana\n\nCrawfordsville: Wabash College, which has handed out sheepskin diplomas to its graduating seniors for 187 years, is going to end the practice. College administrators said the quality of the diplomas has deteriorated while the prices have soared.Year 188 will bring paper. Wabash College President Gregory Hess told the Indianapolis Star last week in a written statement that the availability of sheepskin diplomas and timely delivery have been an issue for years. The diplomas cost the college $28,000 to $32,000, depending on the size of the graduating class, which ranges from 175 to 200 graduates. The diplomas would cost about $160 each. James Amidon, the college’s Director of Strategic Communications, said the college will look for museum-quality, archival grade paper, but it's not yet clear how much that will cost.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: City officials gathered with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers leaders and members of Iowa’s congressional delegation for a groundbreaking ceremony of a new flood gate to protect part of downtown from Cedar River flooding. The 4-foot-thick gate will be 14 feet tall and 67 feet long and will hide behind a flood wall when not in use, the Gazette reported. It can be rolled into place within about 30 minutes to protect the New Bohemia business district when the river rises. A contract to complete the $2.4 million gate was signed last week, and construction will likely begin later this year or next spring, said Jason Smith, a program manager with the Corps. The city has been slowly assembling a $550 million flood control system since devastating floods ravaged Cedar Rapids in 2008. Last year, the Corps announced the approval of $117 million federal funding for flood protection in Cedar Rapids. Of that, $41 million must be repaid by the city. City officials have estimated the full east side system would cost $245 million.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A new water plant planned for Wichita is behind schedule, delaying a City Council decision on keeping a nearly $524 million contract that has prompted an investigation of the mayor. The Wichita Eagle reported the contract gave Wichita Water Partners until Oct. 4 to submit a cost estimate for a part of the plant it is designing. The council had planned to decide at the end of October whether the group could start construction. But on Oct. 3, City Manager Robert Layton approved the group’s request for a 75-day extension. The Dec. 18 deadline is after the Nov. 5 mayoral election. Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett opened an investigation after The Eagle reported that Mayor Jeff Longwell steered the contract to the group and it includes friends of his.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky’s Court of Appeals has appointed its first female clerk. Rebecca Combs Lyon assumed the post Oct. 1. She has worked with the court for more than 30 years and has become the first woman in the role since Kentucky’s modern court system was created more than 40 years ago. The court said in a news release that Lyon has worked as an appellate staff attorney, civil motions panel attorney, deputy chief staff attorney and chief staff attorney. As clerk, she’s now responsible for custody, control and storage of all appellate records. Lyon succeeds Samuel P. Givens Jr., who retired last month after 30 years with the court system.\n\nLouisiana\n\nOpelousas:A large cross has disappeared from the wreckage of an African American church in Louisiana that was burned down in an arson case. News outlets reported the white fiberglass cross belonged to Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas. It was one of three historic churches set ablaze in arson attacks earlier this year. The Rev. Gerald Toussaint told The Acadiana Advocate he noticed the cross was missing Friday after a meeting with architect Stephen Juan Ortego. Ortego said the congregation wanted to use the cross as a relic of the destroyed church. On Facebook , Ortego asked anyone with information to message him. Toussaint said he’s hesitant to file a report because it might be a “fruitless effort.” Holden Matthews was indicted in June on federal arson and hate crimes charges.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: The world’s largest 3D printer and the largest object ever printed have been unveiled at the University of Maine. The university showed off a 25-foot, 5,000-pound boat Thursday that researchers think is just the beginning of the type of product that companies can bring to the market faster with 3D printing. The boat was printed at the university’s Advanced Structures & Composite Center. The school and Oak Ridge Laboratory in Tennessee are collaborating on the project, which aims to help businesses innovate with larger, faster prototypes. The university said Guinness World Records confirmed it’s the world’s largest 3D-printed boat, the largest 3D-printed object and largest prototype polymer 3D printer.\n\nMaryland\n\nSecretary: A wastewater treatment plant on Maryland’s Eastern Shore has received a $5.8 million federal grant for an upgrade. U.S. Rep. Andy Harris made the announcement Wednesday. The Twin Cities wastewater treatment plant is shared by the towns of Secretary and East New Market in Dorchester County. The grant will be accompanied by a loan of about $1.1 million. The money will be used to upgrade the wastewater treatment plant for enhanced nutrient removal. The U.S. Agriculture Department said it will correct a health and sanitary problem at the existing treatment plant, due to its deteriorating condition.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: The Telegram & Gazette reported that the Worcester Planning Board voted Wednesday to give definitive site approval to the Polar Park project and associated private development. The Worcester Redevelopment Authority is overseeing construction of a minor-league ballpark and municipal parking garage, and Madison WG Holdings LLC is doing the private development. The ballpark will be home to the Boston Red Sox’s Triple-A affiliate, currently located in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. To meet deadlines to get the ballpark open by 2021, the city will be approving development in phases and will approve details such as landscaping, lighting and architectural elements at a later date.\n\nMichigan\n\nSpring Lake: The remains of a Michigan soldier who went missing during the Korean War’s fierce Battle of Chosin Reservoir are being returned home after DNA testing confirmed that he died in that battle nearly 70 years ago. U.S. Army Sgt. David Alexander Feriend was 23 in December 1950 when he was listed as missing in action, after the 17-day siege near the Chosin Reservoir in eastern North Korea. Feriend’s remains were among 54 boxes of human remains that North Korea turned over to the U.S. after a June 2018 summit in Singapore between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced in August that Feriend had been “accounted for.” DNA testing verified that the remains in box number 36 were those of Feriend, WOOD-TV reported. Feriend’s sister, Irene Arbogast, said her parents had hoped for years that he was a prisoner of war. Feriend will receive full military honors when his remains arrive at Gerald R. Ford International Airport near Grand Rapids late Friday. Patriot Riders and the Michigan State Police are expected to accompany his remains to a Traverse City-area funeral home.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Enbridge Energy has offered the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa at least $24 million to settle a lawsuit the tribe filed to shut down and remove the Line 5 pipeline from its reservation. But, tribal leaders said their position against the pipeline remains unchanged. Line 5 carries up to 540,000 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids each day from Superior, Wisconsin, to Sarnia, Ontario. Minnesota Public Radio News reported Enbridge is offering $12 million to settle claims over expired easements on tribal land, as well as $10 million that would follow the start of a new Line 5 route outside the reservation. Enbridge, based in Calgary, Alberta, would also pay the tribe $2 million annually until the pipeline’s operation is no longer in use on the reservation.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Hunters who use dogs to pursue deer could see reduced access to national forests in Mississippi. A report for the U.S. Forest Service found few large continuous tracts of national forest land in Mississippi judged suitable for hunting with dogs. Adjoining landowners often complain when dogs enter their property. Forest Service spokesman Mario Rossilli told the Clarion Ledger that officials will meet with interested groups to discuss possible changes. But David Smith, president of the Mississippi Dog Hunting Association, said if the Forest Service would open closed forest roads, allowing hunters to catch dogs before they leave public lands. He said roads are opened for hunters in Alabama and Georgia. Smith also questions the validity of the report because University of Georgia researchers didn’t come to Mississippi before issuing it.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Officials are planting small flags in piles of abandoned dog poop as part of a campaign to get residents to clean up after their pets downtown. The Police Department in Springfield posted photos of the flags in use on its Facebook page Wednesday. The flags contain messages such as, “Is this your turd? ‘Cuz that’s absurd” and “This is a nudge to pick up the fudge.” The campaign started this week and the department noted on Facebook that leaving behind a pet’s mess in many cases violates a city ordinance. The flags are made of bamboo and recycled paper. The city said it picks up nearly 25 pounds of poop a week from downtown parks and parking lots, with the work costing $7,500 annually.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: More than 488,000 people visited Glacier National Park in September, a 12.5% increase over the same month last year. The Flathead Beacon reported that the National Park Service said 2.9 million people have come to the park this year, a 3.5% jump over 2018. The strong September numbers come on the heels of a busy August, when more than 771,000 people visited Glacier. Just two months ago, year-to-date visitation was down more than 3%, with 1.6 million people coming to the park between January and July. One likely reason for the spike in August and September visitation is that for the first time in three years, the park did not have a major wildfire.\n\nNebraska\n\nChadron: A winter storm system has dropped nearly a half-foot of snow in northwest Nebraska, making roads and highways treacherous. The National Weather Service said 5 inches had been dumped on Chadron, where schools and Chadron State College canceled classes for Thursday. The service said 3.4 inches accumulated in Scottsbluff, and more is expected. Schools in Gordon, Hay Springs and Hemingford planned to delay the start of Thursday classes. The eastbound system has brought an inch so far to Valentine. The weather service said blowing and drifting snow are making travel hazardous and said the low temperatures could pose a danger to people working outdoors and livestock. Gusts could approach 35 mph.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Backup plans are being considered for an avalanche control system in Nevada near a year-round highway pass amid concerns about reliability, transportation officials said. The remote-operated Gazex system uses propane-powered blasts to trigger controlled avalanches on state Route 431, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported Monday. The system has been in place near Mount Rose since 1992 and the building that houses the propane and oxygen tanks is about 12 years old. The building receives annual inspections. The next is scheduled for this month. The human-triggered avalanches clear the snow load from slopes overhanging the highway, making the roadway safer for drivers once the debris is cleared, officials said. The Gazex system covers the zone at the summit of the mountain at the highest risk for sliding. Alternatives could include contracting companies licensed and trained to use hand-thrown explosives to trigger controlled avalanches, a common method at ski resorts, said Meg Ragonese, a spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Transportation. The department has also announced plans to add as many as six new snowblowers for use on the highway in the coming two years, she said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Kimberly Piper-Stoddard, an English teacher who instructs inmates in the state prison system, has been named the New Hampshire Teacher of the Year. Piper-Stoddard was honored Wednesday at a ceremony at the New Hampshire State Prison for Men in Concord. She’s a teacher at Granite State High School, which is located within the walls of the men’s and women’s prisons. Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut said Piper-Stoddard teaches students who have gone down the wrong path but are working to turn their lives around. One student said Piper-Stoddard is excited and enthusiastic about what she teaches, and that’s created “an overwhelming positive change in me.” Other finalists were Jeremy Brown, Littleton High School; Sarah Grossi, Con-Val Regional High School; John “Drew” Groves, Bow High School; Barbara Milliken, Oyster River High School; and Christine Stilwell, Robert J. Lister Academy.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFredon Township: A lost hiker and his dog are safe after a state trooper was lowered by rope down a cliff to reach the man who was holding on to a tree. The rescue happened Monday night in the dark and rain after the hiker called 911 to say he was trapped on an incline along a trail in Fredon Township. Troopers Russell Cahn and Sean Sullivan located the man and the dog. The troopers were worried about hypothermia. Body camera video shows Cahn and firefighters lowered Sullivan by rope to reach the man. The hiker’s dog was hoisted to safety before the man was raised by the rope and was treated at the scene by EMS. The rescue took nearly two hours.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Officials said 18 small fires discovered burning near each other in the Carson National Forest last week were caused by people. The Albuquerque Journal reported U.S. Forest Service is still investigating the exact cause of the fires, which collectively are being called the Maton Fire. A soaking rain on Friday helped firefighting crews contain the blazes, keeping them more than 80% contained by the weekend. Carson National Forest spokeswoman Denise Ottaviano said investigators found 18 points of ignition, and it will take time to determine the cause for each one. She said it was unusual for that many fires to start at one time.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The observatory atop the Empire State Building has a dizzying new look with floor-to-ceiling, 360-degree windows 102 floors above New York City. The remodeled observatory opens to the public on Saturday. It was unveiled to the media on Thursday. More than 4 million annual visitors will get a bird’s-eye view of the city and nearby states. The $58 cost to get to the observatory at 1,250 feet above Fifth Avenue has not changed. The building also has remodeled its famous open-air observatory on the 86th floor. The highest new perch also contains fresh exhibits on the way up. It was a four-year project costing $165 million.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nLewisville: Officials said an overheated and smoldering Chromebook caused about 600 children to be evacuated from Lewisville Elementary School, whose district is now recalling about $4.2 million-worth of district-issued laptops. Winston-Salem Forsyth County Schools’ chief technology officer Kevin Sherrill told reporters at a Wednesday news conference that the children were evacuated that morning after the 2015 laptop began to smoke. District spokesman Brent Campbell said a third-grader reported the laptop was getting hot, and it then started to smoke. He said the classroom and building were evacuated, and the laptop was sprayed with a fire extinguisher. Sherrill said the laptop likely suffered a battery-related issue. The district is now recalling all 20,000 of its 2015 Chromebooks, which Sherrill said are each valued at about $210.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nDevils Lake: Police are investigating several reports of laser pointers targeting aircraft at the local airport, which is a dangerous crime. KFGO reported authorities said the latest incident happened Sunday night and involved a medical helicopter. There have been similar reports in recent weeks involving aircraft arriving at the Devils Lake airport. When a laser is pointed at an aircraft and enters the cockpit, it has the potential to blind the pilots often at a crucial time – when they’re landing. Interfering with a flight is a federal crime. Police said anyone providing information that leads to an arrest might qualify for a reward through Devils Lake Crimestoppers.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:The Great Ohio River Swim has been canceled because of a harmful algal bloom that could endanger swimmers’ health. Organizers canceled the event Tuesday after it was postponed from late September to Oct. 13. The race is scheduled to return in 2020. The event website thanked participants for their patience through the rescheduling and cancellation and said they can request a refund by email. Greater Cincinnati Water Works said the ongoing bloom of blue-green algae does not endanger residents’ drink water. The city’s health department said anyone swimming, boating or fishing could potentially be at risk of exposure. Health officials have warned that people encountering the harmful algae can have an array of reactions including irradiated skin and eyes as well as cause stomach cramps, headache and difficulty breathing.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An ornate conference-room table where the late oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens made billion-dollar deals and hosted VIPs in his Dallas office is heading to the Oklahoma Capitol. Officials at Oklahoma State University announced Wednesday that the 24-foot-long table and 22 leather chairs will be loaned to the governor’s office for the next 10 years. A university donor purchased the four-pedestal desk, inlaid with golden cherry and walnut wood, and donated it to the university. Oklahoma’s new Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt is a graduate of Oklahoma State and had inquired about the desk after visiting with Pickens, who died last month at age 91. The governor’s office is being renovated as part of a $245 million project to overhaul the state Capitol.\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: The Oregon Coast Aquarium has announced a fundraising campaign for an $18 million expansion effort. The Oregonian/OregonLive reported Wednesday that the aquarium plans to remodel existing facilities and add a marine rehabilitation center and an outdoor play area. Aquarium officials said the project would be the first major remodeling since the facility opened to the public in 1992. The attraction, located 133 miles southwest of Portland, draws more than 420,000 visitors annually and has hosted 15 million people overall. Aquarium CEO Carrie Lewis said the original facility was not designed to accommodate current visitor numbers. The renovation plan includes a rehabilitation facility for endangered marine animals such as sea turtles, seals and snowy plovers. Officials said those animals are now cared for in a repurposed warehouse.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Trump administration officials said the Navy will name a ship that has yet to be built after the city of Harrisburg. The naming of the future USS Harrisburg was announced Thursday in the Capitol Rotunda at an event that included federal, state and local officials. The $800 million amphibious landing platform dock will be built in Mississippi and is expected to be ready for service in about two years. Officials said the 684-foot USS Harrisburg will be used for amphibious and special operations efforts, as well as humanitarian missions. A previous USS Harrisburg served as a troop transport during World War I.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s largest school district is now giving every student access to free breakfasts and lunches without having to apply for a free or reduced-priced lunch program. The Providence Journal reported that the Providence School Board gave the new policy first passage at its meeting Wednesday night. Board President Nina Pande said removing the application process for reduced-price lunches helps eliminate the stigma for students who are eligible. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, nearly 60% of Providence students meet the criteria. Providence Public Schools spokeswoman Emily Martineau said the city is expected to receive about $16 million in reimbursement from the federal government for the program. The school board will take the new policy up for second and final passage at its next meeting.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Much of one of the state’s largest counties was left without water after a 70-year-old pipe broke, sending a torrent of water over a main highway and closing schools, businesses and county offices. A 20-inch iron pipe that carries water from Rock Hill’s treatment plant into the water system in York County, just south of Charlotte, broke Wednesday afternoon because of old age, Deputy City Manager Jimmy Bagley said. The pipe was fixed about 1 a.m. Thursday and water was again running through the system, but officials said it would take hours to restore pressure. About 30 million gallons – enough to fill more than 45 Olympic-size swimming pools – of treated water spilled, Bagley said. About 125,000 customers, including residents, schools and businesses, were left without water and forced to close. Many remained closed Thursday. The torrent of water also shut down U.S. Highway 21. York County residents will need to boil their water until at least Friday afternoon to give state health officials time to test it for safety, Rock Hill Mayor John Gettys said Thursday. City crews were opening fire hydrants to flush out mud and sediment that entered the system through the break and Gettys later asked residents to wait for that process to finish Thursday before washing clothes or taking showers. York is South Carolina’s seventh-most populous county, with 260,000 people, and one of the state’s fastest-growing areas.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:The Sioux Falls School District on Tuesday held its largest full-scale active shooter training session since 2014. The district had been planning for the training since January 2018, a month before a shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school left 17 dead. School District Risk Manager Bob Bray coordinated the training, and assistant superintendent Jamie Nold walked emergency responders and district officials through various exercises at a simulated command center set up at the district's Instructional Planning Center. No one portrayed the role of the shooter in the exercise. However, 10 student names were listed as “injured” during the training. None of those students participated in the event, district spokesperson Carly Uthe said. Bray said the purpose of the execise was to spot potential pitfalls, future concerns and any security gaps that need to be addressed and adjusted.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville:The copyright owners of the “Charlie Brown Christmas” theme song have sued Dollywood in federal court for copyright infringement. News outlets reported the complaint said the East Tennessee theme park named for country star Dolly Parton has used the song without permission in live Christmas performances since 2007. The lawsuit said Los Angeles-based Lee Mendelson Film Productions owns the copyright and is asking for $150,000 for every time the song has been used. According to the suit, “Christmas Time is Here” was written by Lee Mendelson and Vince Guaraldi for the 1965 television special “A Charlie Brown Christmas.” Dollywood said it is aware of the lawsuit but declined to comment on pending litigation.\n\nTexas\n\nLaredo: Officials in this border city have lifted a boil-water notice 1½ weeks after low chlorine levels in the municipal drinking water supply prompted its issuance. In a statement issued Wednesday, Laredo officials said the city’s tap water was safe and could be used for any purpose. An investigation by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is underway to determine what caused the variable chlorine levels that had fallen to insufficient levels in some parts of the city of about 260,000 residents. The boil-water notice issued Sept. 28 had applied to all consumption, including for cooking, personal washing and brushing teeth.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Cans of beer have littered the parking lot of a church of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after a semi-trailer crashed that was carrying cases of brew banned by the faith. Sandy Police Stg. Jason Nielsen said the semi-trailer veered and fell from a road and into the church’s parking lot after it was hit by a pickup truck that ran a red light on Thursday. Beer cans were strewn across the empty church parking lot. One of the faith’s key rules is a ban on members drinking alcohol. Nielsen said the semi-trailer driver suffered nonlife-threatening injuries. The pickup truck driver wasn’t injured. Authorities haven’t determined if he will be cited. The church building wasn’t damaged.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department is warning motorists to be on the lookout for moose crossing roadways this time of year. Officials said it’s breeding season for moose, so they are on the move and more likely to cross roads, particularly after dark or early in the morning. State Game Warden Major George Scribner said drivers hit 57 moose on Vermont highways last year and 36 so far this year. Among the highways that moose frequent are Route 105 from Island Pond to Bloomfield; Route 114 from East Burke to Canaan; Interstate 89 from Bolton to Montpelier; and Route 12 from Worcester to Elmore. Officials said 19 people have died in vehicle collisions with moose on Vermont highways since 1985.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State health officials have issued an advisory because of elevated mercury levels found in blue catfish caught in the Nottoway River. The Virginia Department of Health said Thursday that recent fish tissue sample results from the river show mercury levels in blue catfish exceed the amount considered safe for long-term human consumption. The department advises people to eat no more than two meals a month of blue catfish taken from the river. Fish consumption advisories alert people to contaminants present in affected fish species but do not prohibit people from eating fish. Pregnant women, nursing mothers and young children should not eat fish from this advisory area to avoid ingesting mercury.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The cold weather that struck eastern Washington this week is causing worries for apple growers. The cold front is expected to last through the weekend, and calls for lows in the 20s in the Spokane region. The Spokesman-Review said cold temperatures in October could hurt what is projected to be the second-largest apple harvest in state history. Jim DeVaney, president of the Washington Tree Fruit Association, said the harvest is about half complete. He said the crop could withstand some loss from cold weather and still be very large. The potential for damage depends on factor like an orchard’s location and elevation.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The mayor of West Virginia’s capital city reversed a decision to change the name of the annual holiday parade after intense backlash from church leaders and conservatives. Mayor Amy Goodwin announced on Monday that she planned to rename the “Charleston Christmas Parade” the “Charleston Winter Parade” to demonstrate that Charleston is an inclusive city. Officials from several churches quickly criticized the decision and said they wouldn’t attend. State Senate President Mitch Carmichael, a Republican, issued a statement saying the renaming was the handiwork of “Charleston’s elite liberals.” Under pressure, Goodwin publicly withdrew the name change on Thursday. In a Facebook post, she said “the kind of vitriol that has come forth” over the secular parade title has been “disappointing and hurtful.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Assembly has passed a resolution supporting new F-35 fighter jets in Madison despite concerns about noise. Defense officials are considering stationing two F-35 squadrons at Truax Field. The planes would replace the Wisconsin Air National Guard’s aging F-16s. But Truax neighbors are worried about noise from the jets. An environmental impact statement said the noise would render more than 1,000 homes incompatible for residential use. The state Assembly on Thursday approved a resolution supporting F-35s at Truax on an 87-9 vote. The Senate passed it on Tuesday. The resolution’s main authors, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald and Rep. Tony Kurtz, argued that placing F-35s at Truax will ensure the base remains open and noise concerns are exaggerated.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Leaders of three more tribes have signed a treaty guiding restoration of buffalo populations in the U.S. and Canada. The International Buffalo Treaty was the first cross-border tribal treaty in more than 150 years when it was established in 2014. The treaty now has more than 30 signatories. This week, the Eastern Shoshone Tribe of Wyoming, Oglala Lakota Tribe of South Dakota and Frog Lake First Nation of Alberta, Canada, joined during a meeting in Chico Hot Springs, Montana. Jason Baldes with the Eastern Shoshone told Wyoming Public Radio the treaty reconnects buffalo to indigenous people and helps ensure buffalo are treated with “utmost respect.” An Eastern Shoshone herd established on Wyoming’s Wind River Indian Reservation in 2016 has grown from 10 to 33 buffalo.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2022/03/31/tsa-gender-neutral-screening-transgender-travel/7228781001/", "title": "TSA screenings will be inclusive of transgender, non-binary travelers", "text": "The White House and State Department announced U.S. citizens will be able to select \"X\" as the gender marker on their passport application beginning April 11.\n\nWhile gender identification will no longer be relevant at checkpoints for identification verification, name information between an identity document and boarding pass must be consistent.\n\nThe TSA is updating its standard operating procedures to incorporate less invasive screening procedures for passengers who trigger its units in a \"sensitive area.\"\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration announced Thursday – on Transgender Day of Visibility – that it is establishing new standards for transgender, gender-noncomforming and nonbinary air travelers in an effort to be more inclusive.\n\n\"On this internationally recognized day for the transgender community, TSA is proud to announce significant initiatives as a direct result of close partnership with community stakeholders,\" TSA Administrator David Pekoske said in a statement.\n\nPekoske said that over the next several months, the organization will work to implement more secure and efficient screening processes that will be gender-neutral.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security also published a statement on the updates announced by the TSA and Customs and Border Protection.\n\n\"DHS is committed to protecting the traveling public while ensuring that everyone, regardless of gender identity, is treated with respect,\" Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in the statement. \"The new measures announced today are part of a whole-of-government effort to promote equity and inclusion in all our programs and processes.\"\n\n'I STILL KIND OF PANIC A BIT':What transgender travelers want other travelers to know\n\nSTATE DEPARTMENT SAYS:U.S. will offer 'X' gender marker for passports starting April 11\n\nHow and when the new gender-neutral standards will be implemented\n\nIn its announcement Thursday , the TSA outlined the steps it will take to become more inclusive of transgender travelers.\n\n\"The announcement covers standard and TSA PreCheck lanes and is anticipated to provide enhanced security and improve the checkpoint experience for all as it seeks to reduce the number of false alarms and pat-down screenings,\" TSA spokesman Robert Langston told USA TODAY.\n\nThe TSA is taking steps to:\n\nAdd enhanced screening technology.

It said some major aspects are complete. The mill’s first line has been able to produce bales of paper pulp and rolls of fluff pulp since 2011. Fluff pulp is used in such items as diapers and feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products. The mill employs about 470 people.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A plane with seven people on board bound for Katmai National Park and Preserve crashed into the water as it was leaving a seaplane base in Anchorage, with two people suffering serious injuries, authorities said. Clint Johnson, chief of the National Transportation Safety Board’s Alaska division, said the information he initially received was that there were six people on board. He said he was later told there were seven on board. Aaron Danielson, chief of the Ted Stevens International Airport Police and Fire, said there was some “initial confusion on scene.” A statement from the department late Tuesday afternoon said all seven were taken to area hospitals for evaluation and treatment. Johnson said the plane operated by Regal Air had taken off and was in its initial climb phase when the accident occurred. The airport police and fire department said the plane was conducting a water takeoff “when, according to the pilot, a strong crosswind caused the right wing to rise after the plane was airborne. While the pilot attempted to make corrections,” the plane crashed. Johnson said investigators are still gathering information. There have been strong winds in the Anchorage area recently but “we don’t know if that played a part in it or not.” He said the passengers were from outside Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The Coconino County Board of Supervisors approved the transfer of $5 million to the county’s flood control district to deal with monsoonal flooding problems. Meanwhile Wednesday, Mayor Paul Deasy declared a state of emergency to make the city eligible for additional resources to support disaster response. The disaster grant assistance would help cover the costs associated with public infrastructure damage, including debris removal, emergency protective measures and the restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly owned facilities. Since July 16, Flagstaff has experienced days of steady and heavy rain that has inundated neighborhoods in the shadow of mountains that burned recently. County officials said the flash flooding has impacted the Timberline, Wupatki Trails and Doney Park areas, as well as the west side of Flagstaff. The annual monsoon season is expected to last through September, with the possibility of daily rainfall. County officials believe the continued costs of flood mitigation could exceed the costs of the aftermath of the Schultz Fire in 2010, which were $5.6 million.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:Robert Craig, the oldest living World War II veteran of the 101st Airborne in Arkansas and the third-oldest World War II veteran in the U.S., celebrated his 100th birthday on July 18 amid much fanfare at the Washington County Sheriff’s Office. Craig was a part of the fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, the last major German offensive on the Western front. For almost a week during the battle, German soldiers surrounded Craig’s division. The Americans received supplies from airdrops. Gen. George Patton eventually broke through and delivered food and medical supplies. “I’m rather proud of the service I rendered,” said Craig, who received seven bronze stars and a presidential citation for his service.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city’s newest bridge, a $588 million architectural marvel with views of the downtown skyline, opened to great fanfare on July 10 but has been closed several times since then amid chaos and collisions. The 6th Street Viaduct – which soars over the concrete-lined Los Angeles River to connect downtown to the historic Eastside – quickly became a hot spot for street racing, graffiti and illegal takeovers that draw hundreds of spectators to watch drivers perform dangerous stunts in their vehicles. The Los Angeles Police Department has closed the bridge multiple times – an exact count was not available Wednesday – and in the latest move, announced Tuesday that it would be “closed until further notice due to illegal activity and public safety concerns” before backtracking and reopening it hours later. Officials hope to install speed bumps, safety fences and cameras on the less than 3-week-old bridge to curtail the behavior. In the meantime, officers are impounding vehicles and issuing citations. The bridge spans 3,500 feet from the trendy Arts District to Boyle Heights, a traditionally working class Latino neighborhood, in the largest and most expensive bridge ever built in the city.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Conservation groups filed lawsuits against state environmental agencies in Colorado and Montana this week targeting coal mines in the states. Two groups sued Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality on Monday over an approved expansion of the Rosebud Mine, a coal strip mine near the Wyoming border. On Tuesday, five organizations including the WildEarth Guardians and the Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against Colorado environmental agencies alleging they failed to ensure the state’s largest coal mine, West Elk Mine, complied with state and federal clean air laws. The complaint filed in Gunnison County District Court contended that Colorado state officials failed to approve or deny an air pollution permit required by the U.S. government within the 18 months allotted by state law. The federal permit, granted by state agencies, would allow greater oversight over the mine’s compliance with clean air laws and regulations, ensuring that the company was sufficiently restricting methane emissions. If the state denied the permit application, the mine would have to halt operations. West Elk Mine sits in Colorado’s North Fork Valley and is owned by Arch Resources, a company based in St. Louis. The mine produced more than 4 million tons of coal in 2019, according to the Colorado Division of Reclamation, and emits greenhouse gases, including methane.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Former House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, who is running for a chance to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal in November, has come under fire from the conservative wing of the party for her stances, including accusations she’s not a true Republican. More of that criticism was lodged Tuesday night, when Klarides appeared in the first GOP Senate debate with her two conservative challengers in the upcoming Aug. 9 primary. Leora Levy of Greenwich and attorney Peter Lumaj of Fairfield both oppose abortion and further restrictions on gun owners. “There is a contrast here,” Levy said, when comparing herself to Klarides. “And I’m running in a Republican primary, not a Democrat primary. And her views on abortion are more suited to running in a Democrat primary, are more like Senator Blumenthal’s.” Lumaj, however, referred to himself as the only “unwavering conservative” among the three candidates, criticizing Levy for previously supporting abortion rights. He said Republicans in Connecticut have lost statewide races because they nominated candidates who “were afraid to be a Republican.” But Klarides stressed a candidate with such conservative positions won’t win in Connecticut, where the largest voting block is made up of unaffiliated voters, followed by Democrats and then Republicans. There’s also strong support in the state for abortion rights, a key issue in this year’s election after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:A catfish species that can grow up to 100 pounds and reach 4 feet in length is threatening a popular Delaware fishing hole and state environmental officials need anglers’ help to rid the waterway of the invasive fish. The culprit is the flathead catfish, a species native to the Mississippi and Ohio watersheds. It was recently found in Lums Pond near Glasgow, according to the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. Catfish species native to Delaware are scavengers and feed off the bottom of the water bodies in which they live. The flathead catfish eats other species, said Mike Steiger, a DNREC fisheries biologist. If the flathead catfish is left to feed on local species such as shad, crayfish or other pond fish, it could upset the local ecosystem and cause problems for other organisms in the area. “There’s probably not that many in the pond,” Steiger said. “Unchecked, they can definitely have a negative effect on native species.” Steiger is heading a project for the DNREC Division of Fish and Wildlife with the DNREC Division of Parks and Recreation aimed at removing the flathead catfish from Lums Pond. To capture the invasive species, the groups are using the technique of electro fishing, in which a specialized boat is used to deliver electroshocks in the water that temporarily stuns fish within a certain radius. This does not kill any of the fish but causes the affected fish to rise to the top of water, allowing them to be handled and captured more easily and with less stress for the fish. All flathead catfish that are found are then removed from Lums Pond. DNREC urges all who catch a flathead catfish to remove it from the water and report the incident.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Congressional leaders and Kansas officials praised aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart for advancing the cause of women’s rights during her barrier-breaking career at a ceremony unveiling her statue in the U.S. Capitol. Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, joins President Dwight Eisenhower as Kansas icons enshrined in the National Statuary Hall Collection. She is the 11th woman honored with a statue in the collection, where each state is represented by two people of significance. U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kan., said although Earhart is best known for flying across the ocean, she was also a military nurse, social worker, author and a champion for women’s advancement. “Female pilots used to be called ‘ladybirds,’ ‘sweethearts of the air,’ and because of Amelia Earhart, back then, now and into the future, women who fly planes are now called ‘pilots,’ ” Davids said. Earhart disappeared in July 1937 on a flight over the Pacific Ocean while trying to become the first pilot to circle the globe at the equator. No trace of her or her navigator, Fred Noonan, has ever been found, sparking numerous theories about what happened to them.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: A woman who left her newborn baby in a trash bin pleaded guilty to attempted murder and child abuse, agreeing to a seven-year prison sentence and potential deportation. Two maintenance workers at a Boca Raton apartment complex heard faint crying sounds coming from the bin and rescued Rafaelle Sousa’s 6-pound, 8-ounce baby. She was taken in by her boyfriend, who named her Sarah, the Palm Beach Post reported. Sousa’s attorney said the 38-year-old Brazilian woman didn’t know she was pregnant until she went into labor, and was in shock when the baby was born three years ago. Sousa, who was already caring for her 3-year-old son, had taken Tylenol and diet pills in the months before the birth to cope with pain and sudden weight gain, but wasn’t able to afford a doctor’s visit and did not know she was expecting another child, her attorney said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Democrat Stacey Abrams is promoting a plan she said will make housing more available and affordable across Georgia if she defeats Republican Gov. Brian Kemp this year. Abrams repeatedly criticized Kemp for Georgia’s sluggish use of its $989 million in federal rental assistance. Georgia still has almost half that money unused, Abrams said, although the state gave more of it to 12 large local governments that have been quicker to move the money out the door after the U.S. Treasury threatened to take some of it back. Tate Mitchell, a spokesperson for Kemp, said Abrams has Democrats to blame for making the cost of living more expensive. “In the last year alone, Gov. Kemp has allocated $100 million to support nonprofits that provide affordable housing and aid individuals experiencing homelessness,” Mitchell said in a statement. “If Stacey Abrams wants to blame anyone for economic instability, she should start with Joe Biden and her own party.” Abrams said she would seek to bolster Georgia’s weak tenant protections by requiring that leases guarantee the premises will be habitable and by providing a waiting period before a tenant could be evicted. She also would expand state assistance for down payments for first-time homebuyers, require that housing built using the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit serve some households with very low incomes and let local governments offer property tax breaks on affordable housing.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A U.S. defense contractor and his wife who lived for decades under the identities of two dead Texas children have been charged with identity theft and conspiring against the government, according to federal court records unsealed in Honolulu. Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison, both in their 60s, who allegedly lived for decades under the names Bobby Edward Fort and Julie Lyn Montague, were arrested Friday in Kapolei on the island of Oahu. Prosecutors are seeking to have the couple held without bail, which could indicate the case is about more than fraudulently obtaining drivers’ licenses, passports and Defense Department credentials. Those documents helped Primrose get secret security clearance with the U.S. Coast Guard and as a defense contractor and old photos showed the couple wearing uniforms of the KGB, the former Russian spy agency, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Muehleck said in court papers. Faded Polaroids of each in uniform were included in the motion to have them held. A “close associate” said Morrison lived in Romania while it was a Soviet bloc country, Muehleck said. Morrison’s attorney said her client never lived in Romania and that she and Primrose tried the same jacket on as a joke and posed for photos in it. Even if the couple used new identities, attorney Megan Kau told The Associated Press, they have lived law-abiding lives for three decades.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho has been selected as the site for a proposed nuclear test reactor that would dramatically reduce the time needed to develop nuclear fuels and components for a new generation of nuclear reactors that could help reduce global warming, the U.S. Department of Energy said. The Energy Department said it selected its 890-square-mile site in eastern Idaho that includes the Idaho National Laboratory to build the Versatile Test Reactor, or VTR. The VTR is a sodium-cooled fast test reactor that would be the first fast spectrum test reactor to operate in the United States in nearly three decades. The Energy Department has requested funding from Congress to move the VTR project into the design phase. The project includes facilities for examining material tested in the reactor, as well as managing spent fuel produced by the reactor. Scientists have said the test reactor could help lead to new nuclear reactors and reduce the use of fossil fuels blamed for global warming. The Energy Department is hoping to have the test reactor running by the end of 2026. Currently, such nuclear testing capacity only exists in Russia, the department said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, 77, of Illinois said he tested positive for the coronavirus and was in quarantine with what he described as minor symptoms. The No. 2 Senate Democrat, who said in a statement he was vaccinated and received two booster shots, planned to continue to work remotely. Durbin’s announcement occurred after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said last week he tested positive following travel to the White House, Maine and Florida. Earlier this week, Pritzker said on Twitter that he tested negative for the virus. On Wednesday, President Joe Biden ended his COVID-19 isolation, days after he also tested positive.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A federal judge has ordered Indianapolis Public Schools to allow a 10-year-old transgender girl to rejoin her school’s softball team while a lawsuit continues against a state law that bans transgender females from competing in girls school sports. U.S. District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson in Indianapolis issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday on behalf of the girl, finding she “has established that she has a strong likelihood of succeeding on the merits” of her claim. Indianapolis Public School told the girl’s mother earlier this year that her daughter would no longer be able to play on the softball team because of the new law, the judge added. The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana filed the lawsuit on behalf of the girl in hopes of blocking the law. The suit was filed in May, minutes after Republican state lawmakers voted to override Gov. Eric Holcomb’s veto of the legislation, and alleged that preventing the girl from rejoining her team because she is transgender is violation of Title IX and the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State officials are asking residents to keep an eye out for the spotted laternfly after recently confirming the finding of two of the invasive insects in central Iowa. As a young nymph, it is a black weevil-like bug with white spots but adds patches of bright red as it develops into a flying insect. It’s native to China, India and Vietnam, and was accidentally introduced into Pennsylvania in 2014, according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. It has since been confirmed in 11 states and threatens the country’s grape, orchard, nursery and logging industries. The state agricultural department was notified earlier this month of the presence of two immature spotted lanternflies in Dallas County, and federal identification confirmed them. Nearby areas surveyed have not resulted in signs of an ongoing infestation, the department said. Anyone spotting the insect is asked to contact the department’s Entomology and Plant Science Bureau.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:A Bali myna, one of the world’s rarest – and some say most beautiful – birds was hatched this month at the Topeka Zoo. The Asian songbird was born July 2, making it the third species of that bird at the zoo, said Joe Maloney, who works at the zoo with invertebrates. Bali mynas are among the most vocal birds in the zoo’s Tropical Rainforest, where their distinctive plumage and calls make them easily recognizable, Maloney said. The critically endangered The population of Bali mynas in the wild has been reduced by habitat loss and illegal trapping carried out to acquire them to be caged songbirds, said Taylor Miller, the Topeka Zoo’s communications coordinator. Females of the species tend to lay one to three eggs but usually only one will survive, Miller said. “They are cavity nesters, so the chick is currently located in a special box built by keepers,” she said. The box simulates a cavity nest but allows enough space for animal care staff to keep a close watch on them, Miller said. “The mom and dad are excellent parents and you can regularly catch glimpses of them carrying food to their nesting area,” said Wrylie Guffey, animal curator at the zoo. Bali mynas begin flying when they are 3-4 weeks old and become fully independent when they are 6-7 weeks old, Miller said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The University of Pikeville will receive a $4.4 million grant to support construction of an agritech research and education center. The UPIKE Ag-Tech Innovation Center of Excellence will be located at the Kentucky Enterprise Industrial Park at Marion Branch in Pikeville, state officials said. The project will be matched with $5.75 million in local funds. Gov. Andy Beshear announced the grant award Wednesday. The project aims to promote job growth by bringing innovative industry to the area while enhancing educational opportunities for UPIKE students, officials said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nChauvin: Authorities in south-central Louisiana are looking for those responsible for vandalizing the Chauvin Sculpture Garden, a local landmark created by a self-taught artist. Three concrete sculptures were broken, and one is missing, said Gary LaFleur, head of the Center for Bayou Studies at Nicholls State University. Vandals also damaged a sculpture of an angel that held an amber globe, similar to how the Statue of Liberty holds its torch. The garden owned by Nicholls State was created by self-taught artist Kenny Hill when he moved to Chauvin in 1988. A bricklayer by trade, Hill created more than 100 concrete statues along Bayou Little Caillou in Terrebonne Parish before walking away from his home about a decade later. He left no trace of his whereabouts, but about 10,000 visitors each year visit the menagerie of angels, Cajuns, self portraits and other figures he left behind.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Roman Catholic priest is returning to active ministry after an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse, the Diocese of Portland said. The diocese said its investigation into the Rev. Robert Vaillancourt took a year. The allegations concerned sexual abuse of girls in the 1980s. The diocese said in a statement the allegations were “determined to be unfounded.” It said Vaillancourt has not received a new assignment from the diocese yet. Vaillancourt was placed on administrative leave in July 2021 after the diocese received the first complaint. The diocese then received a second allegation from an attorney representing another woman. Vaillancourt denied any wrongdoing at the time of the accusations and the diocese said he cooperated with the investigation. He is a native of Lewiston who has served at parishes across the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nAssateague Island: More military ordnance has washed ashore at Assateague Island National Seashore, the Worcester County Fire Marshal’s Office reported. The fire marshal’s office, along with the U.S. Air Force 436th Civil Engineer Squadron-Emergency Ordnance Disposal team based out of Dover Air Force Base responded to Assateague shortly after 1 p.m. Tuesday for three suspected military ordnance that washed ashore in an area known as North Ocean Beach. It is the second incident of military ordnance washing ashore at Assateauge in as many weeks. National Park Service Rangers reported the suspicious devices. Ordnance disposal technicians determined the devices, which had been in the ocean for an unknown amount of time, needed to be rendered safe in place. From 1944 to 1947, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army Corps used the Maryland portion of Assateague Island as a bombing and strafing range. Air crews from Chincoteague, Virginia, and Manteo, North Carolina, would fire practice rockets, bombs and machine guns from the air at targets on the ground.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nFitchburg: A decorated State Police dog called “as loyal a partner as any Trooper ever had” by the agency’s commander was shot and killed by a man who had barricaded himself inside a home. Frankie, a nearly 11-year-old Belgian malinois with a tan coat and black snout, was shot Tuesday afternoon by a 38-year-old suspect, according to a statement from State Police Col. Christopher Mason. He was the first State Police dog to die in the line of duty, Mason said. Frankie’s handler, Sgt. David Stucenski, was not injured. Stucenski and Frankie won the state law enforcement Medal of Valor in 2017 for apprehending a suspect who opened fire on them, and also won three awards from the U.S. Police Canine Association in 2014. Police went to the multifamily Fitchburg home at about 9 a.m. Tuesday after learning the suspect, wanted on warrants charging him with firearms offenses, was there. Negotiators tried to get the suspect to surrender peacefully but he refused. Just before 3 p.m., he was spotted at a back door and officers decided to try and apprehend him. Stucenski and Frankie approached, but the suspect fired multiple shots before retreating back inside. He later apparently took his own life. Frankie was shot and taken to an animal hospital where he died, Mason said. Frankie’s body was escorted in a motorcade to the Final Gift Pet Memorial Center pet crematorium in Cranston, Rhode Island, as police officers and firefighters paid tribute on overpasses along the highway. A service to honor Frankie will be held, although a date hasn’t been set, state police said Wednesday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A man who admitted to calling in a bomb threat at the state Capitol was sentenced Wednesday to one year in jail, Attorney General Dana Nessel said. Michael Varrone, 49, of Charlotte pleaded guilty last month to false report or threat of bomb/harmful device. Prosecutors dismissed two terrorism charges against him. Judge James Jamo sentenced Varrone to one year in the Ingham County Jail with no possibility of early release and three years’ probation, Nessel said. Varrone must also undergo mental health treatment.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMoorhead: Workers at the largest sugar beet processor in the U.S. have rejected a contract offer that includes a 17% pay increase over four years. Union President John Riskey said the offer from American Crystal Sugar was recently rejected by an overwhelming margin, but he did not provide details on how many members voted or the margin of rejection. The Moorhead-based cooperative said it negotiated for 10 days with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ International Union. The company said in addition to the pay increase, the contract offered more vacation, increased pension benefits and a $1,000 ratification bonus if the new contract was approved by Sunday, when the current contract expires. Riskey said workers felt they deserved a bigger pay increase after helping the company weather the COVID-19 pandemic. Riskey said workers want contract talks to continue, Minnesota Public Radio reported. American Crystal said the new deadline for an agreement is Sept. 15. It agreed to continuing contract talks with a federal mediator.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a deadly bacteria has been found in environmental samples on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The discovery of the bacteria is the first in the U.S. According to a CDC release, a person on the coast was diagnosed with melioidosis in 2020, a rare disease caused by a bacteria known as Burkholderia pseudomallei. A second person living in close geographic proximity was diagnosed with the disease in 2022. The cases prompted state health officials and the CDC to take samples and test household products, soil and water in and around both patients’ homes, with permission. The bacteria was found in samples of soil and standing water. How long it has been on the coast and its spatial distribution isn’t known, but the CDC said conditions are conducive to its growth along all Gulf Coast states. The CDC said an average of 12 cases of the disease occur annually in the U.S., but according to state epidemiologist Paul Byers, most of those cases are the result of travel to countries where the bacteria have been known to occur. Melioidosis has a wide range of nonspecific symptoms such as fever, joint pain and headaches and can cause conditions that include pneumonia, abscess formation or blood infections. Worldwide, melioidosis is fatal in 10% to 50% of those infected, according to the CDC.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The city’s Department of Workforce Development has been awarded a $3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor that will run through 2026. The grant money will go toward bolstering registered apprenticeship programs during the ongoing labor shortage. The Department of Workforce Development was one of 30 organizations nationwide, and the only one in Missouri, to be awarded this grant funding, according to a news release.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:Montana posted 2,320 newly reported COVID-19 cases in the last week and the state’s total active confirmed reports stand at 2,199, with 109 active hospitalizations, according to the state website. Cascade County reported 192 new cases, bringing the actives cases to 205. One death has been reported, a male in his 80s, vaccinated but not boosted, with underlying health conditions. The community level in Cascade County has dropped from high to medium this week. Benefis Hospital reported 14 hospitalized by the virus.\n\nNebraska\n\nSpringfield: Meta, Facebook’s parent company, announced plans Thursday to expand a data center it is building in the Omaha suburbs. A Meta spokesperson said the social media giant now plans to build a ninth building in the complex it is constructing in Papillion and Springfield southwest of Omaha in Sarpy County. The company said the data center will cost more than $1.5 billion and eventually include 4 million square feet. Meta plans to complete the project it began in 2017 by the end of 2024. About 150 people are maintaining computers at the site that is expected to employ about 300. Six of the nine buildings are operational. Meta said all of the data center’s electricity will come from renewable energy, including wind farms in northeast Nebraska and Kansas. Several other major companies have built data centers in the area around the Meta data center, including Google, Yahoo, Travelers Insurance and Fidelity Investments.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Parents and students will again be faced with an alternating bus schedule when school starts on Aug. 15 as the Washoe County School District struggles with staffing shortages. Bus routes will be suspended for one week on a rotating basis in each of the district’s five service areas. The calendar for bus rotation schedules is available on the district’s website. Additional student transportation bus information will be available on Aug. 5. Students in remote areas will continue to have daily bus service, said Adam Searcy, chief facilities management officer, during a school board meeting Tuesday. Those neighborhoods are: Rancho Haven, Antelope Valley, Hungry Valley, Palomino Valley, Nixon, Wadsworth and Natchez. Buses designated for special education students will continue in full operation, as required by federal law. Searcy said additional neighborhoods will return to daily transportation as more bus drivers become available. Bus drivers will be sent to work in areas with the greatest need. Families will be given advance notice before returning to the daily transportation system. Searcy added he hopes the entire school district will return to a daily transportation system by fall break.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A woman has pleaded guilty to charges she sold unapproved drugs on her website that claimed to be remedies and treatments for COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Justice said. U.S. Attorney Jane E. Young said in a news release that Diana Daffin, 69, of Charlotte, North Carolina, pleaded guilty Wednesday to selling unapproved drugs with the intent to defraud or mislead the Food and Drug Administration. In February 2021, Daffin sold an undercover law enforcement officer a product advertised as a drug that could cure, mitigate, treat and prevent COVID-19 in humans. Daffin later sold and shipped that drug and other unapproved drugs to the undercover agent, according to prosecutors. Daffin is scheduled for sentencing on Nov. 2.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Officials from the Golden Nugget will negotiate Thursday with Atlantic City’s main casino workers union on a new contract that would guarantee the seaside gambling resort labor peace for four years. The Golden Nugget is the only one of Atlantic City’s nine casinos without a new deal with Local 54 of the Unite Here union. The sides were expected to negotiate Thursday morning, and the likelihood of a deal appears high given the fact that the rest of the city’s casinos have agreed to new pacts. Thursday’s session followed the successful completion of negotiations Wednesday with Resorts casino on a new contract that contains the same economic elements as those reached with other casinos. Housekeeping employees will see their pay increase to $22 an hour at the end of the four-year contract. In addition to raises, the agreements maintain fully funded family health care and pension benefits, language that protects jobs and increases work opportunities, and new technology protections, the union said. The union has authorized a strike on Saturday if a new contract is not reached with Golden Nugget.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Vegas: Authorities have identified the bodies of three people who died in fast-moving floodwaters in Tecolote Canyon in northern New Mexico. San Miguel County sheriff’s officials said the victims were members of a West Texas family and were swept away last week during monsoon rains in mountainous terrain scorched by a 533-square mile wildfire. They said the three from Hale County were identified as 62-year-old Jimmy Chris Cummings, his 62-year-old wife Linda Jane Cummings and her 84-year-old mother Betty Greenhaw. Authorities said the women’s bodies were discovered in Tecolote Creek floodwaters July 22 near their truck, which also had been swept from the cabin the family owned. The body of Jimmy Cummings was found Tuesday within debris left by the flood in the creek, according to sheriff’s officials. The cabin the family owned in Tecolote Canyon on Camp Blue Haven property for more than 60 years was destroyed by the floodwaters.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: New York is inching toward becoming the first U.S. city to charge motorists an extra fee for entering its most congested areas. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said a long-delayed environmental assessment should be released by federal regulators next month, to be followed by public hearings. The MTA also named the members of a board that will decide the plan’s pricing, discounts and exemptions. The practice is commonly referred to as congestion pricing and has been used in cities including London, Singapore and Stockholm. In New York, motorists entering Manhattan below 60th Street would be charged a toll electronically. The revenue, estimated at $1 billion annually, would be used to back borrowing for capital improvements to the MTA’s subway and bus systems. The tolls aren’t expected to be implemented until late next year at the earliest. Some lawmakers in New Jersey have said the plan is unfair because motorists already pay tolls at bridges and tunnels to enter New York, and the money from congestion pricing won’t be used to improve public transit in New Jersey. Some motorists paying tolls to enter Manhattan from New Jersey are expected to receive discounts or be exempt.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Tens of thousands of people convicted of felonies but who aren’t behind bars can now register to vote and cast ballots following an appeals court ruling. Expanding the scope of those able to register and vote began Wednesday, the State Board of Elections said – the day after local elections were held in more than a dozen localities. The change proceeds from litigation challenging a 1973 law that prevents someone convicted of a felony from having voting rights restored while they are still on probation, parole or post-release supervision. A panel of trial judges struck down the law in March, declaring it violates the state constitution largely because it discriminates against Black residents. The state Supreme Court agreed in May to hear an appeal of that decision, and the case remains pending. But the justices didn’t touch a Court of Appeals ruling that prevented registration requests from the felons who weren’t in prison or jail from being fulfilled only through Tuesday. So these applicants – for now and unless the Supreme Court reverses the trial court ruling – will be able to vote, starting with the November general election.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A judge put on hold the state’s trigger law banning abortion while a lawsuit moves forward that argues it violates the state constitution, ruling the attorney general had prematurely calculated the date when the ban should take effect. Burleigh County District Judge Bruce Romanick sided with the state’s only abortion clinic, the Red River Women’s Clinic in Fargo, that Attorney General Drew Wrigley “prematurely attempted to execute” the trigger language. The clinic had argued that a 30-day clock should not have started until the U.S. Supreme Court issued its certified judgment on Tuesday. The ban had been set to take effect on Thursday. Shortly after the ruling, Wrigley said he was heading to the North Dakota Legislative Council’s office to drop off another certification of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that reversed Roe vs. Wade. He did not comment about the judge’s order. North Dakota’s law would make abortion illegal in the state except in cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A man accused of raping and impregnating a 10-year-old Ohio girl who traveled to Indiana for an abortion was ordered held without bond Thursday by a judge who cited overwhelming evidence and the fact he apparently is living in the U.S. illegally. Gerson Fuentes, 27, faces two counts of raping the girl, who turned 10 before having the abortion in a case that has become a flashpoint in the national discussion about access to the procedure since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. He has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, Fuentes, who is from Guatemala, faces the possibility of life in prison with no chance of parole. That penalty and “not having any ties to this community that can be proved legally makes it a substantial flight risk,” Franklin County Judge Julie Lynch said after a 35-minute hearing. The girl confirmed that Fuentes attacked her, Fuentes confessed to Columbus police detectives and DNA testing of the aborted fetus confirmed Fuentes was the father, Franklin County Prosecutor Dan Meyer and Detective Jeffrey Huhn said in court Thursday. Huhn said he was unable, when searching multiple databases, to find any evidence that Fuentes was in the country legally. Fuentes’ attorney, Bryan Bowen, argued against a no-bond hearing and unsuccessfully asked Lynch to set a reasonable bond. He said there was no evidence of physical abuse outside of the rapes or that the girl had been put under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He also said Fuentes had family ties in Columbus, that he had a job, and that there was no evidence of a criminal history. Fuentes has lived in the area about seven years.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The second half of Scissortail Park will open Sept. 23, with events running that weekend from Friday night to Sunday night. The park will be the relaxed counterpart to the more heavily programmed upper portion, and at the same time be a place for children to play soccer, basketball, futsal and pickleball. MAPS 4 Program Manager David Todd said construction crews just have “finishing touches” left before the park is ready for its first visitors. The upper and lower portions of the park were funded by the voter-approved MAPS 3 penny sales tax, which ran from April 2010 to December 2017. The price tag for the park’s lower portion is now $24.5 million, a 9.5% increase over the original $22.2 million budget. The increase was paid for through higher-than-expected sales tax collections. The park project broke ground in November 2020.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A new audit from the Secretary of State has found Oregon’s unemployment insurance system experienced many problems during the pandemic, delaying payments to thousands of workers who lost jobs. The audit highlights known issues including the Employment Department’s antiquated and inflexible computer system and frequent turnover in its executive ranks. Previous audits warned that the agency’s mainframe system, dating to the 1990s, was too rigid to handle complicated claims or rule changes, and relied too much on manual processes, leading to errors. A 2015 audit recommended the system be replaced – a process that is only now underway.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Four Pennsylvania universities said they will follow through with tuition increases despite calls from state House Republicans to roll back the price hikes. The lawmakers, including Sen. Doug Mastriano, R-Franklin, the GOP nominee for governor, argued Penn State, the University of Pittsburgh, Lincoln and Temple are receiving federal funds and do not need to increase tuition. The universities did not receive a bump in funding in this year’s state budget. Instead, through one-time federal funds, the universities will split about $30 million on top of budget funding. At Penn State, in-state undergraduate students will see tuition increase by 5% at the University Park campus and 2% at the Commonwealth Campuses. Nonresidents will see a 6% tuition increase at University Park and a 3% increase at the Commonwealth campuses. A 5% increase will be instituted for Penn State World Campus undergraduates. Most in-state students paying full tuition at Pitts’ campus will see their tuition rate rise by 3.5%. Regional campus tuition rates will rise by 2%. Temple students will see a 3.9% increase for 2022–2023 undergraduate and graduate base tuition for in-state and out-of-state students. Lincoln’s tuition will increased by less than 1% for the incoming class, according to figures on its website. A university spokesperson didn’t immediately confirm the increase amount.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket:As primary elections near, the city agreed to halt the enforcement of an ordinance restricting the placement of political signs in yards more than 30 days before an election as the parties work out a resolution in the case. The city reached a consent agreement with the state affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union before a court hearing Thursday not to enforce limitations on timing, lighting and size of political yard signs. Under the agreement, the city will not enforce, nor threaten to enforce, “any size, placement, and/or illumination restrictions on political campaign signs, including but not limited to candidate campaign signs or issue signs, that are more stringent than those imposed on nonpolitical signs.” The ordinance had also specified that signs could not be illuminated or exceed 12 square feet. The ACLU sued the city Tuesday on behalf of two Democratic candidates for state legislature – Jennifer Stewart and Cherie Cruz – arguing the ordinance banning the posting of political yard signs more than 30 days before an election was unconstitutional and should be struck down.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Turning around the state’s chronically dangerous juvenile prisons is now the job of Eden Hendrick, a prosecutor who sent some of those children to jail. Hendrick is leading the state Department of Juvenile Justice after two of her predecessors resigned following state audits that found major faults, from a “useless and ineffective” in-house police force to an inability to keep children safe. “We’ve been fighting this battle for a long time,” Hendrick said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I’m very hopeful that now that it’s actually getting some traction, and that we’ll be able to actually start to provide these youths the real services that they need.” Hendrick was confirmed in May shortly before the agency agreed to sweeping reforms at the main juvenile prison. Fixes included installing a modern surveillance system, revising use of force rules, reducing solitary confinement and making sure children get physical and recreational activity. Hendrick, who took over as interim director in September, is asking for time, to change the prisons and the culture of an agency whose employees often feel forgotten and unappreciated.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: The proposed budget for the Aberdeen School District is up 3.3% from a year ago, and COVID-19 grant funding is a major reason why. That money will allow for the construction of a greenhouse and new classrooms at the A-TEC Academy on the Central High School campus. Finance Director Tom Janish presented the proposed budget for 2022-23 to the Aberdeen School Board during this week’s meeting. The board heard about the preliminary budget in May. The final budget has to be approved at the end of September. Until then, the school board can make adjustments. For the 2022-23 school year, the overall budget is projected at $59.38 million, with about $10 million going toward the the capital outlay fund and special education fund. Another $33.5 million is for the general fund, with the remaining dollars going toward debt service, food service and other areas. Overall, the general fund will see a 3.3% increase. The state's contribution to the general fund is going up about 6% to $18.77 million. That's about 56% of total general fund revenue, Janish said. Most of the rest of the money will come from property taxes.\n\nTennessee\n\nCharleston: A German chemical company plans to add 200 jobs through an expansion at its Tennessee campus. The state Department of Economic and Community Development said Wacker has begun a feasibility study to add new silicone production facilities in Charleston. A $200 million investment there would be phased over several years. The company employs 700 people at the site. The first phase of the expansion would add plants to produce high-consistency silicone rubber and silicone sealants. In 2015, Wacker began producing hyper-pure polysilicon for semi-conductor and high-efficiency solar cells. In 2019, Wacker added production of pyrogenic silica. With the new announcement, the company will have invested nearly $3 billion at the site.\n\nTexas\n\nGlen Rose: A wildfire that blackened 101/ 2 square miles of north Texas, destroying 16 homes, reached 40% containment Wednesday, double what it had been the day before, officials said. The multiagency firefighting team fighting the Chalk Mountain Fire 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth said it had completed a fire line around the blaze Wednesday. However, the lines are sufficient only to be impervious to further spreading in 40% of the fire zone, primarily its southern reaches. In a statement, team officials said work continues to improve the lines around the rest of the zone while also attacking stubborn hot spots within the zone’s interior. No injuries have been reported.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:A stormy day of rain helped firefighters battling the Dodge Springs Fire near the Utah-Nevada border on Monday, but the fire was still just 10% contained and threatened to flare back up if winds and hotter temperatures persisted, officials said. The fire, which was burning in Washington County about 25 miles northwest of St. George, began July 22, sparked by a lightning strike. It was burning through pinyon pines and juniper trees in rough terrain that was difficult for firefighters to access but remote enough that there had been no evacuations or road closures.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:LandAir, the trucking firm with facilities in Williston and Windsor that closed unexpectedly earlier this month, has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, meaning it will not be reorganized but will be liquidated. The company has about $3 million in assets and about $43 million in debts, according to documents filed in federal bankruptcy court in Massachusetts, where LandAir is based. Only two creditors have secured claims – Banc of California for $5 million and Corbel Capital Partners, the Los Angeles-based private investment firm that owned the company, for nearly $34 million. There are hundreds of unsecured creditors across the country, which include many Vermont companies. In addition, brothers Thomas and William Spencer, whose father Fred founded what would become LandAir in Burlington in 1968 as Allied Air Freight, are owed $137,500 each as the result of a lawsuit. The brothers’ attorney declined to comment.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: The Chincoteague Pony Swim returned Wednesday morning for the first time since the pandemic. The move of the ponies across the Assateague Channel is a 97-year tradition attended by enthusiastic spectators, many of whom arrived hours early to claim the best spots. Shortly after 9 a.m., a red-orange flare shot up from a Coast Guard boat, signaling to the group of horseback riders known as the Saltwater Cowboys that it was time to bring the ponies across the channel. The ponies didn’t want to be hurried, though, and paused to nibble on grass in the shallow water at the start of their journey. The ponies were submerged up to their necks, water churning as they made their way across the channel. It was over in 41/ 2 minutes. The swim raises money to buy equipment for the fire department, pays the roughly $45,000 yearly vet bill for the ponies and funds eight scholarships for Chincoteague high schoolers, said Denise Bowden, a spokeswoman for the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. After the swim, about 65 foals were auctioned. It’s important to reduce the population of the horses because the fire department has an agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to keep only 150 ponies on Assateague, Bowden said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: People in the state’s most populous county should soon be able to drop off unwanted guns and ammunition at any sheriff’s office or storefront location, assured of its safe disposal. The Metropolitan King County Council unanimously approved legislation Tuesday to create a permanent program within its Sheriff’s Office that allows people to voluntarily return firearms and ammunition, The Seattle Times reported. The legislation asks the county executive to evaluate the feasibility of allowing drop offs and allowing people to request a sheriff’s deputy to pick up an unwanted firearm. People also could drop off guns at locations in the 10 contract cities where the county sheriff provides police services. And the legislation asks the sheriff to look for partnerships with other cities to expand access for people looking to turn over guns or ammunition. During a 2013 gun buyback program coordinated by King County and the city of Seattle, 716 firearms were surrendered to law enforcement in exchange for gift cards.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The deadline to apply for the school clothing allowance has been extended because of a system outage that is affecting multiple state agencies, the Department of Health and Human Resources said. Children who are eligible will receive a $200 benefit each to buy school clothing or piece goods to sew clothing. Families can apply online at wvpath.org, and applications are due by 5 p.m. Aug. 12. Local DHHR offices can supply paper applications, which must be postmarked by Aug. 12. Automatic benefits will go to families with school-age children by the end of June who receive WV WORKS cash assistance; parents or guardians of children in foster care; and children ages 4 to 18 who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, are enrolled in school and whose household income is under 130% of the federal poverty level.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A conservative law firm is pushing back against a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that transparency advocates said has damaged the state’s open records law by limiting when people who sue over records requests can recover attorney’s fees. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty on Thursday called for the Republican-controlled Legislature to strengthen open records laws in response to a 4-3 ruling earlier this month by the conservative-controlled Supreme Court that found that if an entity decides to release records after being sued, the requester can be awarded attorney’s fees only if a court issues a ruling, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. In a policy brief, WILL urged the Legislature to amend state law to ensure that requesters will be able to recover attorney’s fees if they prevail in open records lawsuits. The brief offered multiple suggestions for how to amend the law.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: An accident involving the aerial tram at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort on Saturday left a contractor severely injured, the Casper Star Tribune reported.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}]}

According the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 18.0% of American adults regularly consume unhealthy amounts of alcohol. In some American cities, excessive drinking rates are higher.\n\nExcessive drinking, according to the CDC, includes binge drinking — which is defined as four or more drinks on a single occasion for women and five or more for men — and heavy drinking, or eight or more drinks per week for women and 15 or more for men.\n\nIn the short term, excessive drinking can increase the likelihood of violence, risky sexual behavior, alcohol poisoning and injuries. The potential long term effects of excessive alcohol consumption include depression, anxiety, alcohol dependence and social problems. Long-term excessive drinking can also lead to chronic diseases, including certain cancers, liver disease and heart disease.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed the adult excessive drinking rate in 381 U.S. metro areas to identify the 20 drunkest (and 20 driest) cities. The cities with the highest excessive drinking rates are concentrated in the Midwest, while those with the lowest rates are mostly in southern states.\n\nThe drunkest cities in America\n\n20.

Across Wisconsin, 26.2% of adults drink excessively, the largest share of any U.S. state.

Some 32.6% of Ames residents are enrolled in college, more than four times the national average. The fall 2017 enrollment for Iowa State University in Ames was over 36,000.\n\nSome 22.7% of adults in the city report drinking excessively in the last month. A high excessive drinking rate does not necessarily mean drunk driving is also common. There were 3.6 alcohol related driving deaths for every 100,000 driving age residents in Ames between 2011 and 2015, the lowest rate of any metro area in the country.\n\nMore: Which state's residents drink the most beer?

A National Institutes of Health study found that 60% of college students report drinking at least once in the last month, and 40% of students report binge drinking.\n\nLincoln is the only metro area in Nebraska on this list, even though adults in the state are some of the most likely to drink excessively. Some 21.1% of adults in Nebraska reported drinking to excess, the fifth highest rate among states.\n\n16. Watertown-Fort Drum, N.Y.\n\nPct. adults drinking to excess: 22.9%\n\n22.9% Pct. driving deaths involving alcohol: 32.8%\n\n32.8% Est. number of restaurants and bars: 270 (236.8 per 100,000)\n\n270 (236.8 per 100,000) Median household income: $45,624\n\nNew York state’s 18.8% excessive drinking rate is similar to the nationwide excessive drinking rate of 18.0%. New York is one the most populous states in the country, and not all communities report similar alcohol consumption habits. In the Watertown-Fort Drum metro area, 22.9% of adults either binge or heavily drink, a larger share than in any of the state’s 11 other metro areas and the 16th largest rate of any metro area in the country.\n\nMetro areas with high excessive drinking rates are often wealthier than areas with healthier drinking habits. Watertown-Fort Drum is an exception. The typical area household earns $45,624 a year, the lowest median income of any metro area in the state and well below the U.S. annual median of $57,617.\n\n15.

The area's poverty rate of just 5.4% is the lowest in the nation by more than a full percentage point and well below the 14.0% national poverty rate.\n\nWisconsin is the heaviest drinking state in the country and Sheboygan is one of 10 metro areas in the state to rank among the heaviest drinking in the country. Some 23.0% of adults in the Sheboygan metro area drink excessively.\n\nMore: Which beer is loved most by consumers? 26 most popular U.S. beer brands\n\n14.

Some 23.0% of adults in the Dubuque metro area drink excessively, compared to 22.1% of adults across the state and 18.0% of adults nationwide.\n\nExcessive drinking is a risky behavior, and getting behind the wheel after drinking also endangers the lives of others. In Dubuque, a larger than typical 40% share of driving deaths involve alcohol. Nationwide, 30% of driving deaths involve alcohol.\n\n13. Iowa City, Iowa\n\nPct. adults drinking to excess: 23.1%\n\n23.1% Pct. driving deaths involving alcohol: 17.7%\n\n17.7% Est. number of restaurants and bars: 387 (229.2 per 100,000)\n\n387 (229.2 per 100,000) Median household income: $57,777\n\nLike many college towns, the Iowa City metro area boasts a high concentration of bars and restaurants. There are an estimated 387 places to drink in the area, or about 229 per 100,000 people. That is well above the national average concentration of 184 places to drink per 100,000 people.\n\nThe high concentration of drinking venues may be partially explained by demand. In Iowa City, 23.1% of adults report drinking excessively, a larger share than in all but a dozen other U.S. metro areas and slightly higher than the statewide excessive drinking rate of 22.1%.\n\n12. Fond du Lac, Wis.\n\nPct. adults drinking to excess: 23.5%\n\n23.5% Pct. driving deaths involving alcohol: 27.0%\n\n27.0% Est. number of restaurants and bars: 188 (184.1 per 100,000)\n\n188 (184.1 per 100,000) Median household income: $58,310\n\nFond du Lac is one of 10 Wisconsin metro areas to appear on this list. Though 23.5% of adults in the metro area drink excessively, they are actually less likely than the average Wisconsin adult to drink excessively. In Wisconsin, 26.2% of adults drink excessively -- the highest rate of any state and well above the 18.0% national average.\n\nExcessive drinking is never healthy. Still, alcohol consumption is just one of a multitude of factors that can affect health outcomes across a population. Despite the metro area’s relatively high excessive drinking rate, just 13.8% of adults in Fond du Lac are in fair or poor health, well below the 16.0% of adults nationwide.\n\n11.

Some 23.6% of adults in Mankato-North Mankato drink excessively, a larger share than the 22.9% of adults across the state and the 22.3% of adults who drink excessively in Duluth, the second heaviest drinking metro area in Minnesota.\n\nWhile excessive drinking is relatively common in the metro area, drunk driving does not appear to be. From 2011 to 2015, there were 50 driving deaths in the Mankato-North Mankato metro area, only nine of which involved alcohol. The area’s rate of 10.9 alcohol involved driving deaths per 100,000 driving age residents is one of the lowest rates in the nation.\n\nMore: Home buyers beware: Most expensive housing markets in some states average $750,000-plus\n\n10.

The are 313 drinking venues in the area of just under 137,000 people, which amounts to about 229 bars and restaurants per 100,000 people. Nationwide, there are just 184 bars and restaurants for every 100,000 people.\n\nSerious car accidents can be the result of a number of factors and conditions and a high excessive drinking rate does not necessarily mean metro area residents are more likely to drive under the influence. In La Crosse, driving deaths are actually less likely to involve alcohol than is typical nationwide. Alcohol is a factor in 26.4% of fatal auto accidents in the metro area compared to 30.0% nationwide.\n\n9. Wausau, Wis.\n\nPct. adults drinking to excess: 24.2%\n\n24.2% Pct. driving deaths involving alcohol: 28.9%\n\n28.9% Est. number of restaurants and bars: 253 (186.6 per 100,000)\n\n253 (186.6 per 100,000) Median household income: $54,774\n\nOf the 10 metro areas with the highest excessive drinking rates, seven are in Wisconsin. The central Wisconsin metro area of Wausau is one of them. Some 24.2% of adults in the Wausau metro area drink excessively compared to 18.0% of American adults.\n\nThough many Wisconsin metro areas are among those with the highest excessive drinking rates nationwide, the statewide excessive drinking rate of 26.2% is even higher than in most of its metro areas. Of the dozen metro areas in the state, Green Bay is the only one reporting a higher excessive drinking rate than the statewide rate. This means that excessive drinking is even more common outside of the state’s urban areas.\n\n8. Grand Forks, N.D.-Minn.\n\nPct. adults drinking to excess: 24.2%\n\n24.2% Pct. driving deaths involving alcohol: 34.0%\n\n34.0% Est. number of restaurants and bars: 206 (200.5 per 100,000)\n\n206 (200.5 per 100,000) Median household income: $48,671\n\nBecause drinking alcohol can be expensive, places with high excessive drinking rates also often have high median incomes. But not in Grand Forks, N.D. The area’s median household income of $48,671 a year is well below the national median of $57,617.\n\nThe high excessive drinking rate may be at least partially explained by the presence of University of North Dakota. According to studies, university students tend to binge drink at far higher rates than other age groups. Grand Forks is one of several college towns to rank among the heaviest drinking metro areas.\n\n7. Missoula, Mont.\n\nPct. adults drinking to excess: 24.3%\n\n24.3% Pct. driving deaths involving alcohol: 44.4%\n\n44.4% Est. number of restaurants and bars: 285 (245.4 per 100,000)\n\n285 (245.4 per 100,000) Median household income: $46,550\n\nMissoula is the only metro area in Montana with a near nation-leading excessive drinking rate. Some 24.3% of metro area adults drink excessively. This may be at least in part due to the fact that Missoula is home to the University of Montana and college students are among the most likely groups to drink to excess. The metro area in Montana with the second-highest excessive drinking rate is Billings, where 22.0% of adults report drinking excessively.\n\nOther than the greater tendency to drink excessively, adults in Missoula tend to make healthy lifestyle choices. A relatively low percentage are overweight, and a far greater than typical share get at least some exercise.\n\nMore: Is your city's population keeping pace?

However, not all unhealthy behaviors are widespread in Oshkosh-Neenah. For example, just 16.4% of metro area adults smoke, below both the state smoking rate of 17.1% and the nationwide rate of 17.0%.\n\nWisconsin has the highest excessive drinking rate of any state in the country. Oshkosh-Neenah has the sixth highest excessive drinking rate in the country and the fifth highest in Wisconsin.\n\n5.

Still, excessive drinking is more common across North Dakota as a whole than in Fargo. At 25.9%, North Dakota's excessive drinking rate is the second highest of all states, trailing only Wisconsin.\n\nDriving is dangerous and serious car accidents can be the result of any number of factors. In Fargo, drunk driving is a common culprit. Some 38.0% of driving deaths in the metro area involve alcohol, more than the comparable 30.0% share nationwide.\n\n4.

Some 25.9% of adults in the metro area report drinking excessively compared to 18.0% of adults nationwide. There are about 226 bars and restaurants for every 100,000 Madison metro area residents. Nationwide, there are 184 drinking establishments per 100,000 people.\n\nNearly 44,000 students attend the University of Wisconsin in Madison. College students often report high levels of binge drinking, likely contributing to the city's overall excessive drinking rate.\n\n3.

The median household income in Appleton is $63,902 a year, more than 10% higher than the national median household income. Appleton, Wisconsin is one of only five metro areas nationwide where more than one in every four adults drink excessively.\n\nIn Appleton, there is no shortage of options when it comes to drinking venues. There are 213 restaurants and bars for every 100,000 metro area residents, compared to the 184 per 100,000 national concentration.\n\nMore: Best-selling 2017 models: 15 cars so hot they’re sometimes out of stock\n\n2.

It is easier to find a place to drink in Eau Claire, Wis., than in much of the rest of the country. There are 232 bars and restaurants for every 100,000 residents, compared to the 184 per 100,000 concentration nationwide.\n\nDriving is dangerous and deadly accidents can be the result of any number of factors and circumstances. But in Eau Claire, alcohol is a common culprit. Alcohol was involved in 38.9% of deadly car accidents, one of the highest percentages of any metro area and significantly higher than the 30.0% national average.\n\n1.

Some 26.5% of adults in Green Bay drink excessively, making it the only metro area in Wisconsin with a higher excessive drinking rate than the statewide average of 26.2%. For comparison, 18.0% of American adults drink excessively.\n\nA high excessive drinking rate does not necessarily increase the likelihood of alcohol-related car accidents. However, the Green Bay metro area is one of only five nationwide where alcohol was a factor in over half of all driving deaths.\n\nThe driest cities in America\n\n20.

Some 13.0% of adults in the metro area report excessive drinking, or 5.0 percentage points lower than the national excessive drinking rate of 18.0%.\n\nCollege students ages 18-22 are more likely than the adult population as a whole to binge drink. Typically, metro areas with large colleges tend to have high excessive drinking rates, and areas with few college students tend to have low excessive drinking rates. Just 4.3% of the population in the Dothan metro area is enrolled in graduate or undergraduate classes, one of the lower rates in the country.\n\n19.

While excessive drinking is not especially common in the metro area, other unhealthy behaviors are. About one in every five adults in Rocky Mount smoke, compared to the 17.9% state and 17.0% U.S. smoking rates. Metro area adults are also less likely to exercise than those across the state and nation as a whole.\n\n18.

In Ogden-Clearfield, Utah, drunk driving is rarely the culprit. Just 13.9% of driving deaths in the metro area involved alcohol, which was one of the lowest rates in the country and less than half the nationwide rate of 30.0%.\n\nAlcohol is expensive and most of the cities with the lowest excessive drinking rates are relatively low-income. One of the most affluent metro areas in the country, Ogden-Clearfield, Utah is an exception. The metro area’s $70,227 median household income is about $12,600 higher than the national median. The area’s low excessive drinking rate is likely because the majority of residents in Utah are Mormons, and the Mormon church teaches its members to abstain from alcohol.\n\nMore: Thinking about where to retire?

In comparison, 18.0% of American adults and 15.9% of adults across Arkansas drink excessively.\n\nLike many metro areas with lower than average excessive drinking rates, Fort Smith is relatively poor. The typical metro area household earns just $40,970 a year, below both the median income across the state of $44,334 a year and the national median of $57,617 a year. Alcohol can be expensive, and many low-income households spend their money elsewhere.\n\n16.

Some 12.8% of adults in McAllen drink to excess, compared to 19.4% of adults across the state.\n\nThe median annual household income in the southern Texas metropolitan area is $36,176, which is more than $20,000 below the national median and the second lowest median income of any U.S. metro area. The relatively small share of residents with disposable income may partially explain why the McAllen area has just 110 bars and restaurants per 100,000 people, one of the lowest concentrations in the country.\n\n15.

Additionally, a relatively small portion of fatal auto accidents in the area are attributed to drunk driving. Of the fatal auto accidents in the metro area, fewer than one in five involved alcohol. This is well below the 30.0% of driving deaths nationwide.\n\nCollege students age 18 to 22 are more likely than the typical adult to binge drink, increasing the excessive drinking rate in places where many of them live. In the Bristol area, just 4.4% of residents are enrolled in college, below the 7.0% national average.\n\n14.

College towns frequently report higher than average excessive drinking rates, but not Knoxville. Just 12.3% of area adults drink excessively, compared to the 18.0% of American adults who do.\n\nSince the number of students at the school represents a small fraction of the Knoxville area’s 869,076 residents, students at the University of Tennessee do not drastically increase the excessive drinking rate for the area. In fact, only 6.4% of Knoxville area residents are enrolled in either undergraduate classes or graduate school. That is slightly below the national rate of college enrollment of 7.0%.\n\n11.

Some 12.2% of Cleveland area adults drink excessively, below the statewide excessive drinking rate of 14.4%.\n\nThough relatively few adults in the metropolitan area drink excessively, the area has a high rate of alcohol-related fatal auto accidents. Alcohol played a role in 41.0% of automotive fatalities in the area from 2011 to 2015, compared to 30.0% of driving deaths nationwide during the same time.\n\nMore: The most religious counties of every state in the U.S.\n\n9.

This is the case in Pine Bluff, one of the poorest places in America. The median household income in the metro area of $37,076 a year is more than $20,000 below the national median household income. Only a handful of other U.S. metro areas have a lower median household income. Some 21.8% of Pine Bluff residents live in poverty compared to 14.0% of people nationwide and 17.2% of Arkansas residents.\n\n8.

Some 12.2% of area adults report excessive drinking. Though it is the eighth lowest rate among U.S. metro areas, it is above the West Virginia excessive drinking rate of 11.8%, the lowest of all states.\n\nDespite the low excessive drinking rate, there are many places in the Parkersburg-Vienna area to buy alcohol. There are 214 bars and restaurants per 100,000 people for residents to buy alcohol, greater than the national concentration of 184 bars and restaurants per 100,000 people.\n\n7.

The state of Tennessee has some of the more restrictive liquor laws in the country. It is illegal to sell wine in the state on Sundays, and grocery stores only recently gained the ability to sell wine at all.\n\nThose restrictive alcohol sales laws may be one of the reasons why Tennessee’s metro areas are some of the driest in the country. Of the 20 cities with the lowest excessive drinking rates, six are in the Volunteer State.\n\n6.

Today, a strong majority of city residents identify as Mormon, a religion that teaches its followers to avoid alcohol consumption. Partially as a result, Logan has one of the lowest excessive drinking rates in the United States. Just 11.6% of adults in the metro area either binge or heavily drink, below the 13.4% statewide excessive drinking rate and the 18.0% nationwide rate.\n\nResidents’ drinking habits are reflected in the number of drinking establishments in the metro area. There are only 123 bars and restaurants for every 100,000 Logan residents, one of the smallest ratios of any U.S. metro area.\n\nMore: Economic inequality: The worst states for Hispanics and Latinos\n\n5.

Charleston is one of four metro areas in West Virginia to rank among the cities with smallest shares of adults who either binge drink or drink heavily. Just 11.1% of adults in Charleston drink excessively, the fifth smallest share of any U.S. metro area and second lowest in the state.\n\nAreas with low excessive drinking rates are often relatively poor, and Charleston is no exception. The typical Charleston household earns just $41,689 a year, below both the statewide median income of $43,385 and the nationwide median of $57,617.\n\n4. Jackson, Tenn.\n\nPct. adults drinking to excess: 10.9%\n\n10.9% Pct. driving deaths involving alcohol: 30.7%\n\n30.7% Est. number of restaurants and bars: 217 (167.5 per 100,000)\n\n217 (167.5 per 100,000) Median household income: $42,373\n\nSome 10.9% of adults in Jackson, Tenn., drink excessively, well below the statewide excessive drinking rate of 14.4% and the nationwide rate of 18.0%. Drinking is income dependent as people with lower incomes may avoid spending money on alcohol. The Jackson area’s median household income of $42,373 is more than $15,000 below the national median and $6,000 under the state median.\n\n3. Beckley, W.Va.\n\nPct. adults drinking to excess: 10.8%\n\n10.8% Pct. driving deaths involving alcohol: 27.9%\n\n27.9% Est. number of restaurants and bars: 179 (148.0 per 100,000)\n\n179 (148.0 per 100,000) Median household income: $44,178\n\nIn the Beckley, W.Va., metro area, just 10.8% of adults drink excessively. This percentage is well below the 18.0% of adults nationwide who reported either binge drinking or heavy drinking. The Beckley area also falls a full percentage point below West Virginia’s state excessive drinking rate of 11.8%.\n\nEven though very few Beckley, West Virginia, adults drink excessively, many area residents report other vices. Some 24.3% of the metro area’s adults smoke tobacco, the highest smoking rate of any metro area in the country.\n\n2.

Metro area residents abstain from other unhealthy vices as well. Just 7.7% of St. George area adults smoke, the second-lowest smoking rate in the nation and less than half the national smoking rate of 17.0%.\n\nAs is the case in much of Utah, abstention from unhealthy behavior is closely tied to residents’ religious beliefs. The majority of Utah residents are Mormon, a religion that discourages consumption of alcohol and tobacco.\n\nMore: Most livable: America’s 50 best cities to live in\n\n1. Provo-Orem, Utah\n\nPct. adults drinking to excess: 8.5%\n\n8.5% Pct. driving deaths involving alcohol: 14.3%\n\n14.3% Est. number of restaurants and bars: 712 (118.2 per 100,000)\n\n712 (118.2 per 100,000) Median household income: $69,288\n\nProvo-Orem, Utah, is by far the driest metro area in the United States. Just 8.5% of area adults report drinking excessively, well below anywhere else in the country and nearly half the nationwide excessive drinking rate of 18.0%. Provo is the home of Brigham Young University. Towns with large colleges will often have high drinking rates because college students tend to drink excessively. However, BYU’s honor code prohibits students from drinking alcohol because of its close association with the Mormon church.\n\nThat relationship with Mormonism extends to the rest of the community as well. As of 2017, Utah County, which contains the Provo area, was 84.7% Mormon. The religious group encourages followers to abstain from drinking.\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nAcross broad populations, excessive alcohol consumption rates appear associated with some economic factors. Alcohol is expensive, and an individual’s ability to drink to excess can be limited by their income. Partially as a result, the cities with the lowest excessive drinking rates tend to have lower incomes, and vice-versa.\n\nOf the 20 metro areas with the lowest excessive drinking rates, 18 have a lower median household income than the national annual median of $57,617. Meanwhile, median household incomes in 11 of the metro areas with the highest excessive drinking rates exceed the national median.\n\nSocial factors also play a role. In Wisconsin, alcohol consumption is, for many, an integral part of the state’s culture. Half of the heaviest drinking cities are in Wisconsin. On the other end of the spectrum, large segments of the population in Utah are teetotalers. Over 60% of the state’s population identify as Mormon, a religion that teaches its followers to avoid alcohol consumption. Four of Utah's five metro areas rank among the cities with the lowest excessive drinking rates.\n\nWhile the health risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption are well established, a large share of excessive drinkers often does not translate to poor health outcomes across a population. Alcohol consumption is just one of a multitude of factors that can affect personal well-being. In fact, because cities with higher excessive drinking rates also tend to have higher incomes, residents can afford healthier diets and lifestyles than lower-income residents in many cities with low excessive drinking rates.\n\nPartially as a result, just one of the 20 cities with the highest excessive drinking rates is home to a larger share of adults in fair or poor health than the 16.0% national average. Meanwhile, 16 of the 20 cities with the lowest excessive drinking rates are home to a larger-than-typical share of adults in sub-optimal health.\n\nSimilarly, fatal car accidents that involve alcohol are not necessarily more common in the cities with the highest excessive drinking rates. Nationwide, 30% of all driving deaths involve alcohol. In eight of the cities with the lowest excessive drinking rates and in 11 of the cities with the highest excessive drinking rates, the share is higher than the nationwide rate.\n\nBusiness patterns in the cities on both sides of this list also reflect residents’ drinking habits. Nationwide, there are 184 bars and restaurants for every 100,000 people. The concentration of such drinking establishments is higher in all but four of the cities with the highest excessive drinking rates. Meanwhile, only two of the cities with the lowest excessive drinking rates have a higher than average concentration of bars and restaurants.\n\nTo identify the U.S. metro areas with the highest and lowest excessive drinking rates, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the percentage of adults 18 and older who report binge or heavy drinking within a 30 day period across 381 metro areas. Metro-level data was aggregated from county-level data provided by County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute joint program. All excessive drinking data is as of 2016. Median household incomes, poverty rates, and share of the population in college or graduate school came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2016 American Community Survey. The number of bars and restaurants per 100,000 people is also as of 2016 and comes from County Business Patterns, a program maintained by the Census. Health outcomes and factors, including the percentage of adults who report being in fair or poor health and the share of driving deaths that involved alcohol were also aggregated from county-level data obtained from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps and are for the most recent years available.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Bars across Columbus, and the country, are full on Saturdays for college football and Sunday for the NFL. Luckily, in Columbus there are plenty of places to watch the Buckeyes, but some take game day more seriously than others, especially the first game of the season.\n\nTake Big Bang Dueling Piano Bar, 1516 N.

That's what led her to the Southern Exposition, a vast fair that was held in what's now Central Park and St. James Park in the mid-1880s.\n\nAmong other marvels, the five-year Southern Exposition event featured a stunning display of more than 4,000 electric lightbulbs, more than could be found anywhere in the world at the time, as well as an electrically lit train tunnel. It drew around a million admissions and sparked interest and development in the area now known as Old Louisville. But ask many people today if they've heard of the Southern Exposition and the answer is no.\n\n“It feels like a part of history that's been forgotten,” Johnson said. “We were really trying to think of what we most connected with and what in Louisville excited us and drew us and the answer was the Southern Exposition. ... this really important part of our history in Louisville has fallen to the background and (when we decided to open a bar) we wanted to bring that in as part of our inspiration.”\n\nYou may like:Fondue can make a great dinner, this Louisville restaurateur says\n\nThe other half of the 'we' is Johnson's partner Nickle Morris, who was living in Hong Kong working at The Pontiac, an expat bar on the list of the World's 50 Best Bars, when she moved here first. Johnson had been traveling back and forth from New York since launching Camp Runamok, an event that brings some 500 bartenders from around the world to the world-famous Kentucky Bourbon Trail.\n\nThough she loved both cities, “Louisville grew on me as it was growing and changing,” she said, “and it felt like a place where I could contribute.”\n\nWhile it's difficult for anyone with limited financial means in New York to pursue a passion, she said, “in Louisville, anyone who has a work ethic and wants to do something cool can, and that was really exciting to me.”\n\nJohnson's discovery of Old Louisville and the fascinating history of the Exposition helped draw Morris here, and talk soon turned to opening their own bar.\n\nIn a nod to the Southern Exposition and their inspiration, the bar's name is Expo. But exposition also means to explain or show something, and Johnson and Nickle want to use their bar as an example of sustainability and fair wages for employees.\n\n“The goal of the bar is to create a business model that other people in industry can replicate,” Johnson said. “Just like the tunnel of light (at the Exposition) was to show how amazing the technology was, we're trying to show people in the industry you can pay fairly and be successful. People in our industry are not paid well and that's something we're really trying to fix.”\n\nBut above all, people visiting Expo at 114 West Main St. in downtown Louisville can expect some thoughtful, high-end cocktails.\n\n“My job is to travel around the world and drink cocktails,” Johnson said. And “nobody makes better drinks than Nickle. The man is gifted and I'm really excited to be able to have him making cocktails in Louisville. … this is the ancestral home of spirits in America. Louisville deserves a million great cocktail bars, and it's really cool to be able to contribute.”\n\nYou may like:Old Louisville is in desperate need of a real grocery store\n\nThey first hoped to open the cocktail bar in Old Louisville, where they eyed a couple of places on Oak Street. But one landlord “totally ghosted me,” Johnson said, and another wouldn't schedule a viewing once they learned plans were for a bar.\n\n“It was a real bummer because … there's potential (here),” Johnson said. “I lived in Crown Heights in Brooklyn, and it's the most diverse neighborhood in New York City … the best food you're ever going to find. It's a hell of a neighborhood. Old Louisville was the only neighborhood that I felt comfortable because there were all kinds of people.\"\n\nSo while they live there, they'll work downtown.\n\n\"There's a lot of opportunities and I think the people are underserved and are very good at supporting something in the community when there's something there ... (but) I think the landlords are scared and not able to support the neighborhood growing and changing,\" she said.\n\n“We have a lot of heart for opening something in Old Louisville so I hope at some point we can make that happen,” she went on, but for now, they ended up downtown, in a building that weirdly has no record of having ever had power, she added.\n\n“We're not sure what the purpose of the building was through the years,” she said. “It was a construction office for a long time and they've been in there … running everything off generators.”\n\nThough they've been ready since March, they've been delayed and had to jump through hoops “waiting for power to get hooked up,” Johnson said.\n\nThe plan now is to be open in about two months.\n\nExpo also has a goal of becoming a zero waste bar (in an industry where reaching even 50% is a lofty goal for many, she said), and the name and idea “is a way to remind ourselves every day that the impossible can be achieved.”\n\nTell Dana!

Atrocious school conditions have even prompted some teachers this school year to go on strike.\n\nHow CNN found subpar school conditions CNN asked teachers about the conditions of their schools and received more than 250 responses from across the US. Some teachers spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.\n\n“We’re getting to a critical stage now,” said Mike Pickens, executive director of the National Council on School Facilities. “The average age of a school building now is from 49 to 50 years” – the highest in memory. Some schools date back to World War II.\n\nBut as schools get older and more desperate for repairs, the funding gap for public schools keeps getting worse.\n\n“American Society of Civil Engineers gives the condition of America’s 100,000 public school buildings an overall grade of D+,” the National Education Association said late last year. “And no wonder – half our school buildings are half a century old.”\n\nNow, everyone is paying the price for underfunded schools.\n\nStudents get sick, distracted or miss entire days of education when conditions turn abysmal. Parents sacrifice income to provide child care when classes suddenly get canceled.\n\nBurnt-out teachers already stressed by the pandemic and school violence are pushed closer to leaving the profession.\n\nEven those not directly connected to deteriorating schools will be impacted, Pickens said.\n\nWithout more investment in US public schools, he said, “we get further and further behind on the world stage.”\n\nFrom Maryland to Colorado, students struggle to breathe in oppressively hot classrooms\n\nIn Baltimore, Marcia Turner is sick of her kids feeling sick at school.\n\n“My children can’t even breathe in the school. It be so hot. One have asthma,” Turner told CNN affiliate WMAR.\n\nFourteen Baltimore schools don’t have any air conditioning, school district Chief Operating Officer Lynette Washington told CNN. Those students get sent home early when it’s too hot to learn – 85 degrees or higher in their classrooms, she said.\n\nStifling temperatures can impede students’ academic success. Researchers who looked at millions of test scores from American high schoolers found students tend to score lower when it’s a hot school year, according to a 2018 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nBut air conditioning mitigated many of the negative effects, the researchers found.\n\nThe lack of air conditioning doesn’t just stymie students’ learning. It also hurts parents who can’t afford to leave work to take care of their children in the middle of the day.\n\n“And I can’t get off because I’m just starting a job,” Turner told WMAR.\n\nThe Baltimore school district’s COO said she’s frustrated, too. About 65% of the city’s public schools are over 41 years old; more than a third are over 51 years old.\n\n“We have such a backlog of infrastructure that has not been updated and upgraded in a consistent way. When they’re not upgraded toward the end of their life cycle, then we just hold onto them, and we just keep putting Band-Aids on them,” Washington said.\n\n“We do not have the dollars. We do not have the resources.”\n\nFive years ago, Baltimore had 75 public schools without air conditioning, Washington said. Installing AC in all those schools would cost $250 million – about five times the district’s entire annual infrastructure budget.\n\nSo Baltimore Public Schools is chipping away at the problem over years. Of the 14 schools that still lack air conditioning, six will have it in the next 24 months, Washington said. The other eight will be completely renovated – with air conditioning – or shuttered.\n\nWhy window AC units won't fix the problem For schools that don’t have air conditioning, window AC units aren’t a practical solution, said Baltimore Public Schools Chief Operating Officer Lynette Washington. “The challenge with these window air conditioning units is that they don’t meet what is called ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) standards because they do not provide the ventilation and fresh air intake required for classrooms,” she said. “The other challenge with the air conditioning box units is that they have a very short life cycle. So they may last for a year or two … (and) have to be consistently maintained and replaced. We don’t have the resources.”\n\nMany states away in Colorado, more than 30 schools in Denver Public Schools had to send kids home early and four closed for full days this month due to the heat, the district said. Temperatures soared in Denver the first full week of September, with daily highs ranging from 97 to 99 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“I can’t change the fact that it’s 88 degrees in the classroom,” said Sara, a teacher at McAuliffe International School, which had three days of early dismissal. “It gets really draining, physically and emotionally, to be kind of beat down by these factors, day in and day out.”\n\nThe middle school in Colorado’s largest school district has no air conditioning, said Trena Marsal, the district’s executive director of facility management. The infrastructure, she said, was never meant for higher temperatures.\n\n“Our oldest building is (from) 1889,” she said.\n\nForty Denver public schools still lack AC, down from 55 in 2019, Marsal said. In 2020, Denver voters approved bonds to pay, in part, for the installation of air conditioning units in schools, including a two-year plan to air-condition McAuliffe, the school district said.\n\nBut supply chain problems delayed installations this summer, leaving the work at eight schools only partially completed.\n\nSo the district has heat mitigation liaisons, Marsal said. Portable cooling units are strategically placed during the day, and windows are opened at night, she said.\n\nOpening windows, though, means “we basically daily get wasps and flies – and it’s always exciting when that happens,” Sara said.\n\nIn the heat of day, Sara said, conditions in classrooms can make older kids anxious.\n\n“You have students, I’m sure, who are nervous about sweat stains or they sit down on a plastic chair and their butt gets sweaty,” she said. “It’s stuff as an adult we’re not as self-conscious about, but a teenager absolutely is.”\n\n“I sweat, like, everywhere,” seventh grader Zmarra Fleming told CNN affiliate KUSA. “In the classrooms, it’s really hot. It’s, like, hot where the point is you can’t really breathe in there.”\n\nMcAuliffe International School student Zmarra Fleming said it was hard to breathe in her hot classroom. KUSA\n\nBut the immediate fix – early dismissal – caused transportation problems this month for some students. McAuliffe got out at 1:32 p.m., according to the school’s website, but Marsal said early buses weren’t requested.\n\n“It’s very frustrating,” parent Stephanie Bates told KUSA. “I can’t imagine what parents who don’t have flexibility in their schedules do.”\n\nRusty water drips from classroom ceilings\n\nLeaking water in classrooms and brown, stained ceiling tiles have made for a “morning ritual” among some teachers at Joseph G. Pyne Arts Magnet School in Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\n“Outside my room, in the hallway, there’s several tiles that are stained brown like rusty, dirty water from leaks,” said Eric Kolifrath, a seventh and eighth grade science teacher. “Everyone on my floor, especially if it’s rained, we examine the ceiling to let the custodial staff know if we see new leaks.”\n\nEric Kolifrath says it's become a \"morning ritual\" to inspect for leaks on his floor of the school. Courtesy Eric Kolifrath\n\nLast school year, a ceiling tile got so wet it “bowed out like a bowl,” Kolifrath said. So custodians wheeled in a 33-gallon trash bin to collect the water.\n\nAnother time, a leak sprang right above his classroom projector.\n\n“That’s not a problem that my principal can fix,” Kolifrath said. “If she had a wand, she would wave it.”\n\nThat’s in part because Kolifrath’s school, which serves pre-K through eighth grade, and 28 others in the district are managed by the City of Lowell, which also looks after municipal buildings, City Manager Tom Golden said.\n\nThe setup is among the myriad ways American school buildings are maintained – which can lead to confusion over who’s responsible for repairs.\n\nA browning ceiling tile hangs over a room this school year at Joseph G. Pyne Arts Magnet School in Lowell, Massachusetts. Courtesy Eric Kolifrath\n\nLike many teachers nationwide, Kolifrath has crowdsourced financial support for his classroom.\n\nThe city is putting $2.3 million into all Lowell schools during the 2022-2023 school year and investing $389 million to build a new high school, Golden said.\n\nThe roof at J. G. Pyne was repaired last year, he said. But maintaining ceiling tiles “would be the responsibility of the custodians who work for the school department,” Golden said.\n\n“With the number of buildings that we have, there are always going to be issues and challenges on a day-to-day basis, which our lands and buildings professionals will be out there to rectify.”\n\nThe school funding gap keeps getting worse\n\nThe money spent on fixing or building US public schools falls woefully short of what’s needed to get buildings up to standard, according to the latest “State of Our Schools” report by the 21st Century School Fund, the International WELL Building Institute and the National Council on School Facilities.\n\nAnd the gap is widening. In 2016, public schools were underfunded by $46 billion a year (or $60 billion, when adjusted for inflation to 2020 dollars), the report said. By 2021, that annual deficit had grown by $25 billion.\n\nWhere does funding for public school buildings come from? The funding sources and ratios vary across the country. But in general, “local school districts bear the heaviest responsibilities for school construction capital funding,” according to the 2021 “State of Our Schools” report. From fiscal years 2009 to 2019: Local school districts paid 77% of the costs for PK-12 capital projects. States paid 22% to districts for capital outlay and debt service. But state support is highly variable, with 11 states paying nothing to eight states paying over half the district-level capital costs. Public school districts got slightly more than 1% from federal funds for school construction.\n\n“We have a gap of about $85 billion in our country from where we are to where we need to be to be current with codes and standards and the quality of education,” Pickens said. “In that, $57 billion is in capital improvements, and about $28 billion is in M&O – which is maintenance and operation.”\n\nThe trend is untenable as more American schools cross the half-century mark.\n\nEven with regular maintenance, “about 50 years is a good place to (consider) replacing a school.” Pickens said.\n\nBut funding sources vary widely, and it can be hard to secure money for school improvements without raising taxes.\n\n“Every state handles school facility improvements a little differently,” said John Heim, executive director of the National School Boards Association. But “it usually comes from property taxes.”\n\nAnd that can put already-disadvantaged students in a more dire situation.\n\n“It affects poor districts or those that have lower tax bases more than it does wealthier districts that have more tax base to call on,” Heim said.\n\n“And so as things get more expensive, you’re going to see that gap continue to grow.”\n\nAs schools deteriorate, so do teachers’ and students’ performance\n\nAt Reading Memorial High School in Massachusetts, a longtime teacher runs up to seven fans in his classroom to try to compensate for the school’s lack of air conditioning.\n\nBut those efforts don’t prevent him or his students from fading as the day gets hotter.\n\n“I don’t get the same caliber of work from them as I do during those cooler months when they’re actually comfortable,” he said.\n\n“I find myself adjusting my lessons as the day goes on because I know I’m not going to have the energy or mental capacity to do what I did earlier in the day because I’m so uncomfortable.”\n\nThe temperature in his classroom can reach 100 degrees, and the humidity can make you “slip on the floor,” the teacher said.\n\nThat’s especially problematic because he has an autoimmune disease and has suffered dizzy spells that have forced him to leave the classroom to splash cold water on his face, he said.\n\nHVAC preventative maintenance has been completed at all Reading Public Schools, the district said.\n\n“We are committed to ensuring high quality air ventilation in all of our classrooms,” Superintendent Thomas Milaschewski told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe district “will continue to encourage staff to open windows, as feasible, to increase air flow in classrooms, and to bring students outside when weather permits,” the superintendent wrote.\n\nBut that brings little comfort to the veteran high school teacher – especially because the building’s central and main offices are air-conditioned, he said.\n\n“I cannot think of many professions where people have graduate degrees or have a license where they would tolerate something like this,” the teacher said. “I don’t understand where the disconnect is, where you want your teachers to be the best that they can possibly be but you’re not even making them comfortable.”\n\nKids miss entire school days because some buildings don’t have heat\n\nWhile nonexistent air conditioning can hinder students at the beginning and end of the school year, the opposite problem can have even greater consequences.\n\n“We tend to have to close schools down more for heating issues than for cooling issues,” said Washington, the Baltimore school district COO. “Wintertime goes from December all the way up until March.”\n\nBaltimore teachers have reported classrooms as cold as 40 degrees. More than a third of the schools’ boilers are over 20 years old. Some pipes were installed when Harry Truman was President.\n\nBeyond that, one elementary school had no running water for more than two weeks last winter, according to a school district memo.\n\n“The district is severely underfunded,” Washington said.\n\n“Baltimore’s already taxed at a higher rate than the surrounding counties,” she said. But “Baltimore city has a low tax base. We have a disproportionate share of households that live below the poverty line. And so if we’re just depending on property taxes, we might not get there at all.”\n\nShe hopes the state will increase funding for Baltimore city schools “so that we won’t continue to have the infrastructure challenges that we’re having.”\n\nIf not, Washington said, “I cannot guarantee that our students will have the learning environments that they deserve and that they need to be successful.”\n\nWhy this year may be even more challenging\n\nFallout from the pandemic could make infrastructure problems harder to fix this year, Pickens said.\n\nSome school districts haven’t been able to complete projects due to supply chain shortages or an increase in the cost of raw materials, he said. And remote or hybrid learning during the pandemic means some parts of schools may have been neglected.\n\nA demonstrator in Columbus, Ohio, rallies in support of teachers at a Columbus Education Association protest in August.

Perenic/Columbus Dispatch/USA Today Network\n\n“We’ve had two years of less use than we had,” Pickens said. “And because students were not in buildings, we probably did not continue the maintenance and operation and capital improvements of those school buildings because students weren’t in them.”\n\nInflation this year could also be getting in the way of school improvements, Heim said.\n\n“If we’re talking about an improvement that was to be made for the 2022-2023 school year, that bid process probably would have taken place back in January, February,” Heim said.\n\n“That’s when we were seeing those incredibly high building costs. And it’s also when we were experiencing all those supply chain issues. So … schools may not have been able to get the projects done in time or weren’t able to do as much because of the supply chain issues and inflation issues.”\n\nCockroaches make lunch a scary scene, teacher says\n\nSchools that aren’t well-maintained can attract unwelcome visitors. Around one school building, cockroaches have occupied corners, carpets, sinks and sticky glue insect traps, an Oakley, California, high school teacher said.\n\nThe bugs can be seen every day, inside and outside the school. They grow as long as 2 inches and seem to have multiplied after school resumed in-person learning last year, the teacher said.\n\nThe infestation at Freedom High School is so bad it inspired an Instagram account. The teacher verified the cockroach photos were taken at the school and shared some personal ones from the last week of August. The teacher submitted work orders about the cockroaches in recent years but didn’t report them directly to the administration, they said.\n\nDead cockroaches lie inside and outside a bug trap at Freedom High School in Oakley, California. Provided to CNN\n\nLiberty Union High School District Superintendent Eric Volta recognized Freedom High School in the social media photos, he said. The district sprays schools for pests quarterly, he said, and if there are additional needs, pest services are requested.\n\n“We fog, we spray, we bait, we trap. We do whatever we need to do to try to correct the issue,” Volta said. “We’ve been having triple-digit temperatures out here, and these things are coming up out of wherever they are just looking for water.”\n\nA big concern is cockroaches shed, leaving the teacher wary of eating in most places. Some students haven’t wanted school lunches because of the roaches, the teacher said.\n\nBut all kitchens and snack bars go through health inspections. So Volta is not worried about the pests in eating areas, he said.\n\n“I guess this is something that probably most teachers deal with,” the teacher said.\n\nWhile cockroaches might not be in every school, “there’s these problems that you have that are constant, but that you just go on teaching and doing what you have to do, knowing that you almost have no control over the situation,” the teacher said.\n\n“I can keep stepping on cockroaches and killing them, but there’s always more. The problem just sort of needs to be addressed instead of just putting Band-Aids on it.”\n\nThe consequences of inaction … and possible solutions\n\nAnd if America keeps underfunding public schools, the impact could last generations, said Mary Kusler, the National Education Association’s senior director for advocacy.\n\n“It’s really setting up a continued structural imbalance between the haves and the have-nots … unless we step up and push to ensure that a child’s ZIP code does not determine the education they receive,” she said.\n\nIncreasing funding for school infrastructure would “improve a lot of things in our country, including putting out into the workforce a more vibrant and more educated workforce,” said Pickens, the director of the National Council on School Facilities.\n\n“Also, by improving schools, somebody has to do the work on a school building. We’re putting people to work. We’re getting taxes from those people, from the labor. We’re increasing jobs. All of those things are factors in providing funds for school buildings.”\n\nTeachers and supporters rally in 2019 in Annapolis, Maryland. Baltimore union members asked for fans to be donated to cool sweltering classrooms without air-conditioning. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nIt’s in everyone’s best interest to ensure students in poorer communities have schools in which they can thrive – even if local tax revenues aren’t as plush as those in wealthier communities, said Heim, the director of the National School Boards Association.\n\n“I think it comes down to having good formulas that can compensate for that. I think states are reevaluating those all the time,” Heim said.\n\n“But that’s what it comes down to: affordability and helping those poorer districts with their facilities.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean wealthier school districts with state-of-the-art buildings should have anything taken away, Kusler said.\n\n“The issue isn’t that they deserve less. The issue is actually that all of our kids deserve more,” she said.\n\n“Ultimately, we are about creating the next generation of leaders in this country. And they will come from all over the country. Therefore, we need to make sure all of them have access to the education that they deserve.”", "authors": ["Christina Zdanowicz Holly Yan", "Christina Zdanowicz", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/columnists/john-carlisle/2018/06/10/upper-peninsula-drinking-guide/670567002/", "title": "Upper Peninsula drinking guide becomes cult classic", "text": "THE UPPER PENINSULA – Randy Kluck liked to drink. If he wasn’t drinking wine on his front porch at his house he was drinking liquor on a barstool at some dive bar in Sault Ste. Marie, where he moved to be close to his son Kevin, who came here to attend college.\n\nThe two were such buddies that Kevin refers to his dad by his first name. “He really was always my best friend,” said Kevin, 36. “So I just think of him as ‘Randy.’ ”\n\nSix years ago, they were drinking on the porch, and Randy came up with an idea — how about they spend the summer together on an epic road trip through the Upper Peninsula and write a book about all the amazing bars they’d stop at along the way? There would be so many nights they’d get to spend side-by-side on barstools, so many long drives along the empty highways, so much to tell each other, so much to see.\n\n“When we first started, I don’t think we were really cognizant of what kind of bonding experience it was going to be,” Kevin said. “But we were already so close to begin with that a lot of it was business as usual for us.”\n\nThe resulting book, “Yooper Bars: Visit the Finest Bars in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula,” took nearly a year to finish, and came out only after they paid to have it published themselves. It was a beer-goggles view of the Upper Peninsula as seen from the barstools of 109 watering holes like Jack’s Tee Pee in Ishpeming, Buckshot’s Bar in Manistique, the Pine Stump Cook Shack and Drinkery in Newberry, and the Bear Belly Bar and Grill in Lac La Belle.\n\nBut “Yooper Bars” was more than just a drinking guide. With its affectionate descriptions of the unique world inside each bar, it was an ode to Upper Peninsula life. It showed that many bars serve as more than just a place to drink for a small town’s residents. And it gave a father and son something important that neither at the time knew they would need.\n\nAt first, it drew some interest. A few newspapers did articles about the father-son authors, and several TV stations came Up North to interview them about this unusual travel guide.\n\nOnce the attention faded they moved on with their lives and forgot about their book. Kevin relocated downstate, got a job, got married and had a child. Randy stayed in the U.P., spending perhaps a little too much time on barstools. A mere 10,000 copies of the book had been printed, yet it seemed unlikely that even that many would sell and that the book was probably doomed to obscurity.\n\nThen a funny thing happened.\n\nOne thing in common\n\nThere are lots of dive bars in the U.P. Some are little more than crooked shacks with a deep-fryer and two beers on tap. But there are also some spectacular bars, usually in those few places with money and jobs — or places that once had money and jobs — like former copper mining towns. There’s Shute’s in Calumet, a 128-year-old saloon with an elaborate stained-glass canopy above its bar, hand-carved wooden lions heads and a basement speakeasy from the Prohibition era. The Nahma Inn in Nahma, built in 1906 by a lumber company for its workers, still featuring antique-furnished rooms for overnight guests. The Jack Pine Lodge in Manistique, once lost during a poker game in 1936, whose tables, chairs and lamps are made of pine stumps and roots.\n\nAnd there’s the Islander Bar and Grill in Hessel, which resembles the large, idealized cabin of an eccentric, seafaring collector.\n\nKevin stood at the 50-foot wood bar, across from the large stone fireplace, ordering a beer. It was a spring afternoon, and this was his first stop on a road trip he was taking across the eastern U.P., visiting a string of bars that he hadn’t been to since Randy last took this route with him. He wanted to see whether any of the bars had changed, if anyone would remember the two of them or the book they wrote.\n\nThis time, though, he was taking the trip by himself.\n\nThe Islander is housed inside a century-old former general store and ice cream parlor in the heart of downtown Hessel, a genteel waterfront vacation spot that draws well-to-do visitors to its gift shops, an art gallery, a boat-building school and a culinary institute. The polished wood walls here are crowded with vintage clocks, nautical gadgets and posters from the town’s annual Antique Wooden Boat Show.\n\n“For people who’ve been up here, when you think of Yooper bars, this is a classy bar no matter where you put it,” Kevin said.\n\nIf there’s any unifying theme to the book, it’s that in the U.P. — regardless of whether a bar is a crumbling cabin serving skunked beer to lumberjacks, or an ornate, beachfront pub offering tourists filet mignon with steamed vegetables — there’s a common Yooper ethic that underlies each establishment.\n\n“It kind of takes you back 30, 40 years to the way things were back then,” said Johnny Edington, 55, of Pickford, sitting at the Islander's bar rail. He and his buddy were out running errands from town to town, and they figured why not drink at some bars along the way?\n\n“Communities are very community-oriented, you know what I’m saying? Where, if somebody in the community is sick, they’ll have a big bash for them and raise a bunch of money and give it to them,” Edington said. “That’s just the way it is here.”\n\nHis dad’s nearby barn burned down years ago, he said, and, within a week, 30 local men showed up and built him a new barn. “Never charged the man a dime,” Edington said. “It’s just the way it is. When you see a neighbor in need, you go take care of them.”\n\n“Well that’s what you get in small communities up here, ‘cause everybody knows everybody, so everybody’s close,” said his friend, Mike Marble, 54, also of Pickford. “That’s the biggest difference from downstate to up here.”\n\nEach of them was drinking an Escanaba Black from Upper Hand Brewery in Escanaba. In the past few years, dozens of breweries have opened in the Upper Peninsula — including Blackrocks Brewery in Marquette, Keweenaw Brewing Company in Houghton and Les Cheneaux Distillers just down the road from the Islander — and the bars up here have expanded their offerings from the previously typical Budweiser and Miller. But no matter how much they upgrade, some things in the U.P. never change.\n\nMarble said a small bar up in Hulbert — nameless because the story he likes to tell technically violates health codes — is a great example of this.\n\n“We go up there a couple months ago, and I took a bunch of fresh fish with me that a buddy give me, and we go in, we sit down and order a beer, and I say to the bartender — we call her Aunt Nancy — ‘What’s the chances of us, if we brought in some fresh fish, that you’d cook it for us while were here?’ She looks at us, (jokingly) gives us a dirty look and says, ‘Bring it in,’ So we bring the fish in and I said, ‘Cook it all up and give the guys down the bar some too, spread it around.’ And that’s what they did. And again, that’s like anywhere you go. That’s how people treat you.”\n\nA joke until it wasn’t\n\nAs Kevin headed farther east from the Mackinac Bridge on his road trip along M-134, the towns grew smaller and the bars became more rustic. And, unlike at the Islander, the souvenirs on the walls were valued more in sentiment than in money.\n\nAt Snow’s Bar in Cedarville, for example, the walls feature a collage of sports equipment — antique sleds, snowshoes, ice skates and hockey sticks — each of them scraped and scuffed by years of use; most of them just things people had in their basements and garages, all of them the embodiment of Upper Peninsula winter life.\n\nSnow’s is tucked several side roads deep into a residential neighborhood. Nobody would stumble on it. Either you know it’s there or you don’t. The few tourists who do come regularly are longtime boaters familiar with the area.\n\n“A lot of the bars in the U.P., they’re hidden gems,” said Shirland Cardinal, the 58-year-old bartender at Snow’s. “The locals know about them, but unless you know some of the locals you’re not going to find them. I get people all the time — ‘We’ve been coming up here 20 years, never knew this place was here.’ ”\n\nBut a few years ago, something unusual began happening — strangers started showing up at the door with an odd little book in their hands.\n\n“You wouldn’t believe the people we had coming around who made it goals after this came out to come in and have us sign our pictures,” she said of Kevin’s book, which was on a shelf behind the bar, offered for sale. “There would be groups of them — ‘Oh, we’re doing the tour’ — and they were gonna hit so many bars today and so many bars tomorrow, and they were literally planning vacations around hitting bars in the ‘Yooper Bars’ book.”\n\nKevin smiled about this. After all the work he and Randy put into it, it was gratifying to hear that so many people liked it.\n\nFor years, Kevin and Randy joked about writing a book on all the unusual bars in the Upper Peninsula to share with outsiders everything they loved about the region, the kinds of things they never saw in any guidebook.\n\n“The original impetus of the project was to showcase all the great bars up here and let all the people downstate know what a good time it was,” Kevin said.\n\nKevin moved from Kalamazoo to \"The Soo\" — as Sault Ste. Marie is called — in 2007 to attend Lake Superior State University, where he majored in business administration. Randy soon followed. After a shaky business venture had collapsed and he’d lost his house in Saginaw to foreclosure, he decided to start over in a part of the state he’d always loved.\n\n“As a child Randy came up here; his love of the U.P. trickled down to us,” Kevin said. “I can remember as a child coming up here almost every summer.”\n\nRandy always wanted to be an author, but he figured his college-educated son would do a better job writing the book. Besides, Kevin was the only one of them who knew how to use a computer.\n\nSo extroverted Randy would hold court on a barstool while the quieter Kevin would dutifully take notes and photos, conduct the interviews and chronicle the decor on the walls. They couldn’t afford to stay in motels, so they’d leave the Soo in the morning, drive five or six hours to some bar, immerse themselves in its atmosphere and drive back that night as the sun was rising, talking for hours along the way.\n\nThey started with a $500 budget, but that quickly evaporated, and they came up with the idea to charge bar owners $199 each for the privilege of being in their proposed book. “Because I can’t afford to publish the book and take an entire summer off,” Kevin explained. Surprisingly, more than 90 percent of bar owners paid the fee, which went toward bar tabs, gas money and the $25,000 it cost to self-publish.\n\nThe project took 10 months — much longer than planned. They put 47,000 miles on Kevin’s maroon 1998 Grand Prix — far more than anticipated. They each added 30 pounds to their waistlines — a lot more than either needed.\n\nEarly on, they sensed that every bar embodied its town’s personality. “It started out with a template for each bar,” Kevin said. “But each bar had such unique character, so much different than the next bar, we couldn’t keep the same criteria for each bar. We had to find out what was special about each place.”\n\nWhat they found was that for some small towns up here, the local bar is sometimes the only public establishment in town where people can gather. So bars are often the location of wedding receptions, baby showers, divorce parties, birthday celebrations and funerals. Bars hold fundraisers to help neighbors who’ve fallen on hard times, or throw midwinter parties just to break up the snow-white monotony of the longest season of the year. Some serve as their town’s unofficial historical museum, posting old photos and documents on the walls for lack of anywhere else in town to display them. And for many people living in rural isolation, they become a home away from home.\n\n“You and I could walk into some of these bars as perfect strangers, and within 15 minutes you’d think you were at a family reunion,” Randy told Michigan Radio in 2013, just after his book’s publication. “It’s just really cool.”\n\nThey found unusual events like the Spam-carving contest every spring at Cat Tails Cove in Cedarville. The Hula-Hoop Happy Hour at Silver Creek Grill and Pub in Eckerman, where people get on the dance floor at 4 p.m. and Hula-Hoop with their drinks in the town where it was invented in 1923. The reverse drag party at the Cozy Corner’s Tavern in Barbeau on deer rifle-hunting season’s opening day, for which the wives of hunters come out in fake moustaches and camouflage for a party while their husbands are gone.\n\nThe book splits the U.P. into three sections, each fronted by a locator map showing the location of every bar, the pages where each can be found in the book, and highways that suggest the paths of long-distance bar crawls. Its 224 pages are dense with photos of the bars and the customers, plus facts and stories about each place, the kind of granular details that become apparent only after long hours on a barstool — who has a stuffed bear, which place serves cattle testicles, which bartender won the most arm-wrestling contests.\n\nThe book lists each bar’s hours, its house shot and house drink, celebrity sightings (lots of Jeff Daniels) and the favorite joke told at each place.\n\nQuestion: How do you double the value of a Yooper’s car? Answer: Put gas in it.\n\nQuestion: How is a Texas tornado and a U.P. divorce the same? Answer: Somebody is going to lose a trailer.\n\nQuestion: Where does a Yooper go on vacation? Answer: To a new bar.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThere was nobody drinking at Snow’s that day except Kevin. It was late April, the worst time of the year in the tourism-reliant U.P., the way the end of the month is rough for poor people in urban areas who rely on public assistance. And even though this spot gets few tourists compared with the coast, everyone here needs those few tourists to keep going.\n\n“Most people who are in the tourist industry, you’re laid off at the end of October and you’re usually down for the winter,” explained Cardinal, who’ll work on visitor-crowded Mackinac Island in the summer. “You don’t go back until the start of May. And that’s just another part of being in the tourist industry. They only give you 20 weeks of unemployment. You know, you’re laid off every year for 26 weeks. There ain’t much you can do about it.”\n\nA place for everyone\n\nUp the highway was a bar run by dogs and ghosts.\n\nTo announce this, a German shepherd hopped in the recliner by the front door of the Runway Bar in Hessel, and gave the strangers walking into the bar a stern look to signal that nobody but this dog sits in this chair. Two other dogs threaded their way through the legs of the customers, as if they owned the place. Because here, they essentially do.\n\n“Dogs are welcome,” declared Wendi Smith, 65, the bar’s longtime owner. She started the tradition years ago by designating every Sunday as Dog Day. That soon stretched into every day, and now everyone who has dogs brings them. “I know all the dogs by name and what they like for treats and stuff,” she said, smiling.\n\nThe Runway was built in the 1930s. The original bar burned to the ground years ago, and the owner at the time rebuilt the whole thing out of fireproof concrete, visually unappealing but certainly fireproof. Smith’s dad bought it in 1959, and when she took over in 1984 she had the bar rebuilt to look like the original — a cozy, wood cabin.\n\n“But the old bar is all under here,” she said. “It’s completely cement — the floors, the walls.”\n\nThe interior is decorated with ancient saws and axes, left over from the region’s lumber mill roots, and deer heads and antlers, donated by generations of hunters. As in many U.P. bars, historical photos on the walls document the town’s history, this time from the bar’s front porch — the evolving models of the vehicles parked out front, the dated hairstyles and clothing of the customers, the changing appearance of the bar itself. And the mysterious orbs that sometimes appear in pictures taken here.\n\n“This place is known to be a haunted bar,” explained bartender Staci Fountain, 52. “Drink at your own risk.”\n\nA lot of bars in the U.P. claim to be haunted. At the Nahma Inn, a ghost is said to occasionally rearrange things in the kitchen. At Tovey’s Jolly Inn in Germfask, the now-110-year-old original owner is said to change radio stations and turn lights on and off. And at the Runway, a ghost likes to flirt with women.\n\n“I was bent over, and I felt my hair go back, and a kiss on my cheek, and I turned around and there was nobody there,” Fountain said.\n\nThat’s the ghost’s trademark. “We had a girl almost in the same spot sitting there,” Fountain noted, “and she said, 'Do you think this bar is haunted?' and I’m like, ‘Yeah,’ and she goes, ‘Somebody keeps whispering in my ear and playing with my hair.’ ”\n\nOver the years, several bartenders have claimed to see a man emerge from the kitchen and walk through the bar. Some have quit in distress over this. A few customers have quit their barstools, too.\n\n“We have a guy that won’t come in after dark unless there’s a lot of people here, ‘cause he swears he seen someone come out the back room,” Fountain said.\n\nThe Runway is up the road from a small tribal casino but far from anything else, including the prosperous shore by the islands. Its customers are almost all locals, some living in far-flung rural isolation. So every Thanksgiving and Christmas, the owners cook a big dinner for those in the area who don’t have anywhere else to go.\n\n“We’ve done it for many years, at least since 1984, and I’m pretty sure on Thanksgiving my mother had cooked for people who didn’t have a place to go, didn’t have family,” Smith said. “We’ve had as many as 30 for dinner and we play bingo and we buy all kinds of not-expensive little gifts, and everybody that comes to dinner at Christmas brings a little gift, and we buy extra so nobody goes without.”\n\nFor the longest time, Smith knew everyone who came in the door. At least, until a certain book came out, and strangers started showing up as part of a peculiar drinking game.\n\n“I really met some super people from all over that had purchased these books and had decided to go to as many of the bars as they could and get their book signed,” she said. “And a lot of them asked for me to write a little note to them.”\n\nIt was the same story Kevin had heard earlier in the day at Snow’s Bar. It turns out that in the years since it was published, the book slowly became an underground classic, selling one at a time in gas stations and souvenir shops, and a game spontaneously grew from it. People were driving all over the U.P., visiting the places highlighted by Kevin and Randy, asking the bartenders to sign that bar’s pages in the book as proof of their visit, trying to be the first to hit all 109 bars.\n\nSmith said she understands the fascination with U.P. bars that motivated Kevin and Randy, and all the people now following in their tracks to see these places for themselves.\n\n“I think the Yooper bars have a tendency to know their customers, to be closer with their customers. It’s not strangers walking in every day,” Smith said. “It’s like family. I think Yooper bars have more of a tendency to connect with their patrons and become family. We do get our tourists, and they’re very, very appreciated. Extra money is awesome. But Yooper bars are family.”\n\nIn like a Lion\n\nHugh Speier needed swear words to fully convey what he first thought of the Upper Peninsula when he moved here a few years ago at his wife’s request.\n\n“She said, ‘I want you to come up to the U.P. and see how I live, where I was born.’ I thought it was totally crazy,” said the blunt-spoken, 75-year-old New York City native in a thick Brooklyn accent. “Why would anybody fucking live here? You’d have to be crazy. Why would you do that?”\n\nHe was sitting at Yooperman’s Bar and Grill in Goetzville with a group of friends, having lunch. “My son, who’s a sports fan, said, ‘Pop, you’re going to rot up there. You’re going to have nothing to do, you’re going to lose your Yankees, you’re going to lose football, you’re going to lose sports.’ And my wife brought me here and I said, ‘Holy shit, this is unbelievable.’ ”\n\nIn a place where not every sports fan can afford cable, Yooperman’s is a sanctuary, where the walls are covered in flat-screen TVs always tuned to sports and where the man in charge is a boisterous sports lunatic.\n\nOwner Donnie Stefanski has not missed a single Detroit Lions home game in 25 years. This, despite living in the Upper Peninsula. This, despite the team doing everything it could over the years to disappoint fans like him.\n\n“It would’ve been nice to have had a championship so far in there someplace,” said Stefanski, 60, a retired truck driver and foreman for a local township. He was given the nickname “Yooperman” by fans at Lions games. “But other than that, it is what it is.”\n\nDuring the fall, he and his 37-year-old daughter Megan Stefanski, who tends bar here, typically leave Raber Township at 3 a.m. or so on Sunday morning, after Donnie paints his face and puts on Lions-themed hunting gear. Megan’s just getting off work and will sleep in the passenger seat while Donnie gets them as far as West Branch in the middle of the night. Then she’ll hop behind the wheel until they reach Eastern Market in Detroit at about 8:30 a.m. to tailgate. After the game they’ll drive back and get home just before midnight.\n\n“My mother, she lives about 1,000 feet from me, and I haven’t seen her in 30 years on Thanksgiving,” Donnie said, laughing. A few years ago, he was inducted into the NFL Fan Hall of Fame. “Of course, how I grew up, Thanksgiving’s a holiday if you’re a Lions’ fan. You have a home game every year.”\n\nHis bar is a Detroit sports shrine. An archway in the dining room is wallpapered in Lions season tickets. Lions jerseys autographed by Calvin Johnson and a Red Wings jersey signed by Henrik Zetterberg hang above the bar. And a forlorn little sign above the salad bar notes that Ford Field is 346 miles away.\n\nThat salad bar is a magnet around here. In many Upper Peninsula towns, the bar is the only place to eat, and people will drive a long way for a decent meal because they’re hard to find. This has led to a surprising competition among U.P. bars to elevate bar food to an unexpectedly high level. “Some of these bars could be five-star restaurants,” Randy told a Marquette-based TV show in 2012.\n\nAt Yooperman’s, that means Donnie’s wife Joanne, 58, creates all the salad dressings from scratch, makes a couple different soups every day and bakes her own desserts instead of just slicing up store-bought ones. It’s hard to find this kind of homemade cooking in actual restaurants in most places, let alone a sports bar. And people up here know this. “My mom’s an amazing cook,” Megan said, “So we get people from 60 miles away for dinner. Everything’s homemade.”\n\nBut even more so, drunken driving laws changed the culture of rural bars. To survive, they had to adapt and become for their communities more than just a place to drink.\n\n“It’s where you meet,” Donnie said of Yooper bars. “I have a sandbox out back … ‘cause we always have kids around, and of course we're not worried about them getting kidnapped here or nothing; we’re more worried about a truck going by on the highway and a kid running out. Kids go play in the back yard, it’s not a problem. The parents can sit here and visit and have dinner, whatever; my grandkids are around so there’s kids in and out of here all the time. It’s community.”\n\nFor Brooklyn-native Speier, his new home is still a culture shock. He grew up in Manhattan, where his high school graduating class had 2,500 students. His wife’s in nearby Pickford had 25. He has lived in France and Maine during his career in the dairy business, he’s an abstract painter, and now in retirement he has settled down in a town of maybe 600 people living along dusty roads and cattail marshes.\n\n“But the people are good, the air is clean, there’s no crime, well there’s crime but not real crime. And it’s more private, you get a little piece of property, you live your own life, you live your own destiny. And if you fuck up here, it’s your own fault.”\n\nA sudden end\n\nAfter the book was done and all the attention faded, Kevin stopped partying. He moved to Muskegon, found a job inspecting blades for aircraft engines, got married, had a daughter, got back in shape.\n\nBut Randy kept going.\n\n“Dad’s drinking took a turn after the book,” Kevin said. “I should say probably during, or before.”\n\nWherever Kevin stopped in on this road trip, people told him they’d seen Randy drinking there long after the book came out. “You don’t write a book about bars and not have a love for going to bars,” Kevin said of his dad, who had already lost a leg to diabetes, and who smoked a pack a day. “Left unattended, I’d say a pack and a half.”\n\nOne night in June 2013, Randy called his son to say he wasn’t feeling well, then drove himself down from the Soo all the way to his familiar Saginaw to check into a hospital where his sister worked.\n\n“I got a call, they said things weren’t going well,” Kevin said. “I’m like, 'no, he’ll be fine.' Well, no — on Saturday I went down. And he was gone on Sunday.”\n\nRandy died at 59. Cause of death was everything. “The doctor summed it up as just doing shit to your body for so long,” Kevin said.\n\nFor a while, this weighed on him. After all, he was the one who had just taken Randy on an epic drinking binge. “I mean, I feel a lot of guilt about this, like I was an enabler,” he said. “I’ve gotten over it; I don’t think like that anymore. But without me this book wouldn’t have happened. I enabled him to go on a year-long bar crawl and that wasn’t good for his health. But he wanted to.”\n\nIn fact, whenever the scope of the project became daunting, it was always Randy who would push the two of them to keep going, as if driven by the opportunity to spend all this time with his son, on his own terms, in the places he was most comfortable —inside the bars of his beloved U.P., a drink in his hand, talking through the night with someone he loved.\n\n“It was a tremendous bonding experience, a lot of time in the car with my dad,” Kevin said. “I didn’t take it for granted. I think I knew what we were doing along the way.”\n\nLast call\n\nThe end of the road was a gravel parking lot at the edge of the peninsula in Sault Ste. Marie. Across the water, low on the horizon, was Canada. In the middle of the river stood Sugar Island, 50 square miles of woods containing a closed church, a community center and a single bar.\n\nKevin was waiting for the ferry to the island, which went back and forth twice an hour across St. Mary’s River. He’d just come from Raber Bay Bar, named for the bay along which it was located. It was another bar drawing people with its meals, cooked by owner Mary Lou Harmon, 70, on whose kitchen window customers like to post pictures of their kids and grandkids like it’s a family home.\n\n“If I wasn’t selling food I’d really be hurting,” said her husband, Rich Harmon, 66. “And that’s where a lot of … the country bars, they didn’t adapt to selling food. You know, a shot and a beer, and it didn’t work.”\n\nAnd it was another bar where newcomers came with the book in hand. “I got a bunch of traffic out of it,” Harmon told Kevin. “People come in, I signed it. They were traveling around, having the book signed. Quite a few of ‘em. More than I ever thought.”\n\nNow, Sugar Island’s lone bar, the Hilltop, would be the last stop of the road trip, a fitting ending since it was a bar that his dad loved. Whenever Randy tired of all the places to drink in downtown Soo, where everyone knew him, he could hop on the ferry and vanish from the world for a while.\n\nSugar Island is best known because in 1945, Chase Osborn, a former Michigan governor (1911-13) with property on the island and the only Michigan governor ever from the U.P., launched a campaign to locate the proposed headquarters for the United Nations here. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers even drew up plans featuring an airport, docks and a skyscraper. It wasn’t enough to beat New York City, though. The ex-governor, who died not long after, is buried on the island in what’s now a 3,200-acre nature preserve maintained by the University of Michigan.\n\nAt the Hilltop, the names of its patrons over the years have been carved with knives deep into the wood rail. Hundreds of $1 bills are tacked to the ceiling, yellowed from the days of indoor smoking. Elderly houseplants droop from pots in the window. A stage stands ready for a local band called Three and a Half Men, so named because one of its four members lost his legs. And once again, black-and-white photos on the walls document the history of the island.\n\nIt’s the quintessential Upper Peninsula dive bar. And the drinkers here cherish it.\n\n“What makes it special? Solitude,” said 62-year-old Mike Williams, a Sugar Island resident who moved here from Hazel Park years ago.\n\nHis wife Debra Jo, 62, sat next to him. They were in love with the simplicity and serenity of life on the island, where visitors are rare. “I’ll tell you, there’s nothing like a sunset, watching the boats go by. You have a little campfire, and you wonder what the rich people are doing, because you are so comfortable sitting back and watching all this.”\n\nWhen Kevin walked in, he received something close to a hero’s welcome. Customers came up to hug him or shake his hand. His drinks were declared on the house. Off-duty staff were called and told Kevin was back, come in and see him.\n\nAnd everyone had fond memories about Randy.\n\n“Oh my golly, it touches strings,” said owner Steve Miller, 57. “He showed so much respect for us. He sat down and talked to us, he touched hearts. He was just a good person, a really good person. I was thankful to meet him.”\n\nThey were also thankful that the book highlighted this faraway bar, nestled between two countries, as remote as can be. To them, Randy was the one who thought this unheralded bar was worth telling the world about, that the Upper Peninsula was worth being proud of, and whose pride in the region had brought so many new people through here.\n\n“The book brought people, but more than that, more than the book, was the fact that they showed interest in our community and our place,” Miller said.\n\nBefore he died, after all he’d been through, Randy got to see the first flush of his project’s success, and he was happy.\n\n“Randy had so many — I don’t want to call them failures — but misses, that he was very proud of this,” Kevin said. “We felt it was an overwhelming success. He loved showing it off.”\n\nAnd Kevin was proud, too — of the book he helped write, of his dad seeing his dream through, and of everything that came from an excuse to spend a summer together, father and son, drinking at bars and bonding like pals one last time.\n\n“For two people who had absolutely no business doing a book — I’m not a writer, I’ve never written more than 12 pages in my life; Randy’s a career salesman — to have a finished project that started with absolutely nothing and have it end up like that,\" Kevin said, \"is incredible.”\n\n\"Yooper Bars\" is available on amazon.com.\n\nJohn Carlisle writes about people and places in Michigan.

I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two/ Walking the floor over you.\"\n\nGlen Campbell — “Rhinestone Cowboy”\n\n\"Rhinestone Cowboy\" defined Campbell's career. It was a country-pop hit that kept the singer balanced between each world.\n\nCarrie Underwood — “Before He Cheats”\n\nCountry music has its share of anthems for scorned women, but Underwood’s signature song is the gold standard. An instant classic upon its release in 2006.\n\nCharley Pride — “Kiss an Angel Good Morning”\n\nWith the biggest of his dozens of hits, the Country Music Hall of Famer shared the key to marital bliss: “Kiss an angel good morning/ And love her like the devil when you get back home.”\n\nDavid Allan Coe — “You Never Even Called Me By My Name”\n\nJohn Prine didn’t want credit when he co-wrote this kiss-off to Music Row. But it was the perfect message to be delivered by Coe, perhaps country music’s most infamous outsider.\n\nWillie Nelson — “Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain”\n\nThe Red Headed Stranger narrates a story of emotional messiness with soothing clarity.\n\nJohnny Paycheck — “Take This Job and Shove It”\n\nIt spawned an eternal catchphrase, but don’t forget there’s another layer to Paycheck’s lone chart-topper: “My woman done left and took all the reasons I was working for.”\n\nTanya Tucker — “Delta Dawn”\n\nRecorded when she was just 13, Tanya Tucker’s first haunting hit is ironically about an aging Southern belle, one who's under the delusion that a long-gone suitor is still coming for her.\n\nPatsy Cline — “Crazy”\n\nIt’s been covered by the likes of Neil Young, LeAnn Rimes and Linda Ronstadt, but no artist captured Willie Nelson’s lyrical poignancy the way Cline did with her 1961 version.\n\nKeith Urban — “Somebody Like You\"\n\nUrban sounds unstoppable on his 2002 chart-topper, a love song that's also wrapped up in his personal redemption.\n\nGarth Brooks — “The Dance”\n\nWhat one song could possibly capture the career of this country music giant? How about the 1990 entry showcasing Brooks’ unparalleled ability to embody a story worth singing for decades to come?\n\nCharlie Rich — “Behind Closed Doors”\n\nCountry love songs didn't get much more suggestive than Rich's 1973 hit.\n\nTennessee Ernie Ford — \"Sixteen Tons\"\n\nIt may be one of country’s most depressing songs, and in this genre, that’s saying something. Ford’s beyond saving in his 1955 recording, as he’s “sold my soul to the company store.”\n\nDwight Yoakam — “Guitars, Cadillacs”\n\nWhen he found himself in Hollywood with a broken heart and shattered dreams, Yoakam clung to hope with his \"guitars, Cadillacs (and) hillbilly music.\" Soon enough, it made him one of country's biggest stars.\n\nHank Williams Jr. — “Family Tradition”\n\nWhile he explained that he was only following in his dad’s rowdy footsteps, “Bocephus” also truly stepped out of Hank Sr.’s shadow with this 1979 smash.\n\nOak Ridge Boys — \"Elvira\"\n\nGiddy-up! We dare you to name a song that’s more fun to sing than this Oaks “oom-poppa” classic (named after an East Nashville street).\n\nRay Charles — \"You Don't Know Me\"\n\nCharles’ heartbreaking spin on the Eddy Arnold/Cindy Walker song is the pinnacle of his landmark album “Modern Sounds in Country & Western Music.”\n\nKenny Rogers — “The Gambler”\n\nRaise a glass to timeless advice.\n\nLittle Big Town — “Girl Crush”\n\nSome radio programmers were terrified of this 2014 song — in which Karen Fairchild sings of wanting to “taste (the) lips” of the woman who has her love interest’s attention — but listeners, critics and Music Row gave it a full embrace.\n\nLee Brice — “I Drive Your Truck”\n\nBrice’s powerful 2012 hit was inspired by a true story of a father who found comfort in driving the truck once owned by his son, who’d been killed while serving in Afghanistan.\n\nLacy J. Dalton — \"16th Avenue\"\n\nSeveral years after she found country stardom, Dalton made sure to tip her hat to those still chasing their dream on Nashville’s Music Row — aka 16th Avenue South.\n\nPorter Wagoner — “The Green, Green Grass of Home”\n\nBefore Tom Jones, Elvis and dozens of others put their spin on Curly Putman's classic, Wagoner first made it a hit. In a devastating twist, it turns out he's dreaming of his hometown while on death row.\n\nMerle Haggard — “Mama Tried”\n\nA slippy lead guitar, Haggard's sketched storytelling ... California country with \"Mama Tried.\"\n\nRandy Travis — “Forever and Ever, Amen”\n\nTravis lays out his devotion in his signature song, and listeners haven't stopped loving it since its release in 1987.\n\nRoy Acuff — “Wabash Cannonball”\n\nThis folk song about a mighty train had already been passed down for generations when Acuff cut it in 1936, and his version helped the \"Wabash\" legend spread around the world.\n\nGuy Clark — \"Desperados Waiting for a Train\"\n\nClark penned a beautiful tribute to his grandmother's boyfriend, Jack Prigg, \"an old school man of the world\" who would sing \"Red River Valley\" with the budding songwriter.\n\nBrooks & Dunn — \"Believe\"\n\nThe country duo won multiple awards for this soulful ballad of unwavering faith.\n\nThe Highwaymen — \"Highwayman\"\n\nOnly songwriting great Jimmy Webb could conjure up an epic theme worthy of country's greatest supergroup, composed of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson.\n\nLarry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers — \"All the Gold in California\"\n\nIn soaring three-part harmony, the Gatlins issued a warning to all who head west with stars in their eyes: \"It don't matter at all where you've played before/\n\nCalifornia's a brand-new game.\"\n\nCharlie Daniels Band — \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\"\n\nIn 1979, Daniels found the perfect showcase for his fiery fiddle technique — a familiar tale about a boy named Johnny who makes a bet with the devil (and wins).\n\nJoe Diffie — “John Deere Green”\n\nAgainst all odds, tractors have nothing to do with Diffie's 1993 song. Instead, \"John Deere Green\" is the color used to paint \"Billy Bob loves Charlene\" on the town's water tower.\n\nEarl Thomas Conley — \"Holding Her and Loving You\"\n\nIt doesn’t have a chorus, but “Holding Her and Loving You” has quite a hook. Conley counts down the hardest things he'll ever do, and the song's title tops the list.\n\nDixie Chicks — \"Wide Open Spaces\"\n\nWith the title track of their breakthrough album — about a young woman who's ready to spread her wings — the Dixie Chicks truly took flight.\n\nKacey Musgraves — \"Follow Your Arrow\"\n\nOn top of taking mainstream country into new territory with its \"Kiss lots of boys/ Or kiss lots of girls\" line, \"Follow Your Arrow\" was a powerful mission statement from Musgraves, as she's proven to have great artistic instincts.\n\nPatty Loveless — \"How Can I Help You Say Goodbye\"\n\n\"Time will ease your pain,\" Loveless sang. That may be true, but this tearjerker about carrying on after a move, a divorce and the death of a parent still stings 25 years later.\n\nSugarland — “Stay”\n\nWhat if \"Jolene\" could have given her side of the story? On Sugarland's massive 2007 hit, Jennifer Nettles sings from the perspective of a mistress, who begs her lover to stay before deciding she's tired of waiting.\n\nMartina McBride — \"Independence Day\"\n\nIt's often falsely assumed to be a patriotic song, but McBride's triumphant anthem is actually about a woman breaking free of an abusive relationship.\n\nLee Ann Womack — \"I Hope You Dance\"\n\nWhether you're singing it to your kids, a loved one or yourself, Womack's plea to live life to the fullest and take chances truly resonates.\n\nK.T. Oslin — \"80's Ladies\"\n\nOslin rocketed through the decades on her 1987 hit, which fittingly sounds very much like a product of its time. \"Now we're 80's ladies/ There ain't been much these ladies ain't tried.\"\n\nJohn Anderson — \"Swingin’ \"\n\nSure, it's about swinging on the porch (is it really, though?), but few country hits have strutted the way Anderson's feisty, horn-spiked 1983 hit does.\n\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band — \"Fishin’ in the Dark\"\n\n\"You and me going fishing in the dark/ Lying on our backs and counting the stars.\" NGDB's classic is all about simple pleasures, and listening to it is one, too.\n\nKenny Chesney — “The Good Stuff”\n\nKenny's bartender teaches him a valuable lesson: \"The good stuff\" isn't booze; it's the memories you make with your loved ones.\n\nGeorge Jones and Tammy Wynette — \"Golden Ring\"\n\nGeorge and Tammy's greatest duet explains that \"only love\" can transform a \"cold metallic thing\" into something more.\n\nLuke Bryan — “Drink a Beer”\n\nBryan didn't write this song, but he made a powerful connection to it, relating it to the deaths of his brother and sister. He sings about learning of the death of a friend and going to the pier they would sit at to \"watch the sunset disappear and drink a beer.\"\n\nLefty Frizzell — \"If You’ve Got the Money, I’ve Got the Time\"\n\nSome things never change. In 1950, Frizzell kicked off his celebrated career with this No. 1 tune about painting the town red and going \"honky tonkin.'\"\n\nToby Keith — \"How Do You Like Me Now\"\n\nKeith was already an established star, but he didn't really crank up the attitude until this 1999 hit, in which he rubs his success in the face of an unrequited love.\n\nWaylon Jennings — \"Only Daddy That’ll Walk the Line\"\n\n\"Everybody knows you've been stepping on my toes/ And I'm getting pretty tired of it.\" The outlaw legend is barely holding it together on his seething 1968 hit.\n\nEmmylou Harris, Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt — \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\"\n\nThe iconic trio finds exquisite harmony on a Rodney Crowell composition.\n\nHank Williams — “Your Cheatin’ Heart”\n\nSome consider this Williams entry, a can't-miss in country music history, to define the genre.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/01/26/phoenix-arizona-bucket-list/22363587/", "title": "Ultimate Arizona bucket list: 50 things to do in Phoenix", "text": "Sonja Haller\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nThe Phoenix area is full of cool things to see and do.

Like driving laws and school curricula, alcohol is regulated individually by state governments.\n\nWhat do our nation’s drinking laws look like? While some things stay consistent − you need to be 21 to purchase alcohol and you cannot drink and drive − almost everything else varies per state.\n\nSo before you start your cross-country road trip or head across state lines for a barbecue, here are the things you need to know about America’s liquor laws.\n\nBuying alcohol on Sundays\n\n\"Blue laws,\" or those designed to limit what people can do on Sundays, have mostly been repealed across the United States. We can still see the remnants in the nine states that allow counties to dictate the sale of alcohol on Sundays. Some counties have the power to limit all sales of alcohol on Sunday; other states allow counties to determine only whether liquor stores can open.\n\nA few states close state liquor stores on Sundays (Mississippi, North Carolina, Texas and Utah).\n\nBuying alcohol in grocery stores\n\nIf you're used to throwing beer or wine in your grocery cart – or having to drive to a different store to complete your shopping – the opposite might seem alien to you.\n\nThere is no common rule across the United States on whether alcohol can be sold in grocery stores.\n\nWhether hard liquor can be sold in grocery stores usually depends on whether the state is a \"control\" state. That means state governments control the wholesale retail of distilled spirits and, in some cases, wine and beer. According to the National Beverage Control Association, 17 states fall into the \"control\" category, and in 13 of those, the government controls retail sales for off-premises consumption, meaning there are state-owned or state-designated liquor stores.\n\nMany states have moved to expand what can be sold in grocery stores to include beer and wine, but only 21 states allow the sale of hard alcohol outside liquor stores.\n\nNo happy hour\n\nA handful of states do not allow \"happy hours,\" or a time when drinks are discounted, usually immediately after the end of the typical workday.\n\nEight states don't allow for after-work discounts. They are:\n\nAlaska\n\nIndiana\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOklahoma\n\nRhode Island\n\nUtah\n\nVermont\n\nElection Day limits\n\nJust two states, Massachusetts and Alaska, still prohibit the sale of alcohol on Election Day while polls are open. That dates back to a Prohibition-era ruling at a time when some saloons served as polling places.\n\nIn both states, the sale of alcohol can resume after polls close.\n\nWeak drinks\n\nUp until 2019, all beer served at bars or sold in grocery stores in Utah had to be at or below 3.2% alcohol. That has now been increased to 5%. The only place to find more alcoholic beer is at distilleries or liquor stores.\n\nAdditionally, cocktails in Utah must have \"shots\" of 1.5 ounces of primary liquor and no more than 2.5 ounces of spirits total in one drink.\n\nOther unique liquor laws\n\nUtah is also home to other unique laws about liquor. The state prohibits the sale of miniature alcohol bottles, or \"minis\", with the exception of airplanes and hotels. Residents also are forbidden to ship alcohol to their homes; it's considered a felony. There go the wine-of-the-month clubs!\n\nNevada, in contrast to its neighbor Utah, is the only state where you can buy alcohol any hour of the day. Unlike other states with a designated time that bars must close (usually 1 to 4 a.m.), Nevada has no required \"last call.\"\n\nLouisiana is known for originating the \"drive-thru daquiris\" of the 1980s, a business model seemingly antithetical to nationwide laws against drunken driving. But these businesses operate legally, and patrons are advised to keep the container closed until returning home. In Louisiana, so long as the lid is intact, no straw is protruding from the cup and the cup’s contents have not been removed, you're good to go! The model has expanded to Mississippi, Texas and Florida.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2022/10/28/best-chocolate-shops-phoenix-scottsdale-and-gilbert/10555495002/", "title": "From boxes to bars, here's your guide to the best chocolate shops in ...", "text": "Valentine's Day is, arguably, all about chocolate.

They use excellent ingredients, many of which they source locally to create unique flavor profiles. What's more is they source their beans ethically.\n\nCacao farmers have long been exploited, forced to sell beans at unsustainably low prices, which in some cases, mean children forgo school to help on the farm in order to keep costs down. Purchasing Fair Trade cacao means that farmers are paid a Fairtrade Minimum Price for their goods. That safeguards farmers when market prices drop leading to greater stability.

In 2021, Food and Wine named them on their best chocolate in America list.\n\nAll the products are free from soy, corn syrup and artificial flavors and they use only three ingredients in the dark chocolate: cacao beans, cocoa butter from the same beans and organic cane sugar, meaning it's both vegan and gluten-free.\n\nA must-try is their Sonoran white chocolate, a silver medal winner at the 2019 International Chocolate Awards.\n\nIn addition to bars, Zak's offers a variety of bonbons with flavors like prickly pear, smoky star anise and mocha; brownie flights; drinking chocolates and other local goodies. The Eliztaks also teach the participants more about chocolate through private virtual events and in-person events.\n\nFor Valentine's Day, Zak's has added six choices to its menu to include boxed chocolates, including a heart box, mugs and the love bar, a square bar made of house blend 69 percent dark chocolate and packaged in a window box with a silver bow.\n\nDetails: 6990 E.

Eventually, they narrowed their offerings down to just chocolate.\n\nDon't let self-taught fool you into thinking they are amateurs. The pair have won multiple gold medals at the International Chocolate Awards, including in 2021 for their cappuccino and crystalized ginger bars and Suntory whiskey and Asian pear caramels.

After spending 11 years in Nepal, India and Tibet, studying meditation she returned to the United States with the goal of either teaching it or taking people on meditation trips.\n\nBut, she found thatpeople felt intimidated by meditation. \"So I thought, I'll make this chocolate and tell them to let it melt in their mouths, they shift from an unconscious eating to a particular moment,\" said Reinhardt.\n\nShe researched the health benefits of chocolate and created organic, dairy-free, vegan, soy-free, gluten-free, GMO-free, Paleo-friendly and Rainforest Alliance-certified bars.\n\nEach bar has nine pieces engraved with symbols of earth, fire, water, wind and space and the letters for om, ah and hum to represent enlightened body, speech and mind. She also adds floral essences to all of her chocolates.\n\nThe chocolates arepresented in a beautiful, glossy square pouches in different colors.\n\nWhether you practice meditation or not, it's worth trying these chocolates just for their flavors.

That Christmas visit cemented the alliance that would win World War II and built the post-war democratic world.\n\nZelensky compared his nation’s resistance against Russia with Britain’s lonely defiance of the Nazis in the days before the US entered World War II during a video address to the UK Parliament earlier this year, and his arrival in the US capital will sharpen the parallels to the earlier meeting of Churchill and President Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nHis visit is unfolding amid extraordinary security. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wouldn’t even confirm the early reports that she’d welcome Zelensky to the US Capitol in an unexpected coda to her speakership, saying on Tuesday evening, “We don’t know yet. We just don’t know.”\n\nA White House reception for Zelensky, who sources said was traveling to the US on Tuesday night, will above all be an unmistakable sign of US and Western support for Ukraine’s battle against Putin, who says the country has no right to exist. The war exemplifies what Biden has framed as a global struggle between democracy and totalitarianism, which he has put at the center of his foreign policy.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who visited Ukraine earlier this month, said on CNN’s “AC360” that Zelensky was coming to Washington on a specific mission. “What he is trying to do is draw a direct correlation between our support and the survival and support and future victory of Ukraine,” Gallego, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said.\n\nZelensky poised to collect massive US military aid\n\nBiden will announce an additional $1.8 billion in security assistance to Ukraine during the visit, with the coveted Patriot missile systems as part of that package, a US official told CNN’s Phil Mattingly. Washington also plans to send Ukraine precision bomb kits to convert less sophisticated munitions into “smart bombs” that could help it target Russian defensive lines, sources told CNN’s Pentagon team. Zelensky’s visit also comes as Congress is poised to sign off on another $45 billion in aid for Ukraine and NATO allies, deepening the commitment that has helped Kyiv’s forces inflict an unexpectedly bloody price on Putin’s forces.\n\nThe decision on Patriots, which would satisfy a long-standing Ukrainian request, reflects a US process of matching its aid to the shifting strategy of Russia’s assault. The system would help Kyiv better counter Russia’s brutal missile attacks on cities and electricity installations, which it has mounted in an effective attempt to weaponize bitter winter weather to break the will of Ukrainian civilians.\n\nThe meeting between Biden and Zelensky, who have spoken multiple times by phone and video link-ups but have not met in person since the invasion, comes at a vital moment in the war. Biden has for months cautiously calibrated US shipments of arms and weapons systems in a way designed to save Ukraine but to avoid escalating the conflict into a disastrous direct clash between NATO and Russia. He, for instance, rejected Ukrainian calls for the West to enforce a no-fly zone over the country. The Patriots – a long range-aerial defense system – would represent the deepest US dive into the conflict so far.\n\nFormer NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, Wesley Clark said that Zelensky’s trip reflects a critical moment when the destiny of a war that Ukraine cannot win without upgraded US support could be decided before Russia can regroup.\n\n“This is a window of opportunity for Ukraine and a window of danger as well,” Clark told CNN’s John Berman on “AC360” on Tuesday.\n\n“Russia’s weak, (but) Russia will be stronger. This is a period where the United States needs to pour in the support. … This is the window, President Zelensky knows it – if he is going to defeat, with US support, the Russian aggression in Ukraine,” Clark said.\n\n“Wait until the summer and it will be an entirely different battlefield.”\n\nHow will Putin respond to Zelensky’s visit?\n\nBut the highly public nature of Zelensky’s visit, and the expected announcement regarding Patriots, also risks further provoking Putin when he is signaling that, as disastrous as the war has been for Russia’s troops, he’s in for the long haul, betting the West’s commitment will eventually ebb.\n\nHis visit to Congress will also play into an increasingly important debate on Capitol Hill over Ukraine aid with Republicans set to take over the House majority in the new year. Some pro-Donald Trump members, who will have significant leverage in the thin GOP majority, have warned that billions of dollars in US cash that have been sent to Ukraine should instead be shoring up the US southern border with a surge of new migrants expected within days.\n\nConscious of pressure from his right flank, the possible next speaker, GOP Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, has warned that Ukraine should not expect a “blank check” from the new House. Even though Ukraine still has strong Republican support in the Senate, it’s this kind of shifting political dynamic that appears to inform Kremlin perceptions about how long US resolve will last in a conflict on which Putin’s political survival may well depend.\n\nZelensky’s pre-Christmas trip promises to be the greatest public relations coup yet for the media savvy comic actor-turned-president, who has cleverly tapped into the history and patriotic mythology of Western nations in a series of video addresses to lawmakers from war-torn Kyiv. Often, while grateful for outside support, he has seemed to be trying to shame the West to do more and to create a deeper understanding among voters for the trials facing Ukraine.\n\nIn March, for instance, Zelensky evoked Mount Rushmore and Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I have a Dream Speech” during a virtual address to Congress. He also referred to two days of infamy in modern history when Americans directly experienced the fear of aerial bombardment.\n\n“Remember Pearl Harbor, terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember it,” Zelensky said. “Remember September 11, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities, independent territories, into battlefields. When innocent people were attacked, attacked from air, just like nobody else expected it, you could not stop it. Our country experiences the same every day.”\n\nWhen Zelensky arrives in Washington, he might well experience the same revelation that Churchill did over the capital’s blazing lights at Christmas after months in the dark of air raid blackouts back home.\n\nThe wartime British leader sailed to the United States aboard HMS Duke of York, dodging U-boats in the wintery Atlantic and took a plane from the coast of Virginia to Washington, where he was met on December 22, 1941, by President Franklin Roosevelt before their joint press conference the next day.\n\nOver days of brainstorming and meetings – fueled by Churchill’s regime of sherry with breakfast, Scotch and sodas for lunch, champagne in the evening and a tipple of 90-year-old brandy before bed – the two leaders plotted the defeat of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan and laid the foundation of the Western alliance that Biden has reinvigorated in his support for Ukraine.\n\nChurchill, who had pined for US involvement in World War II for months and knew it was the key to defeating Adolf Hitler, said during his visit, “I spend this anniversary and festival far from my country, far from my family, and yet I cannot truthfully say that I feel far from home.”\n\nZelensky is sure to get that kind of hero’s welcome and will hope that extra US support will mean that Washington has truly “drawn the sword for freedom and cast away the scabbard,” as Churchill said of the Roosevelt administration in his address to Congress on December 26, 1941.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader is likely to appreciate the historical parallels. He paraphrased one of Churchill’s most famous wartime speeches in an emotional address to British members of parliament in March.\n\n“We will not surrender, we will not lose, we will go to the end,” he said.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/politics/gallery/zelensky-us-visit/index.html", "title": "Photos: Zelensky's wartime visit to US | CNN Politics", "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting with President Joe Biden in Washington to announce an additional $2 billion security assistance package for Ukraine.

It amounts to a remarkable moment 10 months into the war.\n\nThe wartime visit is meant to demonstrate in stirring fashion the continued American commitment to Ukraine at a moment when Biden's ability to maintain that support at home and abroad is being tested.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/world/volodymyr-zelensky-grit-defiance/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Zelensky's grit and defiance epitomize the nation he leads ...", "text": "This story was adapted from the December 22 edition of CNN’s Meanwhile in America, the daily email about US politics for global readers. Click here to read past editions and subscribe.\n\nCNN —\n\nIf ever a leader personified their nation, it is Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nUnbroken, defiant, a civilian forced to don green military garb, the Ukrainian president spent Wednesday in Washington, DC, on his daring first trip out of his country since Russia’s brutal, unprovoked invasion in February. He expressed heartfelt gratitude for America’s multi-billion dollar weapons and ammunition lifeline – but made clear he’d never stop asking for more.\n\nAppearing with extraordinary symbolism at the White House with President Joe Biden and before a joint meeting of Congress, Zelensky also bore sobering news. A long, bloody battle for freedom, democracy, and ultimately, the survival of a nation Russian President Vladimir Putin says has no right to exist – a fight for which it’s still not clear the free world has the stomach – is nowhere near over.\n\nThe comic actor-turned-wartime hero effectively put the fate of millions of Ukrainians in the hands of American lawmakers, taxpayers and families at a time when there is growing skepticism among the incoming Republican House majority about the cost of US involvement.\n\nAt an emotional peak of his speech in the House chamber, Zelensky handed Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris a Ukrainian flag he retrieved from the hottest battle front at Bakhmut on Tuesday.\n\n“Our heroes … asked me to bring this flag to you, to the US Congress, to members of the House of Representatives and senators whose decisions can save millions of people,” he said.\n\n“So, let these decisions be taken. Let this flag stay with you.”\n\nThat imagery encapsulated Zelensky’s mastery of historical allusion and public relations theater. He argued the war in Ukraine was at a turning point – drawing an analogy to the Battle of Saratoga, a rallying point for an outgunned army against a superpower enemy in America’s revolutionary war. He evoked the heroism of US soldiers dug into freezing foxholes in the Battle of the Bulge during Christmas 1944, which thwarted the last effort by Nazi Germany to repel the allied liberation of Europe. And he cited wartime President Franklin Roosevelt to promise a certain, hard-won victory for freedom.\n\n“The American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory,” Zelensky said, quoting FDR. “The Ukrainian people will win too, absolutely.”\n\nHis broader message was that Ukraine’s fight was not just some flashpoint over an ancient grudge on the fringes of the old Soviet empire. It was that his fight is America’s and everyone’s – to hold back tyranny and save global democracy.\n\n“The battle is not only for life, freedom and security of Ukrainians or any other nation that Russia attempts to conquer,” he said. “This struggle will define what world our children and grandchildren will live in and their children and grandchildren.”\n\nZelensky’s multiple audiences\n\nLike any accomplished politician, Zelensky spoke to multiple audiences at once.\n\n— To Putin, who thought he would topple Zelensky and his nation in a February blitzkrieg, he sent a signal of heroic resistance embraced by the US – after flying to Washington on an US Air Force jet, seeking to show Russians are now fighting a war that can never be won.\n\n— To Americans, Zelensky professed deep thanks for tens of billions of dollars in weapons and aid offered and to come. Implicitly, he argued they couldn’t abandon this gritty, independence hero without also suppressing something of their own patriotic national identify.\n\n— To the incoming House Republican majority, some of whose members want to halt aid, the Ukrainian leader’s hero’s welcome in the chamber suggested they would be shamed if they choose to forsake him.\n\n— To Europeans, enduring their own grim winter of high electricity and heating prices after cutting off from Russian energy, and who may be minded to push for an end to the conflict on Putin’s terms, Zelensky showed that the West is united and that Biden means it when he said Wednesday the US is in “for as long as it takes.”\n\n— And to Ukrainians hunkered down in basements and to soldiers on the front line, he proved that they are not alone as Russian attacks on their power plants effectively weaponize winter.\n\n“We will celebrate Christmas, maybe candlelit. Not because it’s more romantic, no, but because there will be no electricity,” he said. “We’ll celebrate Christmas and even if there is no electricity, the light of our faith, in ourselves, will not be put out.”\n\nBehind the pomp, political questions about US staying power\n\nBut Zelensky’s inspirational rhetoric and heroic bearing couldn’t disguise the uncertainties and risks of a war in which the US is effectively now fighting a proxy battle with its nuclear superpower rival, Russia.\n\nZelensky repeatedly pointed out that despite the largesse of US artillery support and the imminent arrival of high-tech weapons like a Patriot missile battery that Biden unveiled Wednesday, his nation was still outmanned and outgunned.\n\n“What’s going to happen after Patriots are installed? After that, we will send another signal to President Biden that we would like to get more Patriots,” Zelensky said during a White House news conference. In his address to Congress, he said: “We have artillery, yes, thank you. We have it. Is it enough? Honestly, not really.” Both times, he was joking but that didn’t mean that he wasn’t deadly serious. In his address to Congress, Zelensky pleaded with Washington to send more offensive weapons to spur victory.\n\n“I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves,” Zelensky told lawmakers.\n\nHis comment addressed a rare point of contention amid the ceremony. While Ukraine is desperate for weapons to take the fight harder to Russia, his country’s fate is not the only thing that Biden must consider.\n\nThe president has limited the potency of the weapons he sends into the battle, balancing the need to defend a European democracy with the desire not to trigger a disastrous direct clash with Russia and to avoid crossing often invisible red lines whose locations are known only to Putin.\n\n“Now you say, why don’t we just give Ukraine everything there is to give?” Biden said at the White House, explaining that pushing overwhelming force into Ukraine would risk fracturing the transatlantic consensus needed to support the war.\n\n“We’re going to give Ukraine whart it needs to be able to defend itself, to be able to succeed and succeed in the battlefield,” Biden said, arguing that European allies understand the stakes intimately. But he added: “They’re not looking to go to war with Russia. They’re not looking for a third World War.” And nor is he.\n\nZelensky also had a message for some members of the incoming GOP House majority, who are skeptical of massive aid for Ukraine, and the possible new House speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who warned again after the speech on Wednesday that he did not support a blank check for Ukraine.\n\n“Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way,” Zelensky said.\n\nHowever, given partisan fury that will erupt in a divided Washington next year, there is no guarantee that America’s lawmakers will even be able to fund their own government – let alone one fighting for its survival thousands of miles away.\n\nSeveral Republican members who have expressed reservations about aid to Ukraine – like Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Matt Gaetz of Florida – did not stand to applaud when Zelensky was introduced.\n\nZelensky’s visit recalled an earlier visit to Washington that started 81 years ago Thursday, by another leader of a dark, bomb-ravaged nation, desperate for US help to turn the tide toward victory over totalitarianism. Pelosi, likely presiding over her final great congressional occasion, recalled how her father was in the House, as a Maryland congressman, when British Prime Minister Winston Churchill addressed Congress on December 26, 1941. Zelensky borrowed one of the great statesman’s greatest lines, as he also presented himself as the symbol of a nation’s defiance.\n\n“Ukraine holds its lines and will never surrender,” he said.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/12/politics/joe-biden-nuclear-message-putin-cnntv-analysis/index.html", "title": "Biden sends a careful but chilling new nuclear message to Putin in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s never going to feel normal to hear a president discussing the danger of “Armageddon” – especially now, on camera.\n\nBut Joe Biden used an exclusive CNN interview on Tuesday to send another careful, yet clear and chilling message to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the disastrous consequences of using nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe first president since the 1980s to really have to game out calculations about nuclear arsenals and deterrence, Biden was asked by Jake Tapper whether he thought that Putin – who has warned he is prepared to use every option in Russia’s arsenal – might consider detonating one of the world’s most heinous weapons as an act of desperation in a losing war.\n\nBiden replied: “I don’t think he will.”\n\nBut the President, who first touched on this subject at an off-camera fundraiser in New York last week, made crystal clear he was sending a public message to Putin about the dangers of thinking that using a lower yield, tactical nuclear bomb would be an isolated event.\n\n“What I am talking about, I am talking to Putin. He, in fact, cannot continue with impunity to talk about the use of a tactical nuclear weapon as if that’s a rational thing to do,” Biden said, before warning of dangerous consequences of such a move.\n\n“The mistakes get made, the miscalculation could occur, no one could be sure what would happen and it could end in Armageddon,” he said, again stressing that a nuclear blast that kills thousands of people could lead to events barreling way out of control.\n\nThe danger of escalation\n\nBiden is stating the fear of some strategists who warn about a ladder of escalation that could occur if a nuclear bomb is used and triggers reprisals by the West – even though any initial US response would certainly go no further than conventional military action.\n\nHe also appears to be trying to create a narrative of deterrence around the specific situation in Ukraine. The logic of the US and Russia’s long-range strategic nuclear arsenals is that the use of them is deterred because a conflict would be suicidal for both sides. That equation does not exist in Ukraine, since the country has no nuclear arsenal and it’s hard to conclude that it represents a vital national interest that would lead Washington to respond in kind to Putin going nuclear. By stressing that even a tactical device – which could be small enough to destroy an airbase or large enough to reduce a city to ruins – could lead to something worse, Biden seems to be almost seeking to create a new chain of calculations in Putin’s mind.\n\nTwo moments in Tapper’s interview brought home the burden now borne by the man who is followed everywhere he goes by a military officer carrying the nation’s nuclear codes.\n\nFirst the CNN anchor asked the President to state the US red line for the US and NATO in Ukraine and what Washington would do if Putin bombed a nuclear plant in Ukraine or set off a tactical nuclear weapon.\n\n“It would be irresponsible for me to talk about what we would or wouldn’t do,” Biden said.\n\nThen, Tapper prodded the President over whether the Pentagon had gamed out scenarios. Biden soberly replied: “The Pentagon didn’t have to be asked.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch the full exclusive interview with President Joe Biden 15:20 - Source: CNN\n\nExpert: nuclear use in Ukraine still ‘not a probable event’\n\nMost experts and strategists estimate that there are many reasons why Putin would stop short of using a nuclear weapon – among them the possible risk of radioactive fallout crossing into Russia or the fact that the use of a tactical nuclear weapon may not actually be a sensible strategic option in the war.\n\nBut the fact he’s pushed himself into a corner, along with his obliviousness to civilian loss of life underscored again by his callous assaults on Ukrainian cities this week, suggests that a humanitarian impulse is unlikely to be part of his calculation. And Biden himself said in the interview that while he believed Putin was a “rational actor,” he had made significant miscalculations and his objectives were not rational. That leaves open the possibility of even more decisions that appear irrational to the West but may seem reasonable in Putin’s warped logic.\n\nThat is why Biden and experts who have dedicated their careers to staving off a nuclear apocalypse say the possibility that Putin may go nuclear must be taken so seriously – even if the chances remain very low and the US would likely be able to detect well ahead of time if Russia’s atomic devices were on the move.\n\n“It’s not a probable event. It’s not even likely,” said Joseph Cirincione, a nuclear non-proliferation expert and former president of the Plowshares Fund, said on CNN’s “Newsroom” on Tuesday.\n\n“But this is a low probability, high consequence event. If he uses even one nuclear weapon, he’s bringing us into a whole new world. He’s causing massive damage. And he’s running the risk of escalation with exchanges from the West that could lead to further exchanges, et cetera.”\n\nCirincione explained that even if Putin’s saber rattling represented a political threat designed to scare the West, it cannot be discounted.\n\n“He has the means. He has the doctrine that allows him to use it. And he has the motive. He is losing this war. He has to do something to try to turn the tide of battle in desperation. He might turn to a nuclear weapon.”\n\nWhile some critics have faulted the President for mentioning words like “Armageddon” and comparing his rhetoric to that of Putin, the motivations of the two men are very different. At a minimum, the Russian leader is boasting about nuclear weapons to scare the world. Biden is speaking publicly to stave off the possibility of disaster.\n\nBiden doesn’t rule out meeting Putin over basketball star\n\nOne reason the war in Ukraine is so dangerous is that nearly eight months in, there remains no prospect of any genuine diplomatic process that could defuse it. Ukraine’s forces, using US and allied weapons systems, are making remarkable progress on the battlefield and are determined to repel an unprovoked invasion that has caused carnage and extensive destruction. Putin has thrown so much personal prestige and Russian blood into the war he can hardly afford any outcome he cannot spin as a win, despite his autocratic grip on Russia.\n\nBiden signaled in the Tapper interview that he saw no real rationale to meet Putin when both leaders are expected to be at the G20 summit in Indonesia next month. But he did leave one intriguing door open to the Russian leader, saying he’d sit down with Putin if he were willing to discuss the fate of US basketball star Brittney Griner, who was sentenced in August to nine years in prison after pleading guilty to drugs smuggling. The US says Griner and another American, former US Marine Paul Whelan, have been wrongfully detained. Washington has offered to swap jailed Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout for the two Americans.\n\n“Look, I have no intention of meeting with him, but look, if he came to me at the G20 and said, ‘I want to talk about the release of Griner,’ I would meet with him, but that would depend,” Biden said.\n\nThe President also downplayed the idea that more generally there was anything to talk about.\n\n“He’s acted brutally, I think he’s committed war crimes, and so I don’t… see any rationale to meet with him now.”", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/politics/joe-biden-europe-trip-vladimir-putin/index.html", "title": "Biden's European trip will be heavy on displays of Western unity, but ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden and his fellow world leaders hope to finalize and unveil a package of new measures to punish Russia, help Ukraine and demonstrate Western unity at a string of emergency summits in Europe this week.\n\nBut aside from a dramatic wartime show of resolve, few observers believe anything the leaders can agree upon will be enough to end the bloodshed in Ukraine or dissuade Russian President Vladimir Putin from continuing his attacks that are increasingly harming civilians.\n\nSince the prospect of the NATO leaders summit was first broached roughly two weeks ago, American and European officials have been discussing potential announcements for leaders to make at the conclusion of the gathering, according to several people familiar with the plans.\n\nThat could include new rounds of sanctions on Russian oligarchs, additional measures restricting the country’s finances and new steps to limit import of Russian energy products. Discussions are also underway on what measures can be unveiled to provide more support for Ukraine, including new shipments of military assistance or financial aid to bolster the country’s defenses.\n\nAnd Biden has left open the option of scaling up US troop deployments to NATO members along the alliance’s eastern edge, reinforcing American commitment to European defense at a critical moment.\n\nBut the stark reality that those moves are unlikely to curb Putin’s war will loom over Biden’s visit to Brussels for a snap meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, along with a special session of the European Council and a gathering of the G7. Biden could also add another stop in Eastern Europe, potentially Poland, officials have said. He departs Washington on Wednesday for the high-level diplomatic maneuvers.\n\nWhile Biden has been successful in rallying European and Asian allies behind a punishing set of sanctions and unparalleled levels of military assistance, he and his NATO counterparts have drawn lines at where their support will end. And while all parties seem to support a diplomatic resolution to the crisis, US and European officials say the parameters of such a settlement remain murky.\n\nThat leaves open how Biden’s visit to Europe – one of the inflection moments of his presidency – can alter the course of the worst conflict in Europe since World War II. And it poses another discussion point that world leaders must begin to broach: What happens if, or when, Ukraine can no longer withstand Russia’s assault?\n\n“They’re going to have to look at what happens if Ukraine is lost,” said retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, a former NATO supreme allied commander. “After they have weighed the problem of what happens if Ukraine falls, they have to consider what more can be done to sustain Ukraine in the fight. Yes, there’s a risk. There’s always a risk in dealing with Mr. Putin.”\n\nBiden challenged to be ‘the leader of the world’\n\nBiden was publicly challenged by Ukraine’s leader last week to assume responsibility for bringing an end to the fighting. In an emotional address to Congress, in which he called for a no-fly zone and help procuring fighter jets, President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke directly to Biden, who was watching from his private library on the third floor of the White House.\n\n“Being the leader of the world means being the leader of peace,” Zelensky said in English.\n\nBiden was also challenged by Ukraine’s former President, Petro Poroshenko, to visit Ukraine as a “symbol of our solidarity” during his trip to Europe this week.\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s Jim Acosta Saturday afternoon, Poroshenko called Biden a “very good friend of mine and a very good friend of Ukraine,” adding that a visit by Biden would be “an extremely right step to demonstrate that the whole world is together with us against Russia.”\n\nThose personal appeals will have resonated with a man who vowed while seeking office to restore American leadership, renew US alliances and defend democracy from the creeping tide of authoritarianism.\n\nNowhere will that challenge be more pertinent than at this week’s emergency talks, where leaders are looking to Biden for direction and purpose as the war in Ukraine grinds ahead.\n\n“He’s challenging Biden to live up to his responsibilities as a leader of the West, a leader of the democratic community of nations. And he presented the de facto challenge to NATO,” said Ian Brzezinski, a deputy assistant secretary of defense for Europe and NATO in the George W. Bush administration.\n\n“He was saying if NATO is not up to this challenge, we have to think of other security arrangements,” Brzezinski said. “What a powerful challenge to the relevance of NATO in this day and age. That sets the context for … (the) summit meeting.”\n\nThe limits of supporting Ukraine on full display ahead of trip\n\nYet as the summits were announced last week, some European diplomats revealed concern at what they viewed as a lack of major steps available for the leaders to take at the high-profile gathering, which both Russia and Ukraine will be watching closely.\n\nMajor items that Ukraine wants, like help from NATO in establishing a no-fly zone or providing Soviet-era fighter jets, appear for now off the table as the US and its partners seek to avoid direct confrontation with Russia. That means any announcement coming out of the meetings would likely focus more on ramping up assistance that’s already being provided, including military and financial aid, or applying new sanctions on Russia.\n\nEuropean and US officials said discussions about announcements and a concluding joint statement were ongoing as countries look to settle on a decision or takeaway for the summit to produce.\n\n“The President is looking forward to seeing his counterparts face to face. I suspect they will have a number of new measures that they will be able to disclose and roll out during those conversations, but I’m not going to get ahead of them a few days in advance,” US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said last week on CNN.\n\nHaving a major announcement materialize during the summit could help underscore the current unity among the allies, which US officials say has surprised Putin as his military struggles with losses on the ground.\n\n“He miscalculated about the West. I think he thought that … there would be some scolding, maybe a couple of sanctions, but he could withstand it, and he could continue, and he could move on,” said Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine.\n\n“Instead, he has inspired a resurgence of NATO. And the West is united in opposition and trying to provide not only sort of strengthening NATO and the flank countries on Ukraine’s border, but also in providing support to Ukraine.”\n\nCountering China will be top of mind after Biden-Xi call\n\nThe upcoming summits will also present Biden an opportunity to take his counterparts’ temperature on another matter: What to do if Chinese President Xi Jinping decides to provide Russia military or economic support, as Putin has requested.\n\nOn a 110-minute call with Xi last week, Biden laid out the “implications and consequences” of going ahead with that support, according to the White House. But punishing China – the world’s second-largest economy – would be far more complicated than it has been with Russia, and would require the same unity with Europe, which hasn’t always agreed with Biden on how to approach Beijing.\n\n“This is an incredibly important summit. It is taking place on an extraordinary basis in the midst of a crisis. It is partly to make sure that we and our allies [are] on the same page, which is good. But it’s also very important for sending a signal to Vladimir Putin,” said Kurt Volker, a former US ambassador to NATO and special envoy for Ukraine.\n\nVolker identified several messages the alliance must send during its summit, including recommitting to the Article 5 guarantee of collective defense and making clear the use of nuclear weapons by Russia would warrant a Western response.\n\nBut he said NATO must also make clear that Ukraine – not a member of its grouping – is nonetheless a matter of critical importance to its members.\n\n“I think it’s very important that NATO also send a signal about Ukraine, that Ukraine’s survival as an independent and sovereign state in Europe is a NATO interest,” Volker said. “We don’t want to say what we don’t do. We don’t want to be too specific about what we will do. But we need to send a signal to Putin that we’re not going to sit by while he destroys and eliminates a sovereign European country.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/biden-macron-state-visit/index.html", "title": "Biden and Macron affirm commitment to Ukraine but diverge on ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday demonstrated a united front in addressing the ongoing war in Ukraine but offered divergent answers over their willingness to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin, relaying that they spent much their recent meeting discussing the invasion.\n\nBiden told reporters during a joint White House news conference with Macron that he “has no immediate plans” to contact Putin, but added that he’s prepared to speak with the Russian leader if he’s looking for a way to end the war in Ukraine. Biden also clarified that Putin has not done so yet.\n\n“He’s just miscalculated across the board,” Biden said of Putin following his bilateral meeting in the Oval Office with the French president. “And so the question is … how does he get himself out of the circumstances in? I’m prepared, if he’s willing to talk, to find out what he’s willing to do, but I’ll only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. I’m not going to do it on my own.”\n\nMacron said that once Ukraine sets conditions for a peace agreement, he’s willing to speak with Putin. The French leader told ABC’s “Good Morning America” earlier Thursday that he intends to speak with the Russian president in the coming days.\n\nFirm US support, Macron also relayed, “is very important, not just for the Ukrainians … but for the stability of our world today. Because if we consider that we can abandon the country and abandon the full respect of these principles, it means that there is no possible stability in this world,” pledging France’s own increased military, economic, and humanitarian support.\n\nThe French president’s trip to the White House alongside his spouse, Brigitte Macron, marks their second time as the guests of honor for a state visit, having first done so during Donald Trump’s administration in 2018. Thursday’s agenda for Biden’s first state visit since taking office has been filled with formal fanfare, with a list of events intended to highlight the strength of the critical relationship between the US and its oldest ally.\n\nAt the start of the news conference, Biden called the US and France the “strongest partners and our most capable allies,” taking care to note that “Emmanuel has also become a friend, as well as President of that great country.”\n\nIn his opening remarks, Macron praised Biden for fulfilling campaign commitments linked to addressing international challenges, saying “we’re being able to re-engage with you.”\n\n“I can only tell you once again how pleased we were with your choices that very much matched your history and your campaign commitments. The fact that you’re back on international challenges such as health and climate – it is really a New Deal,” the French leader said.\n\nEarlier Thursday morning, the Macrons had stepped onto the South Lawn of the White House for an official arrival ceremony, where a long slate of top French and US officials as well as thousands of other attendees greeted them. The pomp-filled program included military honors, a 21-gun salute, both countries’ national anthems, a review of troops and remarks by both leaders.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Biden referred to the Macrons as “close friends,” remarking that it is a “genuine honor to host you for the first state visit of my administration and to celebrate the current strength and vitality between France and the United States of America.”\n\nFrance, Biden said, is the United States’ “oldest ally” and an “unwavering partner,” referencing the history of the relationship from Lafayette to the beaches of Normandy. He said the alliance will “grow stronger for decades to come.”\n\nMacron referenced common values of the US and France, referring to the nations as “sisters in the fight for freedom” and calling for their countries “to become brothers in arms once more” in the midst of Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Macrons’ return for another state visit also follows a dramatic bounce-back in US-French relations compared to just a year ago, when Macron took the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multi-billion dollar defense contract. The rift appears to largely be behind them, and Biden and Macron have deepened their ties even more over the last year in their united efforts to combat the war on Ukraine.\n\nElysée announced that Macron gave the president four gifts: a vinyl and CD of the soundtrack to the film the first couple saw on their first date – “Un Homme et une Femme”, a cup from the house Christofle symbolizing links between France and the US, a sweater from the House Saint James and a watch from LIP Horlogerie. He also gave the first lady copies of “Madame Bovary” and “The Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, and Selected Essays.” He gifted Vice President Kamala Harris a model of the Ariane 5 rocket – a reference to common interests on space shared by the US and France.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden and White House staff present the menu during a media preview ahead of the state dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe American president and first lady presented a custom mirror made of fallen wood from the White House grounds that’s a reproduction of a mirror that hangs in the West Wing, according to the White House. Additionally, the French president was gifted a custom vinyl collection of great American musicians along with “an archival facsimile print of Thomas Edison’s 1877 Patent of the American Phonograph,” the White House said. And the first lady gifted Mrs. Macron a pendant necklace designed by a French-American designer.\n\nAfter the official arrival ceremony at the White House, Biden and Macron began bilateral discussions for an Oval Office meeting which lasted just under three hours. Kicking off the meeting, Biden reiterated the importance of the alliance.\n\n“Things are changing rapidly, really rapidly. And it’s really important we stay in close communication. Doesn’t mean that every single solitary thing we agree on. That does mean we agree on almost everything,” he said, adding that they would work toward strengthening “security and prosperity.”\n\nMacron said the Russian invasion in Ukraine will be one of their main topics of discussion and that “sustainable peace” is about respecting sovereign nations.\n\n“We want to build peace and a sustainable peace means full respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine but at the same time a new architecture to make sure we have a sustainable peace in the long run,” Macron added.\n\nUS and French officials had not expected the visit to yield any major deliverables, but both sides see it as an opportunity for the two countries to deepen their partnership on a slew of global challenges. The two sides expected to advance working group discussions that were launched in the wake of last year’s submarine affair to step up cooperation on space, cyberspace and energy issues.\n\nIn a joint statement following their meeting, the two leaders “outlined a shared vision to strengthen security and increase prosperity worldwide, combat climate change, build greater resilience to its effects, and advance democratic values.”\n\nOf particular note, the two leaders wrote they “strongly condemn Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and stress that intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.”\n\nOn the Indo-Pacific, the two leaders pledge to “continue to coordinate on our concerns regarding China’s challenge to the rules-based international order, including respect for human rights, and to work together with China on important global issues like climate change.”\n\nThere are areas of disagreement that were expected to come up.\n\nOne of the biggest points of tension will be over billions of dollars in electric vehicle subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which applies only to those manufactured in North America. Macron has slammed the measure as protectionist and French officials said he intends to raise the issue in meetings with Biden and congressional leaders. During Thursday’s news conference, Biden confirmed that they discussed the matter in detail.\n\nHe said the US makes “no apologies” for the Inflation Reduction Act, but he admitted there were “some glitches” and changes that may need to be made to the law.\n\nMacron agreed with Biden and reiterated his belief that they’re going to “resynchronize” and said he was not searching for an exemption for his economy but to “discuss the consequences of this legislation.”\n\nIn their joint statement, the US and France said they “reaffirm their shared goal of accelerating the global green energy transition. They look forward to the work of the U.S.-EU Taskforce on the Inflation Reduction Act to further strengthen the U.S.-EU partnership on clean energy and climate through mutually beneficial ways.”\n\nFollowing their morning at the White House, Jill Biden and Brigitte Macron also visited Planet Word, a language-focused museum in Washington. President Macron also attended a lunch at the US State Department.\n\nThursday evening, the Macrons returned to the White House for the first state dinner of the Biden administration. French guests include film director Claude Lelouch, Louvre Museum Director Laurence des Cars and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, according to the French official.\n\nA White House list of state dinner attendees also included comedian Stephen Colbert, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, fashion designer Christian Louboutin, Laurene Powell Jobs, ABC’s Robin Roberts, musician John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, Vogue’s Anna Wintour, film director Baz Luhrmann, as well as actresses Jennifer Garner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Ariana DeBose. Biden family members, Cabinet members, politicians and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle – including Republicans Steve Scalise and Kevin McCarthy – were also on the list of attendees. New Orleans native Jon Batiste is performing musical selections.\n\nOn Wednesday, Harris welcomed President Macron to NASA to celebrate the cooperation of both nations in space. The first family also held a private dinner with the Macrons ahead of Thursday’s formal state dinner.\n\nDuring the last leg of their US visit, the Macrons will travel to New Orleans on Friday to highlight new efforts to expand French language education in the US.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Donald Judd Betsy Klein Sam Fossum", "Maegan Vazquez", "Donald Judd", "Betsy Klein", "Sam Fossum"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/15/biden-inauguration-on-war-time-footing-over-domestic-terror-threat/6646873002/", "title": "Biden inauguration 'on a war-time footing' over domestic terror threat", "text": "WASHINGTON — No one may be more familiar with the extraordinary security plan being readied for Wednesday’s inauguration than Joe Biden.\n\nIn 2009, Biden was the vice president-elect when the Secret Service rolled out a strategy specifically tailored for all of the racially charged contingencies that might accompany the swearing-in of the first Black president of the United States, Barack Obama.\n\n“The fact that this is an African American is not lost on us,” then-Secret Service spokesman Malcolm Wiley said. “We understand that this is a historic event; we understand that this is different from other inaugurations.”\n\nAs the inauguration nears for President-elect Biden, security officials are confronting an even more daunting challenge laid bare by the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol involving a toxic mix of white nationalists and extremist supporters of President Donald Trump who have rejected his November election defeat.\n\nDAY BEFORE RIOT:'We get our President or we die': FBI issued dire warning\n\nNot in modern times has an inauguration of a new president been staged amid such domestic turmoil and in such close proximity to a deadly attack – on the very ground where Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are set to be sworn in.\n\n\"We are on a wartime footing,\" said John Magaw, a former Secret Service director who has served on the Homeland Security Advisory Council. \"You can bet that every angle is being considered and fighter jets will be on the runway with their engines running.\"\n\nLATEST:Capitol rioters intended to 'capture and assassinate' elected officials, prosecutors say\n\nAlready, the inauguration had been dramatically altered by the unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic. Officials scrubbed the traditional parade as a concession to the surging health crisis in favor a largely virtual event. Yet the continuing threat of violence has never been more striking, triggering an unprecedented massing of National Guard troops, law enforcement officials and physical security that has transformed the capital to a city sheathed in iron fencing and concrete.\n\nAs many as 21,000 armed National Guard troops are being deployed to Washington, with thousands already taking up defensive positions around the city – about double the number for the 2009 inaugural. The force is being augmented with thousands more federal, state and local law enforcement officers, some being deployed from cities across the country.\n\nThe National Park Service Friday also announced the closure of the National Mall, a move that effectively shutters mass access to a signature event of American democracy to the public.\n\nThe Secret Service, overseen by the Department of Homeland Security, is leading the security operation.\n\n\"The threat is real and has been building for a long time,\" Magaw said, referring to domestic extremists who have vowed to return to Washington and to expand their armed protests to capitals across the country.\n\nRay Mey, a former member of the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team who assisted in security preparations at seven Olympics, said the security footprint this week appears to dwarf any previous defensive plan.\n\n\"In my lifetime, I have never seen the country in such turmoil,\" Mey said. \"The pressure has to be elevated.\"\n\nThe enemy within\n\nIn the nearly two decades since the 9/11 attacks, the threat of international terrorism has been the primary focus of intelligence and law enforcement officials.\n\nAnd security plans for inaugurals, Olympics, Super Bowls and State of the Union addresses have been organized around the haunting scenarios made real by the 2001 strikes by al-Qaida suicide hijackers that left nearly 3,000 dead.\n\nNo one event has done more to alter that strategy than when extremists, some them carrying firearms and explosives, stormed the Capitol Jan. 6, seeking to overturn Trump's defeat in the November election.\n\nThe siege, the first mass breach of the Capitol in more than 200 years, has dramatically redefined the mission to secure the Biden-Harris inauguration – this time from an enemy within.\n\nApart from the necessary National Guard troops and miles of barricades, the success of the inaugural security plan also weighs heavily on federal law enforcement officials who are pursuing hundreds of potential suspects in the attack to both hold them accountable and stop any planned return to Washington to disrupt the inauguration.\n\nCharges have been filed against more than 70 people, including some off-duty police officers who joined the mob and the battle against the badly outnumbered U.S. Capitol Police. Two Virginia police officers, Jacob Fracker and Thomas Robertson of the Rocky Mount Police Department, were charged Wednesday with violent entry and disorderly conduct.\n\nARREST TRACKER: Who has been charged in the Capitol insurrection\n\nVETERANS & ACTIVE DUTY:Pentagon called on to investigate white supremacists in military\n\nSeparately, a Chicago-area man was arrested and charged Tuesday after allegedly lodging a direct threat aimed at the inauguration. In a Dec. 29 voice mail message left for a New Jersey House member, Louis Capriotti allegedly warned that Biden would not be allowed to \"walk into that (expletive) White House on Jan. 20\" without a fight.\n\n“We will surround the (expletive) White House and we will kill any (expletive) Democrat that steps on the (expletive) lawn,” he said, the federal complaint alleges.\n\nFederal authorities have briefed lawmakers on similar threats that have been timed to the the inauguration. In a separate FBI briefing this week with local law enforcement officials, Director Christopher Wray warned of the threat to state government buildings and lawmakers.\n\n\"We're concerned about the potential violence ... that could bring armed individuals in close proximity to government buildings and officials,\" Wray told Vice President Mike Pence in a separate briefing Thursday.\n\nAssistant FBI Director Steven D'Antuono, meanwhile, has cast the pursuit of Capitol fugitives as \"a 24/7, full bore operation.\"\n\n\"The significance of this investigation is not lost on us,\" D'Antuono said.\n\n'We're really at a crossroads'\n\nA collective awakening to the current domestic terror threat has drawn chilling parallels to the anti-government militia movement that launched Timothy McVeigh and the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City that left 168 dead.\n\nMey, the former FBI official, characterized the Oklahoma strike as the \"real manifestation\" of extreme right-wing violence.\n\n\"But that movement largely produced lone attackers, now we're talking about thousands,\" Mey said, referring to the Capitol mob. \"We're really at a crossroads.\"\n\nWhite supremacists and other like-minded extremists conducted 67% of terrorist plots and attacks in the United States in 2020, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The Washington, D.C.-based think tank also found anarchist, anti-fascist, and other like-minded attacks and plots made up 20% of U.S. terrorist incidents in 2020, an increase from 8% in 2019.\n\nLaw enforcement's response to the Oklahoma attack contributed to a noticeable decline in the anti-government and militia movemen, some of whom were taken aback by the bombing, which also claimed the lives of 19 children.\n\nIt is too early to know, analysts said, whether the Capitol attack will reverberate through the ranks of white nationalists and other far-right extremists in a similar way.\n\nFederal authorities, however, believe that the aggressive pursuit of suspects in the Capitol assault and the early show of force to secure the inauguration may be prompting some extremists to reconsider plans to return to Washington, an official familiar with the investigation said Thursday.\n\nThe official, who is not authorized to comment publicly, said some suspects who had planned to return have instead retained lawyers and turned themselves in, rather than risk joining new demonstrations in Washington and elsewhere.\n\nThe official cautioned, however, that the threat level remains very high as many extremists are not part of organized groups like the Proud Boys and others with designated leadership.\n\n'Imagine the unimaginable'\n\nThe Secret Service, meanwhile, has expressed confidence in the far-flung security plan, describing it as a \"zero-fail mission.\"\n\nMichael Plati, the agent leading the effort, described a layered network of steel fencing, vehicle checkpoints and concrete barricades to repel potential threats.\n\nPlati described the Capitol security collapse as a \"poignant reminder\" of the consequences for any breakdown.\n\n\"We have a zero-fail mission,\" he said. \"We feel we are prepared to address the challenges presented by that day.\"\n\nWhile Plati said the security plan has been a year in the making, it is impossible to ignore how the Capitol assault has dramatically altered the plan.\n\n\"Between now and Jan. 20, they (security officials) need to be able to imagine the unimaginable,\" said Terry Gainer, a former chief of the U.S. Capitol Police.\n\nOn Wednesday, DHS officials began locking down the city nearly a week ahead of schedule, acting on requests from anxious members of Congress and municipal officials.\n\n\"In light of these requests, recent events at the U.S. Capitol ... and planned events in Washington, D.C., prior to the inauguration, I have determined that extending the (enhanced security period) to begin on Jan. 13 is necessary to provide a unified command and control and ensure the safety and security of this special event,\" acting DHS Secretary Pete Gaynor wrote in a memo to department officials.\n\n'Uncharted waters'\n\nThis week, the chief executives of D.C., Maryland and Virginia sought to close the door on public access to one of the most revered features of American government: the inauguration.\n\n\"Due to the unique circumstances surrounding the 59th Presidential Inauguration, including last week’s violent insurrection as well as the ongoing and deadly COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking the extraordinary step of encouraging Americans not to come to Washington, D.C. and to instead participate virtually,\" the leaders said in a joint statement.\n\nD.C. Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee echoed the message in a briefing Wednesday.\n\nAnd all over the city, there were stark images reflecting the urgency of the continuing security preparations, from Guard troops bivouacked at the Capitol building to a largely deserted downtown where blocks of glass storefronts and office buildings are now wrapped in protective plywood.\n\nOn a section of 16th Street near the White House, designated as Black Lives Matter Plaza following last summer's police clash with social justice protesters, concrete barriers were set in place as two demonstrators silently hoisted a placard calling for Trump's removal.\n\nAll the while, a nearby speaker played an eerie metaphor for the jarring street scene: the The Temptations hit \"Just My Imagination.\"\n\n\"Clearly, we are in uncharted waters,\" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/joe-biden-united-nations-general-assembly/index.html", "title": "Biden tells the United Nations that Putin's attempts to 'extinguish ...", "text": "United Nations CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday declared Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a violation of the global order, sharpening his rebukes of President Vladimir Putin as the war entered a tense new moment.\n\nBiden’s speech at the United Nations General Assembly came hours after Putin announced an expansion of his war effort, lending the annual address Cold War-style gravity as Biden sought to rally nations behind his effort to isolate and punish Russia.\n\n“This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state and Ukrainians’ right to exist as a people,” Biden told the international body. “That should make your blood run cold.”\n\nSpeaking inside the soaring General Assembly hall, Biden called the seven-month-old invasion a “brutal, needless war” that amounts to a “shameless violation” of the United Nations charter.\n\n“Putin claims he had to act because Russia was threatened, but no one threatened Russia and no one other than Russia sought conflict,” Biden said in his speech.\n\nBiden returned to the green-marbled United Nations stage Wednesday hours after Russia’s president delivered his provocative speech, setting up a rhetorical showdown between the two leaders on the international stage.\n\nPutin’s speech dramatically illustrated the challenges that lie ahead in Biden’s efforts to sustain Ukraine and punish Moscow. The combined effects of the prolonged conflict and economic uncertainty have created a dark mood among world leaders gathering in New York this week for the annual high-level UN meetings.\n\nBiden had already planned to make the Ukraine war a centerpiece of his yearly UN address, with aides previewing a harsh message for Moscow. But Putin’s announcement that he was ordering a “partial mobilization” of Russian citizens in the Ukraine war and again raising the specter of using nuclear weapons dramatically increased the stakes for Biden’s address.\n\nBiden accused Putin of making “irresponsible nuclear threats” in his speech, and declared “a nuclear war cannot be won, and must never be fought.”\n\n“Let us speak plainly: A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor, attempted to erase the sovereign state from the map,” he said.\n\nHours earlier, in his 20-minute speech, Putin warned he would use “all the means at our disposal” if he deemed the “territorial integrity” of Russia to be jeopardized. The mobilization means citizens who are in the reserve could be called up, and those with military experience would be subject to conscription, Putin said, adding that the necessary decree had already been signed and took effect on Wednesday.\n\nIn response, Biden said Putin was waging a war meant to demolish the Ukrainian nation.\n\n“We will stand in solidarity against Russia’s aggression, period,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video: Putin's threats and military escalation explained 02:25 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden warned that the basis of the United Nations’ charter is “under attack” amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, which he cast as a “shameless” violation of the body’s founding document.\n\n“As we meet today, the UN charter’s very basis of a stable and just rule-based order is under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political advantage,” Biden said, noting that the 1945 charter was negotiated by citizens “united in their commitment to work for peace.”\n\nPutin’s escalation came after stunning Russian setbacks in the war, which has dragged on for more than six months. Biden, who has led efforts to isolate Russia and supply Ukraine with advanced weaponry, had already been planning to underscore those efforts in Wednesday’s speech.\n\nPutin’s national address, which occurred after Biden had arrived in New York late Tuesday, caused White House aides to update some of the language in Biden’s speech, according to an official. But a total rewrite wasn’t necessary because White House officials had anticipated some of what Putin would say.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also planned to address the UN later on Wednesday.\n\nAfter making his debut UN address last year under the cloud of a messy Afghanistan withdrawal and stalled domestic ambitions, Biden’s aides believed he entered his sophomore outing with a stronger hand.\n\n“We believe that the President heads to New York with the wind at his back,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, citing a mostly-united western alliance and recent wins on the domestic front, including a historic investment in fighting climate change.\n\nQuestions about US leadership\n\nEven as Biden proclaimed renewed US leadership Wednesday, deeper questions persist over his ability to maintain that position in the years ahead, as fears of a global recession looms and threats to American democracy fester.\n\nBiden has spent ample time underscoring those threats in recent weeks, primarily for a domestic audience but with foreign capitals also listening intently. He has recounted in recent speeches sitting around a table at last year’s Group of 7 summit in Cornwall, England, telling fellow leaders that “America is back.”\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, Biden has told audiences, asked him: “For how long?”\n\nThat question still hangs over Biden’s efforts on the world stage, even a year-and-a-half into his term, as his predecessor continues to wield influence over the Republican Party and prepares to mount another run for the White House. Biden himself said in an interview that aired Sunday that while he intends to run for reelection, a final decision “remains to be seen.”\n\nOne of the issues currently at the forefront of global affairs – the pained negotiations to restart the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew – only underscores the effects of pendulum swings in American leadership.\n\nIn his speech, Biden reiterated his stance that the US will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon as negotiations to revive a nuclear deal have failed to make significant progress in recent months.\n\n“While the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if Iran steps up to its obligations, the United States is clear: We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon,” Biden said.\n\nFor Biden, the yearly UN speech was another stab at explaining to the world how he has steered the United States back into a position of leadership after the “America First” years of Donald Trump.\n\nHe called for expanding the United Nations Security Council, saying countries should refrain from using their veto powers except in rare circumstances.\n\n“The United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent” Security Council members, Biden said in his speech.\n\nHe said constant vetoes from countries on the Council were harming its effectiveness, and said only using vetoes in “rare, extraordinary situations” would ensure the council “remains credible and effective.” Russia has consistently vetoed resolutions at the Security Council that have blocked action on Ukraine and other areas.\n\nIn his speech, Biden also announced $2.9 billion in US assistance to help address global food insecurity. The $2.9 billion investment, the White House said in a fact sheet, is aimed at shoring up food supply amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, widespread inflation and other supply chain issues, and builds on $6.9 billion already committed by the US this year.\n\nIt includes $2 billion in global humanitarian assistance through USAID, the US Agency for International Development.\n\nLater Wednesday morning, Biden will host a pledging session for the Global Fund to Fight HIV, AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In the evening, Biden and the first lady will host a leaders’ reception at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nSpeech drafted over weeks\n\nBiden and his aides have been drafting the address for several weeks, a period that coincided with Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive taking back some Russian-held territory after months of occupation. The initiative had been coordinated with American officials, including through enhanced information and intelligence sharing, and sustained by weaponry provided by the US and its allies.\n\nUS officials have cautioned Ukraine’s current gains don’t necessarily signal a wider change in the outlook of the war, which remains likely to be a prolonged conflict. A day ahead of Biden’s speech, two Russian-controlled regions in eastern Ukraine announced plans for referendums on officially joining Russia, votes the US has previously warned would be “shams.”\n\nOne of Biden’s objectives in his speech Wednesday was stressing the importance of maintaining unity among western allies in supporting Ukraine in the uncertain months ahead.\n\nThat effort is made more difficult by a looming energy crisis as Russia withholds supplies of natural gas to Europe as winter sets in. Higher costs spurred in part by withering western sanctions on Moscow have led to an economic calamity that is causing political turmoil for many leaders in Biden’s coalition, including himself.\n\nMeeting new British leader\n\nThe President meets with one of those leaders, British Prime Minister Liz Truss, later Wednesday. It will be their first formal in-person talks since Truss entered office earlier this month following the decision of her predecessor, Boris Johnson, to step down.\n\nShe inherited a deep economic crisis, fueled by high inflation and soaring energy costs, that has led to fears the UK could soon enter a prolonged recession. While few in the Biden administration shed tears at Johnson’s resignation – Biden once described him as the “physical and emotional clone” of Trump – the US and the UK were deeply aligned in their approach to Russia under his leadership.\n\nWhite House officials expect that cooperation will continue under Truss, even as she comes under pressure to ease economic pressures at home.\n\nLess certain, however, is whether Truss’s hardline approach to Brexit will sour relations with Biden. The President has taken a personal interest in the particular issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a post-Brexit arrangement that requires extra checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nThe rules were designed to keep the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland open and avoid a return to sectarian violence. But Truss has moved to rewrite those rules, causing deep anxiety in both Brussels and Washington.\n\nBiden’s message for China\n\nPutin is not attending this year’s general assembly, though his foreign minister Sergey Lavrov was in New York for the event. Chinese President Xi Jinping also did not attend the UN in person this year.\n\nThe two autocratic leaders, who met in-person last week, have deepened ties between their countries as relations with the west deteriorate. Biden has warned Xi against supporting Putin in his invasion of Ukraine, a theme he’s expected to reiterate in Wednesday’s speech.\n\nBiden said in his speech the US was not seeking “conflict” with China or other nations.\n\n“We do not seek a cold war. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partners,” Biden said.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/politics/biden-calls-putin-a-war-criminal/index.html", "title": "Biden on Putin: 'I think he is a war criminal' | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” Wednesday, a rhetorical leap that came as civilian deaths mount in Ukraine.\n\nIt was the harshest condemnation of Putin’s actions from any US official since the war in Ukraine began three weeks ago. Previously, Biden had stopped short of labeling atrocities being documented on the ground in Ukraine as “war crimes,” citing ongoing international and US investigations.\n\nBut on Wednesday, speaking with reporters at an unrelated event, Biden affixed the designation on the Russian leader.\n\n“I think he is a war criminal,” the President said after remarks at the White House.\n\nThe shift from the administration’s previous stance came after an emotional address to Congress from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who aired a video showing Ukrainians suffering amid Russia’s onslaught. Zelensky asked American lawmakers and Biden for more help defending itself, including a no-fly zone and fighter jets.\n\nCNN Illustration/Getty Images\n\nBiden responded in his own address a few hours later, laying out new American military assistance to Ukraine – including anti-aircraft and anti-armor systems, weapons and drones – but stopping short of acceding to Zelensky’s requests.\n\nStill, Biden acknowledged the horrors transpiring on the ground.\n\n“We saw reports that Russian forces were holding hundreds of doctors and patients hostage in the largest hospital in Mariupol,” Biden said. “These are atrocities. They’re an outrage to the world. And the world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make Putin pay a very heavy price.”\n\nIt wasn’t until a few hours after that that Biden responded to a question about Putin being a war criminal. Biden initially said “no,” but immediately returned to a group of reporters to clarify what had been asked. When asked again whether Putin was a war criminal, he answered in the affirmative.\n\nOn Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Biden’s remarks were “absolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.”\n\nOfficials, including Biden, had previously avoided saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used. Other world leaders have not been as circumspect, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said last week war crimes were being committed. The International Criminal Court at the Hague has also opened an investigation into war crimes. And the US Senate unanimously asked for an international investigation into war crimes on Tuesday. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said last week that actions committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people “constitute war crimes,” marking the first time a senior US official directly accused Moscow of war crimes since last month’s attack on Ukraine began.\n\nIn Poland last week, Vice President Kamala Harris called for international investigations into war crimes, and made clear she believed atrocities were underway. She said the intentional targeting of civilians would constitute war crimes.\n\nAfter Biden delivered his assessment, the White House said the administration’s investigation into war crimes would continue.\n\n“The President’s remarks speak for themselves,” press secretary Jen Psaki said. She said Biden was “speaking from the heart.”\n\nState Department spokesman Ned Price echoed Psaki later Wednesday, telling CNN’s Erin Burnett on “OutFront” that “when you are speaking from the heart, speaking as a human and you’re seeing what we’ve all seen, these searing images on TV, a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, strikes against residential buildings, against schools, against civilian neighborhoods, it’s hard not to walk away with that conclusion.”\n\n“What we are doing here at the State Department, we are collecting every single piece of information, we’re evaluating it, we’re documenting it and sharing it with our partners. There is a process that is involved in this and there are people working almost around the clock to document, evaluate, share as we all watch what is happening with some horror.”\n\nPressed as to how Putin’s actions don’t currently amount to war crimes, Price reiterated that “there is a formal process here at the department under international humanitarian law to document war crimes. We’re involved in that.”\n\nWhile the term “war crimes” is often used colloquially – as Biden appeared to be doing Wednesday – they do have a legal definition that could be used in potential prosecution. That includes in the Geneva Convention, which specifies intentional targeting of civilians as a war crime.\n\nYet in order to prosecute a war crime, solid evidence is required. And for Russian officials to be held accountable, they would need to travel outside of the country.\n\nStill, an official designation of war crimes – backed up with evidence – would still present the West with a symbolic tool in framing Putin’s actions in Ukraine.\n\nBiden has come under increasing pressure to do more to help besieged Ukrainians as Russia’s campaign intensifies. On Wednesday, a theater in Mariupol where civilians were sheltering was bombed, the latest example of Russia’s indiscriminate shelling.\n\nThe pressure was only likely to increase after Zelensky’s dramatic appeal to lawmakers for more help. He compared what is happening in Ukraine to Pearl Harbor and September 11, and said “we need you right now” to offer more support.\n\nBiden watched the address from the library of his private residence, and later called it a “convincing” and “significant” speech.\n\n“Putin is inflicting appalling, appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine, bombing apartment buildings, maternity wards, hospitals,” he said afterward. “I mean, it’s godawful.”\n\nNext week, Biden plans to travel to Brussels for an extraordinary session of NATO leaders, where he hopes to demonstrate western unity amid Russia’s aggression.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Sam Fossum Kevin Liptak", "Sam Fossum", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/03/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/politics/nato-g7-european-union-summits-joe-biden-russia-ukraine/index.html", "title": "Biden and Western leaders plan new ways to punish Russia for its ...", "text": "Brussels, Belgium CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden emerged from a series of emergency summits in Brussels touting unity in the Western response to Russia as allies worked behind the scenes to formulate their plans for the next phase of the war in Ukraine.\n\nBiden said he supported ejecting Russia from another summit, the Group of 20, which is scheduled to convene in November, though other members of that grouping would have to sign on. And he issued a vague warning that the United States would respond to potential chemical weapons use on the battlefield.\n\nBut he maintained his view that direct US military intervention in Ukraine would result in catastrophe and defended a sanctions regime that so far has not stopped Russian President Vladimir Putin from intensifying his assault.\n\n“Putin was banking on NATO being split,” Biden said in a news conference Thursday afternoon.\n\n“NATO has never, never been more united than it is today. Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine.”\n\nDuring the critical day of meetings, Biden announced new punishment directed at members of Russia’s parliament and unveiled a plan to accept as many as 100,000 refugees fleeing the violence in Ukraine, steps intended to show American resolve in confronting the crisis.\n\nA discussion of NATO’s force posture along its eastern edge was also part of the last-minute diplomatic burst. And leaders conferred on what to do if Russia deploys a chemical, biological or even nuclear weapon, a prospect causing increasing concern as the war reaches a stalemate.\n\nBiden said the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine would spark an American response, though declined to reveal what current intelligence says about the likelihood of such an attack.\n\n“The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,” Biden said.\n\nAs the summit got underway Thursday morning, leaders heard a call for more help from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who addressed the gathering virtually. He stopped short of issuing his usual request for a no-fly zone. But he did say Ukraine needs fighter jets, tanks and better air defenses.\n\n“You can give us 1% of all your planes. One percent of all your tanks. One percent,” he said in a virtual address to the summit.\n\nFollowing Zelensky’s remarks, a senior US official said the US is still opposed to providing fighter jets to Ukraine. Previously, US officials said providing such jets to Ukraine could be viewed by Putin as an escalatory step.\n\nBiden insisted that ruling out military action Ukraine had not emboldened Putin, and denied he’d been too quick to take such action off the table.\n\n“No and no,” Biden said.\n\nStill, he said other steps to isolate Russia were in play, including removed from the G20, though he acknowledged it would be a decision taken by the entire bloc.\n\n“That was raised today, and I raised the possibility that, if that can’t be done – if Indonesia and others do not agree – then we should, in my view, ask to have both Ukraine be able to attend the meetings as well,” he said. G20 leaders are next scheduled to meet in early November in Indonesia.\n\nThe announcements and displays of unity Thursday came as US officials say the war in Ukraine has reached a stalemate, leading to fears of what steps Putin may take to unblock his stalled campaign or force Ukraine to make concessions at the negotiating table.\n\nAsked during Thursday’s news conference whether Zelensky needs to cede any territory in order gain a ceasefire with Russia, Biden said it was up to the Ukrainians to decide.\n\n“That is a total judgment based on Ukraine. Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. I don’t believe that they’re going to have to do that, but that’s a judgment,” Biden said.\n\nA quickly arranged “sober and resolute” meeting of allies\n\nRepresentatives from the White House and European governments spent the days leading up to the summit in intensive conversations finalizing steps to unveil following the talks.\n\nLeaders including Biden arrived to NATO headquarters Thursday morning intent on demonstrating unity amid Russia’s aggression. They posed for a brief family photo before entering the lengthy closed-door session. The mood inside the meeting was “sober, resolute and incredibly united,” one senior US administration official said.\n\n“We gather at a critical time for our security,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said as the meeting convened. “We are determined to continue to impose costs on Russia to bring about an end to this brutal war.”\n\nHe said leaders would discuss ways to “strengthen our defenses now and for the years to come.”\n\nWhat they won’t do, however, is what Zelensky has repeatedly asked: Enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. US and NATO officials have repeatedly said that such a move would risk provoking Putin and sparking a wider war with Russia. Western allies have also found it difficult to take more aggressive steps, such as providing Russian-made fighter jets to Ukraine or deciding to cut themselves off from Russian energy supplies, which could potentially cripple Russia’s economy.\n\nThe crisis sessions of NATO, the European Council and the G7 were arranged last-minute, leaving little time for the normal back-and-forth between governments that precedes such events. Biden determined earlier this month that an in-person gathering of a newly united Western alliance would signal resolve to Putin.\n\nWhether Putin views it that way – or whether cracks are exposed among the allies on sanctions and use of military force – remains to be seen.\n\nBiden hoped to set a tone on sanctions by slapping restrictions on 300 members of the Russian Duma, the lower body of Parliament, and over 40 Russian defense companies.\n\nBiden also announced the US will accept up to 100,000 refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine, a major step toward easing a brewing humanitarian crisis in Europe. A senior administration official said a “full range of legal pathways” would be utilized to welcome the refugees.\n\nLeaders from Poland in particular – where Biden will visit Friday – have called on the United States to expedite processing of refugees with family in the United States. More than 3 million people have fled fighting in Ukraine, the UN Refugee Agency says.\n\nBiden said at his news conference he hopes to see Ukrainian refugees when he visits Poland this week, though he said he doubted witnessing the crisis first-hand would alter his approach.\n\n“I plan on attempting to see those folks, as well as I hope I’m going to be able to see – guess I’m not supposed to say where I’m going, am I? I hope I get to see a lot of people,” Biden said.\n\nNew sanctions on politicians, defense companies and Putin associates\n\nAs Biden met with NATO and European allies, the US Treasury Department officially announced a slew of new sanctions against hundreds of members of the Russian State Duma, dozens of Russian defense companies and the CEO of Sberbank – Russia’s largest financial institution.\n\nThe new sanctions target 328 members of the 450-seat Russian State Duma, the lower level of the two-tiered Russian Parliament, cut off 48 Russian defense and materiel companies from Western technology and financing, as well as sanction Herman Gref – the head of Sberbank – who has worked with Putin since the 1990s when both men worked in the mayor’s office of St. Petersburg.\n\nLong-time Putin associate Gennady Timchenko – his companies, family members and yacht – have also been sanctioned, as well as 17 board members of Russian financial institution Sovcombank, according to the White House.\n\n“They personally gain from the Kremlin’s policies, and they should share in the pain,” Biden wrote on Twitter shortly after the US Treasury officially announced the new measures.\n\nTreasury sanctioned 12 members of the Duma earlier this month for their calls to recognize the Russian-backed separatist regions in Eastern Ukraine, which precipitated Russia’s invasion. Thursday’s measures will also sanction the State Duma as an institution, according to the Treasury.\n\n“The Russian State Duma continues to support Putin’s invasion, stifle the free flow of information, and infringe on the basic rights of the citizens of Russia. We call on those closest to Putin to cease and condemn this cold-blooded war,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a written statement.\n\nOne of the Duma members sanctioned was Maria Butina, a gun-rights enthusiast who studied at American University in the US and pleaded guilty in 2018 to conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government after she tried to infiltrate conservative political groups, including the National Rifle Association.\n\n‘We must be intelligent” with sanctions against Russia, European allies warn\n\nBiden has made clear his options to stop bloodshed in Ukraine are limited. He has drawn the line at sending US troops into direct conflict with Russians and indicated that Ukrainian requests for a NATO-enforced no-fly zone are a nonstarter.\n\nEuropean leaders have also made plain their own limitations in punishing Russia. While the US has imposed a ban on imports of Russian energy products, Europe remains far more dependent and has stopped short of cutting itself off completely.\n\n“We do not have exactly the same situation in Europe and in the United States,” Charles Michel, the European Council president, acknowledged in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Wednesday. “The oil or the gas sector, for instance. We are much more dependent in Europe in comparison with the situation in the United States.”\n\n“It’s why we must be intelligent,” Michel said. “The goal is to target Russia; the goal is to be painful against Russia. The goal is not to be painful for ourselves.”\n\nLeaders who began arriving in Brussels late Wednesday hoped to focus on what they are willing to do rather than what they have ruled out. Biden was expected to announce more American help in weaning Europe from its dependence on Russian natural gas as part of his meetings this week, US officials said.\n\nSullivan said Biden would reveal details of the assistance on Friday. He added that US and European officials have held an “intense back-and-forth” about reducing dependence on Russian energy in the lead-up to the emergency summits.\n\n“We are aiming at having a commitment for additional supplies for the next two winters,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, told lawmakers Wednesday.\n\nBiden is due to meet von der Leyen on Friday morning before leaving for Poland.\n\nMore troops headed to eastern NATO countries\n\nA day ahead of the extraordinary NATO summit, the alliance’s secretary general said he expected members to ramp up forces in countries closest to Russia.\n\n“I expect leaders will agree to strengthen NATO’s posture in all domains, with major increases of forces in the eastern part of the alliance, on land, in the air and at sea. The first step is the deployment of four new NATO battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia,” Jens Stoltenberg told reporters ahead of the summit.\n\nBefore Biden’s departure for Brussels, the Pentagon provided the White House with a series of options for potential additional US troops in Eastern Europe, according to a US official. The US already added troops in Poland and Romania as tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated.\n\nSullivan said leaders on Thursday would ratify certain decisions on increasing NATO’s troop posture and would task their military and political officials with setting out a “longer-term game plan for what forces and capabilities are going to be required in those eastern flank countries.”\n\nThat plan will be agreed to at this summer’s NATO summit in Madrid, which had been previously announced. The new force posture will ensure that “we’ve got a long-term footprint that is matched to the new security reality that’s been created both by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and by what’s happening in Belarus,” Sullivan said.\n\nOfficials said possibilities for changes include more forward-deployed US troops, either permanently or on a rotating basis, which could lead to more and potentially larger field exercises; a more structured rotational presence within the NATO force structure; or the construction of a new traditional US military base.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Thursday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/03/24"}]}

Candidates must have at least 50,000 unique donors and poll at least 3% in two national polls or 3% in one national poll and 3% in one early state poll from two “carve out” states recognized by the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe first debate only required candidates to receive 1% in three national polls, or 1% in two national polls and two early state polls. The first event also only required candidates to be backed by 40,000 unique donors from 20 different states or territories.\n\nAdditionally, the candidates must also have signed the “Beat Biden” pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee, even if it's one of their political rivals.\n\nWhich candidates were at the first 2024 presidential debate?\n\nEight GOP candidates were present at the first debate including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former South Carolina Gov.

The debate also will be carried by Salem Radio Network and Rumble, which will handle livestream and online content.\n\n“I am eager to announce that the RNC has selected NBC News, Salem Radio Network, the Republican Jewish Coalition, and Rumble as our partners for the third Republican primary debate in Miami. The partners for our third debate will offer our candidates an excellent opportunity to meet the moment and contrast their plans and vision with the failures of the Biden White House,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.\n\nFollowing last month's debate in California, Trump's campaign issued a statement saying \"these primary debates are a waste of time\" and called on party officials people to stop focusing \"on this distraction\" and \"unite\" around Trump as the party's candidate.\n\nLast week, in a speech to Club 47 USA in West Palm Beach, Trump ridiculed the debates saying they suffered from low public interest and ratings. Speaking Monday in Clive, Iowa, Trump again ridiculed the debates saying the ratings were low and cited a Morning Consult poll from this month showing him with a 49-point lead over second-place Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\n\"Think of that, we're up almost 50 points,\" Trump said. \"These guys ought to get out.

Some candidates have refused to participate altogether.\n\nWHO'S IN THE FIRST GOP DEBATE?Here's a rundown of candidates who qualify\n\nWho's participating in the first GOP presidential primary debate?\n\nNine candidates say they have met the qualifications for a spot on stage in Milwaukee, as of mid-August.\n\nTrump announced on Sunday that he will skip the debate in a Truth Social post, citing his wide lead in the polls.\n\nTrump did not say what he would do counter-program Wednesday's debate. He is reportedly talking about an online interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, but nothing official has been announced.\n\nGOP DEBATE: Play it safe? Blast Trump? Defend him? How DeSantis, Christie, other GOP candidates will seek to score debate points\n\nDeSantis said in an interview in July with Fox News host Will Cain that he will be on the debate stage regardless of whether Trump joins.\n\nMike Pence qualified for the debate after a surge of donations after the latest indictment of his former boss, Donald Trump. He will be on the debate stage Aug. 23, his campaign confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nPence, one of the most recognizable names in the race, took a while to get here. By contrast, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie entered the race a day earlier than Pence and qualified for the debate a month sooner than Pence.\n\nBut as Pence has become more critical of Trump, he has attracted more donors − and more ire from the former president.\n\nMIKE PENCE: Pence the candidate vs. Pence the witness: Can he do both in 2024 election, Trump trials?\n\nHow to watch the first Republican presidential primary debate\n\nFox News announced in June the debate will air exclusively on its channel. It will air from 9-11 p.m. ET.\n\nWho is moderating the first Republican presidential primary debate?\n\nThe debate will be co-moderated by Fox News anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum.\n\nWhy is the debate happening in Milwaukee?\n\nWisconsin is widely viewed as one of the most politically competitive states in the country, according to Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He said that since the presidential election is decided by the electoral count rather than the popular vote, a shift of even a small number of votes in Wisconsin could help determine who is elected.\n\n\"Several analysts are already predicting that Wisconsin will the 'tipping point' state that decides when one of the tickets crosses the crucial threshold of 270 electoral votes,\" Burden said. \"For these reasons the major parties and candidates are laser-focused on the Badger State.\"\n\nWHY WISCONSIN MATTERS:The first GOP debate is being held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Here's why that matters\n\nUnlike some states such as Georgia and Minnesota, which sometimes have close presidential outcomes, Wisconsin is unique for consistently having tight elections, according to Burden. He said that the margin between two frontrunners was often less than 1% in four of the six elections held between 2000 and 2020, and that only two victories from former President Barack Obama stand out as “sizable wins for one candidate.”\n\nWisconsin, a key battleground state, was the site of previous debates for both the Democratic and Republican parties in the 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns. Former President Donald Trump, the GOP frontrunner, has also held many rallies there.\n\n“I am so excited to bring the world into Milwaukee, not just for the Republican Party, but to help businesses and business owners to highlight a bipartisan effort to do great things for this urban community,” Ronna McDaniel, the committee’s chair, told Wisconsin Public Radio.\n\nContributing: Sudiksha Kochi, David Jackson, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/21/trump-leads-gop-field-iowa-poll/70639433007/", "title": "Iowa Poll: Donald Trump holds commanding lead 5 months to ...", "text": "© Copyright 2023, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nDonald Trump holds a commanding lead over the rest of the 2024 Republican presidential field in Iowa — and a more than 2-to-1 lead over his closest rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — with about five months to Caucus Day, a new Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\nThe poll of Iowa’s likely Republican caucusgoers comes as the former president grapples with the fallout of a fourth criminal indictment and a pack of other top contenders prepares to gather for a high-stakes GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee on Wednesday.\n\nAmong those likely caucusgoers, 42% say they plan to support Trump — a lead of 23 percentage points over DeSantis, who is at 19%. U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina follows in third place with 9%.\n\nFormer United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence tie at 6%, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at 5% and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy follows with 4%.\n\nThe poll finds many indicators of Trump’s strength, but the race is not settled and may be “closer than it may first seem,” said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., the firm that conducted the poll.\n\nMore:See where presidential candidates are campaigning in Iowa\n\nSixty-three percent of likely GOP caucusgoers say they support Trump as their first or second choice in the caucuses or are actively considering him. That footprint is on par with the 61% who say the same for DeSantis.\n\nPlenty could shift by Caucus Day on Jan. 15.\n\nA majority, or 52%, of likely GOP caucusgoers have a first choice for president and say they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate, while 40% say their minds are made up. Seven percent do not have a first-choice candidate.\n\nIn addition, just 7% of poll respondents say they are considering only one candidate for president. Seventeen percent say they are considering two candidates; 19% say three; and 55%, four or more.\n\nThe poll of 406 likely Republican caucusgoers was conducted Aug. 13-17 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n\nIt is the Iowa’s Poll’s first test of the field of 14 Republican candidates vying for their party’s chance to take on Democratic President Joe Biden in 2024.\n\nIn addition to the top contenders, seven other candidates are polling at 2% or lower.\n\nThey include North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who is at 2%, and former U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, who has 1%.\n\nBusinessman Ryan Binkley, conservative radio host Larry Elder, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, businessman Perry Johnson and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez all register below 1%.\n\nAs they think about which candidate to support, 65% of poll respondents say it’s most important to find a candidate who comes closest to their own views on issues, while 29% say it’s most important to pick a candidate who has the best chance of defeating Biden.\n\nDonald Trump’s legal challenges may be helping him in Iowa\n\nEven as Trump faces mounting legal troubles, his support appears only to grow.\n\nA grand jury in Georgia indicted Trump Aug. 15 for allegedly attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election there.\n\nThe Iowa Poll, which was conducted Aug. 13-17, showed greater support for Trump in the days after the indictment was unveiled.\n\nIn the days before the indictment, Trump led DeSantis 38% to 20%. In the days after, his lead grew to 43% over DeSantis’ 18%.\n\nTrump’s Iowa footprint, combining his first-choice support, second choice and those actively considering him, also increased 12 percentage points after the Georgia indictment was announced — from 55% to 67%.\n\nDonald Trump leads, but Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott have room to grow\n\nAlthough Trump leads overall, the poll measures candidates’ full footprint of support in Iowa, where caucusgoers are known for considering many candidates before slowly zeroing in on one person by Caucus Day.\n\nThe footprint adds together those who say the candidate is their first choice for president, those who say the candidate is their second choice and those who are actively considering supporting the candidate.By that measure, about as many likely GOP caucusgoers are considering DeSantis as are considering Trump.\n\nTrump’s Iowa footprint includes the 42% who say he is their first choice for president, 10% who say he is their second choice and 12% who say they are actively considering him. That’s 63%, or nearly two-thirds of likely Republican caucusgoers, who are considering caucusing for Trump.\n\nDeSantis’ support includes the 19% who name him as their first choice, 20% who say he is their second choice and 22% who say they are actively considering him — totaling 61%.\n\nScott is the only other candidate whose Iowa footprint tops 50%.\n\nIn addition to the 9% who say Scott is their first choice for president, 15% say he is their second choice and 29% say they are actively considering him. That gives him an Iowa footprint of 53%.\n\nHaley’s Iowa footprint totals 40%, Ramaswamy’s is 34% and Pence’s is 31%.\n\nSelzer said other candidates have the opportunity to gain on Trump and turn people who are actively considering them into firm supporters, but “there’s a lot of work to be done.”\n\nTrump’s support is more firmly locked in than DeSantis’; 66% of those who name Trump as their first choice say their minds are made up, while 34% say they could be persuaded to support someone else.\n\nFor DeSantis, it’s nearly the inverse, with 31% who say their minds are made up and 69% who could be persuaded.\n\nMore:Donald Trump, at Iowa fair, woos crowds, rebuffs 'wise guy' question on taking plea deal\n\nTrump also leads DeSantis among self-identified Republicans, the core of caucusgoers, 51% to 20%.\n\nAmong those who say they will be attending their first caucus in January, Trump leads the Florida governor 47% to 18%.\n\nAnd among evangelicals, an influential group in Iowa that’s often key to a caucus win, Trump leads with 47% who say he is their first choice for president. He’s followed by DeSantis, who gets 20% of evangelicals and Scott who gets 7%.\n\nPhil Marchand, a 42-year-old Sergeant Bluffs resident and poll respondent, said he caucused for Trump ahead of the 2016 election and has been “on the Trump train” ever since.\n\nMarchand is steadfast in his support for Trump in the current election cycle. He said he considered other Republican candidates, including DeSantis and Scott, but ultimately decided to caucus again for the former president come January.\n\n“The more time I spend listening to DeSantis and the more I listen to the things Trump is saying, the more I think that it has to be (Trump). It can’t be anyone else,” he said.\n\nMore:Trump is wrestling with 5 big legal cases. Here's how they may collide with the campaign calendar.\n\nMarchand said he appreciates Trump’s “America first” approach to foreign policy and his efforts to grow the economy and jobs.\n\nIf Trump does not receive the Republican nomination, Marchand said he would likely register as an independent and vote for a third-party candidate.\n\nIndependent caucusgoers could be ‘the way in’ for Trump challengers\n\nAmong independents, Trump and DeSantis are nearly evenly split, with 21% supporting Trump as their first choice and 19% supporting DeSantis.\n\nAnother 13% of independents support Scott, 12% support Christie, 10% support Haley and 6% each support Pence and Ramaswamy. No other candidate tops 5% with independents.\n\nSelf-identified independents who say they will likely caucus with Republicans make up 25% of the poll’s respondents.\n\n“To me, that's a little bit of something to be paying attention to,” Selzer said. “Because we've seen this happen in the past. A non-Trump candidate could say, 'I've got to get people to come to the caucus who are outside of the GOP base.’ So, if a candidate can grow the people who are coming to the caucuses, that is the way in, because Trump is strong with that base.”\n\nBrian Alstrom, a 48-year-old independent voter and poll respondent, said he would consider caucusing in January — if it looks like some of the candidates opposing Trump have a chance.\n\n“I did vote for him both times because it was the lesser of two evils,” Alstrom said of Trump’s 2016 and 2020 campaigns. “But it was hard to even listen to him speak. I’m just done with him. Hopefully I don’t have to vote for him again, because I’m not going to vote for Joe Biden.”\n\nAlstrom, who is a Dorchester resident, said he’s soured on Trump’s personal approach to managing conflicts and his combative attitude. He said DeSantis is his top choice for president, followed by Scott.\n\nIn DeSantis, Alstrom sees an appealing candidate with a “common sense approach” to issues that are important to him, such as the economy and national security.\n\n“Florida speaks for itself in how successful they’ve been,” he said. “... I’d love to see that transfer to the rest of our country.”\n\nDonald Trump has never been viewed favorably by more Iowa Republican caucusgoers\n\nSince his presidency ended and as he has mounted a third campaign for the White House, Trump has been criminally indicted four times, has attacked Kim Reynolds, Iowa’s popular Republican governor, and has held relatively few campaign events in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\nAnd yet, Trump has never been viewed favorably by more of Iowa’s likely Republican caucusgoers than he is now, the Iowa Poll shows.\n\nIn August 2015, Trump was viewed favorably by 61% and unfavorably by 35% — his best showing among likely GOP caucusgoers during the 2016 caucus cycle. Trump went on to finish second in Iowa’s Republican caucuses behind U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nMore:Candidates try to clear GOP debate fundraising hurdles. Is it changing their Iowa strategy?\n\nNow, Trump is viewed favorably by 65%. That includes 42% who view him “very favorably” — the best showing of any of the 2024 candidates. Another 33% view him unfavorably, and 2% are not sure.\n\nTrump’s best showing is among self-identified Republicans, with 77% viewing him favorably and 21% viewing him unfavorably.\n\nHe also does well with those who make less than $70,000 a year (74% favorable, 25% unfavorable) and among evangelicals (74% favorable, 25% unfavorable).\n\nDeSantis’ overall favorability numbers are about on par with Trump’s.\n\nThe Florida governor is viewed favorably by 66% of likely GOP caucusgoers and unfavorably by 29%. Another 5% are not sure.\n\nAmong self-identified Republicans, DeSantis is viewed favorably by 74% and unfavorably by 21% — numbers that are about equal to Trump’s.\n\nMore:Republican presidential candidates woo Iowa's pivotal evangelicals to pry them away from Trump\n\nPoll respondent Rick Williams, a 72-year-old Holstein resident and self-identified Republican, said he considers himself a Trump supporter and believes the former president is being unfairly targeted in the series of criminal indictments that have been unveiled this year.\n\nStill, he plans to support someone else in the caucuses. Right now, he prefers DeSantis.\n\n“Trump supporters are going to support him no matter what if he's the nominee,” Williams said. “But we need the independents. We can't win with just us. We've got to get the independents, and I don't know if he can swing them.”\n\nThe Florida governor has higher favorability ratings with independents than Trump: 52% view him favorably, and 43% view him unfavorably.\n\nMore:Mike Pence is asking Iowans to choose him for president. Some say Jan. 6 is 'holding him back'\n\nFor Trump, it’s the inverse: 44% of independents view him favorably, while a majority, 53%, view him unfavorably.\n\nWilliams, a semi-retired paramedic, said Scott is currently his second-choice candidate.\n\nScott is viewed favorably by 59% and unfavorably by 17%. But a higher percentage — 24% — are unsure, indicating they don’t know enough about him to say one way or the other.\n\nGenevieve Hefel, a 63-year-old Dubuque resident and poll respondent, said she voted for Trump in the 2020 election but has felt her support for the former president wane.\n\nBecause of the recent indictments, Hefel, a retired Army sergeant, said she believes there’s “too much noise” around Trump for him to be able to defeat a Democratic opponent in the general election.\n\nHefel said she’s still considering other Republican contenders in the race, but she’s drawn to Scott’s “positive message and Christian beliefs” and plans to caucus for him.\n\n“He's able to carry on a conversation to get his point across without having to be ignorant or raise his voice,” Hefel said, reflecting on an interview she saw Scott give recently. “He handled it very professionally and calmly, and I thought he made very good points.”\n\nScott does best with those age 55 and older, with 70% viewing him favorably and 16% viewing him unfavorably.\n\nHaley is viewed favorably by 53% and unfavorably by 26%. Another 21% are not sure.\n\nMike Pence, Chris Christie among those with highest unfavorable ratings\n\nSeven candidates are underwater, meaning more likely Republican caucusgoers view them unfavorably than favorably.\n\nThey include Binkley (12% favorable, 21% unfavorable), Hurd (13%-22%), Hutchinson (20%-32%), Johnson (18%-22%) and Suarez (12%-23%).\n\nPence is viewed favorably by 42% and unfavorably by 53%, with 5% who aren’t sure. Even though he’s underwater, a plurality — 33% — say they have a “mostly” favorable view of the former vice president.\n\nBut he holds no advantage with evangelicals, despite his efforts to highlight his own faith and connect with Iowa’s religious conservatives: 43% view him favorably and 51% view him unfavorably — numbers that mirror his overall favorability numbers.\n\nAmong all the candidates, Christie is viewed unfavorably by the greatest share of poll respondents, with 60% saying they view him unfavorably, including 31% who view him “very” unfavorably. Another 28% say they view him favorably and 12% say they’re not sure.\n\nNo 2024 presidential candidate performs better than Iowa’s own Republican elected officials.\n\nReynolds commands the highest numbers, with 81% viewing her favorably (including 50% who view her very favorably), 18% who view her unfavorably and 1% who are not sure.\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley is viewed favorably by 73%, unfavorably by 22%, and 5% are not sure.\n\nU.S. Sen. Joni Ernst is viewed favorably by 72%, unfavorably by 24%, and 4% are not sure.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register. Reach her at bpfann@dmreg.com or 515-284-8244.

The sample was supplemented with additional phone number lookups. Interviews were administered in English. Responses for all contacts were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect their proportions among voters in the list.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 406 voters likely to attend the 2024 Iowa Republican caucuses have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register, NBC News and Mediacom is prohibited.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/07/17/first-gop-presidential-debate-aug-23/70405173007/", "title": "First GOP presidential debate: Here's a rundown of who will qualify", "text": "WASHINGTON - As the 2024 presidential election heats up, Republicans vying for the White House are preparing to face off during the first GOP primary debate on Aug. 23 in Milwaukee − the largest city in the key battleground state of Wisconsin.\n\nBut who will qualify for a spot on stage?\n\nThe Republican National Committee set forth requirements in June that candidates must meet on status, polling, fundraising and pledging to take part in the debate.\n\nHow it works: Candidates must poll at least 1% in three national polls or 1% in two national polls and 1% from an early state poll from two “carve out” states recognized by the committee.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nCandidates must also have a minimum of 40,000 unique donors part of their presidential campaign committee - with at least 200 unique donors per state - and sign a pledge agreeing to support the eventual party nominee.\n\nWhile top candidates in the Republican primary polls have qualified for a spot, other lesser-known candidates are struggling to make headway.

His campaign said that he has also raised more than $35 million during the second quarter of the year - about twice the amount raised during the first quarter, Politico first reported.\n\nBut whether Trump will participate is still up in the air.\n\nTrump threatened to skip the debate in late June claiming on Truth Social that Fox News, one of the event’s sponsors, ignored his campaign events. He suggested to Fox News host Bret Baier on his show \"Special Report\" last month that he didn't want to spar with low-polling candidates.\n\n\"They're all very low,\" Trump said. \"So why would I allow people at one or two percent, at zero percent, to be hitting me with questions all night? You know, I don't think it's fair.\"\n\nHe's also considered scheduling a competing event for that night, according to NBC News.\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who’s trailing behind Trump in the Republican primary polls, will hit the debate stage.\n\nHis campaign announced he raised more than $20 million during the first six weeks of his candidacy and has about 50,000 donors as of late June, according to the New York Times. The survey from Morning Consult shows that DeSantis has garnered 17% of support among potential GOP voters.\n\nDeSantis said in an interview two weeks ago with Fox News host Will Cain he will be on the debate stage regardless of whether Trump joins.\n\n“I hope everybody who's eligible comes,” DeSantis said. “I think it's an important part of the process and I look forward to being able to be on the stage and introducing our candidacy and our vision and our leadership to a wide audience.”\n\nLast month, DeSantis dodged the question of whether he would support Trump if he becomes the nominee in 2024. However, DeSantis later said that he didn’t avoid the question and would \"respect the outcome of the process,\" according to The Hill.\n\nNikki Haley\n\nFormer Republican South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is on track to meet the requirements for the debate.\n\nHaley’s spokesperson told USA TODAY that she has “well over 40,000 unique donors” and is “looking forward to being on the debate stage.” The New York Times reported she’s raised over $7.3 million through her campaign and affiliated committees between April and June.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows she has registered 3% of support among GOP voters, which is on par with two of her rivals. She’s also maintained scoring above 1% in other polls.\n\nHaley indicated on Twitter she plans on supporting the eventual nominee for the Republican party.\n\n“Absolutely irresponsible that Trump, DeSantis, and others won't commit 100% to supporting the Republican nominee,” Haley tweeted. “There’s no room for personal vendettas in this battle to save our country.”\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has fulfilled the debate criteria, according to his spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.\n\nMcLaughlin told USA TODAY that Ramaswamy has 65,000 donors. As part of his fundraising strategy, Ramaswamy has laid out incentives for supporters such as offering to give them a 10% cut of the total money he raises for his presidential bid, according to Axios.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows Ramaswamy has received 8% support from GOP voters, surpassing former Vice President Mike Pence and trailing behind DeSantis. He’s also starting to receive double-digit figures in some polls.\n\nRamaswamy will take the loyalty pledge if the other candidates do, McLaughlin said.\n\nMike Pence\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, who filed to run for president last month, is facing difficulty meeting the debate criteria.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he has gained 7% support among voters, trailing behind Ramaswamy, and he's maintained over 1% support in other polls. However, the New York Times reported last week he has not yet received donations from 40,000 unique donors.\n\nHe’s also raised less than $1.2 million for his campaign in the second quarter of the year − far below what his rivals have raised, according to the Washington Post.\n\nDespite announcing his candidacy late compared to his rivals, Pence − a familiar face among voters − has already garnered attention from voters as he campaigns across key states and maintains a critical position against Trump’s stances on abortion, immigration, criminal justice and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.\n\nPence said in a CNN town hall last month in Iowa he would support whoever ends up being the Republican nominee in 2024.\n\nTim Scott\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott said during an interview last month on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom” that he's met the requirements for the debate.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he’s scored 3% support among GOP voters, and he’s also maintained an average 3.2% of support in the Republican primary polls, according to data from RealClearPolitics.\n\nScott’s campaign told the New York Post they’ve been backed by 40,000 donors in early July and announced Wednesday that they’ve raised $6.1 million in the second quarter of fundraising, according to The Hill.\n\nScott indicated in a Fox News interview in May he will support the eventual nominee, saying “all Republican candidates would be better than any Democrat candidate.”\n\nChris Christie\n\nFormer Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has qualified for the debate.\n\nHe told CNN host Anderson Cooper on Wednesday he’s received more than 40,000 unique donors in just 35 days. He’s taken in fundraising from big donors such as Motorola Solutions CEO Greg Brown and Lewis Eisenberg, who was a former ambassador to Italy during the Trump administration, according to CNBC News.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he garnered 3% of support among voters − on par with two of his rivals − and has scored above 1% in other polls. Although his poll numbers are not as high as Trump's or DeSantis', he appears to be gaining momentum as a fierce rival against his running mates.\n\nLast month, Christie called the loyalty pledge a “useless idea” on CNN’s “State of the Union” but said he will do what is needed to be on the debate stage. In an ABC News interview, Christie said he will take the pledge “as seriously as Donald Trump did eight years ago,” when Trump signed the pledge but refused to agree to back the eventual nominee.\n\nWill Hurd\n\nFormer Republican Texas Rep. Will Hurd is working to fulfill the debate requirements, according to his campaign spokesperson.\n\n“Will entered the race only a few weeks ago, but he fully intends on fulfilling the polling and donor thresholds,” a Hurd for America spokesperson told USA TODAY.\n\nHowever, the survey from Morning Consult shows Hurd received 0% of support among GOP voters, and he’s not included in some polls. He encouraged his followers on Twitter to donate $1 to support his campaign in late June so he could fulfill the 40,000 donor requirement.\n\nThe spokesperson said Hurd won’t sign the loyalty pledge from the Republican National Committee.\n\n“This is not about whether or not he’ll support the Republican nominee, it’s about refusing to support Donald Trump,” the spokesperson said.\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nWealthy Republican North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is taking several steps to meet the debate criteria.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows Burgum has received 0% support among GOP voters, but he has reached 1% in certain national or state polls, according to The Hill.\n\nBurgum reported raising $11.7 million for his campaign in the second quarter of the year last week, but about $10.2 million of that amount was self-funded, according to NBC News.\n\nHis campaign is offering a $20 gift card to anyone who donates at least one dollar, and the offer lasts for the first 50,000 donors. Experts, however, have raised questions over the legality of this method, according to NPR.\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nFormer Republican Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is struggling to fulfill the debate criteria.\n\nHe's attracted crowds of no larger than 50 people to his Iowa events, according to the Des Moines Register. He also told radio host Hugh Hewitt in early July that he has more than 5,000 donors and has more work to do to reach the 40,000 donor requirement.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he has 1% support from GOP voters and a polling average of 0.8%, according to data from RealClearPolitics.\n\nDespite his low numbers, Hutchinson told ABC News in May he is in the race for the long haul and that his support among voters will expand.\n\nRyan Binkley\n\nTexas business executive Ryan Binkley is working towards fulfilling the debate requirements, according to a campaign spokesperson.\n\n\"Ryan is engaged in a major ad blitz and canvassing effort to be able to qualify for the debate,\" his spokesperson told USA TODAY. \"He is winning over supporters and donors everywhere he and his digital footprint go.\"\n\nBut his name doesn't appear in most national polls or the survey from Morning Consult. He has also raised $2 million for his campaign overall - $1.8 million of which he self-funded, according to Forbes.\n\nBinkley's spokesperson said he is close to 5,000 donors and expects \"to exceed that by the end of the Turning Point Action conference.\"\n\nFrancis Suarez\n\nRepublican Miami Mayor Francis Suarez might not qualify for the GOP debate.\n\nBut his spokesperson, Soledad Cedro, told USA TODAY Suarez' campaign is three weeks old and he will be on the debate stage.\n\nSuarez tweeted on Friday that his campaign committee had raised $1 million and will meet the criteria for the first debate, though he didn't specify how many donors he has. Suarez's major setback, however, are his low polling numbers.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult show he's received 0% support from GOP voters, and he has a polling average of 0.1% according to data from FiveThirtyEight.\n\nSean Freeder, a political science professor at the University of North Florida, previously told USA TODAY Suarez will have a difficult time leveraging himself as the top candidate given his late entrance and competition with two high-profile candidates from Florida.\n\nLarry Elder\n\nConservative commentator Larry Elder is unlikely to qualify for the GOP debate.\n\nHis campaign referred USA TODAY to an opinion piece he wrote for The Hill, in which he criticized the debate requirements and said he is running for president to give back to the country rather than serving “as a piggy bank for a political party.”\n\nHowever, he said in an interview with News Nation last month that he will work hard to meet the criteria.\n\nHe’s not included in the survey from Morning Consult, but data from RealClearPolitics shows he has a polling average of 0.5%.\n\nHis campaign spokesperson declined to say how many donors he has, but said Elder is \"optimistic\" he will reach 40,000.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/14/what-to-know-about-republican-presidential-debate-hosted-in-milwaukee-how-long-format-questions/70566198007/", "title": "What time does the Republican presidential debate start? We have ...", "text": "MADISON - Milwaukee will host the first Republican presidential primary debate Wednesday night.\n\nWhile former President Donald Trump is skipping the event, eight other candidates have qualified and take the stage.\n\nHere's what we know about the debate format and who will appear onstage.\n\nMore:How to watch the first Republican presidential debate on Aug. 23 in Milwaukee\n\nMore:What you need to know about the Aug. 23 Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee\n\nHow long is the debate?\n\nThe debate will last around two hours. It will begin at 8 p.m. Milwaukee time and wrap up around 10.\n\nWill candidates give opening statements?\n\nCandidates won't give opening statements, though they will have 45 seconds for closing remarks, according to the format details obtained by Semafor.\n\nHow long will candidates talk?\n\nCandidates will have one minute to answer a question and 30 seconds for follow-up questions.\n\nWhat kind of debate is it?\n\nAll signs point to the first debate in Milwaukee following a traditional format, where candidates answer questions from moderators.\n\nOther types of debates include the town hall, during which candidates take questions from audience members. Candidates may also speak at forums that are hosted by private organizations, not political parties.\n\nWho will ask the questions?\n\nFox News anchors Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier are co-moderating the debate.\n\nSemafor reported that some of the questions will involve \"sound or video, including pre-taped questions submitted by students\" through the Young America's Foundation, which is a partner of the debate.\n\nThe group, which organizes young conservatives, is headed by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Republicans are trying to make inroads with college-age voters, who have overwhelmingly turned out for liberals in recent statewide elections.\n\nHow many questions will be asked?\n\nIt's not clear at this point whether each candidate will have a chance to answer every question, or if candidates will be asked separate, specific questions about the issues.\n\nAt the early Republican primary debates in 2016, questions were posed to individual candidates about issues like abortion and foreign policy. For the first few debates, so many candidates ran that the group was split and debates were aired separately. Twelve debates and nine forums were held during the Republican primary that cycle.\n\nWhat is the 'spin room'?\n\nCandidates or their campaign representatives also make themselves available after the debate to meet with reporters and attempt to \"spin\" their performances.\n\nReporters and networks may conduct and air interviews from the spin room after the main debate event wraps up.\n\nWho will be onstage?\n\nWhile Trump plans to skip the debate and instead participate in an online interview with Tucker Carlson, eight other candidates have qualified and will appear onstage.\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nNikki Haley\n\nTim Scott\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nChris Christie\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nMike Pence\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nCandidates will be placed onstage according to polling, with the highest polling candidate in the center.\n\nA few other candidates failed to meet the requirements, including Texas Rep. Will Hurd, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and radio host Larry Elder. Candidates had until 48 hours before the debate to meet the criteria.\n\nDo candidates need to sign a pledge?\n\nYes. Those who attend the Milwaukee debate must sign a series of pledges, including a promise to support the eventual Republican nominee.\n\nSome candidates, including Christie and Hutchinson, have criticized the pledge or suggested they won't follow it. Trump said Wednesday he wouldn't sign the pledge in an interview with Newsmax.\n\nIs this the only Republican debate?\n\nNo. The Aug. 23 debate in Milwaukee is only the first Republican debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle. Fox Business will host a second debate Sept. 27 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.\n\nThe qualifications to participate in that debate are tightened from the Milwaukee debate. A candidate will need 50,000 individual contributors, up from 40,000. A candidate also needs to poll at least 3% in two national polls or one national poll and two early-voting state polls, up from 1%.\n\nIn addition to letting voters hear from candidates about issues and allowing them to compare choices, debates also give candidates trailing in the polls opportunities to break out.\n\nMore debates will likely be announced ahead of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which takes place July 15-18, 2024. Fiserv Forum will be the centerpiece of the convention, and the site of the debate.\n\nWill the candidates attend a town hall?\n\nMoms for Liberty, designated as an extremist antigovernment organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center, had planned a town hall with unnamed presidential candidates earlier on Aug. 23. That event has since been canceled.\n\nThe group will instead host a discussion with Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson that afternoon at the Pfister Hotel, which will focus on Wisconsin students' proficiency in reading and math.\n\nTyler Katzenberger of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2023/07/27/does-the-rncs-debate-criteria-change-how-candidates-campaign-in-iowa-fundraising-gimmicks/70456891007/", "title": "Does the GOP's debate criteria change how candidates campaign in ...", "text": "Former Vice President Mike Pence is following the Iowa caucus campaign playbook to the letter — but he could be the highest profile candidate who fails to make the stage next month for the first Republican presidential primary debate.\n\nPence has spent years traveling to Iowa and courting activists. Since launching his campaign in Des Moines, he’s continued to spend time in the state meeting with caucusgoers in small groups and staying late to shake hands. He’s hired caucus veterans who have experience running scrappy, come-from-behind campaigns.\n\nBut that traditional approach has so far left him short of the 40,000 donors the Republican National Committee says he’ll need to earn a spot alongside other Republican debate contenders.\n\nMeanwhile, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has become the latest candidate to make the stage after leveraging his personal fortune to finance fundraising gimmicks.\n\nIt’s led some in Iowa to question whether the RNC's new debate qualifiers are blunting the kinds of retail campaign tactics that historically have allowed candidates with few resources to find a platform and gain momentum in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\n“This is almost becoming a Fox News primary to try to get those small-dollar donors up to make the RNC debate stage, to get that polling threshold,” Iowa Republican political consultant Jimmy Centers said. “And that's a big reason why we're not feeling the caucus visits like we have in the past.”\n\n2024 Iowa caucuses:Where and when are presidential candidates visiting Iowa?\n\nThis year, presidential candidates are on the Iowa caucus campaign trail less, and they’re relying more heavily on TV ads to get their message across.\n\nAccording to a Des Moines Register analysis of Iowa campaign appearances, candidates this year are holding a fraction of the publicly announced stops they made the two previous caucus cycles.\n\nAt the same time, data from the advertising analytics firm AdImpact shows that the volume of television ads in Iowa far exceeds what it was at this point in the past two caucus cycles.\n\nThe RNC has said that to make it onto the Aug. 23 debate stage, candidates need to accumulate 40,000 unique donors and get at least 1% support in multiple qualifying polls.\n\nParty Chair Ronna McDaniel said in a June interview with Hugh Hewitt that the metrics represent a minimum standard for successful candidates.\n\n\"If our candidate is going to be anywhere near competitive with Joe Biden, they need to start creating this building block towards success,\" she said. \"And we need to make sure that they have a small-dollar fundraising infrastructure, and that’s why we’re putting this requirement in. If you can’t do this, you really shouldn’t be running for president. You’re not going to beat Joe Biden.\"\n\nWhy making the GOP debate stage is crucial for many candidates\n\nFailing to make the debate stage could be a fatal blow to campaigns, depriving them of necessary exposure.\n\nSome candidates have easily cleared that bar — former president Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy among them.\n\nOthers with immense personal wealth, like Burgum, who is a former software executive, have been able to rely on eyebrow-raising tactics to entice donors.\n\nPence still has time to meet the criteria. But for now, it has left the former vice president in the unenviable company of candidates such as former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, former U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, businessman Ryan Binkley, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and radio personality Larry Elder — all of whom are still working to qualify for the first debate.\n\n\"Every day that goes by we get more and more unique engagement,\" Pence adviser Devin O'Malley said. \"The rate of donations picks up week over week so we’re confident that he’ll be on the debate stage.\"\n\nIn-person campaigning is down while TV ads are up\n\nAccording to data compiled and analyzed by the Register, presidential candidates each have announced an average of 19 public campaign events in Iowa between January and the end of July.\n\nThat trails the 32 events that candidates were averaging in the first seven months of 2019 ahead of the 2020 Iowa caucuses, as well as the 27 events they were averaging during the same time frame ahead of the state’s 2016 caucuses.\n\nAt the same time, television ads — which let campaigns and their affiliated big-money groups promote a message in the candidate’s absence — are way up this year.\n\nAccording to AdImpact, presidential primary advertising has already hit $32.6 million this year on broadcast and cable networks. That swamps the $4.2 million spent at this point in the 2020 Iowa caucus cycle and the $2 million spent at this point in the 2016 cycle.\n\nWhile the proliferation of super PACs has helped fuel the rise in TV spending, candidates also are likely to focus more heavily on raising money to qualify for the national debate stage.\n\n“I understand the need to have some thresholds,” Centers said. “But I do think that this is a bit of a steep hill to climb for candidates, and we have to recognize that it is changing the way that candidates approach the campaign trail and how they divvy up their time between fundraising and traditional campaigning.”\n\nDemocrats faced a similar hurdle in the leadup to the 2020 Iowa caucuses, forcing some candidates to make difficult choices about how to spend their time.\n\nAlthough he was well-liked by Iowa Democrats, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker struggled to gain enough traction to meet continually increasing debate criteria that year. He ended his presidential bid two weeks before Caucus Day after failing to get on the January debate stage.\n\n“The two things on a campaign that you never have enough of are time and money,” said Mike Frosolone, Booker’s 2020 Iowa state director. “And these new requirements force you to devote resources that you probably were not planning on (to fundraising).\n\n“Are you going to stay on the East Coast and do some media hits and maybe bring in a couple of thousand new donors? Or are you going to travel to Iowa — go to Mason City and meet 100 people and shake hands? And when you're pressed up against it, you know, ultimately you have to be on the debate stage. So you have to make that choice to skip time in the early states to go up and spend more time with the media and speaking to a broader audience.”\n\nAt the first Democratic National Committee presidential debate, held in June 2019, candidates at the time could qualify either by hitting 1% in three separate polls or by tallying enough support among donors.\n\nThis year, the RNC is requiring candidates to meet both polling and fundraising thresholds to make it onto July’s debate stage.\n\nFrosolone said it's necessary for the parties to create some kind of criteria dictating who is allowed into the debates. But the danger comes when those hurdles are set too high too soon, he said. The effect is to strip power away from early state voters who have traditionally played the role of vetting candidates and winnowing the field.\n\n“This is certainly the first step for the Republicans, I think, to make a move towards a more nationalized primary,” Frosolone said. “This diminishes the power of the early states, because you have to speak to such a national audience to get all of these donors.”\n\nHutchinson, the former Arkansas governor, acknowledged the challenge to reporters at U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst's Roast and Ride in June.\n\n“Whenever you look at requirements to get on a debate stage, whenever you put onerous burdens on candidates, you're helping to dictate what they have to do in the campaign and how they need to spend money,” he said. “And so I'm not happy about that. I think it's an unnecessary burden because it's up to Iowa to filter the candidates, not a political party.”\n\nO'Malley, the Pence adviser, said the campaign has begun putting a greater emphasis on inserting the vice president into the news of the day by sending fundraising emails focused on things like the controversy over country musician Jason Aldean’s latest music video or the Sound of Freedom movie.\n\nHe said the campaign is also focusing on direct-mail fundraising, which can be time- and resource-intensive.\n\n“I think we’ve yet to really see the full rewards from the direct mail strategy that we have,” he said.\n\nO'Malley dismissed the idea that Pence would spend less time in Iowa in order to raise money.\n\n“I don’t think that we’re ignoring any one tactic in order to fundraise,” he said. “… We raised the amount of money that we need to run the campaign that we are running, which is a lean, nimble campaign.”\n\nGift cards, T-shirts, concerts: Longshot candidates entice donors with gimmicks\n\nFrosolone said campaigns can easily quantify how much money it takes to raise $1 — “At one point, it was 40 bucks for a $1 contribution on digital,” he said.\n\nSo, campaigns with access to that kind of money can funnel it into fundraising if they need to.\n\n“The big guys and the frontrunners don't have to worry about this,” he said. “But if you're somebody whose theory of the case was to go out and do well in the early states and kind of catapult from there, you then have to make a choice: Can you devote resources for TV ads or more organizers down the final stretch? Or does it go to getting on this debate stage. And ultimately, if you're not on the debate stage, you're not making it.”\n\nPerry Johnson, previously an unknown entity in Iowa, announced his presidential ambitions with a bang, airing an expensive Superbowl ad to introduce himself to the state that will have the first say in selecting a Republican presidential nominee early next year.\n\nSince formally entering the race, Johnson has produced a reality show for Newsmax giving viewers a behind-the-scenes look at his campaign, and he’s distributed piles of his book, \"Two Cents to Save America,\" across the state.\n\nBut nearly all of the splashy spending is the result of Johnson’s own personal wealth rather than a reflection of donor support.\n\nHe’s loaned his campaign $8.4 million, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, and he’s given another $328,000 to the effort outright. Just $67,000 has come from individual donors — including thousands given in increments of $1 or less.\n\nJohnson is among the handful of candidates resorting to gimmicky fundraising efforts to accrue donors — with more emphasis placed on crossing the 40,000-donor benchmark than actually generating money to campaign on.\n\n“I think it's kind of ridiculous if you're willing to fund your own campaign, but you have to go and get donors — they demand that I get 40,000 donors, which is the most absurd thing in the world,” Johnson complained to reporters at U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst’s Roast and Ride fundraiser in June. “If a guy's willing to spend whatever, $1- or $2 million to win an election, you would think he would have a right to at least get on the stage.”\n\nJohn Yob, a consultant for Johnson’s campaign, said Johnson is holding as many Iowa events as possible and plans to continue increasing them. But he described a Catch-22 situation: Johnson needs national name recognition to get on the debate stage, but without getting on the debate stage he’s struggling to earn national name recognition.\n\nThe effort, he said, can de-emphasize their efforts in the early states.\n\n“We just think candidates should be spending time shaking hands and doing the events in Iowa this summer, in New Hampshire this summer, rather than focusing on getting national donors across the country,” Yob said.\n\nBurgum, the North Dakota governor, promised last month that he would give 50,000 people $20 “Biden economic relief cards” if they donated just $1 to his campaign. And on Tuesday, he announced he has met the RNC’s debate criteria after surpassing the donor and polling threshold.\n\nBurgum has also held 11 public announced events in Iowa throughout his campaign, and his press secretary Lance Trover promised he would be campaigning “regularly in the state until the caucuses.”\n\n“Tens of thousands have donated to help Doug get on the debate stage and receive their Bidenflation relief cards,” Trover said. “But we plan to keep going until we reach 50,000.”\n\nBurgum reported raising about $11.7 million in his most recent federal financial report — propped up by a $10.2 million loan he made to the campaign.\n\nRamaswamy, who is also contributing significantly to his own campaign, has launched the “Vivek Kitchen Cabinet” program, which promises to give participants a 10% cut of whatever they raise for his campaign.\n\nRamaswamy told reporters at Ernst’s Roast and Ride that he believes the debate requirements are entirely fair.\n\n“I've never had a donor in my life,” he said. “I'm a first-time political candidate. So, if I can meet that three months ahead of the deadline, I think that that's perfectly fair criteria.”\n\nRamaswamy has reported raising more than $19 million, including a $15.3 million loan he made to the campaign as well as $750,000 he made in contributions. He has another $3.2 million in individual contributions.\n\nOther candidates have been critical of some of those efforts.\n\nIn a statement, Elder, the conservative radio host, described them as “bribery.”\n\nHe said his campaign’s fundraising momentum “continues to grow,” fueled by people who believe in his vision.\n\n“I’m also not throwing ‘free’ country music concerts at a cost of $40,000 to my campaign to entice people to donate a few bucks,” Elder said in the statement. “I’m not running a campaign full of gimmicks. I am running a fiscally responsible campaign.”\n\nElder has so far reported raising about $453,000, and he has not yet qualified for the debate stage.\n\n'We accept the requirements,’ other candidates say\n\nOther candidates say they have no problem with the debate requirements.\n\n“The RNC has set the standards, and we accept the requirements,” said Diane Moca, a spokesperson for Ryan Binkley’s campaign. “Contemplating the rules only distracts us from reaching our goal. As Republicans, we are laser-focused on the objective at hand, which is giving Ryan the platform to share his message with the largest audience possible.”\n\nMoca said Binkley, a business executive and pastor from Texas, has been campaigning in Iowa extensively.\n\n“With every gathering, event and meet and greet, our momentum continues to grow,” she said.\n\nAmong the candidates already confirmed for the first debate stage is Haley, who told the Register she plans to stick to more tried-and-true retail politics.\n\n\"It’s touch as many hands as you can, answer every question and keep coming back over and over again,” she told the Des Moines Register of her strategy to win over Iowans during a barbecue in Moravia on July 14. “You’ve got to earn every person’s support.”\n\nScott, the U.S. senator from South Carolina, has also announced meeting the donor and polling thresholds.\n\nCampaign officials said he entered the campaign with the advantage of a large fundraising list as well as a substantial war chest. Scott launched his campaign with $22 million to spend, and he raised an additional $6.1 million in the second quarter.\n\nThose advantages mean Scott has not had to resort to any unorthodox tactics to draw in additional donors.\n\nCommunications Director Nathan Brand told the Register that the campaign is well-positioned if, as expected, the RNC raises the donor threshold for subsequent debates.\n\n\"We are grateful for the growing grassroots support and enthusiasm for Tim Scott,” Brand said in a statement. “His positive, optimistic message anchored in conservatism is resonating with caucus-goers across the state. Tim will be on the debate stage in August and for months to come.\"\n\nFor the frontrunner, the question has not been whether Trump will qualify for the debate stage — it's whether he'll choose to attend.\n\nThe former president's campaign operation raised more than $35 million in total between March and June, though more than half of it went to an affiliate PAC that has taken responsibility for Trump's ongoing legal bills. Between that and his significant polling lead, he unquestionably qualifies for the debates — but hasn't committed to appearing.\n\n\"You're leading people by 50 or 60 points, you say, why would you be doing a debate?\" Trump said on Fox News recently.\n\nTrump has so far in the race declined to appear at many events that also feature his challengers, preferring to set his own agenda with separate appearances that often overlap. He will appear on the same stage as DeSantis and much of the field on Friday, at Iowa Republicans' annual Lincoln Dinner.\n\nDes Moines Register reporters Galen Bacharier, Stephen Gruber-Miller, Francesca Block, Amanda Tugade, William Morris, Donnelle Eller and Phillip Sitter contributed reporting.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

Chris Christie - have signaled a variety of approaches in recent days.\n\nHere's a look at what each challenger needs to do and is trying to do to defeat Trump:\n\nDeSantis: Trump will 'sell you out' on abortion\n\nDeSantis, who needs to at least hold onto second place in the months ahead, has begun arguing in recent days that Trump is going soft on a major issue for religious conservatives: Abortion.\n\n“I think all pro-lifers should know that he’s preparing to sell you out,” DeSantis told RadioIowa.\n\nDeSantis - and other Republicans - are criticizing Trump for comments urging the party to talk about the abortion issue in a different way because otherwise it could hurt them in general elections.\n\nTrump, who supports exceptions in cases of rape, incest and protecting the life of the mother, also attacked a DeSantis-backed law in Florida banning abortions after six weeks, calling it a \"terrible mistake\" politically.\n\nDeSantis may also use the debate to argue that Trump is taking the nomination fight, and the voters, for granted.\n\n\"I think the former president believes he's entitled to be nominated,\" DeSantis told KCCI News. \"He's not doing the work it takes to really earn people's votes.\"\n\nHaley and the 'disliked' Trump\n\nThe goal of the former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is to maintain the momentum from her well-reviewed performance in the Aug. 23 debate in Milwaukee.\n\nThis time around, Haley is likely to cite a recent CNN poll showing her as the Republican most likely to defeat President Joe Biden in a general election. Other post-debate polls show her catching up to DeSantis for second place.\n\nHaley may also echo her most-quoted line from the Milwaukee event: \"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America. We can’t win a general election that way.\"\n\nPence, Trump and 'populism'\n\nThe former vice president will likely continue stressing contrasts with the former president who put him on the Republican ticket back in 2016.\n\nIn preparing for the debate, Pence made a high-profile speech in which he attacked Trump-style \"populism\" that stresses \"personal grievances and performative outrage\" over traditional conservative principles.\n\n“Should the new populism of the right seize and guide our party, the Republican Party as we have long known it will cease to exist,” Mr. Pence said during the heavily promoted speech in New Hampshire, site of the first Republican primary.\n\nRamaswamy: Take Trump's agenda 'even further'\n\nThe young businessman, who is running his first political race, is taking a unique approach to the campaign and the debate: He's trying to \"out-Trump\" Trump with \"revolutionary\" proposals that would give the president sweeping powers to eliminate a raft of federal agencies and employees.\n\nOn a pre-debate interview on Fox News Sunday, Ramaswamy said his \"core focus\" is to \"take the America First agenda even further than Donald Trump did.\"\n\nPresidents don't have the power to do many of the things Ramaswamy is proposing, but his plans and unique foreign policy proposals drew attention to him after the first debate − and criticism from other Republican candidates that is likely to be repeated in the second debate.\n\n“He wants to hand Ukraine to Russia, he wants to let China eat Taiwan, he wants to go and stop funding Israel,\" Haley said in Milwaukee, telling Ramaswamy: “You have no foreign policy experience and it shows.”\n\nAsked about the criticism, Ramaswamy told Fox: \"The reality is many people are annoyed by my rise and believe that a 38-year-old is too young to be U.S. president.\"\n\nChristie: Trump's legal problems are the issue\n\nThe former New Jersey governor has been the most outspoken Republican candidate about what some call this campaign's \"elephant in the room\": Trump faces up to four criminal trials next year.\n\nGrand juries in Washington, D.C., Georgia, New York, and Florida have indicted Trump in connection with efforts overturn his loss of the 2020 election, a hush-money scheme, and obstruction of justice in the handling of classified information.\n\nWhile Trump seeks to delay these cases until after the election, Christie said the charges will render him unelectable in a general election.\n\n\"Trump has no one to blame but himself,\" Christie said on social media platform X. \"His conduct is the cause.\"\n\nChristie has also attacked Trump for dodging debates.\n\nScott needs more time\n\nScott, who has become stagnant in the polls, is also warming up for the debate by hitting Trump on abortion.\n\n\"President Trump said he would negotiate with the Democrats and walk back away from what I believe we need, which is a 15-week limit on the federal level,\" Scott said during an event in Iowa.\n\nScott's main objective at the California debate: Get more air time.\n\nKall noted that Scott spoke for only around 8 minutes during the Milwaukee event, not enough to make a big impression.\n\n\"The debate learning curve is steep, but time is running out with only a few more debates available before voting begins in Iowa,\" Kall said.\n\nAsa Hutchinson, Doug Burgum try to make the stage\n\nHutchinson and Burgum, two other candidates who debated in Milwaukee, have a more basic challenge next week: Qualifying for the second debate.\n\nAt this point, Hutchinson and Burgum aren't polling high enough to meet the requirements set by the Republican National Committee.\n\nAnother candidate, former U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Tex., did not qualify for the first debate and probably won’t qualify for this one.\n\nTrump in Detroit\n\nThe former president will be a spectral presence at the California debate - he will certainly come up during the discussion.\n\nTrump is also scheduling a competing event, a trip to the Detroit area to speak with union members in the battleground state of Michigan.\n\nHis goal for the evening: Divert attention from his Republican rivals.\n\nA 'careful dance'\n\nIf the candidates use this debate to step up critiques of Trump, they'll need to do with care.\n\nCandidates have to draw contrasts with Trump without alienating his considerable number of loyalists - and without giving him free publicity in the process.\n\nSaid Mair: \"There's a careful dance to be done here.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/09/27/gop-republican-debate-live-updates/70982273007/", "title": "Republican debate highlights: Details of candidates' fierce sparring", "text": "SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — Republican presidential candidates gathered in California on Wednesday for the second GOP primary debate of the 2024 election season.\n\nThe seven candidates who qualified for the event in Simi Valley battled over issues ranging from abortion rights in American to the war in Ukraine and healthcare costs. The White House hopefuls addressed the spread of fentanyl in the United States and workers' rights.\n\nBut the debate also turned personal Former President Donald Trump didn't attend the debate, but his Republican rivals took time to launch new attacks against the GOP frontrunner. As former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley sparred with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, she told him to \"bring it\" on the debate stage.\n\nThe Republican hopefuls started off the debate by discussing the United Auto Workers strike, with several criticizing President Joe Biden for joining the workers on the picket line earlier this week.\n\nSen. Tim Scott showed a feistier side in this debate, taking on Vivek Ramaswamy for having done business with China.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis jabbed at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for not participating in the debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here,\" DeSantis said.\n\nChris Christie: Kick Donald Trump 'off the island'\n\nNone of the Republican debaters wanted to vote one of their fellow candidates \"off the island,\" though Chris Christie suggested running Donald Trump out of the GOP primary.\n\n\"This guy has not only divided our party, he's divided families all over this country,\" Christie said. \"He needs to be taken out of this process.\"\n\nOther candidates balked at the last question of the evening, one borrowed from the game show \"Survivor:\" Who would you vote \"off the island.\"\n\nDeSantis voiced his objection, calling it \"disrespectful\" to the candidates who showed up to the debate.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRon DeSantis takes on Donald Trump over abortion\n\n“He should be here,” Ron DeSantis said of Donald Trump during Wednesday's debate, calling on the former president to explain his stance on abortion.\n\nTrump recently called the Florida governor’s six-week abortion ban “a terrible mistake” and refused to state his position on a federal ban, while on NBC’s Meet the Press.\n\nDeSantis, who has also fielded criticism from anti-abortion advocates for not taking a strong enough national abortion stance, called out Democrats for what he said are extremist abortion rights positions.\n\n“We’re better off when everybody counts,” he said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\n'Bring it, Tim:' South Carolina candidates Haley, Scott argue about experience\n\nThe two South Carolina candidates in this race went after each other over who has the better experience: Former Gov. Nikki Haley or current Sen. Tim Scott.\n\n\"Twelve years - where have you been?\" Haley asked Scott, citing the Senate's uneven record on issues like debt and federal spending.\n\nScott responded that Haley's experience as governor is inadequate, and the two drowned out each other in argument. It was broken up by DeSantis, who touted his own record as governor of Florida.\n\nHaley shot back at Scott \"Bring it, Tim.\"\n\nBoth Haley and Scott are aiming for the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24 - if they can make it that far.\n\n– David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy spar over Ukraine, China\n\nAnother fight broke out between Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy over foreign policy, this time over Russia’s war against Ukraine, as he said the candidates need to “level with the American people” on the issue.\n\n“Just because…Putin’s an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good,” he said, bringing up the country’s ban on 11 political parties with ties to Russia.\n\nInterrupting him, Haley said, “A win for Russia is a win for China.” She added, “But I forgot, you like China.”\n\nRamaswamy hit back that “hurling personal insults” were not helping.\n\nMike Pence also got in on the action, arguing that letting Russian President Vladimir Putin have Ukraine would be a “greenlight” to China to invade Taiwan. “Peace comes through strength,” Pence responded, in a nod to Reagan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nNikki Haley criticizes Donald Trump on his handling of China\n\nNikki Haley, who served as an ambassador to the United Nations under the Trump administration, took a jab at her former boss for his handling of China.\n\nShe said that she would end all normal trade relations with China until it stops contributing to the spread of fentanyl.\n\n“This is where President Trump went wrong,” Haley said. “He focused on trade with China. He didn't focus on the fact that they were buying up our farm and he didn't focus on the fact that they were killing Americans. He didn't focus on the fact that they were stealing $600 billion in intellectual property.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley tells Vivek Ramaswamy 'Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber'\n\nVivek Ramaswamy tried to defuse the biggest criticism of him: That he's a young and arrogant \"know-it-all\" who doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\n\"I'm here to tell you, I don’t know it all,\" Ramaswamy said, adding that he knows how to use staff and develop a strong organization.\n\nHis rivals didn't seem convinced, especially Haley.\n\nNoting that Ramaswamy has joined TikTok while pledging to confront Chinese spying, Haley told the upstart candidate: \"Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber for what you say.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMike Pence: ‘I’ll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American’\n\nWhen asked how he would protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination and violent attacks, Mike Pence said “I’ll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American from every background.”\n\nBut Pence quickly turned to transgender children and their rights at school.\n\n“We've got to empower parents at the state level with the ability to choose where the kids go to school, whether it's public, private, parochial or homeschool,” Pence said. “You empower parents, and our schools will straighten up and reflect our values and focus on the basics faster than you can possibly imagine.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'How it's done': Ron DeSantis touts education record\n\nRon DeSantis answered controversy around Florida’s new history curriculum, which requires teachers to instruct students on “how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” The Florida governor called criticism and response to the change a “hoax” led by Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDeSantis turned his comments to Florida’s other education policies, including the Parental Rights in Education Act, dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by opponents. The law bans instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in grades K-12.\n\n“Florida is showing how it’s done,” DeSantis said, boasting his administration’s focus parents’ rights and having “eliminated critical race theory.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence takes on 'former running mate' Trump\n\nMike Pence also got in a few digs at Donald Trump on Wednesday, faulting him for proposals that would expand government.\n\nReferring to the ex-president as \"my former running mate,\" Pence said that \"Donald Trump has a plan to consolidate more power to the government.\"\n\nIt looked like a planned attack: Pence dragged in Trump after a question about whether former President Barack Obama's health care would survive all Republican efforts to repeal it. However, Pence did not address Obamacare.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley calls for transparency in the healthcare system\n\nNikki Haley told a story about her mother being in the hospital, and when healthcare workers tried to bring her Tylenol and she refused, they said ‘honey, go ahead and take it because you're paying for it anyway.’\n\n“Why is it that when we got the bill, the insurance company in the hospital negotiated the bill for her without her having anything to do with it?” Haley said. “When I'm president, we will bring all that from the insurance company to the hospitals.\n\n\"We will make it all transparent because when you do that, you realize that's what the problem is,\" Haley added.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Address fentanyl crisis by sealing border, addressing mental health\n\nWhen asked how he would stop fentanyl brought into the country through ports of entry, Vivek Ramaswamy said that there’s two sides to the issue: seal the southern border and address the mental health epidemic in America.\n\nHe referenced two parents he met whose son died after buying Percocet on Snapchat.\n\n“It is our job to make sure that never happens,” Ramaswamy said. “But it's also our job to make sure that 17 year olds don't turn to Percocet via Snapchat. We have to bring back mental health care in this country, not with pumping pharmaceuticals but with faith based approaches.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMore politics, in your inbox. Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter.\n\n'Donald Duck': Chris Christie calls out Donald Trump for absence\n\nWhile answering a question on crime rates in America, Chris Christie took time to address Donald Trump directly, calling him too afraid to join the debate stage.\n\n“We’re going to call you Donald Duck,” Christie, who turned directly to the camera to address the former president, said Wednesday night.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nTim Scott criticizes Vivek Ramaswamy after he says he's not ‘bought and paid for’\n\nIn the first Republican debate, Vivek Ramaswamy said that he was the only GOP candidate “not bought and paid for.” Scott invoked those comments in the Wednesday's debate when he criticized Ramaswamy over business in China.\n\nRamaswamy pushed back by saying that while he opened a subsidiary in China, what he did differently from other companies is that he “got the hell out of there.”\n\nWhat's the CCP? It's a reference to the Chinese Communist Party\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRon DeSantis: Donald Trump is 'missing in action'\n\nFollowing Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis also invoked Donald Trump's absence from the debate by saying that Biden and others are \"missing in action\" when it comes to national leadership.\n\n\"You know who else is missing in action?\" DeSantis said, referencing the former president's choice to skip the second GOP debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Missing in action':Ron DeSantis blast Donald Trump for skipping the GOP presidential debate\n\nVivek Ramaswamy veers from Tim Scott, sides with workers\n\nWhile saying he agrees with the “spirit” of Tim Scott’s comments on the ongoing UAW strike, Vivek Ramaswamy added that he sympathizes with workers.\n\n“I understand that hardship is not a choice,” Ramaswamy said, referencing his own family and upbringing. He added, though, that he believes “victimhood\" is a choice and told workers to picket outside the White House in Washington in a message to President Joe Biden.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence: Joe Biden should be on the unemployment line, not the picket line\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence pulls out the first pre-planned line of the night, saying that Biden \"doesn't belong on the picket line - he belongs on the unemployment line.\"\n\nLike the other candidates, Pence hits Biden for the condition of the economy. The group of GOP hopefuls quickly zeroed in on inflation, jobs and other economic issues.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTim Scott weighs in on UAW strike, blasts Biden\n\nTim Scott, when asked about his previous comments that striking workers should be fired, said that the president can’t fire anyone in the private sector.\n\nHowever, he criticized workers for wanting additional benefits and fewer hours, saying that this will simply not stand.\n\nHe also blasted Biden for being on the picket line in Michigan to show support to striking autoworkers and said the president should be at the southern border instead.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump praises unions, attacks Joe Biden, mocks GOP rivals before debate\n\nSeeking to divert attention from a debate among his Republican opponents, Donald Trump traveled to Michigan for a speech extolling union members, attacking President Joe Biden, and mocking his GOP campaign opponents.\n\n\"You know, we're competing with the job candidates,\" Trump said at one point during an event in Clinton Township, Mich., adding he didn't even see a potential vice president or Cabinet secretary in the group.\n\nTrump designed his speech on \"economic nationalism\" to take advantage of the ongoing auto workers strike. He blamed it on Biden, saying his emphasis on electric cars will lead to the elimination of auto workers' jobs.\n\n\"Yesterday, Joe Biden came to Michigan to pose for photos at the picket line,\" Trump said. \"But it's his policies that send Michigan auto workers to the unemployment line!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTim Scott needs a breakout moment. Will this debate be his chance?\n\nTim Scott, who is lagging in the Republican primary polls, struggled to have a breakout moment on stage in the last debate, often disappearing into the background as other candidates sparred over issues like Ukraine aid and abortion.\n\nThis debate, however, could look different.\n\nModerators could contrast Scott's positions with Nikki Haley, since both candidates are from South Carolina. The senator will also likely face questions about a complaint filed by the UAW over his comments supporting the idea that striking workers should be fired.\n\nBut Scott has said he doesn’t think he needs a standout moment on stage in the second debate\n\n“What I need to do is continue to do what I have been doing — showing up,” Scott told “Fox News Sunday.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate fact check: Follow along live\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data? An accurate description or a baseless conspiracy theory?\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will dig into key claims from the candidates as they make them during tonight’s Republican primary debate. Follow our live fact-check file as we dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nGOP debate live fact check: What the candidates get right – and wrong\n\n– Eric Litke\n\nWill the economy take center stage?\n\nThe Republican candidates onstage in California will likely spend swaths of the debate talking about jobs, inflation and other economic issues impacting Americans' wallets.\n\nAnd one of the sponsors of the debate is the Fox Business Network, so expect a lot of discussion of the economy. You can also expect a lot of attacks on President Joe Biden on these issues, many of which will follow the campaign for the next 13-and-a-half months.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia’s violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ description of the conflict as a “territorial dispute” helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a “war criminal.” Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a previous proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nRepublican debate in the shadows\n\nThe Ronald Reagan presidential library is nestled in the mountains of Simi Valley, Calif., but the candidates who debate here Wednesday night will be in some political shadows.\n\nAs much or more attention is being given to Donald Trump's speech in Michigan, and a prospective government shutdown is also soaking up media coverage.\n\nThat means the GOP challengers will have to work extra hard to get attention, perhaps on the topics of Trump and the shutdown.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRepublican candidates on immigration\n\nOfficials in New York City and San Diego have recently warned about the migrant crisis in their cities that have overwhelmed shelters, schools and other services.\n\nAnd Republican White House hopefuls will likely discuss immigration and the U.S. southern border during Wednesday's debate.\n\nOne candidate has already vowed to bring up the issue. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday that his first action if elected to the White House will be to send the National Guard to the border. He has also criticized Trump and Biden’s border policies and said he would be the only candidate willing to address the issue head on at the second debate.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nAnd then there were 7: Asa Hutchinson, other candidates aren't debating in Simi Valley\n\nThe debate stage in Simi Valley will be a little less crowded than the last time the GOP candidates went up against one another.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson barely made the August debate and did not meet the threshold for the September match. He’ll be watching on Wednesday evening from a Washington, D.C. hotel.\n\nHe is the only candidate who qualified for the first debate who missed the mark the second time.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, pastor Ryan Binkley, radio host Larry Elder and businessman Perry Johnson have not qualified for any of the primary debates yet.\n\nGOP frontrunner Donald Trump has met the donor and polling requirements, but he has declined to go head-to-head with his opponents so far.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates try to appeal to \"maybe Trump\" voters while he's in Michigan\n\nThe Republican debaters are looking for any slivers of good news in the polls, and they found a little bit this week: Many self-proclaimed Trump voters also say they are open to other candidates.\n\nIn Iowa and New Hampshire, \"most voters are still considering multiple candidates,\" CBS News said about its most recent survey of those states. These \"maybe Trump\" voters will be big targets in the debate.\n\nMany of the Republican presidential candidates have hesitated to criticize Trump for fear of alienating the many Republican voters who have backed him in the past. Those are voters they'll need if they are to somehow wrest the GOP presidential nomination away from him in 2024.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWill there be a Democratic primary debate?\n\nJoe Biden probably won't take the debate stage with his Democratic rivals.\n\nIf an incumbent president is running, political parties usually rally around that person's reelection bid. There's no formal rule, but at this point, Biden is the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nGavin Newsom: Republican debate is ‘vice presidential debate at best’\n\nThe second Republican presidential primary debate is nothing more than a try out to be Donald Trump’s running mate in 2024. At least that’s how California Gov. Gavin Newsom sees things.\n\n“This is a vice presidential debate at best,” he told CBS News. “This is the JV team.”\n\nNewsom, whose state is where Wednesday’s discussion is taking place, has been a surrogate for the Biden campaign and has vigorously defended the president and Democratic Party's record. He emphasized how Trump is “running away” with the primary in every poll.\n\n“This is the XFL, and it’s entertainment, I guess,” he said.\n\nNewsom is also set to debate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis later this year in Georgia in a Fox News event\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nHow will the Republican candidates line up?\n\nThere's a new debate lineup tonight, and not just because there are only seven candidates on stage.\n\nJust like the first Republican debate in Milwaukee, poll averages helped determine where the candidates will stand on stage: Nikki Haley and Tim Scott have moved up, while Mike Pence has moved down.\n\nOnce again, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy are listed first and second, and will be in the middle of the pack on stage at the Ronald Reagan library.\n\nHaley and Tim Scott will be on either side of those first two, in the 3 and 4 slots. Chris Christie is in the fifth position, Pence is in sixth, and the late-qualifying Doug Burgum is in seventh.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhich candidates would pardon former President Trump?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is facing four sets of criminal charges, and it has raised questions among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected president − and he's found guilty.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, who has defended Trump on the campaign trail, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have leaned towards a pardon, though Haley noted in interviews that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis indicated he would be pursuing pardons aggressively if he's elected but hasn’t given a definitive answer on Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDoug Burgum will appear on the debate stage - this time without an injured leg\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, the final candidate to qualify for the debate, will appear on stage with six other candidates vying for the Republican nomination. But with this debate, he won't have just injured his leg.\n\nBurgum, 67, was rushed to a emergency room after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball a day before the first GOP debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin last month. But he still made it on stage the next day.\n\n“I think I took them a little too literally when they said go to Milwaukee and break a leg,” he joked on stage that day.\n\nSudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Republican candidates clash with Ramaswamy again?\n\nVivek Ramaswamy will again be near the center of the debate stage, ensuring high-profile skirmishes with other candidates, according to Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and co-author of \"Debating The Donald.\"\n\nIn the last debate, many candidates sparred with Ramaswamy over his lack of experience and some of his controversial stances on foreign policy and former President Donald Trump’s indictments, which will likely resurface in the second debate.\n\nRamaswamy has leaned on ultra-conservative values to try to appeal to voters, but he has also reached out to younger Republicans as the youngest Republican candidate in the field.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGOP debate live updates:Republicans face off for 2nd time at Ronald Reagan library\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on abortion?\n\nNikki Haley reiterated her abortion stance in the first Republican debate, arguing that leaders need to find consensus on the issue, including agreeing to not jail women who have the procedure. A self-described “pro-life” candidate, Haley said Republicans need to be honest about a national ban, which would require 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nMike Pence, abortion’s harshest opponent among the Republican candidates, took immediate issue with Haley’s comments during the event, saying abortion is “a moral issue.”\n\nMost Republican candidates, including Chris Christie and Doug Burgum, have dodged the question by saying they would leave the issues to the states.\n\nRon DeSantis has touted his record on the issue as Florida governor, having signed a statewide six-week ban into law earlier this year.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nNikki Haley seeks to keep the debate spotlight\n\nMany Republicans said Nikki Haley \"won\" the first debate − she certainly garnered the best reviews − and they are watching to see if the former South Carolina governor can do it again.\n\nAfter the Aug. 23 set-to in Milwaukee, Haley saw a spike in fundraising and poll numbers. She passed DeSantis for second place in a few national and state polls.\n\nThat may make her a target tonight for other Republican candidates, as the former United Nations ambassador seeks to make it two in a row.\n\n\"America deserves a choice, not an echo,\" Haley said in a pre-debate post on the social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on transgender rights?\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed multiple anti-trans bills in Florida earlier this year targeted at gender-affirming care for minors, instruction of gender identity in schools and more.\n\nHe isn’t alone among the Republican candidates. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has signed a law that allows schools and government employees to ignore pronouns that transgender individuals use.\n\nOther GOP candidates have also been vocally opposed to transgender rights. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has made disparaging remarks about transgender individuals, and former Vice President Mike Pence said he wouldn’t allow transgender Americans to serve in the military.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie stands apart. He has said he opposes transgender health care bans, along with other measures.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat are the candidates saying about Donald Trump's criminal indictments?\n\nDonald Trump’s four sets of criminal charges in both federal and state cases have led some of his rivals to fiercely defend him – while others have knocked him.\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has taken the former position, alleging without evidence that the indictments are politically motivated. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have also condemned the indictments on the campaign trail.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about the indictments.\n\nMeanwhile, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, two of Trump's most vocal critics, have argued that the Republican Party can't stand behind Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said in response to federal allegations that Trump tried to steal the 2020 presidential election that anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate moderator Dana Perino: The 'rubber meets the road' for GOP debaters\n\nFor students of political history, one of tonight's debate moderators will look familiar: She's a former White House press secretary.\n\nDana Perino, the chief spokeswoman for President George W. Bush and now a Fox News host, says tonight's showdown is where \"the rubber meets the road\" for GOP candidates who are struggling to catch the front-running Trump.\n\n\"This is the moment where all of them realize, 'if I don't have some sort of break-out moment to show that I could be the rival, the alternative to President Trump, their campaigns probably start to lose even more steam,'\" Perino told Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe other moderators tonight are Fox Business Network host Stuart Varney and Univision anchor Ilia Calderón.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates. “It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,” then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped. What a difference a few years makes. The nation’s highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Earlier this year, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. – John Fritze\n\nNikki Haley, Tim Scott and others oppose student debt forgiveness\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court had struck down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt for hundreds of Americans, a move that many of the 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president “cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy supported the court’s decision.\n\n“We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do: more $$ to stay at home than to work, more $$ to be a single mother than married, more $$ for those who *fail* to repay loans than those who do,” Ramaswamy wrote on X.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is the third Republican debate?\n\nThe third Republican debate will be held in Miami on Nov. 8, the day after Election Day 2023.\n\nThe Republican National Committee announced that the requirements to participate in the debate will the strictest yet: participating candidates must secure 4% of the vote in multiple polls and 70,000 unique donors.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nRepublican primary polls: Trump still leads, DeSantis a distant second\n\nDonald Trump continues to lead Republican primary polls by about 40 points in most national surveys heading into the debate night. The frontrunner will not be on the stage, though, opting instead to hold a rally for United Auto Workers members in Detroit.\n\nSecond and far behind Trump in polls is Ron DeSantis, who will stand at the center of the debate stage. Next in the polls, each less than ten points behind DeSantis and standing on either side of him on stage, are Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMike Pence and Chris Christie are close behind Ramaswamy in most polls, followed by Tim Scott and Doug Burgum.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nRepublican debate ratings ahead of 2024\n\nMillions of Americans may be tuning into the GOP debate on Wednesday night Approximately 12.8 million people watched the first Republican presidential primary debate last month, when GOP candidates faced off in Milwaukee.\n\nEight Republican candidates pitched their vision for the country’s future during the event, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nCandidates focused on issues like climate change, the war in Ukraine and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. But the debate also got personal, with Republican hopefuls targeting Ramaswamy’s lack of political experience, Haley’s perspective on abortion restrictions in the U.S. and more.\n\nDonald Trump did not participate in the event, instead opting for an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolitical groups divide their forces between Trump speech, non-Trump debate\n\nSome political interest groups seem more interested in Donald Trump’s speech in Michigan this week than in the challengers' debate in California.\n\nFor example: American Bridge 21st Century, a progressive group, financed a plane to fly over the site of Trump's union event with a banner saying \"Trump Sold Us Out.\"\n\n“It’s obvious that, barring something drastic, Donald Trump is going to be the GOP nominee next year,\" said Pat Dennis, president of American Bridge 21st Century. \"The Republicans on the debate stage know that, too.\"\n\nGroups that flooded Milwaukee for the first Republican debate are not much in evidence in Simi Valley, though the Reagan library is a fairly remote location compared to Wisconsin's Fiserv Forum.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhere is the second Republican debate?\n\nThe seven Republican presidential candidates will take the stage in Simi Valley, California, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nNorthwest of Los Angeles, the library opened in 1991 with a ceremony that at the time boasted the largest ever gathering of former presidents and their families. The site is also the final resting place for the 40th president and his wife, Nancy Reagan.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhy is Donald Trump not debating?\n\nNo, Donald Trump won’t go head-to-head with his Republican rivals on Wednesday night.\n\nInstead, Trump, the current Republican frontrunner, is traveling to Michigan to speak with supporters in a battleground state. It's also the epicenter of the ongoing United Auto Workers strike, where workers are protesting the nation's largest auto companies.\n\nTrump also skipped the first Republican debate last month, explaining that he didn’t want to give opponents free shots at him.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nFox's Stuart Varney and Dana Perino, UNIVISION's Ilia Calderón are moderating\n\nFox News Media's Stuart Varney and Dana Perino and UNIVISION's Ilia Calderón will co-moderate the second Republican presidential primary debate.\n\nCalderón will be the first Afro-Latina to moderate a Republican Primary Debate, according to the network.\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nGOP debate participants\n\nSeven Republican candidates are expected to participate in the Wednesday debate: Florida Gov.

What it means for the pharmacy ...", "text": "Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy Sunday and plans to close an untold number of stores across the United States as it battles slumping sales and a slew of opioid lawsuits.\n\nOne of the largest pharmacy chains in the country, Rite Aid has in recent years struggled to keep up with bigger drugstore chains like CVS and Walgreens as it faces legal hurdles related to accusations that it helped fuel the raging opioid epidemic.\n\nRumors of its impending plans to file for bankruptcy began circulating at the end of August amid the company’s mounting billions of dollars of debt, declining sales and more than a thousand federal, state and local lawsuits claiming it filled thousands of illegal prescriptions for painkillers.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the filing, the legal woes and Rite Aid’s plans to stay afloat.\n\nBoo Buckets:McDonald's brings back its Boo Buckets for Halloween this week\n\nWhat does Chapter 11 bankruptcy mean for Rite Aid?\n\nThe company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New Jersey.\n\nThe Chapter 11 filing means Rite Aid plans to stay in business while restructuring its debts through a court-controlled process. Rite Aid even said in a Sunday statement that it has raised $3.45 billion in financing from lenders as it continues to operate its stores while in bankruptcy.\n\nWhen the company last filed a financial report in June, it had $3.3 billion in debt, compared to the $135.5 million in cash it had on hand.\n\nIn the statement about Chapter 11 filing, Rite Aid laid out a restructuring plan that includes closing underperforming stores.\n\nUAW Strikes:How does autoworker union pay compare to other hourly jobs?\n\nWhat do we know about store closures?\n\nFounded in 1962, Philadelphia-based Rite Aid is one of the largest pharmacy chains in the nation with more than 2,000 stores in 17 states.\n\nMost customers won’t have to worry about the bankruptcy filing disrupting their ability to shop or fill prescriptions at their local stores — unless, of course, that store is now slated to close. Rite Aid, which has closed several stores in recent months, said in its media release that it's preparing to close more.\n\n\"Rite Aid regularly evaluates its store portfolio to ensure it is operating efficiently while meeting the needs of its customers, communities and associates,\" the company said in a statement. \"These efforts will further reduce the company’s rent expense and are expected to strengthen its overall financial performance.\"\n\nJoy Errico, a spokesperson for Rite Aid, declined to release further information about how many stores were slated to close or what the timeline for closures would be when reached Monday morning by USA TODAY.\n\nRite Aid said in the statement that it will communicate with customers of stores that will be closing and ensure they are able to get access to the services they need at other nearby locations. Employees at closing stores will also be transferred \"where possible,\" Rite Aid said.\n\nWhat other plans does Rite Aid have?\n\nRite Aid plans to use the bankruptcy to resolve its legal disputes and also sell some of its businesses, including prescription benefit manager Elixir Solutions that it bought in 2015 for $2 billion.\n\nAs part of the bankruptcy plan, Rite Aid appointed on Sunday a new CEO to lead restructuring, Jeff Stein, who will also serve as a member of its board. Elizabeth Burr had been serving as interim CEO since January and will remain on the company’s board, Rite Aid said.\n\nStein, the founder of financial advisory firm Stein Advisors, said in a statement the company plans to remain in business for the long term.\n\n“My priorities will include overseeing the actions now underway to strengthen the company’s financial position and further advance its journey to reach its full potential as a modern neighborhood pharmacy,” Stein said in the statement. “I have tremendous confidence in this business and the turnaround strategy that has been developed in recent months.”\n\nInflation:How inflation is reshaping what employees need from their benefits\n\nWhy is Rite Aid facing opioid lawsuits?\n\nRite Aid's legal troubles related to its alleged role in the nationwide deadly abuse of opioids only further contributed to its mounting debt.\n\nThe many lawsuits filed against Rite Aid accuse the company of knowingly filling prescriptions for the addictive painkillers that did not meet legal requirements. In March, the Justice Department filed a complaint against Rite Aid asserting that it violated the Controlled Substances Act by filling prescriptions for excessive quantities of prescription pain killers that had “obvious red flags.”\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the rise in U.S. opioid overdose deaths can be tied to the uptick in opioid prescriptions starting in the 1990s. Drug overdose deaths from prescription opioids jumped from 3,442 in 1999 to 16,706 in 2021, according to data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nContributing: Bailey Schulz\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Heaps of debt, bruising competition from Amazon and crushing pressures to reduce their physical footprint forced a wave of closures, some after companies filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThe 2010s were cruel. Retailers shed thousands of stores in 2017, too, another record year of losses in the past decade.\n\nMichael Brown, a partner in the retail practice of consulting firm A.T. Kearney who has studied the future of shopping centers, said the closings represented a changing of the guard.\n\n“As we exit this decade, we’re really seeing the tidal wave of shift from physical to digital in many respects whether it’s physical to digital shopping or physical to digital products that are impacting what and how people are buying it,” Brown said.\n\nSears, Forever 21, Pier 1:These retailers are facing the fight for their lives in 2020\n\nStore closings:Who are the biggest victims of the retail apocalypse\n\nNow they're headed into a new decade saddled with fresh worries, from growing consumer debt to the trade dispute with China. A significant downturn isn't forecast for the industry, but chances are the pain won't let up anytime soon for some of America's struggling chains.\n\nThe brick-and-mortar downturn is expected to continue, according to a report released in April from UBS Securities. Investment bank analysts said 75,000 more stores would need to be shuttered by 2026 if e-commerce “penetration rises from 16% currently to 25%.”\n\n\"Amazon is the biggest threat to the retail industry and as such retailers are spending heavily to keep up with Amazon,\" John Haber, Spend Management Experts CEO, told USA TODAY, noting \"this strategy has proved deadly for those retailers that spent themselves straight into bankruptcy.\"\n\nBrown said there’s been a singling out of big box stores where there used to be two players in each sector.\n\n“We had Dick’s (Sporting Goods) and Sports Authority and lost Sports Authority. We had Borders and Barnes & Noble, we lost Borders,” Brown said. “We’ve seen a narrowing of the big box sector based on the strength of growing online but also on the growing strength of Walmart and Target being able to service those categories for the consumer.”\n\nA decade of store closings\n\nHere's a look at some of the biggest stores that shuttered all or nearly all locations in the 2010s, many of which relaunched an online presence.\n\nBebe: 180 stores\n\nWomen's clothing chain Bebe was part of the 2017 string of closings and closed all of its stores that May. It staved off bankruptcy and remains an online store.\n\nBlockbuster: 1,700-plus stores\n\nThe saga of Blockbuster's demise was drawn out for several years. In 2010, the company filed for bankruptcy and was purchased by Dish Network in 2011, which planned to keep most of the 1,700 remaining stores it bought open. By the end of 2014, all corporate stores closed but a few franchise stores stuck it out. After two of the last three U.S. locations in Alaska closed in 2018 and the last store in Australia closed in March 2019, there's only one remaining location of the iconic franchise left worldwide in Bend, Oregon.\n\nBorders: 399 stores\n\nKmart owned the bookstore chain in the early 1990s before spinning it off into a separate company. At one time, the book retailer operated more than 1,000 stores but lost business with the rise of e-readers like Amazon's Kindle and the growth of discount retailers. In 2011, the chain filed for bankruptcy protection and announced some stores would close but then ended up closing its remaining 399 stores. Borders also operated Waldenbooks, which it also shuttered.\n\nCharlotte Russe: 510 stores\n\nThe San Diego-based mall chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early February 2019 and outlined plans to close 94 stores. After not finding a buyer for the remaining stores, the fast-fashion retailer announced in March it would liquidate its 500 stores. Toronto-based clothing manufacturer YM Inc. purchased the Charlotte Russe brand and intellectual property in late March and less than two weeks after the final stores closed, the new owner promoted a comeback. As of Dec. 27, there are 139 new stores, according to the Charlotte Russe website.\n\nDressbarn: 649 stores\n\nAscena Retail Group announced the \"wind-down\" of its Dressbarn stores in May 2019 and closed the last remaining Dressbarn bricks-and-mortar stores closed Dec. 26. New Jersey-based Ascena's other brands include Ann Taylor, Ann Taylor Loft, Lane Bryant, Catherines and the Justice tween brand and it sold the intellectual property assets of Dressbarn to a subsidiary of Retail Ecommerce Ventures LLC. The brand's new owner plans to launch a new Dressbarn website in early 2020.\n\nFred's: 568 stores\n\nDiscount merchandise retailer and pharmacy chain Fred's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2019 after a series of closings throughout the year. Before the closures, Fred's had 568 stores in 15 states in the southeastern U.S. The fate of Fred's had been shrouded in uncertainty since the company's plans to profit from a mega-merger between pharmacy giants Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid collapsed in late June 2017 amid federal antitrust concerns.\n\nGymboree: 749 stores\n\nThe children’s clothing retailer was the first victim of 2019 when it announced in January 2019 that it filed for bankruptcy protection and would close both Gymboree and Crazy 8 stores and sell its high-end children’s fashion line Janie and Jack, which had 139 stores. The Children's Place purchased the rights to the Gymboree and Crazy 8 brands for $76 million and is relaunching a new Gymboree.com and a collection in select Children's Place stores in spring 2020. The Gap acquired Janie and Jack for $35 million.\n\nHHGregg: 220 stores\n\nElectronics and appliance retailer HHGregg filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2017 and had initially planed to close 88 stores in 15 states. It ended up closing all of its 220 stores in 19 states. Today HHGregg exists as an online store.\n\nThe Limited: 250 stores\n\nThe Limited was one of the first retailers to announce mass store closings in 2017 and closed its 250 stores that January. It was formerly a part of L Brands, owner of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Today The Limited is available exclusively at Belk.\n\nPayless ShoeSource: 2,589 stores\n\nThe shoe dropped for the Topeka, Kansas-based discount shoe retailer in February 2019 when it announced plans to close its nearly 2,600 stores in the U.S. and Canada and then filed for bankruptcy protection. While all North American locations closed by the end of June, Payless lives on in the U.S. through Amazon, which is selling some of its well-known shoe brands. There also are 750 brick-and-mortar stores in 35 other countries.\n\nSports Authority: 460 stores\n\nThe sporting goods store chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2016 with initial plans to close about 140 stores. After attempting to restructure debt and not finding any buyers in an auction, all 460 stores shuttered in the summer of 2016. Dick's Sporting Goods bought Sports Authority's intellectual property and some leases for $15 million.\n\nToys R Us: More than 800 stores\n\nSeventeen months after Toys R Us shuttered its last U.S. stores in June 2018, the iconic toy brand’s comeback continued in late November when the new parent company Tru Kids Brands opened its first retail Toys R Us store at Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, followed by a second store in Houston, Texas in December. “These stores are fundamentally different from the Toys R Us stores that you’ll remember from the past,” Tru Kids Brands CEO Richard Barry told USA TODAY in October. “They are smaller, very immersive, experimental as well.” The new company also opened two “toy wonderlands” called Toys R Us Adventure in Chicago and Atlanta this year and rolled out a new e-commerce website and partnership with Target.\n\nWet Seal: 511 stores\n\nTeen retailer Wet Seal filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2017 and closed its remaining 171 stores after closing two-thirds of its stores in 2015, the first time the company filed for bankruptcy.

Drug overdose deaths from prescription opioids rose jumped from 3,442 in 1999 to 16,706 in 2021, according to data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nWhy would Rite Aid file for bankruptcy?\n\nRite Aid has yet to agree on a settlement with the opioid plaintiffs to resolve liabilities in a potential bankruptcy filing, according to the Journal. A Chapter 11 filing would pause those lawsuits and allow the company to consolidate the claims.\n\n“It's one-stop shopping,” said Bruce Markell, a bankruptcy law professor at Northwestern’s Pritzker School of Law. “Otherwise they would have to go into something like the multi-district litigation … with lots of different trials.”\n\nPharmaceutical companies including Purdue Pharma, Mallinckrodt and Endo Pharmaceuticals have already reached settlements for similar opioid-related claims in bankruptcy.\n\n“The downside of it, obviously, is the victims who are hurt get a limited day in court if they get a day in court at all,” Markell said. “They don't get to plead their case before a jury.”\n\nA bankruptcy filing could also impose a hard cap on Ride Aid’s aggregate liability exposure, said Ralph Brubaker, a law professor at the University of Illinois.\n\n“Companies are becoming very aggressive in using bankruptcy to try to get that hard cap on their liability, even if the litigation is not too much to handle,” he said.\n\nBrubaker pointed to Johnson & Johnson as a recent example. Its attempt to settle lawsuits from people claiming its talc-based powder caused cancer in bankrupcy court was dismissed by a federal judge earlier this year because the company was determined not to be in financial distress.\n\nWhat does this mean for Rite Aid customers?\n\nWith more than 2,000 retail pharmacy locations across 17 states, Rite Aid is among the largest pharmacy chains in the country. But customers won’t have to worry about a potential bankruptcy filing upending their day-to-day interactions with the company.\n\nThe Chapter 11 process is “fairly invisible as far as customers are concerned,” Brubaker said. “The whole point of the Chapter 11 processes is to preserve the business operations and the value of that ongoing business to the greatest extent possible so that the payout to the claimants can be as large as possible.”\n\nMarkell said regular customers can expect their interactions with Rite Aid to continue as normal should the company file for bankruptcy.\n\n“Rite Aid has every incentive to continue to operate and serve its customers the way it has in the past,” he said. “If I had a long-term prescription at Rite Aid, I might not change it if they filed. If Rite Aid was the closest pharmacy for where I go to get band-aids, I wouldn't stop doing that.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/business/kroger-albertsons-merger-ftc-antitrust/index.html", "title": "Kroger and Albertsons want to create a grocery empire. The last ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nWhen Christine Martinez found out last month that Kroger and Albertsons planned to merge in a deal worth nearly $25 billion, she thought, “here we go again.”\n\nMartinez lost her job as a pharmacy technician in the aftermath of a prior supermarket mega-merger: Albertsons’ $9 billion tie-up with Safeway in 2014.\n\nThat deal has since become a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when two supermarket giants merge. Now the fallout from that troubled transaction hangs over this latest, even bigger merger proposal. The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing Tuesday afternoon to scrutinize the potential impact of the Kroger-Albertson merger.\n\nBack in 2014, Martinez was working for a subsidiary of Safeway in Valencia, California.”It was a really great company,” she said. “Morale was very high. They cared about our needs. We could depend on our paychecks.”\n\nBut things changed after Albertsons and Safeway joined together.\n\nTo win approval for the deal from antitrust regulators, Albertsons and Safeway agreed to sell 168 of their stores to buyers approved by the Federal Trade Commission. The companies’ divestiture plan addressed the FTC’s competition concerns in communities where the two chains had overlapping stores, which would have given the new company a dominant market share.\n\nWith the FTC’s blessing, Haggen, a small supermarket chain in the Northwest with just 18 locations, bought 146 of the former Albertsons and Safeway stores, including the one where Martinez worked.\n\nHaggen went bankrupt soon after buying Albertsons and Safeway's divested stores. Mel Melcon/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nProblems emerged quickly.\n\nHaggen overhauled the Valencia store and changed the branding and labels. Sales slowed and the company raised prices. The company cut hours and laid off employees. Workers began getting paid every other week, instead of weekly.\n\n“Tensions with Haggen were at an all-time high,” Martinez said. “I think about how hard it was on my family. It brings me back to a time I don’t like to remember.”\n\nMartinez’s store closed. She and dozens of her co-workers lost their jobs.\n\nHer store wasn’t the only location that Haggen struggled to manage. The grocer expanded more than eight-fold essentially overnight, and couldn’t absorb the stores it acquired.\n\nLess than a year later, Haggen filed for bankruptcy and closed some locations. In an weird twist, Albertsons bought back dozens of the same stores it previously sold to Haggen in bankruptcy court — at a lower price.\n\nMartinez found a new job as a pharmacy technician at a Ralphs supermarket, owned by Kroger.\n\nNow she worries Kroger will divest Ralphs as part of its merger with Albertsons in a repeat of the Haggen 2015 deal.\n\n“It brought back a lot of fear and anxiety,” she said. “My co-workers are feeling anxious. They’re hearing that Kroger is going to have to divest. Everyone is worried it will be their store.”\n\nUnintended consequences\n\nThe Albertsons-Safeway merger and subsequent Haggen bankruptcy show that divestitures and other concessions required to gain FTC approval sometimes fail. And while these remedies are designed to promote competition, they can have unintended consequences.\n\n“It was a belly flop,” said Robert Feinstein, a corporate restructuring attorney who represented Haggen’s unsecured creditors during the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nIn fact, current FTC chair Lina Khan has been skeptical of divestitures as an effective tool to promote competition. She has even criticized the FTC’s handling of Albertsons’ deal with Safeway, pointing to it as a prime example of the limitations of divestitures.\n\nIn a 2017 law review article she wrote prior to working at the FTC, Khan said the agency’s approval of the divestiture to Haggen was “[hard] to fathom” and a “spectacular” failure.\n\n“Even a casual observer could have predicted that Haggen would have great difficulty expanding its storefronts,” Khan said. “The skeptics have been proven right.”\n\nIt was the “cruelest of ironies and a stinging rebuke to the FTC” that Albertsons bought back some of the Haggen stores from the bankrupt company, she added.\n\nKroger and Albertsons say their merger, which they expect to complete in 2024, will help them compete against larger chains and benefit shoppers, workers and local communities.\n\nThe two companies believe they have a “clear path” to gain regulatory approval, they added.\n\nKroger wants to merge with Albertsons to better compete against larger chains. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\n“We expect to make store divestitures in certain areas, and we will work cooperatively with the FTC to obtain clearance for the transaction,” Kroger finance chief Gary Millerchip said on a call with analysts last month.\n\nTo address antitrust concerns that the merger will stifle competition in local markets where they overlap, Kroger and Albertsons plan to divest stores.\n\nOne way they may do this is by creating a new, standalone company comprised of between 100 and 375 of their current locations. This new entity would be spun off to Albertsons’ shareholders.\n\nThe new company would become an “agile competitor with quality stores” with strong management. “We think it’s a really clean option in the sense that it could potentially be a faster way to package up the strategy around divestitures,” Millerchip said.\n\nBut it’s not yet clear if the stores to be divested can be viable in the cutthroat grocery industry.\n\nIf the those locations are weak, or unloaded to a buyer that can’t handle them, it could be a repeat of Haggen’s swift collapse, antitrust experts warn.\n\n“The big question the FTC should ask is how is this different than what they promised before,” said Christine Bartholomew, who teaches antitrust law at the University of Buffalo School of Law.\n\nKroger and Albertsons say they must get bigger to compete against larger chains. But it’s unlikely that a new, smaller spinoff could successfully handle those same challenges, she said.\n\nDave Durflinger, city manager of Carpinteria, California, said the FTC can’t afford to get it wrong. Supermarkets are economic anchors in small towns, and support hundreds of jobs. Closures can lead to severe gaps in food access.\n\nDurflinger knows that all too well. In 2015, Haggen bought a Vons grocery store (owned by Safeway at the time) in Carpinteria as part of the Albertsons and Safeway divestitures.\n\n“Things went south right away. Shelves were scant. They just weren’t able to keep up,” he said. “It stopped being an attractive store in short order.”\n\nThe store closed within months, which “created a lot of anxiety in the community,” he said.\n\nAnother chain bought the closed Haggen location out of bankruptcy and has since turned it around. But the experience, Durflinger said, “illustrates just how vulnerable small communities are to mergers and losing economic vitality.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/06/08/marsh-says-has-numerous-bidders/380049001/", "title": "Marsh says it has 'numerous' bidders", "text": "MUNCIE, Ind. — Marsh Supermarkets says it has \"numerous\" bidders who have made themselves known to the Delaware court overseeing the grocery store chain's bankruptcy.\n\nA Marsh spokesman confirmed the bidders to The Star Press but wouldn't disclose their identities or their interests.\n\nThe qualifying of bidders is just the latest step in the Hoosier supermarket chain's Chapter 11 bankruptcy process.

But today the retailer and a hedge fund that controls it are locked in a contentious battle over its second turn through bankruptcy.\n\nIn February, just a year-and-a-half after its first Chapter 11 reorganization case, Payless landed back in bankruptcy court – this time wiping a decades-old retailer off the map in the U.S. and Canada. The turn of events has destined an estimated 16,000 workers for unemployment and disappointed consumers who relied on the chain's 2,500 stores and website for affordable shoes, boots, and sandals.\n\nThe company intends to keep Payless' overseas operations running.\n\nSome of the chain's lenders and creditors claim the collapse may stem in part from self-inflicted causes. They cite the role of Alden Global Capital, a prominent hedge fund that is Payless’ majority shareholder as well as a major lender.\n\nCritics maintain Alden has invested in distressed companies and then in some cases installed unseasoned executives who cut costs and sold assets while failing to take steps needed for successful corporate turnarounds. Some Payless creditors and lenders also have raised questions about what they characterized as conflicts of interest between Alden and Payless.\n\nAfter hearing Alden-focused court arguments last Wednesday in St. Louis, Missouri, Chief Judge Kathy Surratt-States of the Eastern District of Missouri ordered anti-conflict-of-interest measures to ensure that Payless creditors and lenders receive equal treatment with the hedge fund. The provisions include the unusual appointment of a monitor to oversee the five-seat Payless board, three with Alden ties, including Heath Freeman, the hedge fund president.\n\nAlden also is the controlling shareholder of MediaNews Group, the company that in January announced a hostile takeover effort for Gannett, which owns USA TODAY and more than 100 local media properties in the United States. MNG had nominated a six-person slate of candidates for Gannett’s board that, if elected, would have made up a majority of the company's board of directors.\n\nIn a surprise move, MNG on Thursday halved its slate to three candidates, which means they would not control Gannett's board, even if elected. The board will consist of eight seats, down from nine. A vote is scheduled at Gannett's May 16 annual shareholder meeting.\n\nWhen Payless emerged after its first bankruptcy, the company pledged to cut prices, invest in online operations and entice shoppers with a treasure-hunt style of shopping akin to popular budget chains Marshalls or TJ Maxx.\n\nBut during the ensuing months, what some loyal shoppers noticed were changes for the worse. \"From the minute you walked in the door, you knew they were struggling,\" said Kathryn Carrington Bogert of Port St. Lucie, Florida. \"Before I used to go in, and they would be jam-packed.\"\n\nErin Tucker, a data analyst from Grand Rapids, Michigan, said the Payless stores she visited \"were not as neat and appealing.\"\n\n\"The displays were somewhat bare, and they hadn't really updated their style in a while,\" said Tucker.\n\nPayless blamed its collapse on unexpected delays from key suppliers, a glut of shoe inventory last fall, an inability to equip all its stores with an online digital sales presence and lingering problems from the company's previous bankruptcy.\n\n“The challenges facing retailers today are well documented, and unfortunately Payless emerged from its prior reorganization ill-equipped to survive in today’s retail environment,” Stephen Marotta, Payless’ chief restructuring officer, said in a Feb.18 statement that sounded a virtual death knell for a shoe chain popular with families on a budget.\n\nThe new bankruptcy has cast a spotlight on the Payless-Alden business relationship. The hedge fund controls more than 60% of the footwear company and is a secured creditor, placing it closer to the front of the line than others for repayment. In bankruptcy court filings and courtroom statements, some of the chain's lenders and creditors claimed Payless:\n\nFailed to put in place a permanent chief executive officer to run the retailer after the company emerged from its first bankruptcy, and replaced departing senior management members with \"inexperienced and unqualified\" Alden executives.\n\nOpened a new headquarters in a Dallas office building, hundreds of miles from Payless' base in Topeka, Kansas, in what some lenders suggested may have been a move to \"bail out\" an Alden affiliate that controls the Dallas building.\n\nNegotiated a $45 million loan from Alden during a 2018 cash crunch, a transaction that lenders claimed \"had little beneficial effect\" on the company's financial health but enabled the hedge fund to get ahead of other lenders seeking repayment in the new bankruptcy.\n\nAgreed to a shared service contract with Aerosoles, a company that Alden bought during an unrelated bankruptcy case. Lenders want to know whether the deal terms conformed with market norms.\n\nRaised questions about a potential conflict of interest stemming from Alden-linked board members reviewing and voting on Payless matters that involved the hedge fund.\n\nSparked separate conflict of interest concerns by seeking the appointment of a law firm to serve as the 2019 bankruptcy co-counsel for Payless after the firm represented Alden in past and current legal matters.\n\n“Given everything that has happened, we have serious concerns with how this company is being run and controlled by Alden,” Stephen Zide, one attorney for an ad hoc group of Payless lenders, said during a bankruptcy court hearing in February.\n\nThose lenders and some Payless creditors are pursuing an investigation of the claims while the bankruptcy case proceeds.\n\nAttorneys for Payless and Alden say the allegations have no merit.\n\n“We hear it again today that somehow we were the architects of the demise of the company, which we think is completely inappropriate and unsupported,” Allan Brilliant, an attorney representing Alden, said during a March 14 bankruptcy hearing. Payless lenders were trying to “manufacture issues here to try to get leverage in this case and derail the process,” he added.\n\nAt its newspaper company, which operates as MediaNews Group/Digital First Media, Alden has imposed deep cuts and sold real estate. Critics say the quality of the news product deteriorated, while Alden said the moves improved the company's finances. At another investment, Memphis-based retailer Fred's Inc., the Alden-linked board also presided over asset sales and cost-cutting while the business declined, critics claim.\n\nAlden's strategy of cutting costs and selling assets falls in line with a customary hedge fund strategy of serving as a de facto “liquidator” of financially distressed businesses, said James Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business who specializes in global financial markets.\n\n“If you look at their history, they’re going to be very conscious of cost and try to cut corners wherever they can,” Angel said. “The question to ask is, are they tunneling resources out and just leaving the bankrupt shell behind? That’s the real issue.”\n\nIt’s not atypical for investors to capitalize on a business sector's downfall, he added.\n\n\"One of the reasons for buying another business is to say, ‘Hey, I think I can run that business more efficiently than the current owners.’ Now maybe that means cutting costs or maybe it means taking advantage of other opportunities,” Angel said. But “are they doing things like having sweetheart management deals or other deals that wind up basically tunneling the assets out, leaving a bankrupt shell behind where the creditors end up eating it?\"\n\nAlden attorney Brilliant, in an email response to a series of questions from USA TODAY, said the hedge fund and its predecessors \"have a long history of investing in stressed, distressed and bankrupt companies. Such companies are often subject to court proceedings, capital structure optimization, shifts in strategic direction, corporate headcount reductions and leadership changes.\"\n\nThe bankruptcy questions are playing out while Payless stores across the U.S. hold going-out-of-business sales.\n\nIn early April, shoppers came and went at Payless’ New York City location in mid-Manhattan, diagonally across West 34th Street from retailing giant Macy’s. Although store closing signs in English and Spanish announced the news, a smaller sign advised that new inventory was still arriving each week.\n\n“I’m sad, because they have good prices, and I can get my size 12 here,” said Vilma Rosales, a Brooklyn resident.\n\nIn Jensen Beach, Florida, Justine Allegrezza, a mother of three, said she's shopped at a local Payless for her family at least six times a year.\n\n“They had great sales and the sneakers were great quality for the whole family,” said Allegrezza, who was a fan of the buy-one-get-one promotion and coupons. “The kids wear them out and grow out of them fast, and they lasted just as long as the more expensive name brand ones I have bought.”\n\nBest foot forward\n\nPayless debuted in 1956 in Topeka, Kansas, the brainchild of cousins Louis and Shaol Pozez. It pioneered the concept of allowing customers to self-select their footwear, a feature that survived and thrived over the ensuing decades.\n\nPayless eventually went public and was acquired by May Department Stores in 1979. Spun off from May, Payless became Collective Brands after a 2007 purchase of Stride Rite.\n\nIn 2012, private equity companies Blum Capital Partners and Golden Gate Capital joined footwear company Wolverine Worldwide in buying Collective Brands for $2 billion. When the deal closed, Wolverine acquired Collective Brands' Performance + Lifestyle group, while Blum Capital and Golden Gate acquired Payless and Collective Licensing International.\n\nIn part, corporate debt amassed during that transaction led to the April 2017 bankruptcy. Just over four-and-a-half months later, after shedding more than $435 million in debt and closing approximately 673 stores, a slimmed-down Payless emerged with Alden as a major financial investor.\n\nAt that time, interim-CEO Martin R. Wade III said that with less debt, the company would invest in digital infrastructure, reduce prices and adopt the \"treasure-hunt nature\" of retailers TJ Maxx and Marshalls.\n\nWade also said Payless envisioned an opportunity in servicing other retailers by handling their shoe inventory or sales.\n\n\"We’ve got to redesign our model, so we can make all that happen,\" Wade told USA TODAY in a story published in January 2018.\n\nTripped up\n\nWhen the company emerged from its first bankruptcy in August 2017 then-CEO W. Paul Jones told Footwear News that Payless was positioned \"to create substantial value for our stakeholders and achieve long-term success.\"\n\n\"Payless is the first to successfully emerge as a stronger and healthier enterprise for the benefit of its customers, employees, suppliers, business partners and lenders,\" Jones added at the time.\n\nNonetheless, the company faltered.\n\nBy August 2018, Moody’s Investors Service warned that despite Payless’ reduced debt, “financial risk remains high owing to persistently weak trends in its core U.S. brick and mortar business and its still heavy debt service costs and modest operating margins.”\n\nThe treasure-hunt style of retail promised by Wade never happened, said Sheena Butler, senior business editor at Footwear News, who tracked Payless. She said the company may have suffered from strategic mistakes like having too many stores after the first bankruptcy and too much debt to invest in significant retail changes.\n\n“The everyday-low-price model was challenging because they didn’t have that other component, which was the thrill of the find,” Butler said.\n\nThe company also never pulled off a significant rehash of its online strategy, she added.\n\n“They didn’t really evolve digitally,” Butler said. “They weren’t relevant.”\n\nAs Payless' retail prospects worsened in 2018, supplier disruption and a computer breakdown took a toll on the company’s operations.\n\nBy autumn, Payless faced an inventory glut and was \"forced to sell merchandise at steep markdowns, which depressed margins and drained liquidity,\" the company said in a bankruptcy court filing. \"Customers filled their closets with these deeply discounted products, which served to reduce customer demand for new product.\"\n\nPayless said it sold \"millions of pairs of shoes\" for below-market prices in the weeks leading up to its second bankruptcy filing. The company’s $66 million loss in 2018 for its North America stores added to a loss of $11 million in 2017 for that division.\n\nIt is not shocking to see the company’s North American operations fall apart, given the retail sector’s challenges. However it is surprising for a company like Payless to slip back into bankruptcy so quickly – especially because the footwear firm had emerged from its first bankruptcy with less debt, profit forecasts and “a certain sense of optimism,” said Josh Friedman, global head of restructuring data at Debtwire.\n\n“Either you had these projections that you were going to exit bankruptcy and move forward that were just wildly wrong, or there was merit to them and you missed the mark,” Friedman said.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nSome Payless lenders took aim at Alden following what they characterized in a bankruptcy court filing as \"mismanagement suggested by the stunningly swift collapse\" of the company.\n\nThe lenders, joined by hedge fund Axar Capital Management, Payless' second-largest creditor, filed an objection that cited Payless' borrowing of $45 million from Alden during a cash crunch in 2018.\n\nThe loan \"may not have only delayed the inevitable,\" but also may have been harmful because it prevented Payless from seeking bankruptcy court protection even sooner, at a time when the company might have secured more favorable terms and higher recoveries for creditors, the companies argued.\n\n\"All the transactions that occurred between Alden and the company were at arm's length and in fact benefited the company more than that they benefited Alden,\" Brilliant, the hedge fund's lawyer, said during a recent bankruptcy court hearing.\n\nSeparately, the committee of Payless' unsecured creditors questioned why the company has sought bankruptcy court approval to pay an aggregate of roughly $84,000 per month to Payless' Alden-dominated board.\n\n\"If they are retained at Alden's insistence simply to preserve its control of the board, it should be at the expense of Alden, not creditors,\" the committee contended in a court filing.\n\nThe company responded in an April 23 court filing that the Payless board members have \"taken an active role in an extremely complex liquidation and sale process,\" and the board \"has determined to pay the board members commensurate with the board's significant commitment of time and resources.\"\n\nPayless lenders also questioned why the company \"inexplicably\" leased office space in Dallas as part of a plan to move the company's headquarters there from Kansas. The filing said the plan represented \"paying for twice the space\" during a bankruptcy when the company could least afford it.\n\nPayless separately disclosed that it had sold the Kansas headquarters property for $2 million in a deal that enabled the company to lease back part of the building.\n\nOffering a potential alternative rationale, Payless lenders cited a November 2018 Bloomberg News report that said the move in part seemed aimed at helping \"bail out\" a Dallas real estate investment of Randall Smith, Alden's founder.\n\nAccording to the report, Smith owned real estate development company Spire Realty, whose holdings included a Dallas office building called Bryant Tower. The building's largest tenant last year announced plans to move elsewhere in 2020, a decision that could lead to a loan default for the tower, the report said.\n\nThe arrival of new tenant Payless may have eased the financial concerns, the report said.\n\nAlden said the claims are \"without merit.\" The hedge fund sponsor said the Dallas relocation was approved by a special Payless board committee, received a fairness opinion from a national real estate valuation firm, and produced a lease that was on \"below-market terms.\"\n\nThe lenders separately argued that the shared services contract Payless signed with Alden-affiliated Aerosoles lacked disclosure \"as to whether the contract and the associated costs conform with market terms, the debtor's credit documents ... and applicable law.\"\n\nAlden said the deal was \"fully vetted by an independent director, disclosed to the (Payless) board, and approved in the directors' business judgment.\" The agreement called for Aerosoles to pay for any services from Payless for fair consideration, the company added.\n\nAlong with the failure to name a permanent Payless CEO, lenders' attorney Zide contended during a recent bankruptcy hearing that \"many senior members of management left the company over the last 18 months ... only to be replaced by inexperienced and unqualified Alden executives.\"\n\nAlden said Payless' senior management team consisted of \"experienced and qualified executives\" who were chosen in a process that included many Payless executives, \"including Mr. Zide's clients.\"\n\nDuring bankruptcy court arguments, the lenders separately criticized what they said was Payless' lack of corporate governance safeguards to prevent Alden-linked members on the company's board from weighing and voting on matters that involved the hedge fund. The issues included the search and approval of lenders for debtor-in-possession financing during the bankruptcy, lenders claimed in a court filing.\n\n\"We have a board stacked with Alden appointees and employees making a decision on what consists of a conflict and how to address it,\" Daniel Fliman, an attorney for creditor Axar Capital, said during a recent bankruptcy court hearing. \"And they're being advised by Akin Gump, a counsel that has a longstanding relationship with Alden.\"\n\nThe arguments continued during Wednesday's roughly two-hour hearing in St. Louis. The Payless creditors and lenders tried to block the appointment of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld as bankruptcy co-counsel to Payless because the Washington, D.C.,-based firm received millions of dollars in fees by representing Alden in past legal matters.\n\nAkin Gump attorneys said the law firm had disclosed its Alden-related work at the start of the bankruptcy. Echoing arguments by Alden, they also said the hedge fund sponsor does not control the Payless board. Two board members with links to the hedge fund sponsor are deemed to be independent under the laws of Delaware, where Payless was incorporated, said Akin Gump lawyer Abid Qureshi.\n\nLawyers for the Payless lenders and creditors nonetheless argued that further restrictions were crucial to prevent potential conflicts of interest from giving Alden an advantage over other parties in the case.\n\nSaying she would \"help the parties come together,\" the judge said she would issue an order that:\n\nRequires Payless to form a special board committee consisting solely of the company's two independent board members with no Alden ties. That committee will have exclusive authority to “review, consider, negotiate and adopt or approve any document, action or transaction,” including any reorganization or liquidation plan, “in which Alden or its affiliates and any director is either interested or may be implicated.” The committee will also have the sole power to investigate, prosecute, release or settle any claims involving Alden, its affiliates and any past or current directors.\n\nRequires that decisions on any conflict claims related to Alden be determined solely by the two independent directors in consultation with attorneys from Seward & Kissel, a law firm with no ties to the hedge fund.\n\ndecisions on any conflict claims related to Alden be determined solely by the two independent directors in consultation with attorneys from Seward & Kissel, a law firm with no ties to the hedge fund. Directs Akin Gump to establish and enforce a protocol to ensure that its attorneys working for Payless do not discuss those matters or share records with the firm's attorneys who handle unrelated work for Alden.\n\nGives the Payless lenders and creditors a role in choosing a special Payless board observer who will monitor the board’s meetings and report any inappropriate conduct to the court.\n\nThe conditions seemed similar to provisions that were adopted voluntarily as part of settlements or without the requirement of judges' orders in other bankruptcy proceedings, said Marc Carmel, a partner at Chicago law firm McDonald Hopkins and co-chair of a subcommittee of the American Bar Association's Business Bankruptcy Committee. However, the appointment of an outside board monitor \"seems like a pretty extreme thing,\" he added.\n\n\"It seems to presuppose that there needs to be an observer or a 'police person' to make sure nothing happens that conflicts with the judge’s other conditions,\" Carmel said. He and his law firm have no involvement with the Payless bankruptcy case.\n\nPayless' lenders and creditors haven’t proven that Alden engaged in improper conduct with Payless, said Friedman, Debtwire's global head of restructuring data. These \"sorts of allegations require detailed due diligence to get to the bottom of it to see what was done,\" he said.\n\nAttorneys for Payless and Alden did not respond to messages seeking comment on the judge's order.\n\n\n\nTroubled Fred's investment\n\nIn late 2016, Alden invested $158 million in Memphis-headquartered Fred's Inc., a general merchandise retailer and pharmacy chain. The purchase gave Alden an ownership stake of nearly 25%.\n\nThe Fred's investment stemmed from Strategic Investment Opportunities LLC, a subsidiary of MediaNews Group Enterprises, the Alden-controlled newspaper publishing company. Alden is the investment adviser for Strategic Investment Opportunities, according to a Delaware lawsuit.\n\nThat lawsuit was filed by Sola Ltd and Ultra Master LTD, affiliates of a New York hedge fund and MediaNews Group's largest minority investor. The plaintiffs also questioned whether MediaNews Group transactions with Alden \"are arms’ length and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\"\n\nMNG denied the allegations. The parties agreed to a dismissal of the case in October.\n\nMonths after the investment in Fred's, the retailer placed two Alden-linked appointees on its board of directors. Four of the board's five current members have ties to Alden.\n\nOne is Freeman, the hedge fund sponsor's president. The others are: Dana Goldsmith Needleman, whose husband represented Alden in the 2017 renewal of its Manhattan office lease, according to online commercial real estate industry publication citybizlist.com; Steven Rossi, former CEO and president of Alden-controlled MediaNews Group; and Timothy Barton, former CEO and president of Freightquote, a company that previously included Smith, Alden's founder, as an investor.\n\nThe Fred's board has presided over a cost-cutting strategy. From the beginning of 2017 through the first quarter of 2018, the employee count at Fred’s headquarters dropped from 440 to 274, according to a recent earnings call.\n\nFred's also faced disruption when plans to profit from a planned mega-merger between pharmacy giants Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid collapsed in late June 2017 amid federal anti-trust concerns.\n\nThe turn of events left Fred’s without a clear path to growth in a pharmacy business in which size has a significant impact on negotiating power and profitability.\n\nFaced with competitive challenges and a share price in the $3 range, Fred’s appointed MediaNews Group veteran executive Joseph Anto as the company's chief financial officer on Feb. 1, 2018. Anto was named interim CEO on April 27, 2018, and he got the top executive post on a permanent basis in February.\n\nAnto, who had no previous experience running retailers or health care companies, embarked on a cost-cutting plan aimed at lowering Fred's debt and generating positive earnings.\n\nFred's reported $964.7 million in net sales for the first nine months of the company's 2018 fiscal year a nearly 6% decrease from the same period of fiscal 2017. Same-store sales, a key financial metric for retailers, fell by 4.9% during the first nine months of the company's 2018 fiscal year, more than double the 2.3% decline during the same period in 2017.\n\nFred’s stock, which Alden had purchased in late 2016 at an average price of $17.06 per share, has declined about 91%. The shares closed at $1.56 on Friday.\n\nThe company's decline makes it uncertain whether Anto will deliver on his previously announced goal of returning Fred's to profitability by the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year. The company told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 19 that it will be late reporting its fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nAlthough Fred’s faces the same challenges as other retailers in an increasingly digital age, the company’s operational missteps have also contributed to its decline. Sales suffered in 2018 in part because of too many out-of-stock items, Anto acknowledged in a recent earnings call.\n\nIn an April 11 announcement, Fred's said it was closing 159 \"underperforming\" stores, launching clearance sales at 360 locations and hiring investment banking adviser PJ Solomon to \"evaluate strategic alternatives to maximize value for all shareholders.\"\n\nFred's said it is also trying to sell its remaining pharmacy holdings as part of a previously announced plan to monetize non-core assets.\n\nThe company said it had no current plans to seek bankruptcy court protection. However, when businesses say they are evaluating strategic alternatives, the options often include a potential restructuring or sale.\n\nFred's representatives did not respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment.\n\nContributing: Kelly Tyko", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2018/05/01/family-pharmacy-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-seeks-sale-almost-all-assets/569040002/", "title": "Family Pharmacy files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, seeks sale of assets", "text": "Citing financial and industry challenges, Family Pharmacy, owned by state Rep.

Family Pharmacy filled approximately 1 million prescriptions in 2017, down from a height of 1.4 million in both 2014 and 2015.\n\nRelated:Judge approves agreement for Hammons properties to be sold in bankruptcy deal\n\nFamily Pharmacy's \"failure to adapt and adjust their business model, overhead and expenses quickly enough to remain profitable in changing market conditions\" led to the bankruptcy filing, court documents state.\n\nMorris told a News-Leader reporter Tuesday that he and his wife, Janet, the company’s two shareholders, had decided several weeks ago to retire from full-time duties with Family Pharmacy.\n\n“I think the company going forward will be OK, and we hope to be able to continue another 40 years,” Morris said.\n\nMorris said he intends to take off May and June from the company, though he will remain as chairman of the company’s board of directors until a sale is finalized and will be available to help fill in as a pharmacist when needed.\n\nOne bid has already come in, Morris said, and he expects more to be submitted over the next few months. Four people have already called him to discuss “very interesting bids,” he added.\n\n“I think this will create a lot of interest,” he said. “This is kind of like the new way to sell your business.”\n\nMorris emphasized that the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings ahead for Family Pharmacy are the kind of tactics intended to keep a company open and not to shut it down (like Toys r Us).\n\n“This business is not going out of business,” Morris said.\n\nRelated:Toys R Us' Springfield location set to go out of business by June 30\n\nMorris has a primary and general election ahead of him this year as he seeks two more years in the legislature and says he intends to continue serving his district.\n\n“I really love this up here,” he said. “I don’t like the way government works up here, but I still think there’s still some time to make a difference in my last two years, if I get re-elected. I think my last two years will be my most important years.”\n\nMandy Jones, vice president of the company, said Family Pharmacy is working to become a leader in independent and long-term care pharmacy \"by strengthening the company.\"\n\nRelated:City, MSU raise concerns about John Q.

According to court documents, Family Pharmacy will owe wages and salaries to its employees May 11, but the bankruptcy filing prohibits the company from paying claims that arose before the filing date. It is seeking court permission to keep paying its employees to maintain morale and a \"dedicated and loyal employee group.\"\n\nFamily Pharmacy employs 182 and operates 20 retail pharmacies in Missouri, as well as two long-term care pharmacies and a specialty pharmacy in Ozark.

A&P said it is discussing potential sales of additional stores with other suitors.\n\n\"We think that's a real bright spot,\" company attorney Ray Schrock said at a crowded bankruptcy hearing Monday in White Plains, N.Y.\n\nWithout the proposed sales, A&P will have \"no choice but to liquidate their business in a fire sale and piecemeal fashion,\" the company's chief restructuring officer, Christopher McGarry, said in the bankruptcy filing.\n\nThe grocery chain traces its roots to A&P's founding in 1859. The company claims credit for introducing the first U.S. supermarket in 1936, a 28,125-square-foot store in Braddock, Pa. The company boasted nearly 16,000 stores by the 1940s.\n\nAfter an acquirer, Germany-based Tengelmann Group, bought the company in 1979, a series of strategic mistakes, industry changes and financial hurdles led to a dramatic corporate contraction.\n\nThe company is a division of Montvale-Para Holdings Inc., which is majority owned by Mount Kellett Capital Partners LP. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. has about 300 supermarkets and other stores under several brands, including A&P, Waldbaum's, SuperFresh, Pathmark, Food Basics, The Food Emporium, Best Cellars and A&P Liquor.\n\nThe grocery chain sought federal bankruptcy court protection anew in the Southern District of New York, citing about $2.3 billion in debts and listing $1.6 billion in assets.\n\nA&P listed supplier C&S Wholesale Grocers Inc. as its largest unsecured creditor with $39.4 million in claims. The next four largest unsecured creditors includee McKesson Drug Co. ($8.4 million), Facility Source LLC ($6.7 million), Coca-Cola Enterprises ($4.8 million) and Mondelez Global LLC ($3.2 million).\n\nThe grocery chain has about 28,500 employees, including about 20,000 who are part time, with an average hourly wage of $16.85. About 93% are represented by one of 12 different unions, and many of them have bumping rights that the company has described as a barrier to reducing costs.\n\nAbout 25 stores will close almost immediately, the company said.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International Union, which represents many A&P workers, called on the grocery chain to \"stay in business during this bankruptcy process and honor its responsibilities to its employees, our members and their families.\"\n\n“Our message to any potential buyers of A&P is that our hard-working members are not just employees, they are the heart and soul of these stores,\" the union said in a statement. “For the sake of the men and women of A&P, now is the time for A&P and any potential buyer to focus on doing what is right for our hard-working members and their families.”\n\nChapter 11 bankruptcy allows companies to reorganize their operations and slash debts in an attempt to create a stronger company. They must win the approval of the court and creditors to reemerge from bankruptcy.\n\nThe prospective buyers of 120 stores — Acme Markets, Stop & Shop Supermarket and Key Food Stores — don't want A&P's pension obligations, according to court filings. That sets up a potentially bruising battle between the chain's unions and the debtor.\n\n\"The best and only viable path to maximize the value of their business and preserve thousands of jobs is a strategic Chapter 11 filing to facilitate sales free and clear of liabilities,\" McGarry said in the filing.\n\nA&P lined up $100 million debtor-in-possession financing — a loan that allows the bankrupt entities to access capital while operating under court supervision. The financing won approval at Monday's bankruptcy court hearing.\n\nLike many retailers with a long legacy, A&P's biggest asset may be its real estate, which the company described as \"extremely valuable.\" The grocery chain hired restructuring adviser Hilco to evaluate and monetize its commercial real estate.\n\nParts of A&P's 2015 filing read like an explanation for why the 2010 bankruptcy — which ended when the company emerged from court protection in March 2012 — failed to place the grocery chain on a sustainable path.\n\nA&P said it erred by keeping 50 to 60 underperforming stores open \"in favor of preserving the jobs in those stores\" and did not successfully reduce its pension obligations and other costs in the first bankruptcy.\n\n\"These obligations have been a drain on the company\" since then, McGarry said.\n\nThe company has several sources of secured financing, including investors represented by U.S. Bank ($677.1 million) and Wells Fargo Bank ($561 million).\n\nThe grocery giant said it earned a 2014 fiscal-year profit of $46 million before accounting for taxes, interest, depreciation and other costs, but that translated into a book loss of $305 million.\n\nSchrock, the company attorney, said that even though A&P had $5.5 billion in revenue, the grocery chain has been hemorrhaging cash. Cash losses were about $14 million a month this year, he said.\n\nThe company suffered a $25 million cash drain in recent months because some so-called direct store delivery vendors who supply milk, eggs, cheese and other critical products demanded changes in payment and credit terms or threatened to stop shipments, said Michael Nowlan, a senior managing director of FTI Consulting, a financial adviser for A&P and its affiliates.\n\nIn a statement, A&P CEO Paul Hertz described the bankruptcy and store closures as the right decision to \"preserve as many jobs as possible\" and \"maximize value for all stakeholders.\"\n\n\"While the decision to close some stores is always difficult, these actions will enable the company to refocus its efforts to ensure the vast majority of A&P stores continue operating under new owners as a result of the court-supervised process,\" Hertz said. \"We greatly appreciate the continued support of our customers, suppliers and employees, who have maintained an unwavering commitment to our business and our customers.”\n\nNguyen reports for The Journal News in Westchester County, N.Y.\n\nContributing: Kevin McCoy\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2020/12/17/jcpenney-stores-closing-march-2021-list-coronavirus-bankruptcy/3940925001/", "title": "J.C.

Tier homes, schools", "text": "MARY PERHAM\n\nCorrespondent\n\nBed bugs are found in Southern Tier schools, homes and businesses.\n\nArea health departments report bed bug complaints have been rising for the last few years.\n\nMost bed bug bites occur at night are initially painless, but later turn into itchy skin welts.\n\nLike many parents, when his children were small, Tom Kump would tuck them in at night with the familiar rhyme, \"Night, night, sleep tight — don't let the bed bugs bite!\"\n\n\"But at the time, I didn't know bed bugs were real,\" said Kump, now Chemung County Director of Environmental Health.\n\nBed bugs are, unfortunately, all too real after being nearly eradicated 50 years ago. The loathsome little critters are making a comeback in the Southern Tier in suitcases, clothing and beds.\n\n\"Bed bugs are not dangerous to your health,\" Kump said. \"But they're a nuisance, and if you wake up to learn your legs have been mauled by them… well, it's not a pleasant situation.\"\n\nUntil about five years ago, Kump's office never received any complaints about bed bug infestations. Complaints of bed bugs have jumped in recent years, although the agency doesn't track the number of reports since the pests don't pose the health threat other insects or parasites, he said.\n\n\"We forward complaints to code enforcement,\" he said.\n\nBed bug infestations are code violations, although they are not enough to condemn a building, said City of Binghamton Code Enforcement Supervisor Fred Grisel.\n\nThe insects were listed in September as a part of condemnation proceedings against three buildings on Binghamton's South Side. Code inspectors cited structural deficiencies and rotting floorboards, as well as the presence of maggots, cockroaches and bed bugs.\n\nHowever, derelict or low-income housing is not the only place bed bugs are found, Grisel said. The list of places where bed bugs are found include hotels, theaters, schools, daycares and dormitories.\n\nAccording to Grisel, if reports of bed bugs are founded, code inspectors issue a violation against the tenant or property owner considered responsible for the infestation. The responsible party is advised to hire a certified professional exterminator to deal with the problem, he said.\n\n\"And it's not a matter of spraying the place once or twice,\" he said. \"No, it can be five or six times. (The cost) really adds up.\"\n\nIf a follow-up inspection shows bed bugs are still present, the tenant or owner is issued a court appearance ticket.\n\nEven a successful extermination must be followed by absolute vigilance in cleaning, Grisel said.\n\nWhile some owners may opt for over the counter insecticides claiming to kill bed bugs dead, \"some work and some don't,\" Grisel said.\n\nA chief cause for the widespread reappearance of the bug is the widespread travel habits of today's society. The apple seed–sized adult insect is a global traveler, hopping on board clothing, luggage or other items and settling in beds or walls. They aren't picky about where they stay, and have been found on airplanes, seats and coat check rooms.\n\nAnd if no hosts are handy, the bugs also can go dormant for as long as six months to a year. The bug is not known to carry disease and its bite is unlikely to cause more than an irritation similar to a mosquito bite.\n\nThat lack of risk places it lower on the alarm scale at schools than parasites, such as lice or scabies, said Ithaca City School District Nurse Judy Hoffman.\n\nLast October, the school reported a bed bug had been found in the back pack of an unidentified child. The school notified parents and guardians, and took the appropriate measures to ensure the problem was an isolated one, she said.\n\nSince then, there have been no reported sightings of the pest in any of the schools, Hoffman said.\n\n\"They are not a huge risk,\" she said. \"They don't live on the the person. They have a meal and move on.\"\n\nIt is very possible for someone to be bitten and not know about it until a welt appears at the site of the bite, according to Hoffman.\n\nWhile bedbugs are affected by temperature, it is unlikely a cold winter will exterminate them, since most places are heated, Kump said.\n\n\"Well, if they're outside in this (near zero-degree) temperature, well, they'd be dead,\" Kump said. \"But most people keep their places between 60 and 70, and that's ideal for the bugs.\"\n\nWhile the nuisance factor of bed bugs is far higher than any known health risk, the pests are capable of inflicting real misery, according to Grisel.\n\n\"You see children with a couple bites, that's one thing,\" he said. \"You see them covered with hundreds of bites, and that is an entirely different matter.\"\n\nBATTLING BED BUGS\n\nWHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. Adults look like apple seeds with legs. Young bed bugs—nymphs—look like adults, only smaller. Newly hatched nymphs are poppy seed-sized. Eggs are tiny white, and hard to spot.\n\nWHAT DOES A BED BUG BITE FEEL AND LOOK LIKE? Most bed bug bites occur at night are initially painless, but later turn into itchy skin welts. These welts do not have a red spot in the center like flea bites.\n\nARE BED BUGS DANGEROUS? Although bed bugs are an annoyance, they are not known to spread disease.\n\nHOW DOES A HOME BECOME INFESTED WITH BED BUGS? In most cases, people carry bed bugs into their homes unknowingly, in infested luggage, furniture, bedding, or clothing. Bed bugs may also travel between apartments through small crevices and cracks in walls and floors.\n\nHOW DO I CLEAN INFESTED AREAS?\n\n•Clean bedding, linens, curtains, rugs, carpets, and clothes. To kill bed bugs, wash items in hot water and dry them on the highest dryer setting. Soak delicate clothes in warm water with lots of laundry soap for several hours before rinsing.\n\n•Scrub mattress seams with a stiff brush to dislodge bed bugs and their eggs.\n\n• Bag small items and place in a freezer for 30 days.\n\n•Vacuum mattresses, bed frames, nearby furniture, floors and carpets. Pay special attention to cracks and open spaces. Immediately after vacuuming, put the vacuum cleaner bag in a sealed plastic bag, and dispose of it in an outdoor container.\n\n•Repair cracks in plaster and loose wallpaper.\n\n•If you find bed bugs on a mattress, cover it with a waterproof, zippered mattress cover labeled \"allergen rated,\" or \"for dust mites.\" Keep the cover on for at least one year.\n\n•Dispose of infested items or clutter that can't be cleaned. Seal tightly in a plastic garbage bag and discard in an outside container.\n\n• If you throw infested furniture away, make it undesirable to others by cutting or poking holes in its upholstery or making it unusable. Tape a sign to it that says, \"Infested with Bed Bugs.\"\n\n•To find a licensed exterminator, check with the Department of Environmental Conservation by calling 607-753-3095 ext. 232 or visiting http://www.dec.state.ny.us/website/dshm/pesticid/appman.htm\n\nMore information on bed bugs can be found on Cornell University's Integrated Pest Management website, located at www.nysipm.cornell.edu/whats_bugging_you/bed_bugs.\n\nSource: Broome County Health Department", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2015/10/29/hotel-fees-complaints/74747804/", "title": "10 dirty little secrets of hotels", "text": "Ed Perkins\n\nSmarterTravel.com\n\nOn average hotels do a much better job of satisfying customers than airlines — a conclusion supported by many surveys and ranking systems. But beating the airlines is a pretty low bar: No modern hotel accommodations are as downright uncomfortable and unpleasant as an economy-class airline seat.\n\nEven so, however, many hotels and hotel chains harbor some dirty little secrets they'd prefer to keep under wraps. Some are endemic while others are isolated. Here are a few you'll be glad to know.\n\nMandatory fees\n\nMandatory \"resort,\" \"concierge,\" \"housekeeping,\" and \"porterage\" fees (along with other more esoteric varieties) are the hotel industry's most active and widespread current scheme. Hotel perpetrators slice off a part of the real price, post the remaining low-ball partial price as the basic room rate, give a plausible label to the sliced-off part, and add it back in before you buy. The practice started in Las Vegas and Hawaii, but it is spreading like a cancer throughout much of the U.S.\n\nThe practice harms consumers by giving the scheming hotels an apparent price advantage over honest hotels in side-by-side price comparisons. These function as \"hidden\" fees in some cases, but for the most part hotels disclose them somewhere along the line. As is so often the case, however, disclosure is an insufficient remedy: The Florida Attorney General rightly described a similar scam a few years back as being \"inherently deceptive.\"\n\nFortunately, several consumer activists are getting after the FTC and individual states to ban the practice. And attorneys general in other states are getting interested. Consumers may see some sorely needed corrective action soon.\n\nThere is no consumer protection from overbooking\n\nThe Department of Transportation requires airlines to compensate travelers who are bumped from an oversold flight. But oversold hotel guests have no comparable protection at either the federal, state or local levels, as far as we can tell. If you show up with a confirmed reservation but the hotel is oversold and can't give you a room, the hotel has broken a contract and you presumably have a remedy through contract law. But that doesn't get you a place to sleep that night.\n\nTraditionally, if you have a reservation and a hotel is unable to accommodate you, a hotel is supposed to \"walk\" you: Find an accommodation in a \"comparable\" hotel nearby, arrange your transportation to that hotel if it's more than walking distance away, and pay for your first night. Unfortunately that practice is something of an urban legend, sometimes honored but sometimes ignored. It's neither a law nor a formal requirement anywhere, even as a recommendation from the industry's trade associations. You can ask, but you can't demand. And, as far as we know, nobody is currently working toward establishing any sort of industry standard.\n\nThey want to 'own' you\n\nMany hotel chains are following the same objective as the big airlines: They want to \"own\" you as a customer and, specifically, make sure you book through their own channels. The benefits to the hotels are 1. they don't have to pay anything to third-party online booking agencies and 2. they have a chance to upsell you or sell you something else.\n\nWhat this means for consumers is that hotels offer you some strong incentives to do things their way. They can offer membership or age-based discounts that most third-party systems can't access. And some chains now limit their \"free\" Wi-Fi or breakfast deals to members of their frequent stay programs who book directly with the hotel. The net result is that third parties are great for locating hotels, but you have to go through the hotel check for deals those third parties may not show.\n\nWi-Fi: High fees, low speeds\n\nWi-Fi is rapidly approaching deal-breaker status: If a hotel doesn't have in-room Wi-Fi, many travelers will want to go somewhere else. This is apparently true even in resort areas where the focus is (ostensibly) on enjoying the local beach or mountain. And, increasingly, customers expect Wi-Fi to be included in the room rate along with beds, ventilation and hot water.\n\nFor some strange reason, many hotels still charge for Wi-Fi. And for some really strange reason, the more upscale hotels are more likely to charge for it. That seems insane: If Motel El Cheapo can manage to offer free Wi-Fi, why does the Ritz have to charge as much as $15 to $20 a day?\n\nA related and equally appalling problem is that even expensive Wi-Fi at posh hotels can be really s ... l ... o ... w. You can see for yourself thanks to hotelwifitest.com. Some of the most expensive hotels provide extremely low bandwidth.\n\nThis problem — at least the fee part — will likely solve itself, as free Wi-Fi is on its way to becoming an almost universal norm. As to the speed, however, that's anyone's guess.\n\nUnreasonable parking fees\n\nNobody expects free parking at a hotel in midtown Manhattan or around Union Square in San Francisco. But you do expect free parking at a low-rise in a suburban location that is surrounded by an expansive parking area. Unfortunately, however, you sometimes run into parking fees at unexpected places and locations where the hotel can't really justify them.\n\nThis is more of a peeve than a serious problem, and one you can usually avoid. But it goes to show that you should always verify that the parking is free.\n\nUnresponsive climate control\n\nThe most unpleasant night I ever experienced in a hotel was at a four-star property at Orly Airport outside Paris. It was in early spring during an unseasonal heat wave. The hotel's climate control system was still set for \"winter,\" meaning only heat was on, and with windows that didn't open the room became an oven. The hotel couldn't do anything but offer a small portable fan; apparently switching the full system from heating to cooling mode required a day or more.\n\nThese days, modern hotels tend to have windows that don't open at all or, if you're lucky, open a few measly inches. Some even charge for air conditioning! And if the climate system isn't really yours to control, you can find yourself in for a bad night. You don't encounter this problem often, but when you do, the only relief is to move to a different hotel.\n\nLocation and view exaggeration\n\nThe words \"just steps to the beach\" in a brochure or online description don't mean much unless the hotel specifies how many steps it is. Similarly, a \"partial\" ocean view can be partial indeed if the only way to catch a glimpse of the sea is to stick your head out a window and look beyond a busy highway, shopping center or airport runway. And a wide-angle lens can make a closet look as big as a ballroom.\n\nYou routinely encounter mild puffery that makes a hotel seem better than it is. But hotels sometimes cross — or at least stick their toe across — the fine line between harmless exaggeration and outright lying. As a consumer, your best protection is to do some investigative research on TripAdvisor or some other source of unbiased reporting from travelers.\n\nBedbugs\n\nYes, hotels sometimes harbor bedbugs, and the problem seems to be getting worse in recent years. Hotels find it hard to prevent the invasion of bedbugs since the little critters often hitch rides on unsuspecting guests. The problem has gained a high enough profile to attract at least three websites devoted to reporting on hotel bedbug experiences: Bedbug Registry, Bedbug Reports and Bedbugs.net. You can also see bedbug reports on TripAdvisor and other reader-based hotel review websites.\n\nPrice gouging\n\nHotels jack up their rates for big events. Surely, that's not a surprise. Whether it's a Super Bowl, World Cup, World Series, Olympic Games or a big convention, local hotels typically ask double or more what they charge in normal times. In some ways, you can't blame them: After all, pricing is the classic method of balancing supply and demand, and when demand is high and capacity is fixed, the market says hike the prices until demand shrinks to the level of capacity. But you can't avoid at least a little bit of schadenfreude when predicted hordes fail to show up for a heavily hyped event and the rooms go empty.\n\nToo many palms to cross\n\nCheck into a typical motel along an interstate and the clerk hands you a key, says \"Have a nice day,\" and promptly forgets about you. But in an upscale hotel, you sometimes have to run a gauntlet of folks holding out their palms for you to cross — with bills. You've schlepped your baggage in from the airport, maybe along a half-mile of corridors, only to have someone want $3 to haul the bag a few hundred feet to your room. Want a taxi? The doorman toots a whistle, you fork over a few bucks.\n\nThe most annoying element in all this is the relatively recent trend that you're expected to tip housekeepers and other employees for services you formerly figured were covered by the room rate. This is not to say that housekeepers may both deserve and need more compensation than the hotel provides. But the sad fact is that all too many employers these days try to shift employees from fully compensated toward tip-based work categories to cut their pay.\n\nREAD THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE:10 dirty little secrets of hotels", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/best-reads/2016/02/05/yuma-prison-country-club-hellhole/73006636/", "title": "Yuma Prison: Country club or hellhole?", "text": "Ron Dungan\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nA couple of guards stood in the thin shade of a wall at Yuma Territorial Prison, watching convicts mill about the yard. It was summer, the dog days, sometime around the monsoon, and everything was quiet.\n\nThen all hell broke loose. A metal spike flashed and a guard fell. An inmate grabbed the slain guard’s rifle and fired point blank at the other guard. The cons left the yard and ran for the gates.\n\nAs they ran, they exchanged fire with guards stationed around the prison and took out the guard behind the prison’s Gatling gun. Other prisoners join them, until a frenzied mob had gathered. A steam whistle signaled that a prison break was under way.\n\nLittle stood between the convicts and their freedom.\n\nSomeone fired the Gatling gun, cutting off their escape. Behind the big, rapid-fire gun stood Madora Ingalls, the lovely wife of Superintendent Frank Ingalls. The guards regrouped. The escape attempt had been foiled by a mother of three in her late 20s.\n\nThe story is one of many surrounding the Yuma prison (referred to variously over time as Arizona Territorial Prison, Arizona Territorial Prison at Yuma and Yuma Territorial Prison). This one likely originated in newspapers, without citation, then appeared in a thin book on the prison called “The Hell Hole,” published in 1962. Later, the story appeared in another newspaper, with a time frame: July 1891.\n\nBut records on file at the state archives show that Superintendent Frank Ingalls no longer worked at the prison then. Some inmates did attempt an escape that month, during a work detail, far from the prison yard and its big gun, which was actually a Lowell battery gun. Newspapers of the day do not make any mention of the outbreak and the heroics of Mrs. Ingalls, in July 1891 or any other time.\n\nThe story of Madora Ingalls is one of several tales that have been told about the prison over the years. Strip away the myths, however, and there are plenty of stories left. Yuma Territorial Prison held a female stagecoach robber, a Tombstone gunslinger, murderers, rustlers, gamblers, robbers, polygamists from sleepy Mormon settlements.\n\nAlthough the idea of frontier justice implies hasty trials, hangings and long sentences, nobody was ever executed in the Yuma prison, though one prisoner was executed in Yuma County. Prisoners were frequently pardoned or paroled long before their sentences were up. Lawmakers and newspapers talked about how soft the prison was on criminals, and politicians made get-tough-on-crime speeches that sounded remarkably similar to the ones they make today.\n\nThere were escape attempts, of course — lots of them. Some succeeded, some did not. Sometimes men simply vanished from work detail, never to be seen again. Sometimes, they stormed the prison gates.\n\nBuilt by the prisoners themselves\n\nThe first convicts arrived before the prison was even built. They were kept at the Yuma County Jail, where Sheriff William Werninger served as the first prison superintendent. In August 1875, three prisoners pulled off the prison’s first escape attempt and headed for Sonora, Mexico. Werninger got on his horse and captured two of them.\n\nThe prison was built by the prisoners themselves, on a hill overlooking the Colorado River. They quarried rock out of the hill and made walls of adobe, mortar and granite. They plastered over the walls and whitewashed them in places, made doors from thick straps of iron shipped up the river.\n\nWerninger moved the inmates, just over half a dozen at first, from the jail to the prison site until July 1876, when there were enough cells to hold them.\n\nThe Territorial Legislature had appropriated $25,000 to build the prison. The Arizona Republican reported that it cost about $50,000 to run the prison, which came to nearly $1 for every man, woman and child in the territory.\n\nTime passed and they built more cells. Workers bored a hole in the rock on the south side of the prison until they had a room about 16 feet by 15 feet. A small hole in the roof provided ventilation and gated hallway led into what became known as the dark cell, or the snake den.\n\nThe dark cell was reserved for inmates caught fighting, trying to escape, or violating other rules. Superintendent M.M. McInerney, for example, tossed inmates into the dark cell for gambling.\n\nPrisoners sentenced to time in the dark cell were stripped to their underwear, placed inside a cage and chained to a couple of stout rings mounted on the floor. There was no light, except for the light that came in the hole in the roof, no visitors, save for the guards bringing in food. There are stories that a sadistic guard would drop snakes down the ventilation hole, but one historian cautions that those stories have not been verified and are probably not true.\n\nEach convict was assigned a number. The guards noted scars, tattoos and vices of each prisoner, the date they arrived and the length of their sentence.\n\nTheir crimes varied: Burglary, assault, mayhem, rioting, forgery, fraud, murder, manslaughter, selling liquor to Indians, robbery, rape, polygamy, seduction, prize fighting.\n\nThere was Pearl Hart, sentenced to five years for her part in Arizona’s last stagecoach robbery in 1899. Hart spent some of her prison time giving interviews to the press, posing for photos in men’s clothing, in which she is shown holding revolvers and a lever-action rifle.\n\nThere was Joe Boot, Hart’s partner in the robbery, who received 30 years, then fell from the view of history when he escaped in 1901.\n\nThere was Frank Leslie, a Tombstone gunman and reportedly a friend of Wyatt Earp. One historian describes Leslie as “a good shot, mean when drunk, fond of women and a born liar.… ” He was convicted and sentenced to life after shooting his girlfriend. Once in prison, he claimed to have a background in medicine and wound up in charge of the medical supply room.\n\nThere was Rutherford Nephew, a.k.a. Jim Thomas, a.k.a., the “Kid,” a.k.a Climax Jim, after a brand of chewing tobacco. A prolific cattle rustler and horse thief, he was also known as an escape artist who could pick locks and slip out of shackles. He broke out of one jail using a pocket knife, another with a spoon. He may have thought of escaping from the Yuma prison, but he never did.\n\nAnd there was Dewitt Whittaker, who appears to be largely unknown to history. When the guards processed Whittaker as he came into the prison, they noted that he had six gunshot wounds.\n\n'A pretty well-run prison'\n\nThe heat was oppressive. Prisoners lived in crowded conditions at a time when tuberculosis was widespread. Hospital facilities were primitive. Cockroaches thrived. Bedbugs, too, until the bunks were rebuilt.\n\nAs bad as life may have been, there were worse prisons in America. At San Quentin, in California, prisoners were flogged, spread eagle, on an X frame, John Mason Jeffrey writes in The Journal of Arizona History. “One nineteenth-century southern prison,” he writes, “used punishments known today only by such grim names as ‘cowskin,’ and ‘slue paddle,’ and ‘wooden horse.’ ”\n\n“Yuma came on line where there was a movement toward prison reform,” said Mesa Community College History Professor Paul Hietter. “Yuma was, for its time period, actually a pretty well-run prison.”\n\nPrisoners worked on various work details — on maintenance, at the farm or hospital. There was also the rock pile, where armed guards watched as men dug into a hillside on the south side of the prison grounds. But prisoners couldn’t always work, and keeping them occupied was a challenge.\n\nAlthough Madora Ingalls, the superintendent's wife, did not take up a battery gun and stop a prison break, she has been credited with starting the state’s first library. The library stocked books, newspapers and magazines for the cons to read.\n\nEventually, prison authorities gave convicts access to tools and materials. With these, the inmates made cribbage boards, picture frames, canes, jewelry, bridles, and inlaid boxes. For years, the items were sold at what one historian called a “bizarre bazaar.”\n\nIn spite of efforts to keep them occupied, the inmates considered the territorial prison a “hell hole.”\n\nYuma residents called it a country club, in part because the prison eventually had electricity, in part because it had a library. Both were seen as luxuries then, and not available to everyone in town. The craft market fueled this perception.\n\n“One can go any day to the prison and see in the yard where they (sic) are confined men laying in the shade of porches, buildings and trees, singing and sky-larking, reading the latest newspapers and periodicals of the day; joking and conversing with each other and all in all having a grand old time and all at the expense of the taxpayers who toil day in and day out to keep these men guarded and from committing depredations on themselves and their loved ones,” a local newspaper reported.\n\nIn 1893, a state commission overseeing the prison complained about the guards drinking on the job.\n\n“Prisoners seem to do and act in about any manner they please,” a joint legislative committee reported. “On going in to the prison, we find little stands of trinkets, canes, onyx fixtures, etc., made by the prisoners and for sale to visitors, and it appeared more like entering a fair where articles are kept for sale than a Territorial Prison.”\n\nThe committee wondered why the prison medical supply was under the supervision of a “prisoner under life sentence, as seems to be the case at present.”\n\nThe prisoner was probably Leslie, the Tombstone gunslinger who, by all accounts, was a model prisoner.\n\nCertainly, there were problems with contraband, then, as now. In 1897, the Arizona Sentinel reported that a prison guard discovered a cache of “six two ounce sacks of mariguana (sic) … to be smuggled into the prison. … Mariguana is a kind of a loco-weed which is more powerful than opium.”\n\nIn 1907, a local resident was caught passing opium to inmates, the local paper reported.\n\nIn 1889, the Legislature made national headlines by making train robbery a capital crime. The law was quickly put to the test: Less than a month after its passage, a group of masked men robbed a train at Diablo Canyon. They were later captured, tried, found guilty, and sent to Yuma Prison. None received the death penalty.\n\nPrisoners were frequently released before they had served their full sentence.\n\nWhittaker, the con with six gunshot wounds, sentenced to seven years for manslaughter in 1893, was pardoned in 1894.\n\nJuan Enriquez, sentenced to 30 years for murder, was pardoned after serving about nine and a half years.\n\nLeslie, sentenced to life for murder in 1890, was pardoned in 1896.\n\nElena Estrada, sentenced to seven years for manslaughter in 1900, was paroled in 1904.\n\nA violent escape unravels\n\nLegend has it that nobody ever escaped from the prison, but one historian puts the number of successful attempts at 20 or more. The Department of Corrections puts the number at 26. Countless others tried to escape and failed.\n\nIn 1879, a prisoner named Theodore Brown, who had behaved so well he was made an assistant cook, went outside the prison walls to a water storage container to fetch a cup of water, the Sentinel reported. He went back outside to return the cup, and never came back.\n\nIn 1893, the superintendent reported that M.L. Wilcox, prisoner number 870, managed to get beyond the prison walls and tried to swim across the Colorado River. He was captured within 30 minutes and was placed in solitary for 52 days.\n\nOne of the most famous escape attempts took place in 1887, when prison Superintendent Thomas Gates went to the prison shop area. As he left, a prisoner followed him and started to talk. Three other inmates joined them as they approached the sally port, a narrow entrance to the main prison. They pulled out knives and took Gates as a hostage. Others joined in as the cons exited the sally port.\n\nAn inmate assaulted the yard master and they tumbled over an embankment. Another went after a bag of provisions and still another headed for the river, but they were both pinned down by gunfire or captured. The others took Gates to his office, where they found a pistol with five rounds.\n\nAs guards and inmates exchanged fire, the escape attempt unraveled, and an inmate drove a butcher knife into the back of Gates. Lifer Barney Riggs rushed to the aid of the superintendent. He grabbed the pistol from one of the inmates and shot the knife-wielding con, put pressure on the superintendent’s wound and got him to safety. Riggs received a pardon the following year. Gates never fully recovered from his wounds. He committed suicide in March 1896.\n\nOn to Florence\n\nIn 1908, work began on a new prison in Florence.\n\nLike the Yuma prison, it was built by inmates, who slept in tents and earned credit against their sentence as the work progressed. Some had nearly served their terms and were released during construction of the new facility. Others were released shortly after the work was completed.\n\nIn September of 1909, the Holbrook News reported that the remaining inmates were ready to be transferred, and by most accounts, the transfer was complete by the end of the month.\n\nIt is difficult to know who was the last prisoner to escape from the Yuma prison, or the first to escape from Florence. The newspapers make no mention of it and surviving superintendents' reports are brief quarterly statements.\n\nIn those days, it was not unheard of to pay for the use of horses, or teams of horses. About 34 years after Werninger searched for the first escapees on horseback, the Arizona Republican published a list of county expenses, with the following notation:\n\nPete Evente, Horse hire, search of escape, September 30. Territorial Prison, Florence.\n\nThe state park\n\nWhat is left of Yuma Territorial Prison is now a state park, where visitors can walk through the sally port, see exhibits and look inside the dark cell.

Wilson High School Principal Gary Horton told WAFF-TV the removal of some of the stall doors in the boys’ restroom comes two weeks after a student vaping in the bathroom passed out. He says students sneak off to vape every day in the bathroom. Parent Rachel Munsey says she doesn’t agree with the tactic, saying the school took away the “only private place … they can do their business.” Parent Brandon Campbell says the school should instead use hallway monitors. Horton says the door removals could be temporary while the school figures out another solution.\n\nAlaska\n\nNome: Alaska Native women say the Nome Police Department has a history of failing to conduct full investigations on rape complaints. Nome police data show that from 2008 through 2017, just 8% of calls about sexual assaults against adults resulted in an arrest. Nome’s prosecutor says limited resources make it hard for police to respond to calls of all kinds. Survivors and advocates contend that Nome police pay less attention and investigate less when sexual assaults are reported by Alaska Natives. More than half of Nome’s population is Alaska Native, but all of its police department’s sworn officers are non-Native. This year the City Council approved the hiring of the police department’s first victims advocate and passed an ordinance to create a civilian oversight committee to monitor police conduct.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The cost of a gem and mineral museum under construction – set to be among the largest in the world – has grown by $3.25 million, and officials say they would, in a worst-case scenario, sell part of their collection to cover expenses. The University of Arizona’s Gem and Mineral Museum will be housed in part of the historic Pima County Courthouse. The university asked the Arizona Board of Regents to approve spending for the increased costs, which officials attributed to rising labor and material expenses. The regents voted to accept the changes Aug. 22. With the increase, the cost of the project has grown to $12.9 million, and so far the museum has raised $4 million, says Robert Downs, curator of the Gem and Mineral Museum, who anticipates the museum will receive enough in donations to cover the full cost and avoid the last resort of selling gems and minerals.\n\nArkansas\n\nCamden: Lockheed Martin has broken ground on the first part of a $142 million expansion at its southern Arkansas facility that is expected to create more than 300 new jobs. Company executives and state officials broke ground Tuesday on the new Long Range Fires Production Facility at the site in Camden. Lockheed Martin and Gov. Asa Hutchinson in June announced the expansion of its facility, which will add 326 new jobs by 2024. Approximately 650 employees currently work at the Lockheed facility. Construction for the 70,000-square-foot Long Range Fires facility is slated to be completed in the beginning of 2021.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Athletes at colleges in the state could hire agents and sign endorsement deals under a bill the Legislature sent to the governor Wednesday, setting up a potential confrontation with the NCAA that could jeopardize the athletic futures of powerhouse programs like USC, UCLA and Stanford. Gov. Gavin Newsom has not said whether he will sign it. But the NCAA Board of Governors is already urging him not to, sending him a letter Wednesday saying the bill “would erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletics” and have drastic consequences for California’s colleges and universities. The bill would allow student-athletes to hire agents and be paid for the use of their names, images or likenesses. It would stop California universities and the NCAA from banning athletes that take the money.\n\nColorado\n\nTrinidad: Gov. Jared Polis says Fisher’s Peak and the former ranch land surrounding it will become Colorado’s newest state park. Polis’ office said in a statement that the Nature Conservancy and The Trust for Public Land plan to transfer the 30-square-mile property near Trinidad to public ownership, with the goal of opening access by 2021. Polis signed an executive order during a ceremony Thursday. Trinidad Mayor Phil Rico tells the Gazette that access to the 9,633-foot Fisher’s Peak has long been a dream among residents. The Trust for Public Land and the Nature Conservancy last year pledged the $25 million needed to buy the former Crazy French Ranch after the state put down an initial $14.5 million. It will be Colorado’s 42nd state park.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State health officials are urging residents to minimize outdoor activities in the evening to avoid mosquitoes carrying eastern equine encephalitis. The Department of Public Health issued the guidance Wednesday. The virus has been identified in mosquitoes in 12 eastern Connecticut towns and in horses in two other towns. In one town, Groton, school outdoor activities have been restricted because of concern about the virus. Mosquitoes are most active from dusk to dawn. State health officials say the mosquitoes that carry the virus are active until the first heavy frost.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The deadline is nigh for anyone hankering to be the state’s chief justice. Applications from candidates seeking to replace retiring Chief Justice Leo Strine Jr. are due by noon Friday. Delaware’s Judicial Nominating Commission will then interview the applicants, who will be considered simultaneously for a potential derivative vacancy on the Supreme Court if one of the sitting justices is nominated to be chief justice. Strine announced his planned resignation in July, less than halfway through his 12-year term. He plans to step down Oct. 30. The state Senate must confirm judicial appointees and has scheduled a special session for Nov. 7. Before becoming chief justice, Strine served as legal counsel to then-Gov. Tom Carper and spent more than 15 years as a judge on Delaware’s Chancery Court.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital has hit or surpassed the 90-degree temperature mark a total of 54 days so far this year through Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. On average, D.C. sees 36 days of 90-plus temperatures for the entire year. Last year, the city recorded 42. The record is 67 days above 90, hit in both 2010 and 1980. This past July was the ninth warmest on record in the district, tied with 1955. All the temperatures were taken by the National Weather Service at Reagan National Airport.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: A 7-year-old boy made national headlines when he emptied his savings to help feed Hurricane Dorian evacuees. Now Mickey is paying it forward. Jermaine Bell saved for a year to visit Disney’s Animal Kingdom, but when he saw the terrifying storm, he decided to use his trip money to buy hundreds of hot dogs, chips and bottled water for evacuees. He had been visiting his grandmother in South Carolina at the time. He waved a sign by the road and passed out refreshments to drivers fleeing the city. On Sunday, he found Mickey Mouse and several characters on his Jacksonville doorstep, holding balloons. They gave him a “Lion King”-themed cake to celebrate his 7th birthday and a VIP getaway for later this month.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Another former building of historic Morris Brown College has burned. Atlanta Fire Rescue says it responded Wednesday night to the fire west of downtown. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the fire engulfed Furber Cottage, a onetime Morris Brown dormitory built in 1899. The college sold Furber and much of its remaining property in 2014 while in bankruptcy. Firefighters say the structure was too unstable to enter. No injuries were reported, and the cause is unknown. Furber, along with three other buildings once part of Morris Brown, was listed in 2016 as among Georgia’s most endangered historic sites. Gaines Hall, another one of the four buildings listed, was damaged by fire in 2015. Morris Brown lost its accreditation in 2002. The school remains open and is trying to regain accreditation.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s supply of doctors is the lowest since 2015 as older physicians retire and younger practitioners move elsewhere for higher pay. News organizations report workforce data shows there are now 2,819 active physicians in Hawaii, a decrease of 108 full-time doctors over the past year. A survey by the University of Hawaii Burns School of Medicine indicates the state needs at least 3,481 doctors to care for the aging population. The school’s Hawaii/Pacific Basin Area Health Education Center says a quarter of the state’s doctors are 65 and older. Center Executive Director Kelley Withy says physicians are finding opening their own offices too expensive. Withy says a new fixed payment transformation system that reduces the money earned per patient also makes the business “challenging” for doctors.\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: Seven jail inmates have filed tort claims against Canyon County because they say deputies gave them used razors to shave. The Idaho Press reports that the inmates say a deputy pulled the used razors from a biohazard waste box before handing them out to inmates to use and that all seven of the inmates tested positive for hepatitis C following the incident. The virus attacks the liver, and it is easily spread through contact with contaminated blood. The inmates say they suffered damages in an amount likely to exceed $500,000. Canyon County has until the end of November to decide whether to respond to the tort claims. If the inmates are unhappy with the response at that point, they will be able to file lawsuits against the county.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The fate of one of the oldest Greek Orthodox churches in the nation has become clear. The sale of Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church for $2.5 million to Universal Life Church was approved Tuesday by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge. The congregation of Holy Trinity will now have 75 days to vacate the building. The Chicago church’s future hung in the balance after financial woes put it on the verge of closing for good. Church officials said a bank rejected a loan request after the church was unable to secure $1.6 million in needed pledges. Holy Trinity avoided foreclosure late last year after an anonymous donation. But an issue with the money arose, forcing the church to go up for sale again. Officials say Holy Trinity is the second-oldest Greek Orthodox church in the United States.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The History Channel has dropped out of a planned documentary on John Dillinger that would have included the proposed exhumation of the 1930s gangster’s Indianapolis gravesite. A&E Networks spokesman Dan Silberman says The History Channel is no longer involved in the Dillinger documentary. Silberman says network officials won’t comment on the reasons for the withdrawal. The planned exhumation of Dillinger’s grave has become the subject of a lawsuit. Crown Hill Cemetery officials objected to the exhumation, prompting Dillinger’s nephew, Michael C. Thompson, to sue the cemetery. Thompson is one of two Dillinger relatives who obtained a state permit to exhume the gravesite, saying they have evidence Dillinger’s body may not be buried there. An Oct. 1 hearing is scheduled in the exhumation lawsuit.\n\nIowa\n\nBondurant: A small school district won’t be getting nearly $900,000 it wanted to spend as part of this year’s budget because officials have learned the budget revenue was in part based on an erroneous tax valuation from the county assessor’s office. The Polk County assessor’s office had included in the tax base figures for the Bondurant-Farrar school district a fourth building at Facebook’s giant data center in Altoona. But the $52.4 million building was exempted from taxation for 20 years as part of a development agreement the social media giant signed with the city and the Iowa Economic Development Authority. Exemptions also were granted for the center’s first three buildings. Facebook spokeswoman Melanie Roe says the company learned about the error just a few days ago.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: The Kansas and Missouri affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union say they have reached a settlement with the Federal Bureau of Prisons that allows an inmate to receive a drug used to treat his opioid addiction. The ACLU said in a news release Wednesday that the settlement allows the federal prison in Leavenworth to give inmate Leaman Crews a drug used to keep life-threatening withdrawal symptoms at bay. A federal lawsuit filed on his behalf last week sought to compel prison officials to treat his addiction with buprenorphine. Kansas ACLU Executive Director Nadine Johnson says Crews was their primary concern, but the narrow agreement focusing only on him isn’t sufficient. She says they look forward to seeing a prison policy that respects what doctors are recommending in these cases.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: Fort Boonesborough State Park is hosting its annual 1778 Siege of Boonesborough weekend this month. Events at the Madison County park will include a battle reenactment on the afternoons of Sept. 28 and 29 and a night battle at dusk on Sept. 28. The event commemorates the 1778 attack on the fort by Native Americans and French Canadians during the Revolutionary War. The settlers in the fort refused to surrender, and the attackers gave up and left. There will be militia and settlers’ camps, a Native American village, merchants, traders, pioneer skills demonstrations and food. This event is free with regular fort admission of $8 for adults and $5 for children.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Officials have voted to require new commercial parking surfaces to use porous pavement in this city where flooded streets are a common sight. The Times Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports the City Council last week unanimously ruled in favor of the pavement ordinance, which allows rainwater to flow into the soil below. Council members say the pavement won’t solve the city’s problem with flooded streets, but it will lighten the burden placed on the city’s drainage system during heavy rain. The pavement can clog if not washed regularly, so the city recently outfitted some work trucks with power-washing attachments. The ordinance comes more than a year after the city’s code was amended to require that some developments keep the first 1.25 inches of storm rainfall out of the city’s drainage system.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: Acadia National Park officials say they have some leeway in regulating so-called e-bikes following an Interior Department directive to treat them the same as regular bicycles. Superintendent Kevin Schneider tells the Bangor Daily News the park has the authority to ban or restrict e-bikes to protect users and natural resources or to balance other objectives. Thus, it remains to be seen whether bikes with electric motors will be restricted on the park’s popular carriage roads. David MacDonald, president of Friends of Acadia, says the Rockefeller family that donated the roads specified that there be no motorized vehicles. But Matt Horton, a member of Acadia’s advisory commission, says the Rockefellers were opposed to combustion engines. He said those are much different from e-bikes. The park has 30 days to propose rules.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: An attorney representing Maryland’s four historically black colleges is urging the state to settle a long-running lawsuit over disparities in programs for $577 million “over a reasonable period of time.” Michael Jones wrote Tuesday to lawmakers, after mediation failed in July. Jones notes that Mississippi settled its HBCU case nearly 20 years ago for about $517 million. Jones says that is about $791 million in today’s dollars. Jones says if Mississippi could afford that, “surely Maryland can afford a lesser amount to remedy its constitutional violation.” The colleges say the state underfunded them while developing programs at traditionally white schools. A federal judge ruled in favor of the HBCUs in 2013, saying the state unnecessarily duplicated programs. The state proposed a settlement last year of $100 million over 10 years.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nScituate: Experts say another minke whale has been found dead in state waters. The New England Aquarium says the 22-foot, sub-adult whale was found dead rolling in the surf off Scituate on Monday. The aquarium’s Marine Animal Rescue Team responded and determined the whale had likely died within the past couple of days, but because it had been significantly scavenged by sharks, a full necropsy could not be completed. The carcass showed had no evidence of marine gear interference or evidence of any other human interaction. Over Labor Day weekend, another dead minke whale washed up in Duxbury. In 2017 and 2018, a greater than normal number of minke whales died along the U.S. East Coast. In response, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared an unusual mortality event for the species.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Mercedes-Benz USA is asking a judge to protect it from legal action over its use of images of outdoor murals in Motor City in social media posts. The company says four artists threatened to file a lawsuit after their works appeared last year in Instagram posts about the G 500 Series truck. Mercedes-Benz removed the posts, although it insists it didn’t infringe on copyrights and was entitled to fair use of the murals. The company accused the artists of engaging in an “aggressive shakedown.” James Lewis says Mercedes-Benz “defamed” his mural by posting it slightly out of focus. He says it’s a “sacred piece” honoring African women. Detroit federal Judge Avern Cohn on Wednesday rejected a request by the artists to dismiss three lawsuits by Mercedes-Benz.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji: A summer of heavy rains has caused a rise in cases of a rare fungal infection in northern Minnesota. So far this year, more than 45 people and 150 animals have been diagnosed with blastomycosis. Last year, only 31 human cases and fewer than 100 animal infections were reported by this time. An epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health, Malia Ireland, tells Minnesota Public Radio News the infections are caused by fungi living in the ground. Ireland says flooding has moved land around, exposing spores to the air. The fungus thrives in moist ground, especially in wooded areas near rivers and lakes. Most of the cases were reported in northern Minnesota. Most of the animal cases are dogs, which dig their noses in the dirt.\n\nMississippi\n\nTylertown: Some students say they won’t be returning to class while they protest the removal of their prayer group from school hours to after school. News outlets report students at Tylertown High School walked out of class Wednesday and won’t return until their faith-based program, First Priority, is reinstated to its normal time, during school hours. Student Tyasia Shackleford says First Priority has existed for 15 years and meets once a month to praise God. Student Kaitlynn Brown says students “want to celebrate God,” and the school took that away. It’s unclear why the program was removed from school hours. Walthall County School superintendent Wade Carney says all student-led organizations cannot meet during instruction time. He says they can meet before or after school.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A Catholic priest says “fornication,” not pregnancy, was the problem in the case of a teacher who alleges she was fired from a Catholic school because she was pregnant and unmarried. The Kansas City Star reports the Rev. Joseph Cisetti testified Wednesday that he “praised” the decision of former St. Therese School teacher Michelle Bolen not to have an abortion but told her she violated her contract. Cisetti said that “sexual relations must take place exclusively in marriage.” He said he favored offering Bolen a contract, while the school’s then-principal didn’t. He said he was concerned about dismissing her because it might create an environment that would be conducive to abortion. Bolen said administrators concocted non-pregnancy-related reasons to justify not renewing her contract in July 2015.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Wildlife officials say feral hogs from Canada encroaching on the state’s northern border are a serious concern for farmers and others. Daily Inter Lake reports the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services division says there have been multiple reports of feral hogs near the border. An official says eight mature pigs were discovered in Canada directly above Montana’s Lincoln County this summer. Wildlife Services, the Montana Invasive Species Council, the National Feral Swine Program, and the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks department say the pigs could do widespread damage. Officials say the pigs are “rototillers” that root for food and wallow in farms, fields and forests, leaving terrain unrecognizable. The pigs may also spread diseases affecting livestock and other animals.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: City leaders are backing a proposal to restore an open-air theater in Harmon Park. The City Council heard about the plan for the Sonotorium at Tuesday’s meeting. The Kearney Hub reports Councilman Randy Buschkoetter said it says a lot about the community that members wish to preserve the landmark built in 1938. A group led by Kearney High School band director Nathan LeFeber plans to raise $683,000 to construct a roof over the stage and upgrade the structure’s lighting and sound system and backstage rooms. The city has committed $5,000 to cover the costs of structural tests and conceptual plans.\n\nNevada\n\nWadsworth: Federal officials are making fish-friendly modifications to a northern Nevada dam that for more than a century has blocked off spawning grounds for a threatened trout species that once migrated 120 miles upstream to the alpine waters of Lake Tahoe. Officials for the Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service and Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe broke ground Tuesday for a $23.5 million fish-passage project to help Lahontan cutthroat trout navigate the Truckee River’s Derby Dam about 20 miles east of Reno. It’s expected to be completed next year. Fish screens in a bypass canal longer than a football field will allow the trout – once believed to have gone extinct – to get past the high-desert dam for the first time since it was built in 1905 to divert water to farmers and ranchers.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College has become the latest university to allow students to easily change their name or gender identity in directories, on identification cards and elsewhere across the Ivy League campus. Transgender and nonbinary students have been able to request IDs and directory listings that reflect their preferred names for more than a decade, but the new policy announced Wednesday allows them to log on to the college’s information system and make changes on their own. Chosen names also will be allowed to appear on transcripts and diplomas. Campus Pride, a nonprofit organization that promotes LGBTQ-friendly learning environments, tracks such policies. It says most of the other seven Ivy League schools also provide students with a simple process to change their names or gender identities on university documents.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Gamblers wagered more than $293 million on sports in the state in August, helping Atlantic City’s casinos win 13% more than they did a year ago. Figures released Thursday by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show the nine casinos won nearly $339 million for the month, assisted by sports betting money. The Borgata won nearly $80 million and had the best month at slot machines since it opened in 2003. The two newest casinos also fared well in August. Hard Rock retained the No. 2 spot in the market with nearly $41 million, up nearly 31% from a year ago. And the Ocean casino had the best month in its short history, with more than $25 million, up more than 25% from a year ago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nGallup: A western New Mexico high school is becoming a tiny house factory to build affordable housing in a city near the Navajo Nation. The Gallup Independent reports that Hiroshi Miyamura High School in Gallup will begin a program to teach students about building tiny homes and the business behind them. Principal Jack McFarland says the program will provide real results and hands-on learning for students. He says the goal is to build about two tiny houses a year. The houses will be sold at auction at the end of the year to help recoup the costs of the project and help plan for the following school year.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A state law that went into effect Thursday lengthens the waiting period on certain gun purchases from three days to 30 days. Gov. Andrew Cuomo approved the measure in July and issued a statement Thursday saying the change will save lives. He also called on the federal government to pass universal background checks. The Democrat said New York has taken action “while the federal government turns a blind eye to the scourge of gun violence ripping our nation apart and continues to allow this bloodshed to take parents and children away from their families.” The law applies in cases where a federal background check returns an inconclusive response on a potential firearm purchaser. Extending the state waiting period will give federal authorities more time for the background checks.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: The mayor wants the public’s input on a proposed Civil War history center. The Fayetteville Observer reports Mayor Mitch Colvin is calling for a special City Council meeting to gauge support. He says the $7.5 million the city would have to invest in the project could be put to better use than the proposed North Carolina Civil War & Reconstruction History Center. Colvin, who is black, says he no longer backs the project, and he says a growing number of the city’s black residents are expressing concerns about it. Troy Williams, a criminal defense investigator and radio co-host, supports the center and accuses the mayor of stirring up opposition. Williams, who also is black, says the center will tell the truth about the war.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Department of Agriculture has confirmed the presence of a Palmer amaranth plant in a seventh county in the state. The agency said Wednesday that it found the plant in Emmons County, in the south of the state, just weeks after finding it in nearby Grant County. The Bismarck Tribune reports Palmer amaranth can grow up to 7 feet and resist herbicides. Purdue University research shows the plant’s heavy infestation can cut soybean yields by as much as 79% and corn yields by up to 91%. Brian Jenks, a North Dakota State University weed scientist, says this summer’s weed discoveries were in fields with millet. Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring says producers should monitor millet plantings for Palmer amaranth to avoid infestation.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: The school district is apologizing for posting photos that showed students with fake blood stains during an active shooter drill. Officials with the Toledo Public Schools say the photos have been removed from a Facebook post that prompted complaints. The Blade newspaper reports the photos showed high school students looking lifeless and others with red marks resembling blood on their clothes and bodies. Some people commented that they found the photos disturbing. A school spokeswoman said the district takes safety very seriously and apologized if anyone found the post inappropriate.\n\nOklahoma\n\nLawton: Officials say a house explosion that left one man dead and was initially investigated as a homicide is now considered an accident. The state Fire Marshal’s Office says the Aug. 24 blast killed chiropractor Anthony Ferrara of Cache, who operated a chiropractic clinic in Lawton and owned the vacant home about 78 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. Comanche County Sheriff Kenny Stradley told the Lawton Constitution that although there was no electricity, natural gas or propane connected to the house, a “combustion fluid” was inside the home and ignited. Stradley says there is no indication a fire was intentionally started, and investigators are waiting for the fire marshal to determine the cause of the explosion.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Officials say a diminutive fish species native only to one spring in Eastern Oregon is set to be removed from the federal list of endangered species. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the Foskett speckled dace is one of several fish species that have seen comebacks in recent years. It was proposed for removal last year. The Foskett speckled dace was first listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1985 after biologists realized it only existed in one location at a remote spring and was extremely vulnerable to habitat loss. The Bureau of Land Management purchased over 150 acres surrounding the spring east of the town of Lakeview. Federal officials worked to protect the population at Foskett Spring and introduced the fish at a second location.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The state Supreme Court was asked Wednesday to outlaw the death penalty because of what critics call the cruel and arbitrary way it’s applied to poor and black defendants. More than half of the 441 death sentences handed down since the death penalty was reinstated in the late 1970s have been deemed flawed and overturned, Assistant Federal Defender Timothy Kane told the court. Among the 155 from Philadelphia, the reversal rate is 72%. “The reliability of the system as a whole is cruel ... and the systemic problems affect every case,” Kane argued before an overflow crowd at Philadelphia City Hall. Statewide, just under half of the current death row inmates in Pennsylvania are black, compared to 11% of residents. The average appeal in Pennsylvania takes 17 years, straining the resources of the court system, critics say.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A new study estimates the state’s greenhouse gas emissions are higher than previously calculated. Brown University’s Climate and Development Lab and the Stockholm Environment Institute calculated emissions in 2017 were about 45% higher than estimated in Rhode Island’s climate planning study. The study released Thursday was based on updated science on methane leakage from natural gas infrastructure and its short-term impacts. The researchers suggest shifting to electric cars and heating systems, insulating homes, getting rid of old appliances and expanding offshore wind development. Climate lab director Timmons Roberts says the study’s ideas can be applied to other states because the big picture is largely the same, due to natural gas leakage.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Reality television star and ex-state treasurer Thomas Ravenel has been fined $500 after taking a plea deal to charges he assaulted a former nanny. Ravenel was initially charged with misdemeanor second-degree assault and battery after the nanny said the former “Southern Charm” star dropped his pants and fondled her at his Charleston home in January 2015. Ravenel pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and battery. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended if he pays a $500 fine. WCSC-TV reports Ravenel said in court Wednesday that he tried to kiss her and grabbed her arm, and he was wrong. Prosecutors say the woman agreed to the deal. Bravo took Ravenel off “Southern Charm” after his arrest. Ravenel pleaded guilty to cocaine charges in 2007 and resigned as state treasurer.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A South Dakotan has created a new online site where livestock producers can contract to sell their cattle. Kim Ulmer, who owns a livestock and machinery marketing company in Huron, says he created the American Mercantile Exchange in response to volatile market conditions. The first contract sales on the American Mercantile Exchange were made Sept. 3. Ulmer tells the Aberdeen News four loads of cattle were up for sale, and all four sold. Ulmer says sales will be limited to cattle that are close to sale weight until the mercantile has a larger database of buyers and sellers. He says selling cattle through his exchange is different from an auction barn because it eliminates the need for farmers to take the cattle to auction and sell on a particular day.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge has blocked the state’s new restrictions for registering voters from taking effect Oct. 1, saying Thursday that any benefit of the law won’t likely outweigh its potential harm. The ruling, for now, sets aside a law that goes beyond other states by fining groups that pay workers when too many incomplete registration forms are submitted. The law would also criminalize intentional infractions of a new set of rules, exposing voting advocates to misdemeanor charges. Voter registration groups who sued said the law has already curtailed their ability to enroll voters in communities of color and other historically disenfranchised groups. U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger picked apart the law in an order earlier this week, saying efforts to restrict voter registration drives to try to preserve election commission resources are akin to “poisoning the soil in order to have an easier harvest.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Eleven protesters have been arrested after they rappelled from a busy highway bridge over the Houston Ship Channel, closing the vital artery for hours. The Coast Guard said the closure came after the protesters were spotted Thursday afternoon dangling from the Fred Hartman Bridge near Baytown. The demonstrators were Greenpeace USA activists protesting the use of fossil fuels. They suspended themselves from a bridge ahead of Thursday night’s Democratic presidential debate in Houston. Firefighters rappelled to the protesters Thursday evening and lowered them to boats below. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez says 12 activists serving as spotters on the bridge also were arrested. The Port of Houston, located along the ship channel, is home to the largest petrochemical complex in the U.S.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Supreme Court has ruled that partisan state school board elections are constitutional, overturning a 2017 district court decision. High court officials say the Wednesday ruling reinstates a 2016 law meaning people who want to run for the state Board of Education can file as partisan candidates beginning in 2020. The state Board of Education is composed of 15 members who are elected to four-year terms, with elections occurring every two years. Proponents of partisan elections say political party mechanisms were needed to adequately vet school board candidates, a move lawmakers had intended under the now-reinstated law. Current and former members of the state school board and some educational organizations say the ruling could lead to an educational system driven by a single political ideology influencing curriculum and policy.\n\nVermont\n\nLyndon: Vermont State Colleges officials are holding meetings at campuses to get input as the system charts its future amid declining enrollment, low state support and other challenges. An overflow crowd of students, faculty, alumni and community members shared their worries, suggestions and criticisms at a passion-filled meeting at Northern University in Lyndonville on Thursday. They expressed concerns about the school’s growing online classes and whether the programs and school they cherish will continue. They pointed out that the college – originally Lyndon State College – only recently went through a transformation in joining with Johnson State College to become Northern Vermont University. State Colleges Chancellor Jeb Spaulding told the crowd there is no proposal to close a campus or become all Northern Vermont University Online.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia has launched a live “elk cam.” The Department of Game and Inland Fisheries says the elk cam will run annually from mid-August through November. Elk rut peaks between late September and early October. During the fall rut period, elk are highly social and stay in large harem groups out in open areas. Three viewing stations are now open on Buchanan County Industrial Development Authority property, located near Poplar Gap Community Park. The Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and the Kentucky Wildlife Resources Foundation restored 75 elk from Kentucky to Buchanan County between 2012 and 2014. The population has grown to an estimated 250.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: As the area tries to tackle its homelessness crisis, an official wants to expand a strategy of buying long-distance bus tickets for people living on the streets. The concept of sending homeless people out of town to where they say they’re from or may have support has been in place for decades in parts of the U.S. The city of Seattle and community organizations already offer free bus tickets as part of their broader approach to helping homeless people. King County council member Reagan Dunn wants to go a step further by spending $1 million to create a stand-alone bus ticket program that will emphasize “family reunification.” Critics say Dunn’s idea won’t realistically address chronic homelessness.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRainelle: Police say three protesters who chained themselves to equipment at the Mountain Valley Pipeline have been arrested. WOAY-TV reports someone called 911 Tuesday morning and said about 15 protesters were blocking the road by the pipeline near Rainelle. Officers say three other people were chained to three excavators with their arms encased in steel pipes up to their elbows. Police say the three protesters had the ability to unchain themselves from the equipment but refused. Members of the Rainelle and Clintonville fire departments were called to remove them. Officers arrested a fourth person they say refused to get out of the road. All four were charged, arraigned in Greenbrier County Magistrate Court and released on bond.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An appeals court has reduced compensation for a man who got into a legal battle over bedbugs. According to court documents, Steven Stack rented a bedbug-infested room in La Crosse from Donald Lecheler, who planned to solve the problem by moving the kitchen oven around the house, hoping to increase the temperature and kill the bedbugs. Stack said that would create a fire hazard and moved out. Stack filed a lawsuit in 2018 alleging Lecheler didn’t return his security deposit, he had to replace his mattress and clothes, and he suffered emotional distress. A judge awarded him $2,000. The 4th District Court of Appeals reduced Stack’s award Thursday to $1,000, saying Stack failed to show he suffered extreme emotional distress.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Campbell County school district trustees have decided to move forward with developing a policy that will allow armed school staff for security. The Gillette News Record reports the decision Tuesday to move forward with a policy for concealed carry staff, along with other safety procedures, followed a long and divisive comment period in which educators, parents, law enforcement and veterans spoke out. Not everyone agreed about arming school staff in the city limits, but they did agree safety was an issue and advocated for adding more school resource officers. They also agreed on the need for continued discussion. Officials say it will take at least two months to come up with a policy that will then be presented to the school board for a final decision.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/1968-project/2018/08/16/stand-up-america-george-wallaces-chaotic-prophetic-campaign/961043002/", "title": "Stand Up For America: George Wallace's chaotic, prophetic campaign", "text": "'Stand up for America' – George Wallace's chaotic, prophetic campaign\n\nWhen George Wallace took the stage, the show began.\n\nJabbing with his fist, rocking back and forth on his legs, the former Alabama governor – a bantamweight figure standing a bit under 5 feet 7 inches – would denounce Democrats, Republicans, the U.S. Supreme Court, anti-Vietnam War protestors, Communists and any person who didn’t fit his vision for the country, speaking with a banner saying \"Stand Up For America,\" the slogan of his 1968 White House campaign.\n\nHis supporters – who could stuff thousands and tens of thousands of dollars in loose change into buckets passed at the rallies – would cheer and give him standing ovations.\n\n“A lot of folks just worshipped him, the poor white people in the country,” said Tom Turnipseed, Wallace’s campaign co-chairman, in a recent interview.\n\nBut his opponents, who had not forgotten that the candidate proclaimed “segregation forever” on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol, were there, too. They yelled “Sieg heil” or “What about Selma?” at the candidate, who would yell back, sometimes losing his place in his speech. They brought signs that said “God Bless George Hitler The Smiling Bigot” and “Why don’t you die?” and “Not even Jesus could forgive what you did.”\n\nFights erupted. Wallace was the target of fruit, candy, pennies and in at least one instance, a small whiskey bottle. Peggy Wallace Kennedy, who traveled with her father’s campaign in the summer of 1968, stood on the stage at one rally when the projectiles started flying.\n\n“They had to get us off the stage,” she said in a recent interview. “They pretty much carried us to the car. Just took us from the crowd to get us to the cars.”\n\nThe chaos of the rallies reflected the chaos of a campaign that flew from rally to rally on a plane with a tendency to stall on landings and takeoffs; that, according to its campaign finance co-chair, relied on money pulled from those campaign rally buckets to meet daily expenses; and that drew people from the fringes of American life, including one man expelled from the reactionary John Birch Society for “extremism.”\n\nBut by the fall of 1968, George Wallace had pulled the major parties to the right. Republican presidential nominee Richard Nixon conceded the Deep South to him and rewrite a “southern strategy” designed to appeal to white backlash over civil rights. Wallace had also forced Democratic presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey to give a speech on “law and order,” a phrase many of Humphrey’s liberal supporters viewed as racist.\n\nWallace’s campaign – which self-destructed by November, 1968 – was rooted in its peculiar place in time, as America struggled with the traumas of Vietnam and growing unrest at home. But it also presaged the rise of later conservative politics and a political populism that would emphasize emotion over policy.\n\nHe also used tactics that his daughter and some historians see echoes of in President Donald Trump’s approach to campaigning. Like Trump, Wallace boasted of his crowd sizes; complained of “rigged polls” and accused the media of treating him unfairly, all while working to ensure the spotlight stayed on him.\n\n“He was a little bit like Trump, in that he really didn’t have to buy a lot of advertising,” said Dan T. Carter, a retired University of South Carolina professor and author of “The Politics of Rage: George Wallace, The Origins of the New Conservatism, and the Transformation of American Politics.” “He got coverage wherever he went.”\n\nPeggy Wallace Kennedy said Trump and her father “both adopted the notion that fear and hate were the biggest motivators of voters.”\n\n“They were charismatic, they knew how to work a crowd,” she said. “That’s what the average American wants in a leader. They’re looking for a leader who would rather fight first and worry about the consequences later.”\n\n‘Stand up for America’\n\nIn his campaign, Wallace dropped some of the more explicitly racist and segregationist language he used as governor of Alabama. But the ideas were the same. Speaking in Baton Rouge in June, Wallace said both parties “have supported the complete take-over of your schools by the federal government … they have trifled with our children too long and they have trifled with our institutions too long. That’s the reason I’m running for president.”\n\nHe could be more direct with right-wing publications. Wallace told National Review in 1967 that he was a segregationist (“I believe in segregation all right, but I believe in segregation here in Alabama”) and in campaign literature denounced the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as “one of the most tragic, most discriminatory pieces of legislation ever enacted,” promising to work for its repeal. The platform of Wallace’s American Independent Party denounced the “so-called ‘Civil Rights Acts,’ . . . which have set race against race and class against class.”\n\ntest\n\nWhat Wallace wanted to do if he got to the White House wasn’t clear. Judy Turnipseed, who oversaw campaign memorabilia for Wallace, said she didn’t know that Wallace “really thought through about being president, in the sense of presiding over the country.”\n\nWallace Kennedy said her father understood his voters.\n\n“Compare ‘Stand Up For America’ with ‘Make America Great Again,’” she said. “It doesn’t suggest how you’re going to do that, but it makes the average American really feel great.”\n\nWallace staffers found some of their supporters frightening. While visiting Webster, Mass. to assist efforts to get Wallace on the ballot, Tom Turnipseed visited a Polish-American club, and was invited to have a drink with the manager.\n\n“He said, ‘When George Wallace is elected president, he’s going to line up all these n-----s and shoot them,’’ Tom Turnipseed recalled. “I said, ‘Oh, hell no’ … this guy was dead serious.”\n\nBy the summer it was clear many Americans wanted Wallace to be president. The former governor reached 16 percent support in the Gallup poll in July. and Gallup found Wallace supporters were far more likely to oppose integration and believe that “Negroes themselves are more to blame than whites for their present conditions” than the nation as a whole. Wallace supporters were also more likely to consider the war in Vietnam a mistake (their candidate never committed to a clear policy on the subject, beyond declaring national aims and listening to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.)\n\nPolls also showed Wallace making inroads among northern union workers, a key Humphrey constituency.\n\n“What made Humphrey upset was that he would go to traditional strongholds or places of support for his campaign … he would go through the shop floors and see Wallace buttons,” said Michael Brenes, a Yale historian and author of an upcoming book on Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey. “He would see posters of Wallace hanging in the office of union leaders. And he and his staffers were baffled and angry by this.”\n\nBy late September, Wallace hit 21 percent national support in Gallup’s Sept. 20-22 poll, and led or was close in enough southern states to throw the election to the U.S. House of Representatives. Wallace’s stated goal was to do that to win “concessions” on civil rights, but it’s unclear how realistic that was. Tom Turnipseed said in an interview the campaign never had plan for what it might do in that situation – “we were too busy campaigning,” he said.\n\nHumphrey aides and historians believe the Democratic candidate, long a civil rights champion, would never have made any deal with Wallace. “He viewed Wallace with great distaste, largely on the basis of the civil rights issue,” said Ted Van Dyk, a speechwriter for Humphrey.\n\nA stumbling campaign\n\nThe two major candidates pushed back. Humphrey enjoyed solid support from unions, and the AFL-CIO hit Wallace (who tried to cultivate unions) hard on economic issues, highlighting Alabama’s status as a right to work state. Humphrey also took aim at the relatively poor economic conditions in Wallace’s home state, asking in one ad “what a United States of Alabama might look like.”\n\nNixon and the GOP, meanwhile, told conservative voters that voting for Wallace would mean a Humphrey victory. “Nixon’s message was ‘Don’t send Washington a message, send them a president,’” said Ken Hughes, a historian at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia who has studied Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson. Nixon also began to appropriate some of Wallace’s language, attacking busing to achieve integration and calling for “freedom of choice” plans that would leave schools segregated.\n\nThe Wallace campaign, meanwhile, was stumbling. Wallace picked retired Air Force General Curtis LeMay as his running mate. At a press conference broadcast nationwide on Oct. 4, LeMay began attacking what he called a “phobia” over nuclear weapons and – stunning Wallace and his aides –claimed that Bikini Atoll, site of nuclear weapons testing, had seen animals return to the site.\n\n“If I have to go to war and get killed in the conflict in Vietnam with a rusty knife, or get killed with a nuclear weapon, if I had the choice, I’d get killed with the nuclear weapon,” LeMay said.\n\nThe campaign exiled LeMay: “You couldn’t handle him at all,” Tom Turnipseed said. “I thought his personality was rather dour and sour.”\n\nWallace rallies were also getting a reputation for rowdiness. Hecklers followed all three campaigns in 1968, but Wallace seemed to encourage them at his rallies, blowing kisses to opponents or throwing one-liners at them (“Son, if you’ll just shut up and take off your sandals, I’ll autograph one of them as a souvenir,” he said to one).\n\n“It further adds and inflames the image of Wallace as this fire-breathing, hawkish demagogue,” Brenes said.\n\nPolicy concessions\n\nThe Wallace/LeMay ticket finished with 10 million votes, about 13.5 percent of the vote. Wallace took five southern states – as of 2018 he is the last third-party candidate to win states in the electoral college – and drew votes from both men. Van Dyk said Humphrey knew he lost when traditional Democratic strongholds in New Jersey and Ohio underperformed for them.\n\n“Humphrey was mainly preoccupied with Nixon and the Vietnam issue to bring the liberals home,” he said. “We really did see Wallace as an unpleasant distraction. We should have seen him as more important than that.”\n\nWallace also drew votes from Nixon, and some political commentators at the time thought his candidacy prevented a southern Republican breakthrough in Congress. And if he had failed to throw the election to the U.S. House of Representatives, he left an impact on the campaign.\n\nHughes said Wallace didn’t need that chamber to get concessions: “The policy concessions that came came from Democrats and Republicans competing for Wallace votes,” Hughes said.\n\nWallace said as much in a newsletter sent to supporters the following March: “Both national parties and their candidates took positions that would not have been taken had our movement not been involved,” he wrote.", "authors": ["Brian Lyman"], "publish_date": "2018/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/21/public-libraries-struggle-help-homeless-patrons-need/7843071001/", "title": "Public librarians say they're struggling to serve patrons seeking ...", "text": "Rachel Scheier\n\nFor nearly two decades, Lisa Dunseth loved her job at San Francisco’s main public library, particularly her final seven years in the rare books department.\n\nBut like many librarians, she saw plenty of chaos.\n\nPatrons racked by untreated mental illness or high on drugs sometimes spit on library staffers or overdosed in the bathrooms.

The unparalleled enthusiasm helped propel \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" to a massive, first place debut between $95 million and $97 million in North America, AMC Theatres said Sunday.\n\nIt's easily the biggest opening for a concert film of all time, and, not accounting for inflation, has made more than the $73 million \"Justin Bieber: Never Say Never\" earned in 2011.\n\nIn today's dollars, that would be around $102 million. And if it comes in on the higher end of projections when totals are released Monday, it could be the biggest October opening ever. The one to beat is \"Joker,\" which launched to $96.2 million in 2019.\n\n'Eras' tour movie etiquette:How to enjoy the Taylor Swift concert film (the right way)\n\nA unique experiment in distribution, premium pricing, star power and loose movie theater etiquette — more dancing and shouting than a Star Wars premiere — have made it an undeniable hit.\n\nCompiled from Swift's summer shows at Southern California's SoFi Stadium, the film opened in 3,855 North American locations starting with \"surprise\" Thursday evening previews. Those showtimes helped boost its opening day sum to $39 million – the second biggest ever for October, behind \"Joker's\" $39.3 million.\n\nInternationally, it's estimated to have earned somewhere between $31 to $33 million, bringing its global total in the range of $126 million to $130 million.\n\n\"This is a phenomenal number,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \"To have a blockbuster-style opening weekend for a concert film is unprecedented.\"\n\nSwift, who produced the film, went around the Hollywood studio system to distribute the film, making a deal directly with AMC, the largest exhibition company in the United States. With her 274 million Instagram followers, Swift hardly needed a traditional marketing campaign to get the word out.\n\nTaylor Swift 'Eras' movie review:Concert film a thrilling revisit of her live spectacle\n\nBeyoncé made a similar deal with the exhibitor for \"Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé,\" which will open on Dec. 1.\n\nThe two superstars posed together at the premiere of \"The Eras Tour\" earlier this week in Los Angeles. It was a needed injection of star power with Hollywood actors over 90 days into a strike that has left most red carpets void of glamourous talent and resulted in several high-profile films being pushed to next year.\n\n\"The Eras Tour,\" directed by Sam Wrench, is not just playing on AMC screens either. The company, based in Leawood, Kansas, worked with sub-distribution partners Variance Films, Trafalgar Releasing, Cinepolis and Cineplex to show the film in more than 8,500 movie theatres globally in 100 countries.\n\nThe spotlight on Swift has been especially intense lately as a result of her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. The two made separate surprise appearances on \"Saturday Night Live\" this weekend and were also photographed holding hands in New York.\n\nIt led to some hyperbolic projections going into the weekend, with some analysts predicting that \"The Eras Tour\" could make over $125 million. Dergarabedian said it's common for outsized expectations to be attached to massive brands like Swift. There's also no precedent for something like \"The Eras Tour\" and a celebrity of Swift's stature.\n\n\"The laws of gravity don't apply to Taylor Swift,\" Dergarabedian said.\n\nMore:Watching the world premiere of 'Eras Tour' concert movie with Taylor Swift felt like a dance party\n\nThe film scored well with both critics and audiences, who gave it an A+ CinemaScore, a metric that typically signals a film will continue to do well after its first weekend.\n\nElizabeth Frank, the executive vice president of worldwide programming and chief content officer for AMC Theatres, said in a statement that they are grateful to Taylor Swift.\n\n\"Her spectacular performance delighted fans, who dressed up and danced through the film,\" Frank said. \"With tremendous recommendations and fans buying tickets to see this concert film several times, we anticipate 'Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour' concert film playing to big audiences for weeks to come.\"\n\nThe stadium tour, which continues internationally, famously crashed Ticketmaster's site and re-sale prices became astronomical. Pollstar projects that it will earn some $1.4 billion. The concert film offered fans both better seats and a much more affordable way to see the show for the first or fifth time. Prices are higher than the national average, at $19.89, which references her birth year and 2014 album, and ran closer to $29 a pop for premium large format screens like IMAX. Even so, they are significantly less than seat at one of the stadium shows.\n\nShowtimes are also more limited than a standard Hollywood blockbuster, but AMC is guaranteeing at least four a day on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays at all AMC locations in the U.S. Many locations also specified that there are no refunds or exchanges. And fans will have to wait a while for \"The Eras Tour\" to be available on streaming — part of the AMC deal was a 13-week exclusive theatrical run.\n\nMichael O'Leary, CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners said in a statement the moment was, \"Another landmark weekend for cinemas.\"\n\n\"This year has been marked by unprecedented experiences for movie lovers in theaters across this nation,\" O'Leary continued in a statement. \"The 'Eras Tour' debut proves, yet again, that fans are eager to share other experiences in a communal way, with theater owners working creatively to build memorable moments in their cinemas.\"\n\nMore:Taylor Swift wraps her hand in Travis Kelce's in NYC outing after 'SNL' cameos\n\nO'Leary said that a survey of 6,000 people by his organization and The Cinema Foundation found that 72% want to see more concert films on the big screen.\n\n\"The Eras Tour\" accounted for over 70% of the total weekend box office grosses. \"The Exorcist: Believer\" placed a very distant second in its second weekend with $11 million, followed by the \"Paw Patrol\" movie in third with $7 million. Rounding out the top five was \"Saw X\" with $5.7 million and \"The Creator\" with $4.3 million.\n\n\"This is great news for theaters,\" Dergarabedian said. \"'The Eras Tour' wasn't even on our radar in mid-August. You take this out of the equation and it would have been a totally different weekend.\"\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n\"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,\" $95 to $97 million. \"The Exorcist: Believer,\" $11 million. \"Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie,\" $7 million. \"Saw X,\" $5.7 million. \"The Creator,\" $4.3 million. \"A Haunting in Venice,\" $2.1 million. \"The Blind,\" $2 million. \"The Nun II,\" $1.6 million. \"The Equalizer 3,\" $960,000. \"Dumb Money,\" $920,000.\n\nDisney 100th anniversary:Celebrate the Mouse's house with some of our favorite things", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/2015/12/04/hot-tickets-springsteen-joywave-chesney-coming/76776376/", "title": "Hot Tickets: Springsteen, Joywave, Chesney coming", "text": "Jeff Spevak\n\n@jeffspevak1\n\nThanks to a little cooperation from the Section V boys basketball playoffs, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band have a Feb. 27 show at the Blue Cross Arena on 8 p.m. Feb. 27,\n\nThe tour is a part of the release of The River: The Ties That Bind, a box set released on Friday — the same day as the tour announcement — that celebrates the band's 1980 album The River. It contains 54 songs on four CDs, plus three DVDs that include a documentary and a concert. Springsteen released similar packages around his Born To Run and Darkness On The Edge Of Town albums, but neither coincided with a tour.Tickets go on sale Friday, Dec. 11.\n\nThis will be Springsteen's seventh appearance at the venue, dating back to 1978. \"Some of these band are pretty loyal,\" notes arena manager Jeff Calkins, adding that Rush holds the record for a musical act at the arena, with nine concerts. The Section V high school boys basketball playoffs are also scheduled for that weekend, but officials agreed to play on Friday and Sunday, leaving Saturday for Springsteen.\n\nEach show of the nine-week tour will be recorded and made available for purchase on Springsteen's official website within days.\n\nSpringsteen will also play in Buffalo Feb. 25, Albany Feb. 8 and Toronto Feb. 2.

The event was re-scheduled for that December, but canceled again. A third show was booked for the following January, but two days before that date he canceled the show due to “band logistics.” Allegedly, Lil’ Wayne and his band could not make it to Rochester and also do a show the following night in Calgary, Canada. Lawsuits aplenty followed.\n\nTickets ($29.50, $39.50, $59.50 and $79.50) for February’s show go on sale at 10 a.m. Dec. 11 at livenation.com, ticketmaster.com and the Blue Cross Arena box office.\n\nThe Springsteen and Lil' Wayne concerts join already-announced shows for the arena with country singer Lee Bryce on Feb. 5 and comedian Jeff Dunham on Feb. 10. Both shows are already on sale.\n\nOde to Joywave\n\nWe knew they wouldn’t forget us: Two weeks ago, Rochester's Joywave announced it was going back on tour starting next February, but there wasn't a date for us on the itinerary. That's all been fixed, with the band this week announcing a 7 p.m. Jan. 29 show at the Main Street Armory, 900 E. Main St.\n\nJoywave is back home after an extensive seven-month tour that took it throughout the United States and Europe, accumulating a bit of a buzz in the indie-pop world during the process. It joins the Danish indie rockers New Politics, Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness and Coleman Hell at the Jan. 29 concert.\n\nTickets ($20) are available now at J.D. Oxfords, The House of Guitars, rochestermainstreetarmory.com and ticketweb.com.\n\nThink summer\n\nCountry star Kenny Chesney returns to the area with a 7:30 p.m. June 10 show at Constellation Brands Marvin Sands Performing Arts Center, near Canandaigua on the Finger Lakes Community College campus.\n\nIt is the second show announced for the CMAC 2016 summer season. British electro-pop darling Ellie Goulding has a 7 p.m. June 14 concert, already on sale.\n\nChesney’s CMAC shows have been sell-outs, including his last two appearances, in 2015 and 2013.

And yet because we're in Taylor's World, a PR infusion is just what \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" movie is getting.\n\nThe cameras cut to Taylor 17 times during the Kansas City Chiefs-New York Jets game Sunday night, giving her film another dose of marketing less than two weeks before the doors swing open at theaters around the world.\n\n\"She’s on top of the world, that's the simplest way to put it,\" says Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, which tracks movie industry trends. \"Her acumen as an incredibly smart business person has been on display for a long time, it's only been added to now.\"\n\nThe blitz comes courtesy of Swift's recent appearances at Chiefs games, where the singer has been spotted cheering alongside Donna Kelce, the mother of star Super Bowl tight end − and impressively passable \"Saturday Night Live\" host − Travis Kelce.\n\nWhile neither celebrity has been public about what their friendship is all about, the end result has been a nonstop media spotlight just as Swift is looking to pack theaters for her film.\n\nIs the Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce romance a publicity stunt?\n\nSome have crowed that the pairing is but a publicity stunt to boost sales, where others, including TV star Valerie Bertinelli, have posted impassioned defenses of the duo.\n\n“Can all of you Negative Nellies just stop? Stop!” the “One Day at a Time” actress said on TikTok over the weekend. “Let the rest of us enjoy watching two successful, funny, talented, incredibly gorgeous human beings − let us enjoy watching them fall in love.”\n\nResponded one fan: \"100%. Like they really need a PR move. Really! Respectfully enjoying.\"\n\nTaylor Swift's concert movie is set to hit more than 7,500 movie screens worldwide\n\nRegardless of the genuineness of the relationship, the buzz surrounding it is bound to pour rocket fuel on an already-raging fire. Initially, the movie was slated to play at more than 4,000 theaters around North America, but recently European showings have been added that will bring that total to around 7,500 movie theaters globally.\n\nThat puts \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" on par with some of the biggest Hollywood blockbusters. July's release of Tom Cruise's latest \"Mission Impossible\" installment also was in around 4,000 theaters.\n\nMovie industry experts predict that Swift's concert film, which took in $26 million in pre-sales the day tickets were announced, could make more than $100 million in its opening weekend, obliterating the totals for previous top-grossing concert films such as Michael Jackson's \"This Is It\" (2009) and Justin Bieber's \"Never Say Never\" (2011).\n\nAMC, the film’s distributor, reported the highest revenue day for advance ticket sales in the theater chain's 103-year history when Swift's film was announced.\n\nAre American fans heading overseas to catch Taylor Swift's Eras tour?\n\nThe hype over the film and Swift in general these days is also helping drive up prices on the secondary market for her already sold-out shows in Latin America, experts say. The tour resumes Nov. 9 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before continuing to Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo, Brazil.\n\nStubHub reports that so far 50% of the sales for Swift's international dates have come from the U.S.\n\nWhy are tickets to Taylor Swift's 'Eras Tour' movie selling so well?\n\nAt this point, Swift is such a global cultural phenomenon that she is likely bringing both devoted fans and the curious into theaters, says Robbins.\n\n\"The biggest X factor (in terms of the movie's box-office take) is figuring out how many of her non-fan-base will come see it, a bit like how 'Barbenheimer' cross-promoted 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' to different audiences,\" he says of two recent and wildly different blockbuster movies that came out on the same day. \"That's kind of what might happen here. Taylor is all over the media, and that likely pulls in people who want to be part of the cultural moment.\"\n\nRobbins also adds that lofty box-office expectations are in part because ticket prices are higher today than when Jackson and Bieber put out their films. Tickets for \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" are priced at $13.13 for children and $19.89 for adults, with their $16 average \"being a bit higher than what most films bring in,\" he says.\n\nTaylor Swift and Beyoncé could change the movie theater business with their concert films, experts say\n\nSwift's popularity could have a similarly seismic impact on the movie theater business, which teetered on irrelevance during the pandemic and continues to grapple with shifting viewer habits. The announcement by Swift that she was releasing her film on Oct. 13 caused producers of \"The Exorcist: Believer\" and other titles to change their release date as not to compete with \"The Eras Tour.\"\n\nWith fellow music superstar Beyoncé announcing Monday that a concert film of her recently completed Renaissance world tour would also be coming to the big screen on Dec. 1, theater owners have a rare opportunity not only to make money as the Hollywood actors strike roils the industry but also noticeably shift their business strategies.\n\n\"You’re going to see this movie really turn into a form of experiential marketing, much like the tailgating parties of the concerts themselves,\" says Bob Mitchell, adjunct instructor at American University’s Kogod School of Business, of the audience attracted to the Swift film. \"Well, movie chains aren’t used to that at all, they’re focused solely on real estate, on putting butts in seats.\"\n\nMitchell says new opportunities for theaters could include providing unique content from Swift for her fans, accessible only via the theater company's app, or perhaps selling Swift merchandise at the theater.\n\nBut that remains in the land of possibilities. For the moment, the main person benefitting directly from Swift's incredible ubiquity would be Swift.\n\nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce:Why we're invested – and is that OK?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/07/22/star-wars-jaws-titantic-hollywoods-high-grossing-films-inflation/1796847001/", "title": "Top 10 films at the box office when adjusted for inflation", "text": "Sarah Whitten\n\nCNBC\n\nAs “Avengers: Endgame” has raced its way to and beyond the highest-grossing film record held by “Avatar,” questions have arisen about how Hollywood determines what movie is considered the biggest earner.\n\nAfter all, “Avatar” was released in 2009, so wouldn’t a fairer comparison to 2019's “Endgame” be adjusted for inflation?\n\nWell, it’s not that simple.\n\nThere’s a reason the film industry doesn’t measure the success of modern movies against those of the past – movie ticket inflation isn’t an exact science. There are so many factors behind what makes a movie a box-office success and those factors have changed since the earliest days of cinema.\n\nFrom Hollywood to Seoul:How #MeToo is upending Asian entertainment industries\n\nDisney bought Marvel for $4 billion:It’s made over $18 billion since\n\nFor one, consumers have many more choices of what to spend their money on when it comes to entertainment. Even if you exclude sporting events, concerts and at-home entertainment such as streaming services and video games, just the sheer number of options of what movie to see in theaters is so much larger than 50 years ago.\n\nFor that reason, a film like “Gone With the Wind” sold more than 200 million tickets over the course of its initial release and additional seven re-releases in the U.S. For comparison, Disney’s “Endgame” sold around 94.8 million tickets domestically since its release in April.\n\nThe content of movies has also changed drastically. Three-hour dramas about the lives of Southerners during the Civil War wouldn’t be as popular in 2019 as they were in, say, 1939. So, it would be difficult to say with certainty that a film that thrived decades ago would still do so today.\n\nAnother major reason that Hollywood doesn’t adjust for inflation is the number of foreign markets films are now released in. Analysts would have to dive into each global market to determine the inflation rate in each country, a task that is nearly impossible considering most films are released in more than 100 markets during their initial run.\n\nStill, it’s an interesting exercise. So, CNBC contacted Comscore, a media measurement and analytics company, to work out how an adjusted figure could be determined. Paul Dergarabedian and his team devised a method wherein they divided the average ticket price for the year a film was released into the film’s gross to determine the estimated number of tickets the film would have sold. Of course, this gets tricky, especially considering so many high-grossing films are re-released long after their initial debut.\n\nFor instance, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” was released in theaters in 1937, 1983, 1987 and 1993. So for these films, Comscore used the average ticket price for each of those different years and divided them into the gross for each re-release.\n\nTo be sure, this isn’t a perfect method. Average ticket prices are just that, an average. There’s no way to break down the price of IMAX screenings and 3D screenings, or pricing based on region.\n\nNot to mention, ticket prices vary by year. In 2017, the average ticket price was $8.97. In 2018, it was $9.11. This year, it is $9.01. So if this adjustment had been done last year, the numbers would have been significantly higher.\n\nThat being said, here are the top 10 highest-grossing films in the U.S. if Hollywood did adjust the box office, based on modern ticket prices:\n\n10. 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937)\n\nEstimated admissions: 109 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $982 million\n\nSince 1937, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” has garnered around $184.9 million at the domestic box office. The film was the first full-length animated feature from Disney.\n\nThe film has been re-released at least three times and made more money from those re-releases than it did from its initial 1937 release.\n\nComscore determined that since its debut, around 109 million tickets have been sold. At today’s average ticket price, the film would have made nearly $1 billion in the U.S.\n\n9. 'The Exorcist' (1973)\n\nEstimated admissions: 116.5 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.04 billion\n\nOne of only six horror films to be nominated for the Academy Award for best picture, “The Exorcist” has hauled in more than $232.9 million since its 1973 debut.\n\nThe film made the bulk of its money during its initial release. It was brought back to theaters in 2000 and 2010 with extended scenes.\n\nAdjusted for today’s ticket prices, “The Exorcist,” which sold an estimated 116.5 million tickets, would have made around $1.04 billion.\n\n8. 'Doctor Zhivago (1965)\n\nEstimated admissions: 124.6 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.12 billion\n\nReleased only in 1965, “Doctor Zhivago” earned $112.1 million during its run in theaters and won five Academy Awards.\n\nIt’s estimated that around 124.6 million tickets were sold for the film. Adjusted for today’s ticket prices, that would be around $1.12 billion at the box office.\n\n7. 'Jaws' (1975)\n\nEstimated admissions: 128 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.15 billion\n\nSteven Spielberg’s “Jaws” was released in theaters in 1975 and earned $260 million. Like “The Exorcist,” it is one of six horror movies to be nominated for best picture. It did not win the award, however.\n\nComscore estimates that around 128 million tickets were sold during the film’s run. Adjusted for today’s ticket prices, the film would have earned around $1.15 billion at the box office.\n\n6. 'The Ten Commandments' (1956)\n\nEstimated admissions: 131 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.18 billion\n\nThe 3-hour-and-40-minute feature debuted in 1956 and earned $65.5 million.\n\nThe iconic film, which featured famed actors Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Rameses II, sold an estimated 131 million tickets during its run. Adjusted for today’s ticket prices, the film would have earned around $1.18 billion at the U.S. box office.\n\n5. 'Titanic' (1997)\n\nEstimated admissions: 143.5 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.29 billion\n\n“Titanic” is regarded as one of the best films in industry history and is also one of the highest-grossing. Without adjusting for inflation, James Cameron’s masterpiece is the sixth highest-grossing film in the U.S. and the third-highest grossing film globally.\n\nThe film has been re-released twice in addition to its initial run, once in 3D and once to celebrate its 20th anniversary. During those runs, the film earned $658.6 million domestically.\n\nIt’s estimated that “Titanic” sold around 143.5 million tickets. Adjusted for today’s ticket prices, the film would have earned around $1.29 billion at the U.S. box office.\n\n4. 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' (1982)\n\nEstimated admissions: 147.9 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.33 billion\n\nThe four-time Academy Award-winning “E.T.” hauled in $434.9 million since it was first released in 1982. Although it was re-released twice, once in 1985 and once in 2002, the film made the bulk of its earnings during its debut.\n\n“E.T.” sold an estimated 147.9 million tickets, which translated to around $1.33 billion in ticket sales using today’s average ticket price.\n\n3. 'The Sound of Music' (1965)\n\nEstimated admissions: 157.2 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.41 billion\n\n“The Sound of Music” was released twice in theaters. Once was its 1965 debut, where it made the bulk of its $158.8 million haul in the U.S., the other was a 2018 re-release.\n\nComscore estimated that the film, which won five Academy Awards, sold around 157.2 million tickets. That is around $1.41 billion when adjusted for today’s ticket prices.\n\n2. 'Star Wars' (1977)\n\nEstimated admissions: 178.1 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.6 billion\n\n1977′s blockbuster “Star Wars” has been reissued at least twice since its initial debut and has earned $460.9 million at the U.S. box office.\n\nIn the last four decades, the film has sold an estimated 178.1 million tickets, which equates to around $1.6 billion at the modern domestic box office.\n\n1. 'Gone With the Wind' (1939)\n\nEstimated admissions: 201 million tickets\n\nEstimated adjusted gross: $1.81 billion\n\n“Gone With the Wind” has been re-released at least seven times since its initial debut in 1939, Comscore said.

Guillotines! Electric Chairs! My Adventures in the Alice Cooper Group.\"\n\nBut Dallas record store owner Chris Penn of Good Records, where Dunaway's signing was scheduled to happen, had chosen that date in October 2015 because he knew the singer had the day off from touring in Texas.\n\nThat's how he was able to orchestrate a rare reunion concert by the group whose 1973 U.S. tour in support of the chart-topping \"Billion Dollar Babies\" album broke box-office records then held by the Rolling Stones.\n\n'It was a perfect creative machine': An oral history of Alice Cooper's 'Killer' at 50\n\nHow tour led to 'Live From the Astroturf'\n\nDirector Steven Gaddis was on hand to capture Cooper, Dunaway, guitarist Michael Bruce and drummer Neal Smith in action for “Live From the Astroturf, Alice Cooper,\" which won multiple awards at festivals around the world.\n\n\"I was gonna go sign books and do a Q&A on my own,\" Dunaway told the Arizona Republic in 2019.\n\n\"And then we found out that Alice was going to be in town and have a day off, so Chris asked if Michael and Neal would be interested in playing and we ended up turning it into this massive event around the book signing.\"\n\n'The party that never ended':An oral history of Alice Cooper's 'Love it to Death' at 50\n\nDunaway: 'Not bad for no rehearsal'\n\nIt's a stellar performance and the sound is great.\n\nOr as Dunaway told The Arizona Republic, \"Not bad for no rehearsal and having not played those songs in quite a few years. The night before, Neal, Michael and I got together and made sure the amps were working... It was more like a soundcheck than a rehearsal but, you know, it’s not like we haven’t played those songs before.\"\n\nThey hadn't done \"Elected\" in awhile. Ryan Roxie, who was filling in on guitar for the late great Glen Buxton, who died in 1997, talked them into doing that one.\n\n\"But it came out great,\" Dunaway said. \"As soon as you hear the original sound and all of the parts being played the way they were written, it makes things kind of fall into place naturally.\"\n\nFrom 'Love it to Death' to 'Detroit Stories': The best Alice Cooper albums ranked\n\nWhat Alice Cooper songs did they play?\n\nThe concert opens with Bruce on lead vocals for \"Caught in a Dream,\" the opening track on their breakthrough album, \"Love it to Death.\"\n\nThen, Cooper makes his entrance with guitarist Ryan Roxie of his touring band and joins his former bandmates in a raucous trip down memory lane, from \"Be My Lover\" to \"I'm Eighteen,\" \"Is It My Body?,\" \"No More Mr. Nice Guy,\" \"Under My Wheels,\" \"School's Out\" and \"Elected.\"\n\nThe soundtrack also features an instrumental version of the Alice Cooper classic \"Desperado\" from soundcheck.\n\nWhat was Alice Cooper like in high school? Friends and bandmates share their stories\n\nAlice Cooper group reunions through the years\n\nThat show led to other opportunities for Cooper's former bandmates, who met as teens in Phoenix in the '60s.\n\nEach album Cooper has released since then — 2017's \"Paranormal\" and last year's \"Detroit Stories\" — has included two reunion tracks.\n\nThe former bandmates also did a U.K. tour and an industry event in Nashville in 2017 (which led to Cooper having them onstage to take part in the encore at his Nashville concert).\n\nThe original members went their separate ways after \"Muscle of Love\" in 1974. Cooper went solo the following year with \"Welcome to My Nightmare.\"\n\nThe four surviving members reunited in 1999 at the second Glen Buxton Memorial Weekend at CoopersTown in Phoenix and played Cooper's Christmas Pudding with Steve Hunter on guitar in December 2010 at the Dodge Theatre (now Arizona Federal Theatre).\n\nIt was at that Christmas Pudding concert that longtime producer Bob Ezrin announced that they'd been chosen for induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThey reunited again at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony the following March and again a month later to play the Revolver Golden Gods Awards and record a live set for a Jägermeister Ice Cold 4D webcast.\n\nThey also appeared on three tracks on the \"Welcome 2 My Nightmare\" album in 2011.\n\nThe Dallas record store concert was the first they'd played together since those events in 2011.\n\nThe Female Elvis: How a Phoenix rockabilly teen made the cover of Bob Dylan's book\n\nThe Phoenix origins of Alice Cooper\n\nCooper, Dunaway and Buxton made their first onstage appearance in the Cortez High School \"cafetorium,\" shaking the wigs they'd bought at Woolworth's while spoofing the Beatles as part of a talent show.\n\nBy the time they hit the Phoenix club scene as the Spiders, they'd recruited Bruce, a North High football player, scoring a regional hit with a single called \"Don't Blow Your Mind.\"\n\nAfter changing their name to the Nazz, they moved to Los Angeles in 1967, where Smith, a Camelback High grad who'd been in art classes with Dunaway, Cooper and Buxton at Glendale Community College, joined on drums.\n\nThis month marks the 50th anniversary of the \"School's Out\" album, the title track of which remains their highest-charting U.S. hit.\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.

The delays had many fans believing they would never, ever, get tickets (…like ever). But tickets to the pop star’s “The Eras Tour” were available Wednesday via the resale market — with some priced at tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nTickets for Swift’s show at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey on May 26 are listed for as much as $21,600 each on ticket resale site StubHub.\n\nThat price tag will get fans a spot on the floor in front of the stage. As for just getting into the stadium — that’ll cost at least $350 on Stubhub.\n\nThese sky-high prices aren’t just for shows at MetLife, which is right outside New York City. Other dates on Swift’s 52 show tour are commanding insane amounts of money too.\n\nFloor seats for the tour’s March 17 opening night in Glendale, Arizona are going for as much $17,010 while floor tickets for Swift’s show in Atlanta on April 28 on are listed for as much as $35,438.\n\nTo put these numbers in context, tickets to last season’s Super Bowl between the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals at SoFi Stadium in LA averaged $10,427, with the cheapest seats going for about $7,000.\n\nA StubHub representative told CNN Business Wednesday that the resale site had many Swift tickets selling for around “$150 with averages around mid $600.” However, they noted that it’s only the pre-sale period right now “so demand is at its highest and these prices will settle.”\n\nThe company also pointed out that “that listing prices aren’t an indication of demand or what the market can bear.”\n\nAs for Ticketmaster, the company issued a statement Tuesday via Twitter saying that “there has been historically unprecedented demand with millions showing up” to buy tickets for Swift’s tour. The company told customers still waiting in the virtual queue that it is moving and to “hang tight.”\n\nAlthough the demand and prices for Swift’s tour, which wraps up August 9 in Los Angeles, are astronomical, it speaks to how popular she is.\n\nSwift has had countless hits over her career, built up a loyal following of fans — better known as “Swifties” — and recently became the first artist ever to simultaneously claim all top ten spots on the Billboard Hot 100 following the release of her latest album, “Midnights,” which came out last month.\n\n– CNN’s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/media/taylor-swift-ticketmaster/index.html", "title": "Taylor Swift: Ticketmaster fiasco 'excruciating for me' | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTaylor Swift spoke out Friday about the ticketing debacle that took place this week, as many fans were unable to purchase tickets for her upcoming tour on Ticketmaster.\n\n“It goes without saying that I’m extremely protective of my fans,” Swift wrote on Instagram on Friday. “It’s really difficult for me to trust an outside entity with these relationships and loyalties, and excruciating for me to just watch mistakes happen with no recourse.”\n\nSwift blamed Ticketmaster for the snafu, noting that there were a “multitude of reasons why people had such a hard time” getting tickets.\n\n“I’m not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them, multiple times, if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could,” the singer wrote. “It’s truly amazing that 2.4 million people got tickets, but it really pisses me off that a lot of them feel like they went through several bear attacks to get them.”\n\nSwift added that she would try to “figure out how this situation can be improved moving forward.”\n\nSales for the singer’s new Eras Tour began Tuesday, but the heavy demand snarled the ticketing site, infuriating fans who couldn’t snag tickets. Customers complained about Ticketmaster not loading, saying the platform didn’t allow them to access tickets, even if they had a pre-sale code for verified fans.\n\nOn Thursday, Ticketmaster announced that the sale to the general public, which was scheduled to begin Friday, had been canceled due to “extraordinarily high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory to meet that demand.”\n\n“To those who didn’t get tickets, all I can say is that my hope is to provide more opportunities for us to get together and sing these songs,” Swift added.\n\nAnti-hero behavior\n\nTaylor Swift is one of the most popular artists in music. That popularity made it hard to find a ticket to her new tour. Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\nThe issues for Ticketmaster started on Tuesday, when the site’s sale kicked off for “verified fans” — a mechanism aimed at eliminating bots that gives presale codes to individuals.\n\nThe “verified fan” platform was created in 2017 to help Ticketmaster handle situations of enormous demand, but as more than 3.5 million people pre-registered to be a Swift “verified fan” the system became overwhelmed. That’s the largest registration in the company’s history, according to Ticketmaster.\n\n“Historically, working with ‘Verified Fan’ invite codes has worked as we’ve been able to manage the volume coming into the site to shop for tickets,” the company wrote on Thursday in a blog post that has since been taken down. “However, this time the staggering number of bot attacks as well as fans who didn’t have invite codes drove unprecedented traffic on our site.”\n\nTicketmaster noted that it “usually takes us about an hour to sell through a stadium show,” but the site slowed down some sales while delaying others to “stabilize the systems.” That brought everything to a halt.\n\nThe site seemed to have avoided major problems on Wednesday when pre-sales began for Capital One credit card holders. But the company’s inability to deal with demand for Swift’s tour as well as a lack of tickets to meet further demand essentially killed Friday’s planned sale to the general public.\n\nFans blamed Ticketmaster while others, including members of Congress, heavily criticized the company’s control of the live music industry.\n\n“Ticketmaster’s power in the primary ticket market insulates it from the competitive pressures that typically push companies to innovate and improve their services,” Senator Amy Klobuchar wrote in an open letter to its CEO on Wednesday. “That can result in the types of dramatic service failures we saw this week, where consumers are the ones that pay the price.”\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal echoed Klobuchar’s concerns, tweeting that the tour “is a perfect example of how the Live Nation/Ticketmaster merger harms consumers by creating a near-monopoly.”\n\n“I’ve long urged DOJ to investigate the state of competition in the ticketing industry,” he said. “Consumers deserve better than this anti-hero behavior.”\n\nThe Justice Department has launched an antitrust investigation into LIve Nation, the owner of Ticketmaster, to look at whether the company has a monopoly in the market for concerts, including ticket purchasing, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. The New York Times first reported the investigation Friday.\n\nThe Department of Justice has been contacting music venues and other ticket market participants in recent months, asking about Live Nation’s practices and industry dynamics, the Times added.\n\nThe Justice Department and Live Nation did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nAs goes Swift, so goes the music industry\n\nTaylor Swift kicks off her new tour next March. It hits 52 stadiums across the US. Terry Wyatt/Getty Images\n\nThe backlash also highlighted the enormity of Swift’s popularity\n\nThe pop star has had countless hits over her career, built up an ultra-loyal following of fans — better known as “Swifties” — and recently became the first artist ever to simultaneously claim all top 10 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 following the release of her latest album, “Midnights,” which came out last month.\n\nHer Eras Tour — which kicks off in Glendale, Arizona on March 17 and wraps up in Los Angeles on August 9 — is hitting 52 stadiums across the US.\n\nTicketmaster noted on Thursday that more than two million tickets were sold Tuesday for Swift’s upcoming tour — the most ever for an artist in a single day. The company also said that demand for tickets to the Eras Tour was twice that of 2022’s top five tours and the Super Bowl combined.\n\n“Based on the volume of traffic to our site, Taylor would need to perform over 900 stadium shows (almost 20x the number of shows she is doing),” Ticketmaster wrote on Thursday. “That’s a stadium show every single night for the next 2.5 years.”\n\nTickets for Swift’s upcoming tour also resulted in astronomical prices on ticket resale sites, with some tickets being listed for tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nSince her debut album in 2006, Swift has also built herself into a cultural icon with immense influence to move the needle over issues in the industry. She has taken on music streaming services like Spotify (SPOT) and Apple Music regarding artist pay and is currently re-recording her songs to reclaim ownership of her masters.\n\nIn many aspects, as goes Swift, so goes the music industry.\n\nSerona Elton, professor of music industry at the University of Miami’s Frost School of Music, further explained Swift’s popularity by noting her success in both music sales and touring. Most music is now consumed via streaming, she said, which is more popular among younger generations who skew slightly female.\n\n“The demographic group that is driving the highest percentage of music consumption sees themselves in her, and closely relates to what she sings about,” she said.\n\n– CNN’s Evan Perez and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/2016/03/17/coming-up-carrie-underwood-stomp-tobymac/81831320/", "title": "Coming up: Carrie Underwood; Stomp; TobyMac", "text": "Dave Acosta\n\nEl Paso Times\n\n“Sesame Street Live: Make A New Friend”: Elmo, Grover, Abby Cadabby, and their Sesame Street friends welcome Chamki, Grover’s friend from India, to Sesame Street on stage at the Abraham Chavez Theatre, Downtown.

Power pop, adult alternative, adult punk, even fusion are just some of the terms that have been used through the years to describe Folds’ melodic, sometime witty, sometimes acerbic songs.\n\nAnd the pianist-singer-songwriter from North Carolina has added a blend of classical and pop-rock to his repertoire, with his Concerto for Piano and Orchestra that premiered in 2014 with the Nashville Symphony and his 2015 album release, “So There,” in collaboration with New York-based chamber music group yMusic.\n\n“Innovations in pop music come slower and slower each year,” Folds said. “I think one awesome door to walk through is this, the world of classical music from whence all our ideas of composition grew. That world is hurting right now and it could use pop musicians. And pop musicians could use the classical world because it’s so full of possibility and sounds. It’s endless.”\n\nAlong with touring, Folds’ recording career includes multiple studio albums, a pair from live performances, a remix collection, music for film and TV, and an all a cappella record.\n\nFolds also has composed for, collaborated with or worked on recordings with acts ranging from Kesha, Sara Bareilles and Regina Spektor to Rickie Jones and Weird Al Yankovic. Folds also produced William Shatner’s 2004 album, “Has Been.” He was seen as a judge on the NBC-TV singing competition “The Voice” from 2009 to ‘13.\n\nThe Ben Folds Five hit mainstream radio with the 1997 release of its second album, “Whatever and Ever Amen,” which featured the adult contemporary and modern rock hits “Brick,” “Battle of Who Couuld Care Less” and “Song for the Dumped” and was hailed by some critics as one of the best albums of the year.\n\nFolds started pursuing a solo career a few years later (although the Ben Folds Five re-formed for recordings and concerts in the 2010s), but not before the Five released 1999’s “The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Meissner,” which not only contained the single “Army” but also the seeds of Folds’ eventual mix of classical and pop-rock music.\n\n“If you knocked the vocals off that record and string together all the instrumental parts, you’ll hear something that sounds a lot like the concerto,” Folds said. “It’s something I’ve been doing since the start of my career, it’s part of my voice. The best compliments I receive on the concerto are when someone says, ‘Man, I knew it was you after eight bars…’ That, to me, in the context of what I’m trying to do, is success.”\n\nBen Folds is in concert at 8 p.m. July 8 at Door Community Auditorium, 3926 Wisconsin 42, Fish Creek.

If you're a Taylor Swift fan, that would be today, as the mad dash began to attend her newly announced Eras tour concert film.\n\nLet's be frank. It's time to call 2023 what it is: the year Taylor Swift took over the world.\n\nAfter conquering the live music industry, the 33-year-old pop star now is boosting the flagging fortunes of the movie theater business, which has yet to recover from the one-two punches of the coronavirus and streaming habits.\n\nSwift's announcement via social media channels Thursday that \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" will come to the big screen Oct. 13 sent fans scrambling to scoop up $19.89 tickets at the AMC Theatres site, spawning wait times not dissimilar to Ticketmaster.\n\n\"The only place where you can replicate the global excitement of Taylor Swift’s live concerts is inside a movie theater with immersive, state-of-the-art projection and sound alongside a vocal crowd of passionate fans,\" says Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners.\n\nHe hailed Swift for showing \"the true potential of what a concert film can do in theaters. This is a great opportunity for fans to experience a huge cultural phenomenon in a very accessible way.\"\n\nSearches for AMC, which will distribute the taped concert movie, spiked more than 1,000% globally. AMC stock also enjoyed a brief bounce from the Eras movie news.\n\nTickets are on sale now for Taylor Swift's 'Eras Movie,' a new way for Swifties to bask in the tour\n\nFor Swift, a concert film could be seen as yet another way to cash in on an extraordinarily successful tour. But, as many of her fans would surely point out, there is also an altruistic component to the move that goes beyond mere cash generation.\n\n\"The Eras Tour has been the most meaningful, electric experience of my life so far and I’m overjoyed to tell you that it’ll be coming to the big screen soon,\" Swift wrote in an Instagram post. \"Starting Oct 13th you’ll be able to experience the concert film in theaters in North America! Tickets are on sale now at amctheatres.com. Eras attire, friendship bracelets, singing and dancing encouraged.\"\n\nUnderstandably, Swifties are crowing. \"Taylor dominating music charts, streaming platforms, stadiums and now cinemas all in 2023 ... I don't know a bigger peak year than this,\" @samfromthevault wrote on X (formerly Twitter), adding a photo of Swift raising a glass of wine.\n\nThe forthcoming concert film − a boon to those who couldn't get their hands on tickets that cost four figures and beyond − has already inspired a meme that recalls the \"Barbenheimer\" mashup when \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" were released on the same day this summer.\n\nThe new meme? \"#Exorswift,\" a nod to the planned same-day release of the old horror movie's sequel, \"The Exorcist: Believer.\" But late Thursday, it appears Swift scared off the devil as \"Believer\" was shifted to an Oct. 6 release.\n\nSwift, whose Eras tour is projected to generate more than $5 billion in consumer spending, isn't just getting fans to open their wallets. In barnstorming across the nation, the one-woman dynamo also has managed to lift pandemic-battered spirits and generate mass gatherings in a way that was unthinkable a few years ago.\n\nThe explosion of Taylormania has been nothing short of extraordinary. Although she had millions of fans before the pandemic, that base has grown significantly. New, younger fans just discovering the singer are being joined by older music lovers urged on by a wide range of music critics who, if late to the party, now acknowledge Swift as a legitimate songwriter.\n\n\"She's in a class of her own right now,\" says Jason Lipshutz, executive director of music at Billboard. \"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we're at this moment where there's no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that's on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\"\n\nSo much so that Swift's music has become the subject of collegiate lectures around the world. Swiftie courses ranging from literature to social psychology have popped up at schools like Ghent University in Belgium, University of Texas at Austin, New York University and Stanford.\n\nLipshutz says Swift's roaring popularity has rooted in two areas: the sheer quality of her songwriting as well as the shrewdness of her decision-making. That latter includes opting a few years ago to rerecord six of her albums after a dispute with former manager Scooter Braun. \"The first three of those rerecorded albums have done so well that it almost doesn't matter what the other three do,\" he says.\n\nSwift's genius lies not just in her musical craft but also in her ability to generate a near-frenzied feeling among her fan base, says University of Kansas sociology professor Brian Donovan, who is teaching a class this fall called \"The Sociology of Taylor Swift\" and is writing a book about Swifties.\n\nIn his research, Donovan has interviewed fervent fans who feel compelled to collect physical evidence of their passion for Swift, including those who buy vinyl releases without owning a record player or purchase tour shirts they don't really care for. \"Swift knows how to tap into the collector mindset in her fandom,\" he says. \"And folks I spoke to do have that mindset: where they feel compelled to collect every item she produces. She is a musical genius, but a marketing genius as well.\"\n\nTaylor Swift has helped fans, and the nation, recover from lockdown\n\nSwift began her tour in March 2023 in Glendale, Arizona, snaking across the country through 20 cities across 27 states. The tour has broken records, including the most tickets sold in a day by an artist, 2.4 million. That's not to mention the ancillary sales generated from her barnstorming tour, such as sold-out hotels and packed restaurants.\n\nThe excitement is palpable among fans. Part of the Swift sensation is the sheer good vibes she has generated as she has bonded with fans at her shows. Perhaps nowhere was that more in evidence than one of her final shows in a six-performance run in Los Angeles, where her celebrity guests included Channing Tatum and Selena Gomez.\n\nDuring the first of six concerts at Inglewood's SoFi Stadium, Swift gifted her hat to Bianka Bryant, the daughter of basketball star Kobe Bryant, who was killed in a helicopter crash in January 2020. The heartwarming moment immediately made the rounds on social media as a video circulated of Swift hugging the 6-year-old and giving her a peck on the cheek.\n\nTo be sure, Swift is not alone in helping the country bounce back from a series of lockdowns that tested our collective spirits and put in doubt the return of mass gatherings.\n\nPerformers such as Beyoncé to Bruce Springsteen have done their share to bring back pre-pandemic-style lovefests. Their concert tours are nothing short of raging parties for tens of thousands of like-minded souls.\n\n\"Barbie\" also helped, filling movie theater seats but also creating a party atmosphere at screenings, with many arriving in Barbie-pink attire − just as Beyoncé has asked her fans to come to shows wearing silver.\n\nDon't underestimate the restorative power of such gatherings, experts say.\n\n\"For some people, this is a life-altering experience,\" says Elizabeth Cline, professor of fashion policy and consumerism and sustainability at Columbia University in New York. \"It's easy to be critical about it. But if you think more about cultural significance, I think it's quite beautiful.\"\n\nThose experiencing the magic of a Taylor Swift concert − whether live or now in a movie theater − are growing exponentially as Swift's career rounds out its second decade.\n\nDonovan notes that Swift's fan base expanded with the release of the 2020 albums \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore,\" adding more faithful to the flock that is sure to storm movie theaters next month.\n\n\"More Gen X-age men were attracted to (those albums), and I think it speaks to her kind of cross-generational appeal,\" Donovan says. \"The Swifties I've interviewed talked about how they grew up with Taylor and now they have children of their own that they're taking to the Eras tour. And those children are also showing enthusiasm for her in the ways that they did when they were a kid.\n\n\"That's kind of remarkable.\"\n\nContributing: Kayla Jimenez, Nicole Fallert and David Oliver", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/31"}]}

But how will ...", "text": "Demand for anti-obesity medications is expected to grow exponentially this year as a shortage eases and several new drugs come on the market.\n\nBut the drugs cost $1,000 a month or more per person – and they need to be taken indefinitely.\n\nWith more than 40% of Americans weighing enough to qualify for these medications – and the majority now ineligible for coverage – how much prevention can individuals and the country pay for?\n\n\"We appreciate that (the pharmaceutical) industry continues to look into\" anti-obesity medications, said Dr. Marcus Schabacker, president and CEO of ECRI, a nonprofit that works to improve health care. \"It just doesn't help if it is unaffordable to the majority of patients who need it.\"\n\nHealth care technology company Komodo Health calculates that more than 2 million prescriptions were written last year for Wegovy, the brand name for the drug semaglutide made by Novo Nordisk, and for tirpzepatide, by Eli Lilly, a diabetes drug that hasn't yet been approved for weight loss.\n\nThese medications are expected to become more widely available this year, and demand for prescriptions is projected to climb substantially.\n\nSemaglutide has been shown to help cut someone's excess weight by about 15% and tirzepatide by 20% – an unprecedented amount for medications. They are also expected to reduce health consequences and therefore medical costs.\n\n\"Obesity is this huge medical problem in the United States, and here are drugs that are actually working,\" said Dr. David Rind, chief medical officer for the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which estimates the value of different drugs.\n\n\"We've been waiting for drugs that do something like this for a really long time.\"\n\nLATEST NEWS:Weight loss treatment is on the verge of transformation\n\nOBESITY AND KIDS: Why new guidance is drawing scrutiny\n\nWhy this is an issue now\n\nCertainly, not everyone who weighs more than what is considered healthy will want these medications or would benefit from them. And weight loss from the medications, while impressive, will not make heavy people thin. But until recently, there were no drugs capable of helping people lose that kind of weight.\n\nShortages of Wegovy, driven by supply chain interruptions, have kept demand limited since it won approval in June 2021.\n\nNow, Novo Nordisk says, it has fixed those problems, and some doctors say their patients can access the medication. Wegovy's list price is $1,349.02 a month, or more than $16,000 a year, at the full anti-obesity dose. (The same drug, sold under the brand name Ozempic, sells for a lower cost at a lower dose to treat diabetes.)\n\nAlso this year, federal regulators will consider approving tirzepatide, which seems to help people lose even more weight. Since winning approval in May as a treatment for diabetes, Eli Lilly has sold tirzepatide for $1,000 a month under the brand name Mounjaro. Other similar medications are likely to be approved in coming years.\n\nThese new anti-obesity medications, like those that treat high blood pressure and cholesterol, must be taken indefinitely, so once people start taking them they will need to continue or risk the pounds creeping back.\n\nMeanwhile, the American Academy of Pediatrics recently changed its guidelines for children with obesity and recommended more aggressive treatments, including medications for children as young as 12. Guidelines released late last year from American Diabetes Association also recommend aggressively treating obesity, including using medications, in patients with diabetes.\n\nThe global market for anti-obesity medications is expected to grow by 25% over the next five years, driven largely by demand in North America, according to an analysis by Medi-Tech Insights, a business research firm.\n\nMore:How will the obesity epidemic end? With kids.\n\nThe cost of obesity\n\nTreating the health effects of obesity costs the U.S. health care system $170 billion a year, according to ECRI.\n\nAmericans trying to lose weight spend another $70 billion a year – largely without success and often \"for remedies that are unproven and maybe even counterproductive or dangerous,\" Schabacker said.\n\nWeight loss medications are overpriced based on the value they provide, but \"not dramatically\" so, Rind said.\n\nEven though older-generation drugs are less effective, ICER estimates that they provide more long-term value than their cost by reducing obesity-related illnesses.\n\nFor instance, Qsymia, a combination of the drugs phentermine and topiramate, sells for $1,465 a year, but ICER estimates its benefits could justify an annual cost of $3,600 to $4,800.\n\nSemaglutide, by contrast, typically costs consumers $13,618 a year but brings a value of $7,500 to $9,800, ICER found.\n\nMedications should eventually offset costs by preventing heart attacks, joint surgeries and other expensive therapies, Rind said.\n\nBut someone with a very high body mass index – a ratio of weight to height – is more likely to suffer health consequences than someone with a BMI closer to the cutoff threshold for obesity at 30. So cost savings will come mostly from a limited group, said Cornell University health economist John Cawley.\n\n\"It's in preventing extreme obesity where the cost savings lie,\" he said.\n\nWhy weight loss treatment hasn't been covered so far\n\nIt made some sense in the past for insurance companies not to cover anti-obesity medications, Rind said. That's because many drugs promoted weight loss of only about 5%, the lower limit of what will make a difference in someone's health.\n\nAnd a number of approved weight loss medications were taken off the market when they proved dangerous. In 2022, the Food and Drug Administration withdrew the weight loss drug lorcaserin, sold as Belviq, because of an increased risk of cancer among people who took the drug long-term. One of the drugs in the combination known as fen-phen (a combination of fenfluramine and phentermine) was famously withdrawn in 1997 for damaging patients' heart valves.\n\n\"If every decade or two obesity treatments turn out to be killing people, it make sense why somebody said they wouldn't cover them,\" Rind said.\n\nBut now that there are effective medications, the lack of coverage doesn't make medical sense.\n\n\"Nobody would ask anybody who has hypertension to exercise and not give them a beta blocker or another approved drug,\" Schabacker said. “If those Americans who quality for treatment would be covered under insurance plans or Medicare/Medicaid, it would contribute to lowering the health care costs for secondary diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and muscular-skeletal diseases.”\n\nBias also drives the lack of coverage, he and the others said.\n\n\"Obesity is perceived as a choice, a consequence of people's actions and therefore less worthy of coverage than even other conditions linked to diet, like Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure,\" Cawley said.\n\nNational surveys indicate that the vast majority of people who have obesity try to lose weight. \"It's not a lack of effort,\" he said.\n\nDecades of research now shows that human biology fights to regain lost pounds, slowing metabolism, for instance, when someone loses weight. Yet the perception still lingers that patients should be able to help themselves.\n\n\"We have ever better evidence that losing weight with diet and exercise does not work for 95% of people; pretending that it does makes no sense,\" he said.\n\nRethinking Obesity:\n\nIf spotty health insurance coverage for anti-obesity medications is allowed to continue, it will probably worsen economic and ethnic disparities, especially among children, Cawley said.\n\n\"Teens and young adults whose parents have health insurance will get coverage. Others won't,\" he said.\n\nObesity is more common among low-income women, though not low-income men, he said.\n\nPeople with low incomes and fewer food options rely more heavily on inexpensive, highly processed foods, which tend to promote obesity, Schabacker said.\n\n\"This aggravates the obesity issue and makes it even worse by not providing appropriate treatment for it, despite the fact that it's available,\" he said.\n\nWho will pay for the medications?\n\nRight now, the burden of paying for weight loss treatments typically falls to the patient. The majority of health plans don't cover the cost of weight loss medications, and neither do government programs like Medicare.\n\nNovo Nordisk, in a recent presentation to investors, said 40 million American adults have at least some insurance coverage for Wegovy. (Roughly 108 million U.S. adults meet the definition for having obesity.)\n\n\"Coverage policies can be very confusing and thus lead people to give up on getting these medicines from their drug plans – even when they might be covered,\" said Ted Kyle, founder of ConscienHealth and former chair of the Obesity Action Coalition, a 75,000-member nonprofit that works to empower people living with obesity.\n\nThe lack of coverage at least partially explains why only about 2% of Americans with obesity have historically been treated with either weight loss medications or surgery.\n\nOnce multiple weight loss drugs come on the market, there will be some competition and prices could moderate somewhat, said Rind, also an internist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. But if one drug seems to be better and becomes the one everyone wants, \"that one will keep costing a lot.\"\n\nThe arrival of these new expensive medications might also be a boon to less expensive, less effective drugs already on the market, he said. \"We may also see some attempt to have patients use the most affordable drugs first.\"\n\nRind's organization, ICER, has recommended that Medicare begin paying for anti-obesity medications.\n\nCommercial insurers should cover the medications, too, he said. But while it seems as if they'd save money if people lose weight, these cost offsets will happen many years in the future, by which point the patient may have switched coverage plans.\n\nPatent protections will keep low-cost generics off the market for at least two decades.\n\nMaybe, Rind said, insurers and drug companies will reach a deal he described as a \"Netflix plan,\" under which insurers will set a dollar amount and manufacturers will provide as much as they're willing for that sum.\n\nAs with preventive care, Cawley said, the government could also require that all health insurers cover cost-effective weight loss treatments, which would reduce disparities.\n\nHe also said insurers often use incentives to get policyholders to avoid wasteful spending. Cheaper weight loss medications could be made available without a co-pay, but the newer ones could cost patients more out-of-pocket.\n\nThis would \"at least make consumers think twice before going for the more expensive option.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

One survey found 2 in 5 Americans struggled to pay a medical bill or medical debt.\n\nAs consumers choose a 2023 health insurance plan from employers in coming weeks, many will find rate hikes are modest when compared to everyday living expenses. It’s the first time in over three decades that overall inflation accelerated at a faster rate than medical costs.\n\nIt might not last long. Just like gas, groceries and used cars, the cost of medical care is rising in the third year of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"There's a lag effect,\" said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director for the program on the Affordable Care Act for Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit focused on health issues. \"The cost of gasoline can change from one day to the next. That's not really how health care prices work.\"\n\nHealth benefits consultant Mercer's survey of more than 1,700 large employers conducted this spring found these companies expected average health benefits costs to increase a modest 4.4% this year, about half the rate of inflation, which reached a 40-year high this summer.\n\nBut because prices are rising for medical supplies and prescription drugs and health care workers are commanding higher salaries in a tight labor market, employers are preparing for health care costs to spike. A Mercer survey released Thursday shows 43% of large employers think the cost of health care next year will exceed the amount companies budgeted.\n\n“We see inflation running fairly hot right across most every sector of the economy,” said Beth Umland, Mercer’s director of research for health and benefits. “It'd be surprising if health care was the lone holdout, which it’s never been.”\n\nWHAT IS INFLATION? Why prices rise, what causes it and who it hurts most\n\nSome analysts believe the full force of inflation gripping the economy won't squeeze health care consumers until 2023 or later. Insurers negotiate reimbursement rates with hospitals and doctors and pass those expenses to employers and consumers. With inflation this summer reaching the highest level since the early 1980s, employers and consumers can expect more expensive bills for medical care and insurance premiums.\n\nHealth insurance costs will jump 7.4% next year as employers and consumers absorb bills from doctors, hospitals and drug companies, according to Segal, a benefits and human resources consultant.\n\n“We'll start to see the impact of inflation on health care costs in the next one to two years,” said Eileen Flick, senior vice president, director of health technical services at Segal.\n\nMercer projects that large companies will be cautious in passing along higher premiums, deductibles or copayments to employees and their families. More than 7 in 10 large employers won't make workers pay more for coverage, while about 2 in 10 expect to charge workers more for monthly health premiums, Mercer said.\n\nUmland said the message from most large employers this spring was \"loud and clear\" that they planned to enhance health benefits rather than trim offerings or charge employees more. Even though health care costs are rising more quickly than they anticipated just a few months ago, most employers believe affordable health benefits are an important tool to recruit and keep workers in a tight labor market.\n\nLarge companies are \"reluctant to pass any of these excess costs on to employees, at least in 2023,\" Umland said. \"No guarantee what 2024 will hold.\"\n\nCONSUMPER PRICE INDEX:Inflation eased to 8.2% but remained high in September\n\nHospital profits slump amid higher labor costs\n\nHospitals are grappling with higher costs from drug expenses, supplies and workers. A Kaufman Hall report analyzing data from more than 900 hospitals found these facilities are in “poor shape” with an average financial loss of less than 1% through August this year.\n\nThe financial crunch is partly due to labor expenses that are up 10.6% this year. Hospitals have struggled to maintain enough workers during the pandemic and have relied on agencies that provide temporary, contract health care workers such as nurses. Surveys predict many nurses plan to leave bedside care.\n\nElsevier Health, which provides health research and analytics, reported nearly half of U.S. nurses and physicians planned to leave their position within two to three years.\n\nPAY, STAFFING AND FATIGUE:Nurses strike highlights worsening shortages\n\nHospitals and nursing facilities have paid lucrative fees to staffing agencies to hire contract nurses and will attempt to pass on those extra expenses to health insurers and employers who provide coverage for about half of all Americans.\n\nBut employers are also dealing with their own financial pressures and are seeking ways to slow runaway health costs, said Elizabeth Mitchell, CEO of Purchaser Business Group on Health.\n\nCompanies that insure about half of all Americans are taking a harder look at how much hospitals and other health facilities are charging.\n\n“We understand hospitals have increased labor costs,” Mitchell said. “So do employers and families.”\n\n2 in 5 Americans struggle to pay medical bills\n\nWhile people who are insured through their employer might escape double-digit rate hikes for another year, consumers who directly purchase their own health coverage might not be so lucky.\n\nA Peterson-Kaiser Family Foundation Health System Tracker analysis of preliminary rate filings in 13 states and the District of Columbia found next year's median proposed rate hike for plans was about 10%. The report analyzed rate filings from 72 health insurers seeking to sell plans on Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n\nHealth insurers must justify those proposed price increases based on how much they expect to spend on health care billings. These reports include rising prices paid to hospitals, doctors and drug companies, as well as how often insurers expect people will visit doctors or hospitals or fill prescriptions. These reports are reviewed by state health insurance regulators who decide whether to grant proposed rate increases.\n\nOne health plan, Capital District Physicians Health Plan in New York, warned that consumers would soon need to absorb inflationary costs from doctors and hospitals. In its filing, the insurer said a \"correction is imminent.\"\n\nHealth insurance is no guarantee people are shielded from expensive bills. More Americans have health insurance coverage than ever before: The Affordable Care Act extended health insurance coverage to millions of Americans, and even pandemic plans expanded Medicaid coverage to millions of Americans.\n\nBut even with coverage, 2 in 5 Americans struggled to pay a medical bill or past medical debt, according to a survey by the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nSara Collins, a senior scholar at vice president at Commonwealth Fund, said the survey shows even insured Americans are struggling with the cost of health care. Insurance plans require people to pay deductibles, co-pays and coinsurance, and those out-of-pocket costs are unaffordable for many.\n\n“These costs are not only leaving people with medical bill problems and medical debt,” Collins said. “They're not enabling people to get the health care that they need.”\n\nKen Alltucker is on Twitter at @kalltucker, or can be emailed at alltuck@usatoday.com\n\nBEYOND INFLATION:These other economic factors could affect you\n\nCOVID NEWS:FDA authorizes bivalent boosters for children ages 5 to 11", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/29/health/diabetes-young-people/index.html", "title": "Diabetes rates may surge in US young people, study finds | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe number of people under age 20 with type 2 diabetes in the US may increase nearly 675% by 2060 if trends continue, researchers say, with an increase of up to 65% in young people with type 1 diabetes.\n\nType 1 diabetes – in which the pancreas makes little or no insulin – is more common in young people in the US, but type 2 – in which the body doesn’t use insulin the way it should – has “substantially increased” in this age group over the past two decades, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe new study, published this month in the American Diabetes Association journal Diabetes Care, used data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study, which is funded by the CDC and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe researchers found that if incidence rates from 2017 were to remain unchanged over the next decades, the number of young people with either type of diabetes would rise 12% from 213,000 to 239,000.

Social Security recipients may ...", "text": "Slowing inflation is cheered by most people, but for Social Security recipients, it’s a double-edged sword.\n\nAnnual inflation cooled in May to 4%, the smallest rise since March 2021 and well off the peak of 9.1% in June last year. Energy prices fell 11.7% over that time frame, helping to keep prices in check. Even though food inflation has slowed, it was still up 6.7% over the last 12 months. Shelter, which includes rents, rose 8%, continuing to put upward pressure on headline inflation.\n\nWhile investors welcomed the easing inflation and pushed up stocks after the data landed, Social Security beneficiaries may have groaned a little. Cooling inflation rate means a significantly lower cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of 2.7% for next year, according to a forecast from The Senior Citizens League, a nonprofit seniors group. That’s less than one-third of the four-decade high of 8.7% COLA in 2023 and below last month's estimate for a 3.1% increase for 2024.\n\nIsn’t it OK if COLA is lower as long as inflation falls, too?\n\nNo. An ongoing survey by The Senior Citizens League with 2,275 respondents through June 6 showed older consumers are reporting little improvement in their household spending.\n\nProtect your assets: Best high-yield savings accounts of 2023\n\nWhat to expect:2023 Social Security COLA increase\n\n“While the rate of inflation has slowed, prices have remained high in certain essential categories of spending,” said Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst at The Senior Citizens League.\n\nSeniors spend their money differently. Retirees spend most of it on housing, food, transportation, utilities and healthcare – all of which are still increasing at a quick pace. In the May inflation report, shelter costs climbed 8% over the last 12 months, food gained 6.7%, transportation services jumped 10.2%, electricity rose 5.9% and “medical care commodities”, which include prescription and nonprescription drugs and equipment and supplies, added 4.4%.\n\nIn the League’s survey, 62% of respondents said food costs were still their fastest-growing cost, while housing costs were most worrisome among 22%.\n\nSeniors are also still reeling from 2021 and 2022 inflation\n\nAnnual COLAs are meant to ensure Social Security beneficiaries’ purchasing power isn't eroded by inflation. However, COLA hasn’t kept pace, and seniors were the only group that saw its share of poverty increase between 2020 and 2021, the Census Bureau said.\n\nEven though inflation this year has been running below the 8.7% beneficiaries received, they haven't been able to recoup the losses they incurred in 2021 and 2022, when inflation reached a 40-year high, Johnson said.\n\n“Inflation was so severe in 2021 and 2022 that the average Social Security benefit fell behind by $1,054, leaving 53% of retirees doubting they will recover because household costs rose more than the dollar amount of their COLAs,” she said.\n\nHow is COLA calculated?\n\nSocial Security Administration (SSA) bases its COLA each year on average annual increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, or CPI-W, from July through September. The CPI-W largely reflects the broad CPI that the Labor Department releases each month but differs slightly. Last month, while the CPI rose 4.0%, the CPI-W increased 3.6%.\n\nThe Seniors Citizens League uses the most recent inflation data to keep a running projection of what COLA might be next year.\n\nHow many Americans qualify for the COLA increase?\n\nAbout 70 million Americans receive benefits from programs administered by SSA, with retired workers and their dependents accounting for 76.9% of benefits paid in 2022.\n\nNearly 9 out of 10 people aged 65 and older received a Social Security benefit as of Dec. 31. Among them, 12% of men and 15% of women rely on Social Security for 90% or more of their income.\n\nIn April, the average monthly check for Social Security beneficiaries was $1,698.05, according to SSA. A 2.7% COLA would mean about an extra $45.85 each month.\n\nBest place to retire:Sorry, Florida and Nevada.

Community College\n\nWhat’s happening: The White House and administration leaders, including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, say increasing competition is a priority. Gottlieb — whom Trump has called a star — said the FDA has approved a record number of generic drugs and eliminated a backlog in approvals.\n\nThe agency is looking for ways to boost price competition for biologics, which are made from natural sources and are among the most expensive drugs on the market. Currently, pharmacists cannot substitute a lower-cost “biosimilar” version when the doctor prescribes a biologic. FDA has proposed “interchangeability” rules that could change the status quo.\n\nThe outlook: Driving down drug prices through competition may take awhile. That’s because even after gaining FDA approval, generic drugs often have trouble being launched, according to Chip Davis, president of the Association for Accessible Medicines, a trade group for makers of generics and biosimilars. Only three of nine biosimilars approved are available for patients, largely because of patent protections.\n\nPoint 2: Untangling the web of special interests\n\nWhat Trump said: “We have to get the prices of prescription drugs way down and unravel the tangled web of special interests that are driving prices up for medicine and for really hurting patients.” — Jan. 29, 2018, during Azar’s swearing-in ceremony\n\nWhat’s happening: To say health care is complicated is an understatement. The system that dictates how patients get prescriptions and what they pay includes an array of buyers and payers, such as insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers. In February, the White House pitched the idea of passing on the discounts and rebates negotiated by PBMs, the financial middlemen between insurers and drugmakers, to seniors who buy drugs through Medicare Part D. This idea, first floated under President Obama’s administration, would mean seniors would pay less out-of-pocket but could also increase premiums if insurers took on added costs.\n\nMore:Trump budget slashes Medicare, other health programs while boosting money for opioid crisis\n\nMore:State of the Union fact check: Feds did approve more new and generic drugs, devices in 2017\n\nMore:Federal drug discount program grows too big and courts political fight\n\nThe outlook: Late last year, the administration released a request for public comment on this idea, and pressure is building for the administration to take action. “It’s the one thing you could say that has immediate benefit to consumers,” said John Rother, president of the National Coalition on Health Care. But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she isn’t convinced much will really change: “At this point, no one is surprised that President Trump has found another reason not to act on prescription drug costs,” Pelosi said in a statement to KHN. “While President Trump is making more excuses, Democrats will be discussing real solutions.”\n\nPoint 3: Tackling really expensive drugs\n\nWhat Trump said: “I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities for the year. And prices will come down substantially. Watch.” — Jan. 20, 2018, State of the Union address\n\nWhat’s happening: The White House has pitched moving drugs covered under Medicare Part B into the popular Part D program. Part B is the bucket of Medicare that covers drugs that are administered in hospital outpatient settings and doctor’s offices, including expensive chemotherapy and rheumatoid arthritis infusions. Insurers compete for business in Part D and negotiate prices for their members, but there is no such price negotiation in Part B. Total drug spending in the Part B program was about $26 billion in 2015, and the upward trend is ominous.\n\nThe outlook: While providers and insurers are likely to fight it, there’s no reason the idea wouldn’t work, said Tom Scully, the former Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator who designed the Medicare prescription drug programs in the early 2000s. He worked closely with HHS’ current leader, Azar, who was then general counsel for HHS. “There’s no reason to have Part B,” said Scully, adding that moving the drugs under Part D would require price negotiation. “If you really want to drive down drug prices, you have to put somebody’s money at risk other than the taxpayers’.”\n\nPoint 4: Taming government spending\n\nWhat Trump said: “For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get the prices way down, so that’s what we’re going to be talking about.” — Jan. 31, 2017, while holding a listening session with pharmaceutical industry leaders\n\nWhat’s happening: When the White House announced Trump’s forthcoming speech, it also noted that it would coincide with a formal request for information from Health and Human Services on various drug-pricing ideas. The request leaves the door wide open for proposed changes in Medicare and Medicaid. Several experts predict the administration will test payment models through demonstrations under the broad authority of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation, or CMMI.\n\nThe outlook: Ideas such as moving drugs to Part D as well as allowing certain states to create drug lists under their Medicaid formularies, as Massachusetts has requested, and other value-based pricing models would be possible under a CMMI demonstration, said Andrea Harris, who leads the health care team at Height Capital Markets. Still, this process could take awhile, and Harris said, “I don’t think anything will meaningfully impact drug-related stocks between now and the midterms (elections).”\n\nPoint 5: Reining in the pharmaceutical industry\n\nWhat Trump said: “Prescription drug prices are out of control. The drug prices have gone through the roof. … The drug companies, frankly, are getting away with murder.” — at Oct. 16, 2017, Cabinet meeting\n\nWhat’s happening: While there has been no direct proposal that would force the pharmaceutical industry to lower the launch price of its drugs, the industry lost a battle last month when Congress reduced how much seniors would pay for prescription drugs in Medicare. It was a rare loss and signaled that the powerful industry may be in a defensive position. And Trump has another card to play with the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nThe outlook: Trump has nominated Joe Simons, a Washington antitrust lawyer, to lead the FTC. During his nomination hearings in February, he said he’s “very concerned” with price increases for prescription drugs. The agency, which polices anti-competitive behavior, has several vacancies to fill.\n\nKaiser Health News, a non-profit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/01/30/drug-price-increases-2023/11084913002/", "title": "Humira, Eliquis among nearly 1,000 drugs with higher prices in 2023", "text": "With pharmaceutical companies hiking prices on nearly 1,000 drugs in January, some consumers might experience sticker shock next time they pick up prescriptions.\n\nThe price increases come as a new federal law requires companies to pay Medicare a rebate if they increase prices above the rate of inflation. Other Inflation Reduction Act provisions — such as capping Medicare recipients' out-of-pocket expenses at $2,000 and allowing Medicare to negotiate the costliest drugs — haven't kicked in yet.\n\nMajor drug companies such as AbbVie, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb have raised prices so far this month, according to data provided by 46brooklyn Research, a nonprofit that researches drug pricing. The amount consumers pay depends on their insurance coverage and complex rebates often hidden from public view.\n\nDrug affordability remains a top worry for consumers. About 3 in 10 people don't take a drug as prescribed over concerns about cost – some don't fill prescriptions, others skipped doses or sought cheaper over-the-counter medication, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last year.\n\nAnalysts say it's too early to tell whether this month's batch of price hikes were influenced by the federal law. But experts say drugmakers likely will launch new drugs with more expensive prices and seek to maximize sales before Medicare can bargain for more affordable prices.\n\n“Raising prices each year will become more difficult,” said Dr. Benjamin Rome, a Harvard Medical School professor of medicine. “You're going to see changes in pricing behavior over the lifecycle of medicines based on the Inflation Reduction Act.”\n\nHow much are companies hiking prices?\n\nDrug companies often roll out price increases in January for existing drugs, but the amount of the price hikes vary from year to year.\n\nThe data from 46brooklyn tracks list prices for drugs but does not include rebates and discounts to insurance companies or pharmacy benefit managers. Such rebates are becoming more expensive each year and don’t always result in cheaper prices for consumers. .\n\nThrough the first three weeks of January, drugmakers raised prices on 985 products.\n\nIt's the most January hikes sought by manufacturers since at least 2011, according to 46brooklyn, which found:\n\nThe median price increase so far this year is 5%.\n\nThis increase is slightly higher than last year’s 4.9% but lower than when rates spiked 9% in 2015 and 2016.\n\nPrices on more than two dozen drugs swelled 10% or more, but the vast majority had smaller increases, and prices on more than two dozen drugs increased 1% or less.\n\nGE Healthcare imposed the largest price increase, 26% for Omnipaque, a drug people take before undergoing imaging tests such as CT scans.\n\nHow does the Inflation Reduction Act influence prices?\n\nDrugmakers that increase prices above inflation levels must pay rebates to Medicare. This law applies this year to prices on retail and physician-administered drugs.\n\nWhile inflation is retreating from the four decade highs reached last summer, it’s still far above the miniscule rates before the COVID-19 pandemic. So some drug companies might see an opportunity to raise the price of retail drugs to the rate of inflation.\n\n\"Inflation has been running higher than recent historical trends,\" said Ryan Urgo, managing director of health policy at Avalere, a health care consulting company. \"This may certainly create opportunities for manufacturers to raise list prices higher in percentage terms than in the past, given that this could be done without triggering a rebate penalty.\"\n\nHealth care costs are about to skyrocket. Analysts explain inflation's drastic impact.\n\nExpect higher launch prices for new drugs\n\nMedicare will seek to rein the costs of the most expensive drugs by directly negotiating with manufacturers. By Sept. 1, the federal health program will select the first 10 drugs to negotiate maximum prices that will take effect in 2026.\n\nThe federal health program will negotiate more retail \"Part D\" drugs and physician-administered \"Part B\" drugs, but drugmakers will get several years of pricing autonomy before drugs are subject to negotiation. Part D drugs are eligible only after they have been on the market for nine years. Physician-administered drugs will have 13 years before being subject to negotiation.\n\nThe federal law does not limit the amount manufacturers charge once they begin selling new drugs after gaining Food and Drug Administration approval.\n\nOne study found the typical launch prices for new drugs increased 20% each year over the past decade and a half, contributing to total U.S. spending on prescription drugs of over $500 billion in 2020.\n\nNearly half of new drugs cost $150 000 per year in 2020 and 2021. Fewer than 10% of new drugs launched at that price in 2008, according to a study last year co-authored by Harvard's Rome.\n\nBecause Medicare will limit annual price increases to the rate of inflation, Rome said some manufacturers might \"start at a higher price to give themselves a breathing room.\"\n\nControversial Alzheimer's drug, explained:What to know about Aduhelm\n\nPrices increase on blockbuster drugs Humira, Eliquis and Stelara\n\nDrugmakers with widely-prescribed medicines that have been on the market for years are raising prices despite looming competition.\n\nManufacturer AbbVie will raise the price of its blockbuster anti-inflammatory drug Humira by 8%. The world's top-selling drug generated more than $20 billion in sales last year, but generic biosimilar competitors are set to launch later this year.\n\nOther top-selling drugs that will see price increases:\n\nEliquis, a blood thinner from Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, will rise 6%.\n\nImbruvica, a cancer drug, is up 6.2%.\n\nStelara, used to treat plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease, is up 4%.\n\nSome of the steepest prices hikes are reserved for hospital drugs, not medicines consumers pick up at pharmacies.\n\nPfizer will raise prices by 10% on more than a dozen sterile injectable drugs used in hospitals. Many of the drugs are inexpensive with the price increases amounting to $1 or less. The drug giant said it is spending $2 billion to upgrade manufacturing to ensure high-quality, reliable supply.\n\n“Sterile injectables are vital to patient care and often lifesaving, Although low priced, they are among the most difficult and costly medicines to produce. It is critical to have a sustainable pricing structure to fund the ongoing advancements in technology required to manufacture these important products,” Pfizer said in a statement.\n\n'Profiting at the expense of patients': Insurers, middlemen take concessions\n\nAnalysts say drug companies also must factor in the growing power of middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers. These organizations influence whether a drug gets on an insurance plan's formulary. In exchange, these middlemen demand concessions from drug companies in the form of rebates or drug discounts.\n\n\"We love to think that drugmakers sit there and say, 'Hey I can just charge a million bucks get away with it,' – and sometimes they can,\" said Antonio Ciaccia, CEO of 46brooklyn.\n\nBut Ciaccia said some drug companies hike prices so they can pay rebates to pharmacy benefit managers. They also charge higher prices to offset discounted drug programs such as Medicaid, the government program for low-income families.\n\n\"A lot of things go in the sauce when they're trying to create the price,\" Ciaccia said.\n\nOfficials with the drug industry organization, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said too often insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers don't pass rebates and discounts to consumers\n\n\"More than half of what’s spent on medicines goes to entities that don’t make the medicines, said Priscilla VanderVeer, a PhRMA spokeswoman. \"These entities, including insurance companies and middlemen like PBMs, are profiting at the expense of patients. Unless we fix what’s broken, patients will be the ones losing out.”\n\nDig deeper\n\nKen Alltucker is on Twitter at @kalltucker, or can be emailed at alltuck@usatoday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/05/30/biologic-drugs-arthritis-psoriasis-deaths/1284484001/", "title": "Arthritis, psoriasis medication: 34K deaths linked to biologic drugs", "text": "With her kidneys and liver failing and a 106-degree temperature that had smoldered for days, Helen Tschannen was being kept alive on a ventilator.\n\nDoctors were not certain what was happening, but the family knew this: Tschannen, 77, did not want to be kept alive by machines. After 21 days in an Illinois hospital, they gathered at her bedside and wrestled with whether they were doing the right thing.\n\nA nurse unhooked the equipment. Tschannen took one breath on her own and died.\n\nIt was Oct. 19, 2004.\n\nIn the weeks after Tschannen’s death, her family learned she had been suffering from a common fungal infection known as histoplasmosis. For most people, it produces no symptoms or only mild ones.\n\nBut Tschannen, it turns out, was at special risk of a bad infection, not because of her age or because she lived in a region where the fungus lurks, but because of a drug she had started taking a few months earlier to tame her rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe drug, Remicade, had been approved for her condition in 1999. It was at the forefront of a class of drugs known as biological medicines, or biologics, that treat autoimmune diseases of the skin, joints and gastrointestinal system. Unlike drugs made chemically, biologics are cultured in the laboratory from animal cells and are given by injection or IV.\n\nIn the past 20 years, the drugs — which can cost some $40,000 a year — have flooded the market. Ads for several, including Humira and Cosentyx, are fixtures on television, promising improved gastrointestinal symptoms or clearer skin with “sexy elbows.”\n\nPreliminary numbers for 2018 show that group of biologics was on pace to top 6 million prescriptions last year, a nearly 50% increase from 2013, according to data from IQVIA, a pharmaceutical market research firm.\n\nRELATED:What you should know about the safety and side effects of biologic drugs for psoriasis and arthritis\n\nThe drugs are effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders. They often lead to significant improvement in symptoms, even remission.\n\nBut there is a darker aspect to the drugs that is less known to the public: They leave patients more susceptible to a growing number of infections and other serious side effects.\n\nMore:Arthritis is prevalent in the military. This Army veteran wants to help\n\nMore:Biologic medications for arthritis and psoriasis have flooded the market — and been linked to 34,000 deaths\n\nMore:FDA warning letters to doctors flag serious problems, but state medical boards do nothing\n\nTschannen's case is one of at least 34,000 reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of people who died while using biologic drugs since 2004, according to an extensive analysis by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel of data from the agency.\n\nMore than 1 million “adverse events” were reported in people using the drugs during that time, including nearly 500,000 that were deemed serious, the investigation found.\n\nThe FDA defines an adverse event as any undesirable experience associated with a medical product. To be considered serious, the situation must involve death, disability, hospitalization, permanent damage or a life-threatening issue. The FDA’s database, though, does not verify any cause-and-effect relationship between the drug and what happened.\n\nWhile the drugs make up only a small slice of the $450 billion-plus prescription drug industry — they were on pace for about $45 billion last year — they have an outsized effect.\n\nAmong all prescription drugs over the last 15 years, the biologics Humira and Enbrel are the most-cited in the FDA’s database, the Journal Sentinel review found.\n\nHumira was linked to 169,000 reported serious adverse events and 13,000 reports of deaths, followed by Enbrel with 135,000 serious events and 8,000 deaths. Yet neither is among the top 20 prescribed medications in America, according to IQVIA data.\n\n“Those numbers are important,” said Steven Woloshin, a professor of medicine at Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine. “It certainly is a signal that can’t be ignored.”\n\nRemicade, the drug Tschannen was taking, had 98,000 reports of serious adverse events, including 6,000 reports of deaths, the analysis found.\n\nTschannen’s daughter, Bev Webber of Mukwonago, Wisconsin, said she remains troubled that a drug people take to help them live better also can make them susceptible to a deadly infection.\n\n“I still have the unanswered question of how many deaths related to a drug does it take before it is taken off the market?” said Webber, a retired nurse. “I realize there isn’t a clear answer.”\n\nPeople using biologics run the risk of having a more severe infection because their immune systems are weaker, said Chadi Hage, an associate professor of clinical medicine at Indiana University who has done research on histoplasmosis in people who use biologics.\n\nPatients should be fully informed about the risks, he said.\n\n“They take these drugs so they can live a life, but at the same time, the more they are educated about what is risky and what is not, the better the story will be.”\n\nA crowded market\n\nThere are 21 biologic drugs on the market, up from seven in 2004; two others were launched, but taken off the market. Many of the drugs are approved to treat multiple conditions.\n\nBefore going on the drugs, people are supposed to be screened for infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, all of which can lead to devastating effects if they flare up.\n\nBut a study published in January found that only 26% of patients were fully screened by their doctors for those infections.\n\n“More robust safety protocols are urgently needed to prevent serious patient safety events in this high-risk population,” the study, published in the Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety, concluded.\n\nThe screening involves relatively inexpensive skin and blood tests that can have results in a matter of days, said study co-author Jinoos Yazdany, an associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nSafety could be improved with drug company or medical society funding of registries of patients who use biologics to monitor side effects, she said. Other measures could involve better tracking of safety procedures used by doctors and enhanced safety education for patients and health care providers.\n\n“There has been very little investment in patient safety,” Yazdany said.\n\nIndeed, part of the problem may be the FDA’s own drug-approval system.\n\nThat system allows drug trials that may last a year or even less, when real-world patients may be on the drugs for much longer periods. What’s more, the drugmakers designing the trials are allowed to exclude less healthy people as test subjects.\n\nIn short, that means people can come down with serious or even deadly side effects that might not have been foreseen at the time a drug is approved to be sold.\n\nThough the conditions the drugs treat may not be life-threatening, many patients are willing to accept the serious risks of the drugs because their disease may be debilitating, said Alison Huffstetler, an assistant professor of family medicine at Georgetown University Hospital School of Medicine.\n\n“For most of my patients, they are willing to take a risk that will enhance their quality of life,” she said. “It certainly is a balancing act.”\n\nA 2018 paper in the journal JAMA Dermatology found that real-world psoriasis patients were two to three times more likely to get a serious adverse event than those who were allowed in the trials. The drugs also didn’t work as well in them.\n\nConsider the drug Cosentyx, which the FDA approved in 2015 to treat psoriasis, a condition that causes red, scaly patches on the skin. It is not life-threatening in the vast majority of cases.\n\nThe clinical trial excluded people for 12 health reasons, including women who were pregnant or nursing and people with uncontrolled high blood pressure; congestive heart failure; a history of cancer; or with any underlying liver, kidney, blood, heart, brain or gastrointestinal condition that might significantly compromise the immune system.\n\nSince 2015, there have been nearly 13,000 reports of serious adverse events with Cosentyx, including 581 deaths.\n\nA spokesman for Novartis, manufacturer of the drug, noted there have been more than 200 studies of the drug — one of the largest such study programs.\n\nMore than 200,000 patients worldwide have been prescribed Cosentyx and its safety is supported by five years of data, including in real-world patients, said Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff.\n\nWarning after warning\n\nSince 2000, the FDA has issued more than 25 warnings and safety communications regarding biologic drugs or required the drugs’ labels be updated to list information about serious new risks — all after the drugs were approved for use in patients.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel review found warnings for various fungal and bacterial infections, as well as a rare viral brain infection. Other warnings included tuberculosis, a flesh-eating bacteria, various neurological conditions, liver failure and heart failure, as well as lymphoma and other cancers.\n\nIn 2001, the FDA issued a \"black box\" warning, its most stringent, alerting doctors to the potential of histoplasmosis infections in patients on biologic drugs.\n\nBut it was not until 2008 — four years after Tschannen’s death — that the FDA issued a new such warning for Remicade and three related drugs, Humira, Enbrel and Cimzia. The warning noted fungal infections “are not consistently recognized in patients” taking those drugs.\n\nBy then, there had been 45 deaths among 240 reports of serious infections, with more than 207 involving Remicade.\n\nAccording to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, histoplasmosis infections leading to hospitalization increased by 15% a year between 2001 and 2012 with a reported mortality rate of 20%.\n\nBiologics are “likely to be one of the factors behind the increase in hospitalizations,” said CDC spokeswoman Brittany Behm.\n\nFDA spokesman Nathan Arnold said there is intense scrutiny of drugs by his agency before they are approved, but acknowledged “much work still remains to monitor approved drugs over time.”\n\n“No drug is risk-free, and it is not uncommon for new information to be discovered after a drug is on the market and being used by larger numbers of patients,” he said. “Simply put, for a drug to be on the market, the FDA must determine that the drug is effective and that its expected benefits outweigh its potential risks to patients.”\n\nThe FDA says its adverse events reporting system can’t be used to determine the safety of a drug or its side-effect rate, and notes other drugs also may have been used. The database, though, is increasingly used by researchers and the agency itself to detect potential problems.\n\nDrug companies are required to report to the FDA any issues that come to their attention. For others, such as doctors and patients, reporting is voluntary. None of the reports are considered verified. Nevertheless, there is widespread agreement the system undercounts what is actually happening among patients.\n\nThe most recent numbers, based on a 2005 Government Accountability Office report, estimate the system captures 10% or less of all adverse events.\n\nLinda Davis, a spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Remicade, said the FDA’s database is not a reliable measure of a drug’s risks and just because a report is made, it does not necessarily mean the drug caused the adverse event. Remicade’s safety has been established in nearly 3 million patients around the world, she said in a statement.\n\n“We are proud of the impact Remicade has made on transforming the lives of patients.”\n\nMeanwhile, the makers of Enbrel and Humira issued similar statements.\n\n“While changes to a product’s safety information may occur over time as more real-world and clinical data are collected, analyzed and incorporated, Enbrel’s benefits outweigh its risks,” said Trish Hawkins, a spokeswoman for Amgen, the maker of Enbrel.\n\nJillian Griffin, a spokeswoman for Abbvie, said Humira is one of the most comprehensively tested biologics and “has a well-established safety profile and is a trusted treatment that is supported by more than 16 years of physician and patient experience.”\n\nA new risk: suicide\n\nIn at least one case, the FDA approved a biologic drug — Siliq — against the recommendation of an agency expert who raised a new concern: The increased risk of suicide.\n\nSix suicides were reported among the 6,200 people who participated in studies, all within three years of receiving their first dose, including four who had no history of depression, according to an FDA internal analysis. In all, 34 people in the studies reported experiencing suicidal thoughts or behavior.\n\nThe analysis found the suicide rate was three to four times higher than for other biologics used to treat psoriasis.\n\n“This number of suicides in a psoriasis (drug) development program is unprecedented,” an FDA physician said in a 2016 internal review, obtained by the Journal Sentinel.\n\nNevertheless, the FDA approved the drug in 2017. At the time, there already were 10 other drugs approved to treat psoriasis.\n\nThe agency required the drug to carry a “black box” warning label for suicidal behavior, as well as other warnings for serious infections, tuberculosis and the development of Crohn’s disease.\n\nBill Humphries, president of Ortho Dermatologics, which markets Siliq, noted that, at $42,000 a year, Siliq is the lowest priced biologic for psoriasis on the market.\n\nHe stressed no “causal association” has been established between the drug and suicidal thinking and said that since Siliq was introduced in the U.S. in July 2017 there have been no reports of suicides or attempted suicides.\n\nData from the FDA’s adverse events reporting system indicate 108 serious adverse events, including two deaths, were reported for Siliq last year.\n\nA deadly tradeoff\n\nFor some patients, biologic drugs can reduce the need for steroids and other drugs that also have bad side effects.\n\nLife expectancy, which can be several years shorter for people with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, has been increasing in recent decades. While the biologic drugs may play a role, that has not been proven and there are other factors as well, such as other medical advances.\n\nIn any case, research underlines the sometimes deadly tradeoff.\n\nA 2013 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs review of research papers focused on biologic drugs used to treat psoriasis and a related arthritis — drugs in the same class as Humira, Enbrel and Remicade.\n\nThe review found while the biologic drugs don’t have the predictable potential for organ damage found with some older, conventional drugs, they “are associated with relatively unpredictable major harms, including serious infections (e.g., sepsis, tuberculosis, and viral infections), autoimmune dysfunction (e.g., lupus, demyelinating disorders), and malignancies (e.g., lymphoma).”\n\nFungal infections are a particular concern.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified a total of more than 260,000 hospitalizations between 2000 and 2013 for four fungal infections: histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis and coccidioidomycosis.\n\nAll the infections increased substantially over that time frame; between 5% and 20% involved deaths.\n\n“Providers should be vigilant for fungal infection among patients taking biologics,” CDC researchers warned in a 2016 paper.\n\nBehm, the CDC spokeswoman noted that the number of biologics on the market only has grown since the paper was published. Indeed, eight new biologic drugs have been approved since 2016 alone.\n\nThe life-threatening condition known as sepsis has surfaced as a particular concern among people who use biologics, especially those with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nSepsis, a body-wide inflammatory reaction to an infection, affects about 1.7 million people a year, including 270,000 who die, according to the CDC.\n\nBeginning in the early 2000s there was a spike in sepsis cases among people with rheumatoid arthritis. A 2018 paper by researchers at Boston University School of Medicine found that hospitalizations for sepsis more than tripled between 1993 and 2013.\n\nThe big uptick seemed to occur beginning in about 2002 when the number jumped from 4,700 cases to 2013, when there were 32,000 cases.\n\nA substantial portion of the increase may have been due to more accurate hospital coding for sepsis, said lead author Sadao Jinno.\n\nHowever, the increases coincided with the rise of biologic drugs. In the period between 1999 and 2002, three popular biologics — Remicade (1999), Enbrel (2000) and Humira (2002) — were approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAli Wilson, who lives in the Tampa, Florida, area, is one of those who was affected by sepsis.\n\nAfter years of using a non-biologic drug to control her rheumatoid arthritis, Wilson went on Humira in 2013. Wilson, a nurse, gave herself her first injection on Oct. 17 that year.\n\n“On October 29,” she said, “I was in the ER dying.”\n\nWilson, 53, had rapidly developed a case of sepsis. She had severe joint pain, a temperature of 101 and was vomiting and shaking. Paramedics barely could feel her pulse. She spent nine days in the hospital, including four in the intensive care unit.\n\nWilson said she and her doctor believe Humira may have weakened her immune system and allowed an infection that she might have picked up during gallbladder surgery several months earlier to flare up.\n\nThe change was so dramatic, she said, “it was like somebody flicked a light switch.”\n\nShe recovered from the bout with sepsis, but has avoided Humira. She now is taking a generic drug and recently started on another biologic, Orencia, that she thinks may be safer.\n\nSince 2004, there have been nearly 10,000 reports to the FDA of sepsis in people using biologics, according to a Journal Sentinel analysis.\n\nSteven Simpson, who treats sepsis patients and is medical director of the Sepsis Alliance, a patient advocacy group, said people using the drugs need to be aware of potential warning signs such as fever or confusion.\n\nIf a person on a biologic drug gets a fever above 101?\n\n“I’d get to the doctor immediately,” said Simpson, a professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Kansas.\n\nAutopsy finds histoplasmosis\n\nIn the case of Tschannen, the 77-year-old who died of a histoplasmosis infection, she went to the doctor as soon as symptoms emerged.\n\nBut no one recognized the cause of what was happening — or the relationship between the condition and the drug she had just started taking.\n\nThe diagnosis of histoplasmosis didn’t come until the autopsy.\n\nTschannen had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for years. She had been taking three other drugs for the condition and only added Remicade a few months before she got ill. The drug was given by infusion every few weeks.\n\n“She only had two doses,” said Webber, her daughter.\n\nTschannen had suffered a brain aneurysm several years earlier and had high blood pressure.\n\n“Adding Remicade was a lot,” Webber said. “It was too much for somebody with all those conditions.”\n\nUnlike many people who develop a histoplasmosis infection, a CDC paper found those using biologic drugs often have a type of the infection that is harder to diagnose.\n\nSince 2004, nearly 1,800 cases of histoplasmosis and other fungal infections in people using biologics have been reported to the FDA, according to the Journal Sentinel analysis of FDA data.\n\nA 2011 paper on the risk of hospitalized infections in rheumatoid arthritis patients showed Remicade with the highest rate among several biologic drugs. Yet, rather than doom the drug to diminished sales, prescriptions increased from 2013 through 2018.\n\nIn the months after her mother’s death, Webber sought answers from her mother’s doctor and Johnson & Johnson, the maker of the drug.\n\nThe doctor, Steven Baak, wrote back describing the tricky balance with treating rheumatoid arthritis — how if not controlled, it can lead to joint damage or an even the risk of heart disease.\n\n“It is nerve-wracking,” he wrote, “to try to control severe symptoms knowing all the bad things that can happen.”\n\nShe sent multiple emails and letters to the drugmaker, hoping to make sure the company was aware of the case.\n\n“I realize that this medication has helped many patients,” Webber wrote in one letter. “I also know my mother died a horrible death.\n\n“I wish we had never heard of this medication.”\n\nAbout this project\n\nThis story — and others in this series — was produced with the support of the National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation.

Wade and revoked the federal right to an abortion, according to a new study published Tuesday in JAMA.\n\nMore than a dozen states enacted complete or partial bans on abortion after the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, and researchers considered abortion facilities in those states to be inactive – cutting the number of active facilities by a tenth.\n\nThis drop in active facilities means a third of women of reproductive age in the US live more than an hour from the closest abortion facility – more than double the share before the bans were enacted. And the average travel time to get an abortion more than tripled, from less than half an hour to more than an hour and a half.\n\n“No one should have to travel outside their community to get the health care services that they need,” said Rachel Hardeman, a researcher and professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health who focuses on reproductive health equity but who was not directly involved in the research. “Certainly the complexity that comes with having to travel even an hour away from your home to get health care is a significant burden.”\n\nFor women in Texas and Louisiana, average travel times to the nearest abortion facility were seven hours longer, adding nearly a full workday in travel time to get an abortion.\n\n“When the Dobbs decision came down, I think many people thought ‘Oh, they can just go to another state to get an abortion.’ I don’t think people on the coasts really understand the vast distances involved and the barriers that people have in their daily lives to travel to make these very long trips,” said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco’s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health.\n\nBarriers like extra time off of work, arranging for child care, costs of travel and for the procedure could be “insurmountable,” she said. “It means that abortion care will be impossible for many people.”\n\nOverall, the Supreme Court decision adds the most significant barriers to access for Black, Hispanic and American Indian women. With more inactive facilities, an additional 1 in 4 Black women and 1 in 5 Hispanic and American Indian women has to travel more than an hour to an active abortion facility. Uninsured women and those with lower incomes also continue to have low access to abortion facilities, according to the study.\n\n“The United States is the only industrialized nation with a rising maternal mortality rate, and Black people are at greater risk – three to four times more,’ Hardeman said.\n\n“We can’t separate that data and reality from abortion bans. The ripple effects are important to think about.”\n\nA separate analysis published Friday by #WeCount, a research project led by the Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit that supports research on abortion and contraception, found that there were at least 10,000 fewer abortions in the two months after the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade: a 6% drop in August compared with April.\n\nIn states that implemented a ban or severe restrictions, legal abortions dropped 95%. But in states where abortion remained legal, abortions increased only 11%.\n\n“The increases in protected access states were not sufficient to compensate for the losses in the banned states,” said Upadhyay, who co-authored the JAMA study and the #WeCount analysis. “Together, these results point to a great unmet need for abortion care.”\n\nThe women falling into this gap are those who are less able to travel, she said. They’re more likely to be adolescents, immigrants, people experiencing partner violence and people with small children.\n\n“They will most likely self-mange their abortion or delay their care and others will be forced to carry their unwanted pregnancy to term against their will.”\n\nAnother study published in JAMA on Tuesday similarly suggested how patterns of abortion care might change after the Supreme Court decision.\n\nIn September 2021, nearly a year before the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, Texas restricted abortions after the detection of cardiac activity in the embryo or fetus.\n\nIn the month after this law was enacted, in-state abortions dropped more than 50%, and five times as many Texas residents got abortions across state lines, most often in Oklahoma. But even with the increase in Texas residents seeking abortions out of state, overall abortions still declined.\n\nAbortion facilities in neighboring states had more limited capacity and “were challenged to absorb a sudden surge of patients, which might have contributed to long waits for appointments and pregnant Texas residents obtaining abortions later in pregnancy,” the researchers wrote.\n\n“We know that when people decide they want an abortion, they’re certain and they want an abortion as soon as possible,” Upadhyay said.\n\nIn 2020, medication abortion was used in more than half of abortions in the US, according to an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research advocacy group. But federal guidance only approves use of medication abortion up to 10 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n“Time is of the essence,” Upadhyay said.\n\nBut many clinics in states where abortion is still legal now have at least a two week waiting list, she said. And the people living in those states where abortion is still legal are having to delay their care, too.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court ruling, about one in 10 patients that Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains saw for abortion care were from out of state, according to data shared with CNN. But now, more than one in three are from out of state – and most are from Texas.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn all of 2021, about 1,500 out-of-state patients traveled to the region for abortion care. In late summer 2022, more than 300 out-of-state patients scheduled abortion appointments every week.\n\nAverage wait times grew from less than two weeks to more than three weeks for first trimester abortions. And local Colorado residents had an extra four days added to their average wait times.\n\n“Seeing the magnitude of the number of lives these data represent is really devastating,” Upadhyay said. “These are human lives that will be affected forever.”", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2016/05/27/major-increase-water-rates-stirs-debate/85022964/", "title": "Major increase in water rates stirs debate", "text": "Ian James\n\nThe Desert Sun\n\nWater bills are about to go up significantly for more than 300,000 people across the Coachella Valley.\n\nUnder the rate increases proposed by the Coachella Valley Water District, the monthly bill for an average single-family home is set to climb by about $6, or 23 percent, starting in July.\n\nThe rate hikes will vary widely, though, depending on the customer. Some homeowner associations, for instance, would see rates jump by more than 50 percent if they continue using the same amount of water – a change that for some neighborhoods would translate into paying thousands of dollars more in water bills over the coming months. Those increased payments could in turn force HOAs to raise association dues.\n\nFirst and foremost among the reasons cited by the district is the need to invest $250 million to begin treating drinking water to remove the naturally occurring heavy metal chromium-6, as required under a strict new state standard. The district also is projecting that because many people have been changing their water habits and conserving more, that will eat into revenues and require higher rates to help fill the budget hole.\n\nThe Coachella Valley has long had relatively low water rates, and the district’s proposal came as a shock to some people when they crunched the numbers. Those who are opposing the plan say if the CVWD board sticks to its proposal in a vote on June 14, the abrupt shift to higher rates will leave many people shouldering a heavy financial burden.\n\n“It’s too fast going from zero to these increases,” said Bill Jones, president of the Citrus Course Homeowners Association in La Quinta. “We consider it to be onerous.”\n\nHe expects that with the higher rates, his HOA of nearly 500 homeowners will end up overspending the amount it budgeted for water this year by tens of thousands of dollars. That would require the association to dedicate more of its budget to water, he said, and could force it to increase homeowners’ dues.\n\nThe community has plans to convert some of its nearly 10 acres of grass to desert landscaping, Jones said, but that will take time and investment. And in the meantime, he expects the community will take a big financial hit.\n\n“We support the fact that we need to cut down on the amount of water we use,” Jones said. “We don’t support the speed with which they are implementing this.”\n\nThe district is the largest of six water suppliers in the Coachella Valley and serves an area stretching across about 1,000 square miles from Cathedral City to communities near the Salton Sea.\n\nCVWD laid out its plans, including changes to its rate structure, in a glossy mailer ahead of the public hearing next month. Under the new fixed charges and per-volume rates, single-family homeowners would see different increases than those living in multifamily units, business owners and homeowner associations that buy water for outdoor irrigation.\n\nThe district’s figures show that under one scenario, customers living in a multifamily condominium and with a level of water use deemed “efficient,” could face an increase of roughly 21 percent starting in July. In another hypothetical example, a commercial business with average water use could end up paying about 18 percent more.\n\nTHE CURRENT: Subscribe to The Desert Sun’s energy and water newsletter\n\nHomeowner associations that buy water for outdoor irrigation would see some of the biggest increases. HOAs often have a few dozen water meters to supply all of their grassy areas, and the large increases in the fixed rates for each meter – from $7 to $28 – would add up.\n\nThe district’s board will be voting on a single year of rate increases for now. But CVWD’s notice to customers details potential rate increases through 2020. If those increases are adopted as projected in future years, many customers would see their bills double by 2020 – and the bills of some HOAs could rise more than 150 percent.\n\nJim Barrett, CVWD’s general manager, said the district is basing the new drinking water rates on a study of the costs of providing service for each category of customers.\n\n“We recognize that these rates will be difficult for some of our customers. We appreciate that. We don’t see that we have a lot of option in how we do this,” Barrett said. He pointed out that CVWD’s rates, even after the first year of increases, will still be lower than those of many other agencies in Southern California.\n\n“I get it that there’s sticker shock when you look at that fifth year,” Barrett said. But he added that each year the district will analyze its costs and revenues, and the board will decide whether to increase rates by the projected amounts.\n\nCVWD last raised its drinking water rates in 2010. Its customers have cut back water use by about 25 percent during the past year in response to the state’s mandatory drought rules.\n\nAfter state regulators lifted those mandatory restrictions this month, the district eliminated the drought penalty fees it had been charging customers who failed to reach their conservation targets. Now the district will no longer have those penalties to offset losses in revenues due to conservation, and Barrett said that’s another factor contributing to the higher rates.\n\nREAD MORE: Water district eliminates drought penalty fees\n\nThe district has a rate structure with individualized water budgets and different tiers designed to penalize those who use more water and reward those who conserve. By readjusting the rate structure, CVWD is making customers’ budgets stricter – reducing the total budget of a single-family home by about 25 percent. That change, Barrett said, should help encourage conservation.\n\nThe biggest factor behind the need to raise rates, Barrett said, is the district’s plan to start treating the water from many wells to remove chromium-6, also known as hexavalent chromium. California regulators adopted a new drinking water standard for the carcinogen in 2014, and water districts have been given until 2020 to comply.\n\nIn large portions of the aquifer beneath the Coachella Valley, the groundwater has levels of chromium-6 that exceed the new state limit.\n\nIn order to remove the heavy metal, the district plans to build small treatment plants at about 30 of its 92 wells across the valley. The district’s managers say it will be their costliest infrastructure project ever.\n\nRemoving chromium-6\n\nIn a gravel-covered lot obscured by high walls next to a La Quinta mini-mall, a pump hums as it lifts water from hundreds of feet underground. This water, gushing through the pipes at 2,000 gallons a minute, is tainted with chromium-6 at a concentration of 16 parts per billion.\n\nCalifornia’s new limit is 10 parts per billion, so the water will need to be treated. At this well and others across the valley, the district plans to install ion-exchange treatment units that use resin beads to strip chromium-6 from the water.\n\nThe total projected price tag: $250 million for treatment plants and infrastructure, plus $8 million in yearly costs for operations and maintenance.\n\nIndio launches facilities to make drinking water safe\n\nThe potential dangers of chromium-6 were highlighted in the 1990s by a court case brought by then-legal clerk Erin Brockovich against Pacific Gas & Electric Company, claiming groundwater contamination in the Mojave Desert town of Hinkley. After the case became widely known through the 2000 film \"Erin Brockovich,\" the California Legislature in 2001 passed a law instructing public health agencies to develop a drinking water standard for hexavalent chromium.\n\nAs state officials weighed potential limits, environmental groups argued for a strict standard, and water agencies warned of high costs, questioning the science behind the proposal.\n\nCalifornia’s limit is the first in the country to focus specifically on hexavalent chromium. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency limits the level of any chromium compound to 100 parts per billion.\n\nIn many areas of the country, chromium-6 has been released into the environment as a pollutant from sources such as chemical plants, leather tanneries and cooling towers. In the Coachella Valley, though, water agencies say chromium-6 occurs naturally, dissolving from rocks into the groundwater.\n\n“I would have preferred that there was no change to the drinking water standard, honestly,” Barrett said. “But that’s what we have to do because that’s what the state has told us to do.”\n\nAgency to invest in treating water for chromium-6\n\nTo pay for chromium-6 treatment, the water district is obtaining a state loan, and as a condition needs to have rates in place to cover the debt payments. Barrett said the district will need about $16 million a year for 20 years to cover the debt.\n\nThe cities of Indio and Coachella have also started investing in chromium-6 treatment. City officials in Coachella have said recently that they expect substantial rate increases.\n\n“Chromium-6 treatment is definitely a cost driver for some districts around the state,” said Lisa Lien-Mager, director of communications for the Association of California Water Agencies. She said many other agencies are seeking grants and loans to help with the costs.\n\n“Depending on the level of treatment required and capital costs for construction and even land acquisition,” she said, “it will be a big ticket item for some water agencies and will have an impact on rates.”\n\nDistrict facing criticism\n\nSome of CVWD’s customers have studied the finances and strongly oppose the rate increases.\n\n“The public is totally being bamboozled here,” said Randy Roberts of Palm Desert. He said he thinks the district has been mismanaging customers’ money and should withdraw the rate increase proposal and redo it.\n\nThe district’s managers say they’re managing funds properly and have followed legal procedures.\n\nBarrett said the cost study was carried out “to demonstrate to our customers that we’ve done what we can to fairly, accurately and appropriately allocate costs to different types of users that have different needs from the system.”\n\nRates could spike for Coachella Valley Water District\n\nSome people have questioned whether the higher rates will be a burden for the poor and retirees living on fixed incomes. Barrett said the law, however, does not allow one customer to subsidize another, and therefore the district is not permitted to establish “lifeline rates.”\n\nThe process of raising rates is laid out under Proposition 218, a 1996 ballot measure that requires districts to charge the actual cost of providing service to customers.\n\nIn a separate decision this month, the district’s board approved increases in the fees charged to private well owners – including golf courses, farms and some HOAs – based on the amounts of water they pump.\n\nThe Coachella Valley’s relatively cheap water rates have for decades facilitated the growth of resort-style developments with wall-to-wall grass and artificial lakes.\n\nJoan Taylor, an environmentalist who is the Sierra Club’s local conservation chair, said she thinks higher water rates are long overdue.\n\n“It should have happened a long time ago, and it probably still isn’t high enough,” she said. “There’s way too much water wasted in this valley.”\n\nGroundwater levels have declined over the years across much of the valley, while imported water from the Colorado River has helped partially offset those losses. The imported water has flowed to ponds near Palm Springs and La Quinta, pushing up water levels in those areas while the aquifer has continued to decline in the mid-valley.\n\nJones' community, Citrus, was built before desert landscaping was in vogue.\n\nThe retirement community of Spanish-style homes in La Quinta includes large grassy areas fringed with rosebushes and palm trees. Water gushes down artificial waterfalls into ponds.\n\nJones said the community has been looking at estimates for converting grass to desert landscaping in order to save water, but the costs are high.\n\n“We really want more time,” he said. “It’s not just the Citrus. It’s a large number of HOAs that are having the same issue.”\n\nDale Brooks, a fellow member of the homeowner association board, said he thinks the rate increases will have a serious economic impact on communities.\n\n“I think it’ll drive people out of the valley.”\n\nIan James writes about water and the environment for The Desert Sun.

Here's what to do", "text": "Get the shoe handy.\n\nBreak out the fly swatter.\n\nIt's killing season in New Jersey.\n\nThe beautiful — butdreaded — spotted lanternfly is back. The next generation of plant hopper and crop destroyer has begun hatching in every corner of New Jersey after their dormant winter.\n\nBut despite quarantines and the state's \"Stomp It Out\" campaign to get New Jerseyans to crush the bug with their feet, experts say the spotted lanternfly will continue to flourish in 2022.\n\n\"With few predators and no parasites in New Jersey to keep them in check, each year’s population will be bigger than the last,\" said Matthew Aardema, a Montclair State University entomologist, who has already seen large quantities this spring near his Mercer County home.\n\nThe spotted lanternfly, a native of China, most likely came to the U.S. as a hitchhiker on a cargo container. It was first found in New Jersey four years ago despite efforts to contain it in eastern Pennsylvania, where it was first discovered in the U.S.\n\nNow they have infested nearly every corner of New Jersey. They have already been seen clinging to trees in the deep forests of the Highlands and Pinelands, as well as scaling the facades of high-rises in densely populated Hudson County.\n\nInvasive species:5 harmful invasive insects that have wreaked havoc in NJ\n\nThe life cycle of the spotted lanternfly begins in mid-spring when they hatch from egg clusters that were laid by the prior generation last fall. Right now, they are in their early nymph stage, in which they appear black and very small. Two giveaways are their white spots and ability to jump a foot or more.\n\nWhy are spotted lanternflies bad?\n\nSpotted lanternflies love to feed on the tree of heaven. But the problem in New Jersey and other eastern states is that they will suck the sap from as many as 70 plant species, especially fruit trees. As they feed, they secrete a sugary substance that draws other insects such as wasps and ants to feed and promotes mold growth. It leads to a one-two punch that can weaken the tree and eventually contribute to its death.\n\nWhat can you expect?\n\nDespite their spread, New Jersey farmers did not report any significant damage in 2021.\n\nThe state Department of Agriculture has even set up a website — badbug.nj.gov — for the public to get information and report sightings.\n\nThe agency is already starting to get reports from the public, but not enough yet to determine where there is a concentration, said Jeff Wolfe, a department spokesman.\n\nThat will likely change as spotted lanternflies morph into more colorful stages, in which they appear red and black, and later as adults with wings and long antennas. Last summer, in August alone the New Jersey Department of Agriculture received almost 10,000 emails and phone calls concerning the pest.\n\nNew Jersey:Teacher shortages continue. Here's what NJ is doing to make it easier to hire more\n\nIf summer 2022 is anything like summer 2021, they will likely be everywhere.\n\nThe spotted lanternfly has too many different plants it can feed on and is too mobile for total elimination or even control to work, Aardema said.\n\nPopulations can persist in remote locations such as densely wooded areas that would never be sprayed with insecticides or even checked. The best strategy would be to stop infestations in vineyards, orchards, plant nurseries and other similar locations.\n\n\"They will not be eliminated and are almost surely here to stay,\" Aardema said.\n\nQuarantine zone\n\nNew Jersey has set up a 13-county quarantine zone that puts restrictions on the transportation of firewood, landscaping equipment, packing materials, plants and trees outside the area to ensure the insect's eggs are not inadvertently spread.

Now many are asking: What's next?\n\nAcross a storied 45-year career as a New York Times staff reporter, Ralph Blumenthal had extensively covered weighty topics like the Italian Mafia and Nazi war criminals. But never suspected alien spaceships.\n\nThat changed in 2017 when Blumenthal, by that time a retired contributor for the Times, connected with investigative journalist Leslie Kean, who had come across an extraordinary tip.\n\nKean, who has long reported on UFOs, was able to attend a confidential meeting that October where she learned of a top-secret Pentagon program that had for years operated in the shadows. Its mission? To investigate reported sighting of mysterious objects in the skies.\n\nThe discovery was monumental, not least because it directly undermined the government's public position of more than 50 years that unidentified flying objects were not worth studying.\n\nNaturally, Blumenthal was intrigued.\n\n“The government always took the position that there’s nothing to this, that these are all hoaxes or hallucinations, but nothing real,\" Blumenthal told USA TODAY in a phone interview. “This was a pretty good story, I thought – a great story.”\n\nMysterious signal:Researchers discover strange interstellar radio signal reaching Earth\n\nNew York Times article sets the stage for more revelations\n\nBlumenthal's hunch was right.\n\nPublished two months later, the now-famous article uncovering the top secret program headlined \"Glowing Auras and ‘Black Money’\" marked a turning point in the ever-evolving public discourse surrounding UFOs.\n\nReported UFO sightings have long attracted as many skeptics as they do fanatics. But for those with doubts, there it was in black and white on the front page of one of the nation's preeminent newspapers: The Pentagon had for years thought that reports of craft flying in strange ways were so serious as to merit millions of dollars in funding to study.\n\n\"We happened to capture the moment of interest and did change the dialogue\" - Ralph Blumenthal\n\nWhat the Times' reporters exposed spread like wildfire, helping to set in motion a series of additional revelations, government hearings and even UFO documentaries that recently culminated in July in some jaw-dropping testimony before Congress about a spaceship crash retrieval program. This week, the Pentagon's new office to investigate UFOs unveiled a new website where the public can access declassified information about reported sightings.\n\nIn the years since the Times' article appeared, the harrowing experiences shared by Navy pilots and the revelations exposed by government whistleblowers have continued to lend legitimacy to a topic once confined to the realm of conspiracy theory. Long considered taboo, discussion of UFOs (and the potential interstellar lifeforms many believe could be piloting them) has now entered the mainstream as the push for government transparency strengthens.\n\n“I do think we at The New York Times ... did open doors that had long been closed,” Blumenthal said. “I do take great pride in that, that we happened to capture the moment of interest and did change the dialogue.\"\n\n'A promising step:'NASA says planet 8.6 times bigger than Earth could support life\n\nIntelligence officials go public\n\nBut the team of reporters couldn't have done it alone.\n\nGrowing disillusioned with the obstinance he faced among the high ranks of the government, Christopher Mellon in 2017 joined a small group of former government officials with security clearances who went public with some of what they knew.\n\nMellon and others had become concerned over the threat to national security posed by craft routinely observed in U.S. airspace moving in ways beyond the capabilities of any known human technology. Additionally, no central mechanism existed to report and document these sightings of UFOs, which have recently been rebranded as UAP for unidentified anomalous (or aerial) phenomena.\n\n\"We felt it was essential from a security and national defense standpoint to alert the system and wake people up\" - Christopher Mellon\n\nSo Mellon, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, turned to the press. He was joined in his efforts by Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence official who resigned and went public in October 2017 after 10 years of running the Pentagon program.\n\n“We just knew our pilots were encountering some very bizarre craft,\" Mellon told USA TODAY in a phone interview. \"We felt it was essential from a security and national defense standpoint to alert the system and wake people up.”\n\nUsing unclassified documents and on-the-record interviews with former intelligence officers, Blumenthal, Kean and Times' Pentagon correspondent Helene Cooper were able to expose the Defense Department's secretive Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. The bombshell article even included with it the release of videos showing the Navy's encounters with strange objects.\n\nBefore The New York Times agreed to the story, Mellon and Elizondo had also joined the commercial venture To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science, a San Diego-based company co-founded by Blink-182 frontman and guitarist Tom DeLonge.\n\nAt its outset, the company had both an entertainment and now-defunct research arm and was instrumental in the production of the History Channel docuseries \"Unidentified: Inside America's UFO Investigation,\" which chiefly featured Mellon and Elizondo in its two-season run between 2019 and 2020.\n\n“We decided we're going to make this known, we’re going to tell people this is real,” co-founder Jim Semivan, a retired operations officer with the CIA, told USA TODAY.\n\nMore:Mexican congress shown supposed bodies, X-rays, of 'non-human alien corpses' at UFO hearing\n\nUFO lore extends back decades\n\nSemivan's interest in studying the UFO phenomenon extends back 40 years, and includes one sighting of his own in the 1990s that he declined to describe.\n\nEver since Allied pilots would see so-called foo fighters in the skies over both the European and Pacific theaters during World War II, Americans have for decades been equally captivated by and skeptical of tantalizing reports of flying saucers and little green men visiting Earth.\n\nThe Air Force seemed to close the doors on further government study of the phenomenon in 1969 when it shut down Project Blue Book, declaring in no uncertain terms that any reports of UFOs were either hoaxes or misidentified natural occurrences. But many wondered, did the Cold War era program uncover and subsequently cover up the discovery of objects beyond human control, representing a potential threat?\n\n“There’s no way it’s Chinese, it isn’t Russian and it sure as hell isn’t ours because these craft, we’ve been seeing these things for 80 years,” Semivan said. “What we have here is something very odd and very unusual.”\n\nAlien technology on Earth?Metallic spheres found on Pacific floor are interstellar in origin, Harvard professor finds\n\nFallout from the July hearing\n\nIn 2020, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence adopted Mellon's proposal to seek an official report on UAP from the intelligence community. The resulting preliminary assessment released in June 2021 identified 144 military UAP encounters since 2004, a figure which Mellon said has since jumped this year to more than 500 military UAP reports.\n\nThe findings are in part what Mellon said spurred Congress to establish the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) focused on receiving and analyzing unidentified phenomena reports, many of which have come from military pilots.\n\nThe developments seem to have solved the concern of Mellon and others of craft flying unchecked and unreported through military airspace. But now another issue has arisen: In June, a decorated former combat officer by the name of David Grusch came forward to claim, without presenting evidence publicly, that crafts of non-human origin have crashed on earth and been retrieved by the government for study.\n\nThough Grusch's interview with NewsNation went viral, it was Blumenthal and Kean who once again had the story first. Days earlier, the pair broke the news with Grusch's wild claims about the Pentagon's covert crash retrieval program in an article in The Debrief, a news site focused on coverage of technology and national defense.\n\nThe Pentagon has repeatedly denied the existence of such a program.\n\nGrusch, a member of a previous Pentagon task force that investigated UAP, repeated the claims on July 26 before a House Oversight subcommittee, which he said was based on interviews he did with 40 witnesses, many of whom he said are still working in the program.\n\nDuring the two-hour hearing, Grusch was also joined by two former Navy pilots, Ryan Graves and David Fravor, whose own account of the the now-famous a Tic Tac-shaped object captured on video in 2004 during a flight off the coast of Southern California has become the stuff of legend among the UFO community.\n\nLegal constraints may limit what Grusch is able to discuss publicly about alleged classified programs without, but Mellon and Semivan both said they found his testimony to be credible.\n\n“A claim as extraordinary as that requires exceptional, extraordinary proof,\" Mellon said. \"Yet, there is clearly a substantial basis for these claims. The immense national security and scientific implications warrant additional congressional investigation.”\n\nFollowing the hearing, three Republicans and one Democrat on the House subcommittee sent a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., calling for the establishment of a select committee to investigate UAP further.\n\nTo the moon and back:Astronauts get 1st look at Artemis II craft ahead of lunar mission\n\nAstrophysicists caution hasty conclusions of 'aliens'\n\nHowever, many astrophysicists caution the public from jumping to the conclusion that any unexplained sighting means aliens on other planets are visiting us. During NASA's UAP hearing earlier this year, experts were clear that even otherworldly explanations aren't likely even in the absence of a natural explanation.\n\n\"We must be careful to not inject 'aliens' every time we encounter something we don’t understand,\" David Kipping, an astronomer at Columbia University, told USA TODAY in an email. \"Faced with ambiguous evidence like this, our brains tend to fill in the gaps with whatever we’re culturally pre-conditioned to expect.\"\n\n“What it actually is I think is anybody’s guess\" - Jim Semivan\n\nSemivan readily admits that the phenomenon doesn't fit into the scientific method; it's unpredictable, it has no agreed-upon vocabulary, \"yet it's very real,\" he said.\n\n“What it actually is I think is anybody’s guess,” Semivan said.\n\nBoth Mellon and Semivan anticipated that as bipartisan supports mounts for the military and executive branch to reveal what they know, the public will grow increasingly open and accepting of the idea that UAP – whatever they are – are out there.\n\n“It’ll get increasingly difficult to deny that there are intelligent vehicles doing things that we ourselves cannot do in the atmosphere,\" Mellon said. “I think these kind of changes always take time, and I'm talking about a sea change in our worldview, of our understanding of the universe and our place in it.”\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

In a long-awaited report, experts commissioned by the the space agency outlined ways in which NASA can partner with the U.S. government and private commercial organizations to better study and understand unidentified flying objects.\n\nLong considered a fringe topic, UFOs have increasingly become part of the mainstream discussion as reports and videos of objects maneuvering in strange ways captivate the public.\n\nMany of those reports can often be explained as balloons, drones and even commercial airplanes. But absent a commonplace terrestrial explanation, it's not uncommon for UFO enthusiasts to eagerly jump to the conclusion that otherworldly beings are visiting Earth.\n\nWatch the full briefing:NASA UFO press conference discusses findings of UAP report\n\nBecause of the potential threat posed to national security and air safety, NASA embarked in 2022 on the space agency's first-ever study of UFOs, which the agency refers to as unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP. But NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said at a news briefing Thursday that the agency also set out to \"shift the conversation surrounding UAP from sensationalism to science.\"\n\n\"There's a global fascination with UAP,\" Nelson said in prepared remarks. \"We are looking for signs of life, past and present; it's in our DNA to explore and ask why things are the way they are.\"\n\nNo longer conspiracy theories:How UFOs became mainstream in America\n\nWho is on the panel?\n\nNASA commissioned an independent panel of 16 experts in June 2022 to examine data related to UAP.\n\nLed by astrophysicist David Spergel, president of the Simons Foundation in New York City, the team was made up of some of the world’s leading scientists, data and artificial intelligence practitioners and aerospace safety experts.\n\nAfter hosting a public panel in May, the team on Thursday released a comprehensive 36-page report of its findings. As promised, the report was not a review of previous UAP incidents.\n\nInstead, the report detailed the reasons that data surrounding the study of UAP has previously been so insufficient while providing a roadmap on what possible data could be collected in the future. Grainy videos of unidentified objects may provide intrigue online, but without more detailed observations, the panel said that meaningful scientific conclusions about the nature of the objects remains impossible.\n\nThe report provided recommendations to create a uniform process by which NASA, other government agencies and commercial entities with satellites and other imaging technologies can gather and share data about \"one of our planet's greatest mysteries,\" NASA Associate Administrator Nicola Fox said at the briefing.\n\nHunt for extraterrestrial life:Metallic spheres found on Pacific floor are interstellar in origin, Harvard professor claims\n\nUFOs become more mainstream as stigma lessens\n\nThe report comes at a time when UFOs have once again been capturing the public's attention.\n\nIn the U.S., bipartisan pressure has been mounting on the federal government and the military to release more information about what they know of UAP, which is also the official term the government uses instead of UFOs.\n\nAnd just this week, a hearing in front of Mexican lawmakers included one UFO researcher presenting what he alleged were the mummified bodies of ancient aliens, a claim that has been disputed by scientists.\n\nA July hearing, in which former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer David Grusch claimed his country has been aware of “non-human” activity since the 1930s, became Congress’ latest foray into UFOs. A year prior, Congress had held its first public hearing on UFOs in more than 50 years, bucking the government's longstanding public position that unidentified flying objects were not worth studying.\n\nGrusch was joined by former Navy pilots Lt. Ryan Graves and Cmdr. David Fravor for a hearing filled with claims of mysterious objects sighted by Navy pilots and a government program to retrieve and study downed spacecraft. Laws regarding classified information would have constrained Grusch from presenting hard evidence to support the claims of such a crash retrieval program, which the Pentagon has denied exists.\n\nOn Thursday, Nelson expressed skepticism of Grusch's claims and rebuked questions about whether NASA or other government agencies would ever cover up evidence of extraterrestrial life on earth.\n\n\"There's so much concern that something is locked up, classified, that the American government is not being open,\" Nelson said in response to a reporter's question. \"Well, we are the American government and we are being open.\"\n\nIn a bid for transparency, the Pentagon's office to investigate UAP unveiled a website of its own this month where the public can access declassified information about reported sightings.\n\n'A promising step:'NASA says planet 8.6 times bigger than Earth could support life\n\nWhat did NASA's report find?\n\nThat website, operated by the the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), will also be a place where both U.S. government and military personnel, as well as civilians, can someday soon make reports of UFO sightings.\n\nHowever, NASA's convened panel also recommended that the space agency work closely with AARO to develop a standardized system for civilians to make UFO reports, which doesn't yet exist.\n\n\"NASA’s very involvement in UAP will play a vital role in reducing stigma associated with UAP reporting, which almost certainly leads to data attrition at present,\" according to the report.\n\nDetecting UAP is often the result of happenstance, according to the report, which explained that sensors designed for other purposes are simply lucky to capture such objects at all. The report argued that NASA's fleet of Earth-observing satellites − largely unequipped to detect small UAP themselves − should be deployed to determine the environmental conditions present when such objects are sighted.\n\nThe report's authors further advocated for the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to identify occurrences of UAP.\n\nData from air traffic control towers and radar systems from the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as data from crowdsourcing tools such as open-source smartphone apps, could also provide valuable data, the report's authors contended.\n\n\"We know there's missing data,\" Spergel said Thursday.\n\nNASA appoints director of UAP research, but doesn't make name public\n\nAARO was launched in 2022 a year after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence identified 144 military UAP encounters since 2004. That figure jumped this year to more than 500 military UAP reports, many of which cannot be explained as natural occurrences such as unpiloted aircraft or weather balloons.\n\nBut while strange objects in the sky can be captivating, experts at NASA, as well as other astrophysicists, have long cautioned that otherworldly explanations aren't likely even in the absence of a natural explanation. At a UFO hearing that NASA hosted in May, scientists were clear that they did not believe there was evidence to conclusively confirm that UAP are extraterrestrial in origin.\n\nHowever, scientists haven't ruled such an explanation out, Nelson said.\n\n\"The top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn,\" Nelson said. \"We don't know what these UAP are.\"\n\nThat's why NASA also announced Thursday that it appointed a director of UAP research – who it declined to name publicly – to manage data and coordinate with AARO and the Department of Defense.\n\n\"While today is a significant step for NASA it's not our final step,\" Nelson said. \"Whatever we find, we will tell you.\"\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The bodies, he testified, were retrieved in 2017 from Cusco, Peru before radiocarbon dating revealed them to be up to 1,800 years old.\n\nMaussan's wild claims, which he presented without third-party evidence, came during a Tuesday congressional hearing in Mexico about UFOs, now referred to by the U.S. government as UAP, short for unidentified anomalous (or aerial) phenomena.\n\n\"This is the first time (extraterrestrial life) is presented in such a form and I think there is a clear demonstration that we are dealing with non-human specimens that are not related to any other species in our world,\" Maussan testified in Spanish.\n\nNo longer conspiracy theories?How UFOs became mainstream in America\n\nSupposed alien bodies found to have 'unknown' DNA\n\nThe small mummified specimens that Maussan alleges are extraterrestrials were brought out in two glass display cases for lawmakers to observe.\n\nThe hearing was to debate language on UAP in the Aerial Space Protection Law. If the language is approved, Mexico would become the first nation to formally acknowledge the presence of alien life ever existing on Earth, the Reuters news agency said, citing local media.\n\nMaussan said that the specimens were found fossilized in mines in Cusco, Peru, in a layer of diatomaceous earth, or ancient phytoplankton algae. The National Autonomous University of Mexico conducted tests on them, which Maussan claimed revealed that more than 30% of the specimens’ DNA was \"unknown,\" indicating that they are \"not part of our terrestrial evolution,\" he said.\n\nX-rays of the specimens were also presented during the hearing, which experts testifying under oath claimed showed that one specimen had what appeared to be eggs or ovaries, while the other had implants made of rare metals, such as Osmium.\n\nNASA UFO report:How NASA hopes to shift UAP talks 'from sensationalism to science'\n\n'A promising step:'NASA says planet 8.6 times bigger than Earth could support life\n\nJaime Maussan has promoted hoaxes before\n\nMaussan is an investigative journalist who has been researching extraterrestrial phenomenon for decades.\n\nBut if Maussan's latest claims — which scientists are already disputing — prove to be false, it wouldn't be the first time.\n\nThe UFO researcher, who appears regularly in Mexican media to present his purported findings, has previously been associated with claims of discoveries that have later been debunked.\n\nIn 2015, Maussan unveiled the existence of what was alleged to be an alien body unearthed in Nazca, Peru. Later, though, that \"alien\" discovery was debunked, and the mummified corpse was shown to be that of a human child with a head deformity, according to fact-checking website snopes.com.\n\nIn fact, such elongated skulls have often been explained by anthropologists as the result of an ancient practice of artificial cranial deformation. As a part of what could be an ancient religious ritual, young children had their heads bound in cloth, rope and even wooden boards, according to snopes.com.\n\nEarlier this year, Maussan also claimed that a photo of a supposed UFO hovering over the FC Juárez soccer stadium shows \"a ship of nonhuman origin.\"\n\n\"I share that the case was analyzed with AI equipment, and everything indicates that we are facing an unidentified anomalous phenomenon 'UAP', (Kyiv) scientists call these ships 'Ghost' for being dark objects,\" Maussan said in a tweet.\n\nHunt for extraterrestrial life:Metallic spheres found on Pacific floor are interstellar in origin, Harvard professor finds\n\nHearing in Mexico follows one in Congress\n\nMexico's hearing on UAP comes about two months after the United States held a congressional hearing of its own to learn more about the phenomenon.\n\nFormer Navy pilot Ryan Graves, who was among three former military members to testify at the July hearing, also appeared Tuesday to speak to Mexican lawmakers. Graves, now the executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace, has long been outspoken about the dangers military pilots have faced in U.S. airspace during reported encounters with mysterious objects flying in ways that appear to be beyond the capabilities of known human technology.\n\nFormer U.S. intelligence official David Grusch also testified in July before a House Oversight subcommittee about his apparent knowledge of a secretive Pentagon program to retrieve and study down spaceships.\n\nGrusch, who was a member of the National Reconnaissance Office, the agency that operates U.S. spy satellites, also accused the government of hiding the program from Congress and misappropriating funds to operate it.\n\nThe legal constraints of discussing classified information prevented Grusch from presenting hard evidence of such a program, which the Pentagon has repeatedly denied exists. But in a bipartisan effort, members of Congress have vowed to seek more information about what the military and federal government knows about UFOs.\n\nIn a bid for transparency, the Pentagon's relatively new office to investigate UFOs revealed on Sept. 1 a new website where the public can access declassified information about reported sightings.\n\nThe All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) was launched after the Office of the Director of National Intelligence identified 144 military UAP encounters since 2004 in a preliminary assessment released in June 2021.

Commander David Fravor, who was among Navy pilots who during a 2004 flight, spotted the now-famous Tic Tac-shaped object that was captured on video off the Southern California coast. When testifying he described the oval object as \"perfectly white, smooth, no windows,\" and said it displayed flight capabilities that were unheard of. Davenport said he knows Fravor and described him as a \"reliable guy.\"\n\n\"They're trying to tell us what I suspect, they believe is the truth, and which I suspect is the truth,\" Davenport said. \"Namely, we're being visited by objects or creatures, for which we have no explanation.\"\n\nThe researcher added that he's strongly convinced the U.S. government is shielding Americans from crucial information related to these sightings since 1947.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the Department of Defense for comment.\n\nCenter director believes UFOs are a sign of extraterrestrial life\n\nA 36-page report from NASA’s Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Independent Study Team released in September found no evidence that UFOs or UAPs are of extraterrestrial origin.\n\nThe team said some UAP simply can't yet be explained but that NASA is increasing their role in scientific investigation of these sightings, even naming a new director of UAP research, whose identity has been withheld.\n\nDavenport said he believes a significant fraction of reported sightings deal with extraterrestrial creatures, due to technology exhibiting \"flight characteristics that we don't have on this planet.\"\n\nHe said the Phoenix Lights incident decades ago is proof that there is technology that cannot be part of Earth.

A car-sized object in Alaska flew over “sensitive military sites” Feb. 10. In May, Las Vegas police officers investigated two unknown entities falling from the sky.\n\nAs pressure for information amounts, here's everything you need to know about how NASA and the U.S. government classify unidentified objects.\n\nWhat does UFO mean?\n\nUFO stands for “unidentified flying object,” a term for an aerial phenomenon whose cause or identity is unclear to the observer.\n\nThe United States Air Force coined the term in 1952, just five years after pilot Kenneth Arnold added “flying saucer” to the world’s lexicon. In 1947, Arnold flew past Mt. Rainier in Washington state where he saw “nine bright saucer-like objects.” Though he denied initially describing them as saucers, the name had already made its mark in popular culture.\n\nAccording to the Air Force Declassification Office, UFOs were initially defined “as those objects that remain unidentified after scrutiny by expert investigators, though today the term UFO is colloquially used to refer to any unidentifiable sighting regardless of whether it has been investigated.”\n\nHouse panel updates:Public hearings on UFOs amid calls for military transparency\n\nWhat does UAP mean?\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration uses the more precise term “unidentified anomalous phenomena” to describe “observations of the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or as known natural phenomena.” Until December 2022, it was known as “unidentified aerial phenomena” rather than anomalous.\n\nNASA began a study in October 2022 to further UAP data analysis, with promises of a mid-2023 report on its findings. The study is searching for the nature and origins of UAP, scientific analysis techniques, examining the risk to the National Air Space and ways to enhance air traffic management data acquisition systems.\n\nIn NASA’s 2021 UAP report, they classified five explanatory categories:\n\nAirborne clutter\n\nNatural atmospheric phenomena\n\nUSG or U.S. industry development programs\n\nForeign adversary systems\n\nOther\n\nThe report was largely inconclusive, but it stated that UAP “clearly pose” a risk to aviators and U.S. national security and NASA found “potential patterns” in shape, size and propulsion.\n\nUFOs:US government receives over 500 reports, unclassified report says\n\nJust Curious for more?

During that time, California has emerged as far-and-away the biggest hot spot for UFO sightings, logging 15,401 sightings, more than twice the number recorded by any other state.\n\nDuring that same period, Florida ranks second with with 7,749 sightings. The Top 5 is rounded out by Washington (6,866); Texas (5,786) and New York (5,590).\n\nSurprisingly, Nevada, home to the famous classified U.S. Air Force base “Area 51,” finished in 27th place with only 1,605 sightings over those same years.

Over the next four weeks, at least 150 American flamingos were seen in more than four dozen locations across Florida and in at least 14 states.\n\nFlamingos are seen from time to time in Florida and the birds – real and plastic – are synonymous with the state’s tropical vibe, so the sightings there may not be all that extraordinary. But Wisconsin? And the Ohio River?\n\nA flamingo rocked the world of Kansas birders this week when it showed up in Chase County Lake in the Flint Hills. An unconfirmed sighting reported a flamingo in Missouri the evening before.\n\n“It’s amazing to me that so many people all over the country got to experience this,” said Amy Davis, associate editor for North American Birds for the American Birding Association. “They’re just so beautiful and so gawky.”\n\nAt least five of the flamingos were traced back to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and experts surmise they were somehow picked up in the bands of Idalia’s winds as the storm lingered over the northwestern Caribbean Sea.\n\nNow it appears the birds may be returning southward, said Jerry Lorenz, state director of research for Audubon Florida, which dubbed the event “the pink wave.” But he and others hope some of the birds remain.\n\nFlamingos in Wisconsin?\n\nA flamboyance of flamingos showed up in Lake Michigan at Port Washington, Wisconsin on Sept. 22. Word of their arrival quickly spread among birders, who flocked to the lake.\n\nWhen Dexter Patterson, a faculty associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, got the call from a friend, he thought it was a joke, in part because Madison is the site of one of the greatest plastic flamingo pranks of all time, he said.\n\n“I was like get out of here,” said Patterson, co-founder of the BIPOC Birding Club of Wisconsin. His friend soon sent a second message confirming the birds were real.\n\n“I was like how fast can I get in my car and get to Port Washington,” he told USA TODAY. “It was a Friday and I have no classes on Friday.” The trip took about 90 minutes, he said, but it was “worth it.”\n\nIt was the state’s first documented wild flamingo sighting and the only day sightings were reported in Port Washington.\n\nThe next day, a group on a boat reported seeing five flamingos on the Wisconsin River, roughly 100 miles to the west. Because it was the same combination of three pink adults and two grey juveniles, birders think it might have been the same flock, since the birds weren’t seen again in Lake Michigan.\n\nWhat was the flamingo prank in Madison?\n\nOn Sept. 7, 1979, two leaders of a student government association placed 1,008 pink plastic flamingo lawn ornaments on the school’s Bascom Hill, according to the alumni association. The prank became an annual tradition and fundraiser. Then in 2009, the pink plastic birds were named the official bird for the city of Madison.\n\nWhere did these flamingos come from?\n\nFlamingos from breeding populations in the Caribbean have been blown into the U.S. with hurricanes before, said Jennifer McKay, a wildlife biologist in the Bird Banding Lab at the U.S. Geological Survey's Eastern Ecological Science Center.\n\nThis time there are more birds in more locations, experts told USA TODAY.\n\nThrough correspondence with the Pedro and Elena Hernández Foundation, Lorenz and others learned that most, if not all, of the flamingos likely came from the Ría Lagartos Biosphere Reserve on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. The Foundation is one of two environmental nonprofits placing identification bands on birds in the reserve, where many migratory flamingos gather for the summer breeding season.\n\nThe reserve is less than 500 miles from South Florida, said McKay, the lab's liaison with bird banding partners around the world. \"If they got a lot of oomph from a tailwind, it's an easy hop, skip and a jump.\"\n\nThree birds banded in the reserve have been reported in the U.S. over the past decade, McKay said. Since Idalia, six birds banded there have been reported, she said, five in Florida and one in North Carolina.\n\nOne of the flamingos seen in the Florida Keys, was banded as a chick in 2000, making it 23 years old, said Maria Hryniewich, a South Florida birder who talked with the bird banders in the Yucatan. The 23 years makes the flamingo the second-most long-lived wild American flamingo in the geological survey's database. The bird was seen in Florida at least seven times between Sept. 1-23.\n\nWhat’s happening to the flamingos?\n\nAt least five flamingos have died, Lorenz said. Of three that were taken to rehabilitation centers – including a flamingo attacked by a snapping turtle in Pennsylvania – only one survived. That bird, rescued off St. Petersburg Beach, recovered and was released after being fitted with a satellite transmitter under a research permit from the geological survey. Scientists say the bird may provide valuable information about the eventual destination of the Idalia flamingos.\n\nBased on recent sightings, Lorenz said it appears the flamingos may be moving southward and beginning to form larger groups. A group was seen in Charlotte Harbor, on Florida's southwest coast, he said. A group of five in Mosquito Lagoon on Florida's east coast has become a group of a dozen. And a growing flock in Everglades National Park has reached 75 birds, according to a Sept. 23 report on eBird, a voluntary bird reporting website.\n\nOnce it starts getting a little chilly, Lorenz believes the birds will all head south. \"Whether they’ll stay here or not is the question,\" he said. \"Hopefully, they’ll stay in Florida, but I suspect they'll end up going even further south.\"\n\nAre flamingos endangered?\n\nNone of the world's six species of flamingos are classified as endangered, but four are considered near threatened or vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s “red list.”\n\nThe flamingos being seen in the U.S. are American flamingos, also known as Caribbean flamingos, and the conservation union considers them a species of \"least concern.\" Their home range includes the Caribbean, parts of the southern Gulf and Southeast coasts of the United States and the northern coast of South America.\n\nThough their numbers were reduced by as much as 80% by feather hunters between 1880 and 1905, the species rebounded, according to a study Lorenz co-authored. A 2020 conservation union assessment estimated the population at 150,000-200,000.\n\nThey are protected in the U.S. by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.\n\nAre flamingos native to Florida?\n\nYes. Thousands of the birds were reported in South Florida in the late 1800s, but they were believed to be eliminated by feather hunters by the early 1900s.\n\nSightings and the numbers of birds seen in those flocks have increased in recent years, Lorenz said. For example, a flock of more than 140 birds was seen in South Florida in 2011.\n\nAlthough no nesting has been documented, there could be birds nesting in the Everglades already, Lorenz said. “We just don’t know where to look.\"\n\nAt least 3,476 square miles of protected public land is found in Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve at the tip of South Florida.\n\nSeveral scientists point out that the locations where many of the birds have been seen, including several national wildlife refuges, are a testament to land conservation and restoration programs in the U.S.\n\nBy efforts to fix the Everglades and restore the water quality in South Florida, \"we may have repaired Florida Bay to the point where it can sustain flamingos again,\" Lorenz said. \"We're hoping this pink wave will be the re-establishment of that population.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/30"}]}

The results held even after adjusting for other factors that can affect memory, such as age, sex and smoking, according to the study recently published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n“It’s exciting that our study shows making specific diet choices may lead to a slower rate of cognitive decline,” said study author Dr. Thomas Holland, an instructor in the department of internal medicine at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, in a statement.\n\n“Something as simple as eating more fruits and vegetables and drinking more tea is an easy way for people to take an active role in maintaining their brain health.”\n\nFlavonols are cytoprotective, meaning they protect cells, including neurons, so it’s plausible there could be a direct impact on cognition, said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine and nutrition who was not involved in the study.\n\nOnions contain the highest levels of quercetin, one of the most common flavonols. Adobe Stock\n\n“But they are also a marker of higher intake of fruits and vegetables — which is good for the brain because it is good for every vital organ, and the organism as a whole,” Katz said in an email.\n\n“They may also be a marker of better overall diet quality, or even greater health consciousness. People who are more health conscious may do things to preserve their cognition, or maybe being more health conscious is a by-product of better cognition.”\n\nA huge family of phytochemicals\n\nPlants contain over 5,000 flavonoid compounds, which play roles in producing cell growth, fighting environmental stress and attracting insects for pollination.\n\nFlavonols, a type of flavonoid, have been shown in animal and some human studies to reduce inflammation, a major trigger for chronic disease, and are rich sources of antioxidants. Antioxidants combat free radicals, “highly unstable molecules that are naturally formed when you exercise and when your body converts food into energy,” according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nOne of the most common flavonols, quercetin, has shown promise in reducing the onset of colorectal cancer and other cancers, according to studies. Onions contain the highest levels — lower levels can be found in broccoli, blueberries, cauliflower, curly kale, leeks, spinach and strawberries.\n\nAnother common flavonol, kaempferol, appears to inhibit the growth of cancer cells while preserving and protecting normal cells. Good sources of kaempferol are onions, asparagus and berries, but the richest plant sources are spinach, kale and other green leafy vegetables, as well as herbs such as chives, dill and tarragon.\n\nA third major player is myricetin, which has been studied in rodents for blood sugar control and the reduction of tau, a protein that causes the hallmark tangles of Alzheimer’s and other dementia. Spinach and strawberries contain high levels of myricetin, but honey, black currants, grapes and other fruits, berries, vegetables, nuts and tea are also good sources.\n\nThe last group of flavonols, isorhamnetin, may protect against cardiovascular and neurovascular disease in addition to anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory benefits. Good sources of isorhamnetin are pears, olive oil, wine and tomato sauce.\n\nYou can find a full list of the flavonoid content of various fruits and vegetables here.\n\nAn older, dementia-free population\n\nThe new study asked 961 people with an average age of 81 and no signs of dementia to fill out a food questionnaire each year for seven years. In addition, the participants underwent annual cognitive and memory tests and were quizzed on their time spent being physically and mentally active.\n\nPeople were divided into groups based on their daily intake of flavonols. The lowest intake was about 5 milligrams a day; the highest 15 milligrams a day — equal to about a cup of dark leafy greens, the study noted. (For comparison, the average flavonol intake in US adults is about 16 to 20 milligrams per day, according to the study.)\n\nThe study looked at the impact of the four major flavonols — kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin and isorhamnetin — on the rate of cognitive decline over the seven years.\n\nThe greatest impact was found with kaempferol: People who ate the highest amounts of foods with kaempferol showed a 0.4 units per decade slower rate of cognitive decline compared with those who ate the fewest, according to the study.\n\nMyricetin was next: People who ate the most foods with myricetin had a 0.3 units per decade slower rate of cognitive decline compared with the lowest consuming group. People who ate the most foods with quercetin showed a 0.2 units per decade slower rate of cognitive decline.\n\nDietary isorhamnetin had no impact, the study found.\n\nThe jury is still out\n\nDespite the apparent positives, studies on the impact of flavonols on human health have been inconclusive -— mainly because many are observational and cannot show a direct cause and effect. That applies to the Neurology study as well, according to its authors.\n\nA few randomized controlled trials — the scientific gold standard — have shown benefits associated with flavonols for controlling blood sugar in type 2 diabetes and improving cardiovascular health, according to the Linus Pauling Institute, home to the Micronutrient Information Center, an online database for nutrition information.\n\nIt’s not known whether these benefits are long term, the institute said, and no clear impact has been shown for cancer prevention or cognitive protection.\n\n“There are other bioactives that may contribute to the observed outcomes,” Katz said. “Supplemental studies are required to isolate flavonoid effects fully.”\n\nThere’s also a downside to assuming a health impact without the necessary studies to back it up, said Dr. Christopher Gardner, a research professor of medicine and director of the Nutrition Studies Research Group at Stanford University.\n\n“You can count on Americans wanting the benefits of plants but not wanting to eat them,” he said in an email.\n\n“(What) if people read the headline and rush out and buy bottled (extracted) flavonols instead of eating whole plant foods, and it turns out it wasn’t just the flavonols, but the package deal of everything in those plants (instead).”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/health/homemade-baby-food-toxic-metals-wellness/index.html", "title": "Homemade baby food contains as many toxic metals as store ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMaking baby food at home with store-bought produce isn’t going to reduce the amount of toxic heavy metals in the food your baby eats, according to a new report released exclusively to CNN.\n\n“We found no evidence to suggest that homemade baby foods made from store-bought produce are better than store-bought baby foods when it comes to heavy metal contamination,” said the paper’s coauthor Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures. An alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors, HBBF, which produced the report, has a stated mission of reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals.\n\nREAD MORE: Manufacturers allowed baby food contaminated with heavy metals to remain on shelves, lawmakers say\n\nResearchers tested 288 foods bought at stores and farmers markets across the United States – including grains, fruits, vegetables, snacks, teething foods, and family items that babies eat, such as cereals and rice cakes – for lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. Those heavy metals are among the World Health Organization’s top 10 chemicals of concern for infants and children.\n\n“Toxic metal exposure can be harmful to the developing brain. It’s been linked with problems with learning, cognition, and behavior,” according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nResearchers also pored over data from 7,000 additional food tests reported in published studies and by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nResults showed 94% of manufactured baby foods, family foods and homemade purees made from purchased raw foods contained detectable amounts of one or more heavy metals.\n\nLead was found in 90% of manufactured baby food bought by shoppers for the report and 80% of store-bought family food and homemade purees. There is no safe level of lead, according to the AAP.\n\nArsenic was found in 68% store-bought baby food and 72% of family food either purchased or prepared at home. Cadmium was found in 65% of purchased baby food and 60% of family foods, and mercury was in 7% of store-bought baby food and 10% of family foods. (The highest levels of mercury are found in seafood, which was not tested in this analysis.)\n\nREAD MORE: 95% of tested baby foods in the US contain toxic metals, report says\n\nThe new report is a follow-up to a November 2019 report in which Healthy Babies, Bright Futures tested 168 foods purchased from major baby food manufacturers. That analysis found 95% of store-bought baby food contained lead, 73% contained arsenic, 75% contained cadmium and 32% contained mercury. One-fourth of the foods tested that year contained all four heavy metals.\n\n“After that report we saw so many people saying you can get around this problem by making your own baby food at home, so we decided to check,” Houlihan said. “We suspected we’d find heavy metals in all kinds of food because they’re ubiquitous contaminants in the environment.\n\n“And that is exactly what we found – heavy metals were in foods from every section of the store,” Houlihan said. “What this says is that as the FDA is setting standards for heavy metals in baby food, they need to go beyond the baby food aisle.”\n\nWhat’s a parent or caregiver to do? Feed baby with as many different types of foods as possible, said pediatrician Dr. Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“If you spread foods out, and offer a wide variety of options, you’ll have less toxicity,” Corkins said. “And nutritionally that’s always been the right thing to do to get the most micronutrients from the food you eat.”\n\nDoes buying organic help?\n\nThe report found buying organic didn’t lower heavy metal levels either, which was “not shocking or surprising,” said Corkins, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n“It’s the soil and water that’s contaminated with arsenic and other heavy metals, so it doesn’t matter if it’s organic or traditional farming methods,” Corkins said. That would apply to locally grown crops or even backyard gardens, if the soil had not been verified to be metal-free.\n\nHowever, buying organic can help avoid other toxins the new report did not consider, such as herbicides and pesticides, said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“There are other benefits to eating organic food, including a reduction in synthetic pesticides that are known to be as bad for babies, if not even more problematic,” Trasande said.\n\nREAD MORE: Doctors should test levels of PFAS in people at high risk, report says\n\n“We’ve seen multiple studies show significant effects of synthetic pesticides on cognitive function in children as a result of prenatal exposure. We’ve seen images of the brain where certain parts are smaller that are crucial for higher order functioning after exposure,” he added. “A simple step would simply be to say eat organic because regardless of anything we’re talking about in this report, it’s good for you.”\n\nExperts agree that battling toxins in baby foods is a job for government organizations who will need to work with growers, suppliers and manufacturers to institute regulations and safeguards. In the meantime, parents can make a difference.\n\n“Making even one simple choice every day to lower a child’s exposure will make a difference, whether that’s staying away from rice-based snacks and serving a diced apple instead or choosing not to serve carrots and sweet potatoes every day,” Houlihan said.\n\n“With heavy metals and other toxins the risks add up over a lifetime,” she added. “So even if some of these foods had been served to a child up to their second birthday, starting from there to lower exposure to toxins is going to add up. Every choice matters.”\n\nLeast contaminated foods\n\nTested foods with low metal content contain one-eighth as much heavy metal contamination as foods with the highest levels, Houlihan said. These are foods that can be “eaten freely,” the report suggested.\n\nFresh bananas, with heavy metal levels of 1.8 parts per billion, were the least contaminated of foods tested for the report. That’s an “82-fold difference in average level of total heavy metals” from the most contaminated food, rice cakes, which tested at 147 parts per billion, according to the investigation.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Consider chemical hazards’ in the baby foods you sell, FDA warns manufacturers\n\nAfter bananas, the least contaminated foods were grits, manufactured baby food meats, butternut squash, lamb, apples, pork, eggs, oranges and watermelon, in that order. Other foods with lower levels of contamination included green beans, peas, cucumbers, and soft or pureed home-cooked meats, the report found.\n\nInfant formula made with lead-free tap water was recommended. Tap water that has been tested and is free of lead is always a good choice. Milk is also a good choice, but only for babies 12 months and older.\n\nSome healthy lower-metal foods, such as yogurt, unsweetened applesauce, beans, cheese, hard-boiled eggs and grapes that have been cut lengthwise, were good choices for snacks for babies, according to the report.\n\nFresh and frozen fruit – including those used in homemade purees – were options as well. But don’t use canned fruits if you can avoid it: “Tests find lead 30 times more often in canned fruit than in fresh and frozen fruit,” the report stated.\n\nParents and caregivers can also lower their baby’s exposure to heavy metals by making some smart substitutions, the report said.\n\nUsing a frozen banana for a teething baby instead of a rice-based teething biscuit or rice rusk could lower total intake of heavy metals by 95%, according to the report. Another suggested teething aid: peeled and chilled cucumber spears.\n\nAvoid or limit these foods\n\nThe most heavily contaminated foods eaten by babies were all rice-based: “Rice cakes, rice puffs, crisped rice cereals and brown rice with no cooking water removed are heavily contaminated with inorganic arsenic, which is the more toxic form of arsenic,” Houlihan said.\n\nArsenic is a natural element found in soil, water and air, and because rice is grown in water, it is especially good at absorbing inorganic arsenic. (“Inorganic” is a chemical term and has nothing to do with the method of farming.) Brown and wild rice are the worst offenders, as the bran contains the highest arsenic concentrations.\n\nREAD MORE: New FDA limits on arsenic levels in infant rice cereals don’t adequately protect children, critics say\n\nPrior research has shown that even low levels of inorganic arsenic exposure can impact a baby’s neurodevelopment. A meta-analysis of studies on the topic found a 50% increase in arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4-point decrease in the IQ of children between the ages of 5 and 15.\n\nTesting by HBBF found rice cakes were the most contaminated with inorganic arsenic, followed by crisped rice cereal, rice-based puffs and brown rice. The report recommended those foods be avoided entirely, unless the brown rice is cooked with extra water that is poured off before consumption (much like pasta). It’s best to do that with all rice, including white and wild rice, the report said, as it can reduce arsenic levels by up to 60%.\n\nRice-based teething biscuits or rusks and white rice came next on the most contaminated list, the report said. White rice is milled to remove the outer layers, but experts say arsenic levels remain high enough to be concerning, especially if rice is a daily staple.\n\n“Inorganic arsenic averaged 100 parts per billion in brown rice infant cereal and 74 parts per billion in white rice infant cereal in our tests,” Houlihan said. “Baby food companies have taken brown rice cereal off the market because of its high arsenic levels.”\n\nREAD MORE: Water- and stain-resistant products contain toxic plastics, study says. Here’s what to do\n\nParents and caregivers can help by staying away from high-arsenic varieties of white rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, or simply “US” and instead choosing lower-arsenic basmati rice from California, India and Pakistan, as well as sushi rice from the US, the report said.\n\nServe these foods rarely\n\nAfter rice-based foods, the analysis found the highest levels of heavy metals in raisins, non-rice teething crackers, granola bars with raisins and oat-ring cereals. But those were not the only foods of concern: Dried fruit, grape juice, arrowroot teething crackers and sunflower seed butter all contained high amounts of at least one toxic metal, according to the report.\n\n“Many foods have a kind of unique, heavy metal profile,” Houlihan explained. “For example, we saw very high levels of cadmium in things like spinach, leaf lettuce and peanut butter.”\n\nHowever, the human body doesn’t absorb cadmium as easily as other heavy metals, and for that reason “it doesn’t have as high a level of concern,” Houlihan added.\n\n“There’s also not as much evidence that cadmium is neurotoxic to babies, or at least the body of evidence isn’t there at the same levels as lead and arsenic,” she said. “Lead and arsenic damage isn’t reversible – these are permanent impacts on IQ, learning ability and behavior, so it’s a big deal.”\n\nRoot and tuber vegetables may have higher levels of heavy metals like lead and arsenic because they grow underground. In fact, the investigation found that nutritious baby favorites like carrots, sweet potatoes, squash and many types of potatoes did have concerning levels of heavy metals.\n\nREAD MORE: Dangerous chemicals found in food wrappers at major fast-food restaurants and grocery chains, report says\n\nEven the same food could have varying levels of toxic metals, according to the report. For example, a shopper in Raleigh, North Carolina, bought a sweet potato with 60.7 parts per billion of lead – 10 times more than the store-bought sweet potato puree she purchased. A Chicago shopper purchased a fresh carrot with eight times more arsenic than the premade carrot baby food she took home, the investigation found.\n\nYet shoppers in Tennessee and California found the opposite – their fresh produce had minimal levels of heavy metals compared with the manufactured baby food brands they bought.\n\n“As a parent, you don’t know what you’re picking up out of the produce bin,” Houlihan said. “Is it elevated because of the cultivar – the particular type of sweet potato or carrot? Or is it elevated because it’s grown in an area where the soil has naturally high levels of lead?\n\nAnswering these questions will be the responsibility of government regulators and industry, Houlihan said. The FDA has a Closer to Zero campaign, for example, which could take on the issue.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FDA for comment but hasn’t yet received a response.\n\n“And remember, if you’re protecting the basic ingredients that parents are using to make food at home, you’re not only protecting babies and toddlers, you’re protecting pregnant women as well. Babies in utero are particularly vulnerable to toxins while the brain is growing at such a rapid pace.”\n\nWith no way of knowing levels of toxic metals in the soil where produce is grown, parents and caregivers need to add one more step to their efforts to avoid these substances, Houlihan suggested. In addition to mixing up the variety of foods and not serving the same options each day, parents can “choose different brands or varieties of foods or shop in different stores from week to week to avoid choosing a high-metal source regularly.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/europe/early-humans-fordwich-england-kent-scn/index.html", "title": "Home of some of Britain's earliest humans revealed | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nHand axes unearthed from a riverbed in the county of Kent in southeast England have revealed one of the earliest known Stone Age communities in Northern Europe.\n\nWhile the stone tools were discovered in the 1920s and kept at The British Museum, a new study has dated them accurately for the first time using modern techniques – confirming that early humans lived in southern Britain between 560,000 and 620,000 years ago.\n\nResearchers used infrared-radiofluorescence (IR-RF) dating, a technique that determines the point at which certain mineral grains in rock and sand were last exposed to sunlight, thereby establishing when the items were buried.\n\n“The diversity of tools is fantastic. In the 1920s, the site produced some of earliest handaxes ever discovered in Britain. Now, for the first time, we have found rare evidence of scraping and piercing implements at this very early age,” said Alastair Key, an assistant professor in palaeolithic archaeology at the University of Cambridge, who directed the excavation of the site, in a news release.\n\nAt the time these tools were used, Britain was not an island but part of the European continent. This allowed the area’s residents – who would have lived as hunter-gatherers – to move around a much larger landscape than the current Kent coastline, which is close to the archaeological site at Fordwich where the tools were found, near Canterbury.\n\nThe tools would have been used by an ancestor of Neanderthals, known as Homo heidelbergensis, who ate a wide range of plants and animals. Most of the 330 tools unearthed so far would have been used to cut up animal carcasses. However, the scrapers and piercers that were discovered during recent digs at the site may have been used to process animals hides, possibly for clothing or shelters.\n\nThis suggests that the community was not just a pioneering group surviving at the edges of Europe but one that thrived in the area, according to the research published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.\n\nResearchers believe that European populations of Homo heidelbergensis evolved into Neanderthals, a group of early humans who lived for 350,000 years before disappearing around 40,000 years ago. A separate population of Homo heidelbergensis in Africa is thought to have evolved into Homo sapiens.\n\nShown here is an artist's reconstruction of how the hand tools may have been used by early humans. University of Cambridge\n\nEarly humans are known to have been present in Britain from as early as 840,000 – and potentially 950,000 – years ago, but these early visits were fleeting. A collection of footprints at Happisburgh in Norfolk currently represent the oldest evidence of hominins occupying Britain.\n\nCold glacial periods repeatedly drove populations out of Northern Europe, and until now there was only limited evidence of humans inhabiting Britain during the warm period between 560,000 and 620,000 years before present, the study noted.\n\nThe site in Kent had been “overlooked for over 90 years,” according to the study.\n\n“There is so much left to discover about these populations. In particular we are hoping in future excavations to find skeletal remains of the individuals who produced these stone tools as these are very rare in Britain,” said Matthew Skinner, a paleoanthropologist from the University of Kent who helped lead the excavation, in the release.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/health/dementia-ultraprocessed-food-wellness/index.html", "title": "Ultraprocessed food may contribute to dementia, study says | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style.

Besides, they are just darn tasty — who isn’t susceptible to hot dogs, sausages, burgers, french fries, sodas, cookies, cakes, candy, doughnuts and ice cream, to name just a few?\n\nIf more than 20% of your daily calorie intake is ultraprocessed foods, however, you may be raising your risk for cognitive decline, a new study found.\n\nThat amount would equal about 400 calories a day in a 2,000-calories-a-day diet. For comparison, a small order of fries and regular cheeseburger from McDonald’s contains a total of 530 calories.\n\nThe part of the brain involved in executive functioning — the ability to process information and make decisions — is especially hard hit, according to the study published Monday in JAMA Neurology.\n\nMen and women in the study who ate the most ultraprocessed foods had a 25% faster rate of executive function decline and a 28% faster rate of overall cognitive impairment compared with those who ate the least amount of overly processed food.\n\n“While this is a study of association, not designed to prove cause and effect, there are a number or elements to fortify the proposition that some acceleration in cognitive decay may be attributed to ultraprocessed foods,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine and nutrition, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“The sample size is substantial, and the follow-up extensive. While short of proof, this is robust enough that we should conclude ultraprocessed foods are probably bad for our brains.”\n\nThere was an interesting twist, however. If the quality of the overall diet was high — meaning the person also ate a lot of unprocessed, whole fruits and veggies, whole grains and healthy sources of protein — the association between ultraprocessed foods and cognitive decline disappeared, Katz said.\n\n“Ultraprocessed foods drag diet quality down, and thus their concentration in the diet is an indicator of poor diet quality in most cases,” Katz said. “Atypical as it seems, apparently some of the participants managed it. And when diet quality was high, the observed association between ultraprocessed foods and brain function abated.”\n\nUltraprocessed foods, like burgers and fries, could raise your risk for cognitive decline if it's more than 20% of your daily calorie intake, a new study found. d3sign/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nA lot of ultraprocessed foods\n\nThe study followed over 10,000 Brazilians for up to 10 years. Just over half of the study participants were women, White or college educated, while the average age was 51.\n\nCognitive testing, which included immediate and delayed word recall, word recognition and verbal fluency, was performed at the beginning and end of the study, and participants were asked about their diet.\n\n“In Brazil, ultraprocessed foods make up 25% to 30% of total calorie intake. We have McDonald’s, Burger King, and we eat a lot of chocolate and white bread. It’s not very different, unfortunately, from many other Western countries,” coauthor Dr. Claudia Suemoto, an assistant professor in the division of geriatrics at the University of São Paulo Medical School, told CNN when the study abstract was released in August.\n\n“Fifty-eight percent of the calories consumed by United States citizens, 56.8% of the calories consumed by British citizens, and 48% of the calories consumed by Canadians come from ultraprocessed foods,” Suemoto said.\n\nUltraprocessed foods are defined as “industrial formulations of food substances (oils, fats, sugars, starch, and protein isolates) that contain little or no whole foods and typically include flavorings, colorings, emulsifiers, and other cosmetic additives,” according to the study.\n\nThose in the study who ate the most ultraprocessed foods were “more likely to be younger, women, White, had higher education and income, and were more likely to have never smoked, and less likely to be current alcohol consumers,” the study found.\n\nIt’s not just the brain\n\nIn addition to the impact on cognition, ultraprocessed foods are already known to raise the risk of obesity, heart and circulation problems, diabetes, cancer and a shorter life span.\n\n“Ultraprocessed foods in general are bad for every part of us,” said Katz, president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.\n\nUltaprocessed foods are usually high in sugar, salt and fat, all of which promote inflammation throughout the body, which is “perhaps the most major threat to healthy aging in the body and brain,” said Dr. Rudy Tanzi, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and director of the genetics and aging research unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Meanwhile, since they are convenient as a quick meal, they also replace eating food that is high in plant fiber that is important for maintaining the health and balance of the trillions of bacteria in your gut microbiome,” Tanzi added, “which is particularly important for brain health and reducing risk of age-related brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nWhat to do\n\nHow can you keep this from happening to you? If you include ultraprocessed foods in your diet, try to counter these by also eating high-quality, whole foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\n\n“The conclusion suggested here is that ultraprocessed foods are, indeed, an important ‘ingredient,’ but the exposure that should be the focus of public health efforts is overall diet quality,” Katz said.\n\nOne easy way to ensure diet quality is to cook and prepare your food from scratch, Suemoto said.\n\n“We say we don’t have time, but it really doesn’t take that much time,” Suemoto said.\n\n“And it’s worth it because you’re going to protect your heart and guard your brain from dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe oldest ancestor of modern octopuses lived 328 million years ago and had 10 arms, according to a new study. Researchers have named the previously unknown species Syllipsimopodi bideni after US President Joe Biden.\n\nThe creature’s discovery pushes back the time frame when vampyropods, the group to which cephalopods like octopuses belong, appeared in the ocean by almost 82 million years.\n\nThe study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nVampyropods are known for having eight legs, an internal shell made of chitin and a soft body – the last of which doesn’t show up often in the fossil record because it tends to deteriorate more quickly than hard structures like bone.\n\nA well-preserved fossil was discovered in Montana’s Bear Gulch Limestone formation and donated to Canada’s Royal Ontario Museum in 1988. The specimen represents the earliest-known ancient relative of these creatures, a new analysis of the fossil revealed.\n\n“This is the first and only known vampyropod to possess 10 functional appendages,” said study author Christopher Whalen, a postdoctoral researcher in the American Museum of Natural History’s Division of Paleontology, in a statement.\n\nThe exceptionally well-preserved vampyropod fossil is located at the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada. S. Thurston/AMNH\n\n“All previously reported fossil vampyropods preserving the appendages only have eight arms, so this fossil is arguably the first confirmation of the idea that all cephalopods ancestrally possessed ten arms.”\n\nSyllipsimopodi is the best known fossil for understanding how vampyropods originated, as well as helping researchers to trace their evolution, said Whalen, who is also a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow in Yale University’s Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences.\n\nIt has long been thought by researchers that the vampyropods began with 10 arms and eventually lost two of them over time – and now, scientists have direct evidence.\n\nTiny but mighty\n\nThe detailed fossil clearly shows a creature about 4.7 inches (12 centimeters) long with 10 arms, with the suckers still attached – an incredibly rare find since these arms were essentially just muscle. Two of those arms seem to be longer than the other eight, and its body was shaped like a torpedo, similar to modern squid. The researchers also found remnants of its ink sac.\n\nSoft-bodied cephalopods are divided into vampyropods and decabrachians.\n\nVampyropods include octopuses and vampire squids, both of which are different from actual squid. Vampire squid basically look like octopuses with a built-in parachute because they have a membrane that stretches between and connects their arms. They also have two structures to help them feed called filaments in addition to their eight arms.\n\nMeanwhile, decabrachians include modern squids and cuttlefish, which have 10 arms, including 2 tentacles. There are a number of differences that separate cephalopods like squid and octopuses, but the number of arms is one of the most recognizable.\n\nSo why is this fossil considered to be a vampyropod, even though it has 10 arms?\n\nThe team’s phylogenetic analysis, which indicates evolutionary relationships, placed the species within the vampyropod side of the evolutionary tree, Whalen said.\n\nThe new species also had several key anatomical traits that mark it as a vampyropod, including the loss of a chambered cephalopod shell used to regulate buoyancy, called a phragmocone, which is seen in existing creatures like nautilus.\n\n“The age makes the fossil very significant – it indicates that vampyropods (and by extension decabrachians) are much older than was previously thought (at least 82 million years older),” Whalen said. “It indicates that there is a long interval of time during which fossil vampyropods must have existed but have not yet been found.”\n\nWhat’s in a name\n\nSyllipsimopodi likely used its longest pair of arms to capture prey and the rest of its shorter arms to hold small creatures and pry them from their shells. It also had fins, which probably helped it maintain stability and swim.\n\n“Syllipsimopodi may have filled a niche more similar to extant squids, a midlevel aquatic predator,” said study coauthor Neil Landman, a curator emeritus in the American Museum of Natural History’s Division of Paleontology, in a statement.\n\nThe team was surprised to discover that Syllipsimopodi had a gladius, or the tongue-shaped and semitransparent part of a cephalopod’s internal shell.\n\n“The gladius functions to provide structural support, as a rigid structure that the muscles can pull against, and as an anchor for the fins (the overall function is similar to our bones),” Whalen wrote in an email.\n\n“A gladius is considered a rather advanced feature in the grand scheme of cephalopod evolution.

It is very difficult for consumers to avoid bacterial growth in the sponges as long as the sponges are not replaced daily,” Møretrø said.\n\nThe research on the used sponges and brushes builds on a lab-based study published last year by the same team of researchers, which found that harmful bacteria survived better in sponges than in brushes.\n\nThe dish sponges were collected from households in Portugal and Norway. Trond Møretrø\n\nIn the United States, the USDA said that that microwaving or boiling kitchen sponges may reduce “some of the bacterial load,” however these measures alone are not adequate to ensure your sponge will reduce cross-contamination. It advised to buy new ones frequently.\n\nThe research was part of a European Union-backed project on food safety.\n\nSponge vs. brush\n\nThe researchers collected kitchen sponges from 20 people living in Portugal and 35 brushes and 14 sponges from people living in Norway.\n\nAn earlier survey of 9,966 people by the research team found that sponges were commonly used for cleaning in kitchens in the majority of 10 European countries, with brushes the dominant cleaning utensil for washing up in only two countries – Norway and Denmark.\n\nThe sponges were all used for washing dishes – scrubbing pots and pans, and 19 of the 20 sponges from Portugal were used five to six times a week or more often. Of the brushes collected in Norway, 32 out of 35 were used five to six times a week or more. The sponges collected in Norway were used less frequently.\n\nDish brushes are a more hygienic option for clearning dishes. Trond Møretrø\n\nNo pathogenic bacteria (that causes disease) was found in the brushes or the sponges. However, overall bacteria levels were lower in used brushes than sponges. Similar types of non-pathogenic bacteria were found in the two cleaning utensils.\n\nWhen the researchers added salmonella bacteria to the brushes and sponges, they found a significant reduction in the salmonella numbers in brushes allowed to dry overnight. But there was no reduction for brushes stored in a plastic bag or for sponges regardless of storing conditions.\n\nThe owners of the sponges and brushes shared how long they typically used their sponge or brush and how they kept their cleaning utensils clean – rinsing with water, washing with soap and water, placing them in the dishwasher or bleaching.\n\nHowever, none of these things made a tangible difference – something that surprised the researchers. The key takeaway from the study was that brushes, which dry between use, have lower numbers of bacteria.\n\n“Since the brush dries very fast, harmful bacteria will die. Also, most brushes have a handle which prevents you from direct hand contact with potential harmful bacteria, in contrast to sponges,” he said.\n\n“I encourage consumers to try a brush instead the next time they need to replace their sponge.”\n\nWhat to do\n\nWhile study authors recommended the bristles of a brush over the squish of a sponge, Cath Rees, a professor of microbiology at the University of Nottingham who wasn’t involved in the research, she said would continue using a sponge to wash dishes. For her, the key takeaway was that drying dish sponges and cloths between use was a good idea.\n\n“The main message I get is that they did not find any evidence of pathogenic bacteria on the sponges or brushes taken from a range of domestic settings and therefore there is no evidence that these items are a significant source of contamination in normal domestic settings,” Rees said.\n\n“If there were some low levels of pathogens left on your cloth, they are going to grow quite slowly (they grow optimally at body temperatures), so you would not expect to see much growth of these, and this matched their results – in wet condition there was some limited growth, in drying conditions the numbers either stayed the same or declined,” she explained.\n\nMarkus Egert, a microbiologist at Furtwangen University in Germany who has conducted similar research, said he already used brushes to wash up his dishes, which he cleaned in the dishwasher. If people preferred a sponge, Egert, who was not involved in this study, recommended using a new one every two to three weeks.\n\n“Brushes are the better choice to clean dishes, from an hygienic point of view. This might have been anticipated before, but the authors prove it with some nice experiments.

Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen most of us read the words “plant-based diet,” we tend to think of foods such as kale salads and grain bowls or trendy meat replacements. But there is one nonmeat option that’s gaining traction as the newest superfood: seaweed.\n\nSeaweed – yes, the brownish-green ribbons and bundles of oceanic plantlike matter that wash up on beaches – is in fact edible. Nori, the papery sheets used to wrap sushi rolls and as a ramen bowl garnish, is likely the most well-known and enjoyed seaweed, but these large, leafy algae come in hundreds of colorful varieties, including wakame, kombu, red dulse and sugar kelp.\n\nSeaweed helps to support other marine life and to clean the water surrounding it. When out of the water, it can bring more nutrition and minerals to our diets.\n\n“Even though we try to eat healthy, we’re relying on land-based, soil-based agriculture for the most part,” said Sarah Redmond, founder and owner of Springtide Seaweed in Gouldsboro, Maine. “Seaweed is a really interesting alternative because it provides those nutrients that are really hard to find in other land plants.”\n\nWith several companies bringing seaweed-based foods to the market, it’s getting easier than ever to taste the sea. Here’s why we all can benefit from seaweed.\n\nGood for humans and the environment\n\nFor humans, seaweed is a one-stop shop for our crucial nutrient needs. “Seaweed is an excellent source of dietary fiber and minerals,” said Mary Ellen Camire, professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Maine.\n\nThough nutritional profiles vary slightly between green, brown and red varieties, across the board seaweed contains a number of vitamins, including B, C, E and K, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, amino acids, polyphenols and 10 times more minerals than land-based plants, according to a recent study. These essential minerals include iron, calcium and iodine.\n\n“Seaweeds have this ability to concentrate all the trace minerals in the ocean that we cannot access,” Redmond said. “They are sort of this balancing food that we can return some of those trace elements back into our bodies and into our diets.”\n\nAnd when used as a fertilizer for land-based farming, seaweed can add those essential nutrients back into the soil, improving its health.\n\nSeaweed is a one-stop shop for crucial nutrient needs. Wakame seaweed also adds flavor to miso soup. Adobe Stock\n\nHowever, you don’t need to pile your plate high with seaweed because it can absorb high amounts of minerals. “Some brown kelps, such as the sugar kelp grown in New England, are very high in iodine,” Camire said. “They have so much iodine that consumers are advised to eat it no more than three times per week.”\n\nSince the concentration of specific nutrients in seaweed can interact with various medications, check with your doctor if you have a thyroid condition or take blood thinners before going all in.\n\nSeaweed is just as beneficial to water systems as it is to our personal health. Carbon capture might be the buzzword of the moment in the fight to mitigate the climate crisis, but seaweed has been doing it naturally all this time. “Seaweed pulls carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and uses it to make more carbohydrates,” Camire said. “We are not sure how much seaweed farming it would take to have a significant effect on global warming, but it helps.”\n\nSeaweed also works as a component of regenerative aquaculture by consuming nitrogen and phosphorus, two elements that can harm the ocean when found in large quantities. “Seaweed also provides a place for smaller sea creatures to hide from predators,” establishing refuge environments that can help restore diverse marine life in overfished habitats, Camire said.\n\nEven better: Seaweed requires no fertilizer or pesticides to grow in the ocean, whether it’s farmed there or harvested wild.\n\nHow to add seaweed to your everyday meals\n\nOK, now you may be convinced that seaweed is worth sampling. But there’s no need to forage for it – not that you’d want to. Make sure the seaweed products you’re getting are certified organic or tested for heavy metal content, Camire said, because “some types of seaweed are more likely to have heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and arsenic.”\n\nOther than eating lots of temaki rolls and packaged seaweed snacks or adding more nori sheets to your ramen, there are several ways to incorporate edible seaweed into your meal routine.\n\nSushi rolls are wrapped in papery sheets called nori. Here, wakame garnishes the top of sushi rolls. Adobe Stock\n\nSpringtide Seaweed air-dries kelp and mills it into powder for seasonings such as Italian kelp and Red Bay seasoning, which can be sprinkled on everything from popcorn to garlic bread. Add dried kelp ribbons to soups, stews or any dish where you’d sauté kale and other leafy greens. “We try to put seaweed in a form that’s easy for people to use and incorporate into their diet,” Redmond said.\n\nWant your kelp for breakfast? Atlantic Sea Farms, another Maine seaweed producer, incorporates kelp into frozen smoothie cubes alongside antioxidant-rich fruits such as cranberries and blueberries. If you’re feeling spicy, try some of their kelp-based kimchi. To turn up the heat, add some kelp hot sauce from Alaska’s Barnacle Foods.\n\nOr if you prefer your seaweed on the grill, Akua makes kelp burgers and ground kelp, which can be transformed into meatballs, used in tacos or anywhere else ground meat usually makes an appearance on the menu.\n\nYou can even have seaweed that satisfies a sweet tooth in the form of kelp chocolate bars (plain or with potato chips) or by making your own chocolate chip cookies that sneak powdered kelp into the mix.", "authors": ["Casey Barber"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/world/species-discovery-prehistoric-sea-turtle-scn/index.html", "title": "Prehistoric giant sea turtle newly discovered in Europe | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nLong ago, gigantic marine turtles swam the Earth’s seas. Until recently, these prehistoric giants, reaching lengths of over 3 meters (10 feet) from head to tail, had been thought to be found only in waters surrounding North America.\n\nNow, scientists have discovered a previously unknown species — the largest sea turtle found in present-day Europe ever to be identified.\n\nInitially found by a hiker who stumbled upon the remains in 2016 in the Pyrenees mountains of northern Spain, the species has been given the name Leviathanochelys aenigmatica. “Leviathan” is the biblical term for a sea monster, an allusion to the creature’s large body size, while “chelys” translates to turtle and “aenigmatica” translates to enigma — in reference to the turtle’s peculiar characteristics, wrote the authors of a paper published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nThe unusual animal’s presence in this part of the prehistoric world revealed that giant turtles were more common than previously thought, according to the study.\n\nBefore the discovery, the largest species uncovered in what’s now Europe measured at just 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length, similar to today’s leatherback sea turtles, which weigh an average of 300 to 500 kilograms (660 to 1,100 pounds) and measure 1 to 2 meters (or between 3 and 6.5 feet), according to the Smithsonian Institute.\n\nThe bone fragments of this newly identified species, however, have led scientists to estimate that Leviathanochelys had a 3.7-meter-long body (12.1 feet), almost as big as an average sedan.\n\n“We never thought it was possible to find something like this. After quite a long study of the bone fragments, we realized that there were some features that were totally different, not present in any other fossil of a turtle species discovered so far,” said Albert Sellés, coauthor of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at the Autonomous University of Barcelona’s Miquel Crusafont Catalan Institute of Paleontology in Spain.\n\nOriginally, researchers believed the bones belonged to a different kind of animal, according to Sellés.\n\n“It is quite common to find bone fragments, a lot of them. But most of them are uninformative,” Sellés said. “It is quite rare to discover something that really tells you a little bit of the life of the past.”\n\nA member of the research team at the excavation site is seen in the Pyrenees. The initial turtle remains were uncovered in 2016, but researchers returned in 2021 and found more fossil fragments. Àngel Galobart\n\nA local museum and Catalonia’s Ministry of Culture had originally collected the bone specimens, but they remained unstudied for nearly five years. When Sellés and the other researchers began their work studying the bones in 2021, they realized they were looking at a species of marine turtle completely new to science, and quickly went back to the Pyrenees site to perform more excavations.\n\nThere, more fragments of the specimen, including pieces of the turtle’s pelvis and carapace — the part of the shell that covered the creature’s back — were discovered. With these finds, the scientists observed more features not previously seen in any living or dead turtle species.\n\n“The main differences of this new fossil are related to the pelvic region. More specifically, to a couple of bony bumps present in the anterior part of the pelvis, which we suspect are related to some kind of muscle that controls the movement of the abdominal region of the turtle,” Sellés said.\n\nThis feature or muscle most likely impacted the turtles’ breathing capacity, allowing them to hold their breath longer than other turtle species, in order to swim deep in the ocean to find food or escape predators, according to Sellés.\n\nThe research team estimated the ancient animal lived during the Campanian Age of the Late Cretaceous Epoch, making it at least 72 million years old.\n\nThe largest turtle on record, called Archelon, lived some 70 million years ago and grew to be about 4.5 meters (15 feet) long. Before this recent discovery, all prehistoric giant marine turtle discoveries were part of the same lineage as Archelon.\n\nFragments of a giant turtle's pelvis and carapace are shown at the excavation site in northern Spain. Àngel Galobart\n\n“We’re proving that turtles could achieve really gigantic proportions in different times, and also in different families,” Sellés said. “For the first time, we found a (giant) turtle that doesn’t belong to this family.”\n\nThe researchers hope to return to the fossil site again to look for more bones, as they are not certain that all fragments from this specimen have been discovered, according to Sellés.", "authors": ["Taylor Nicioli"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/10/health/olive-oil-benefits-wellness/index.html", "title": "Substitute olive oil to fight major disease and early death, study says ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUsing olive oil instead of margarine, butter or other saturated fats may protect you from dying from cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory disease, dementia, and other conditions, according to a study released Monday.\n\n“It’s a combination of both decreasing the amount of saturated fat at the same time you’re increasing the monounsaturated fats found in olive oil,” said Dr. Howard LeWine, the chief medical editor of Harvard Health Publishing, part of Harvard Medical School.\n\n“The takeaway is to use olive oil every time you can as a substitute for saturated fats when you’re cooking or in your salad dressings,” said LeWine, who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study analyzed the diets of people enrolled in two large government-funded studies: the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Researchers then compared the diet findings to disease and death records for those people over time.\n\nMen and women who replaced just over 2 teaspoons (10 grams) of margarine, butter, mayonnaise or dairy fat with the same amount of olive oil had up to a 34% lower overall risk of dying than people who ate little to no olive oil, according to study author Marta Guasch-Ferre, a senior research scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\n“This is the first long-term study, including more than 90,000 participants followed for up to 30 years, conducted in the American population on olive oil and mortality. Previous studies were conducted in Mediterranean and European populations where the consumption of olive oil tends to be higher,” Guasch-Ferre said via email.\n\n“Our results provide further support for recommendations to replace saturated fat and animal fat with unsaturated plant oils, such as olive oil, for the prevention of premature death,” she added.\n\nPeople who reported eating the highest levels of olive oil had a 19% lower risk of dying from heart conditions, a 17% lower risk of dying from cancer, a 29% lower risk of dying from neurodegenerative disease, and an 18% lower risk of dying from respiratory disease mortality compared with those who never or rarely consumed olive oil in place of saturated fats, said Susanna Larsson, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, in an accompanying editorial.\n\nBoth the study and editorial were published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\n\nThe connection between olive oil and fewer deaths from brain disease was “novel,” Larsson wrote. “Considering the lack of preventive strategies for Alzheimer’s disease and the high morbidity and mortality related to this disease, this finding, if confirmed, is of great public health importance.”\n\nBeloved in the Mediterranean\n\nOlive oil was associated with a lower risk of death, study finds. Shutterstock\n\nOlive oil, or “laderá” in Greek, is a key staple in the award-winning Mediterranean diet, which studies have shown can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. The diet, which is more of an eating style than a restricted diet, has also been linked to stronger bones, a healthier heart and longer life.\n\nWhile the Mediterranean way of eating is based on traditional foods from the 21 countries that surround the Mediterranean Sea, it revolves around a fundamental theme. The focus is on simple, plant-based cooking, featuring fresh vegetables and fruits, whole grains, beans, seeds and nuts, and a heavy emphasis on extra virgin olive oil.\n\nIn Greece, the birthplace of the Mediterranean diet, olive oil is such a part of Greek life that if natives think someone is a bit crazy, they say they are “choris ládi” or “losing oil.”\n\nBut food is not the only focus of the Mediterranean approach, which recently topped the 2022 rankings for best diet for the fifth year in a row. It’s actually a lifestyle which also emphasizes movement – walking, biking, gardening – as well as mindful eating and the social benefits of dining with friends and family.\n\nHealthy behaviors\n\nAn emphasis on healthy behaviors was also found among the men and women who ate the most olive oil in the study, Guasch-Ferre said. They were more likely to be physically active or eat more fruits and vegetables than those who ate less olive oil. They were also less likely to smoke.\n\n“It is true that sometimes it may be difficult to disentangle the ‘real’ effect of olive oil versus having other healthy behaviors,” Guasch-Ferre said, adding that more studies of Americans from all backgrounds were needed to see if the results are similar.\n\nHowever, the study did adjust for a number of potential confounding factors, “including dietary factors, lifestyle factors, history of diseases as well as socioeconomic status factors and the associations were significant, even after adjusting for BMI (body mass index),” she said.\n\nThe important finding from the study, Guasch-Ferre said, is the benefit of replacing unhealthier fats such as butter and full-fat dairy and mayonnaise “by increasing olive oil for cooking, dressing and baking, similar to other Mediterranean populations.”\n\n“Of note, no scientific evidence supports the notion that eating more olive oil is associated with weight gain,” she added. “Olive oil could probably increase satiety and fullness, which may potentially reduce the consumption of unhealthy snacks.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/world/earliest-evidence-of-cooking-with-fire-scn/index.html", "title": "Humanity's earliest known cooked meal was a 6.5-foot fish | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nScientists have found the earliest known evidence of cooking at an archaeological site in Israel.\n\nThe shift from eating raw to cooked food was a dramatic turning point in human evolution, and the discovery has suggested prehistoric humans were able to deliberately make fires to cook food at least 780,000 years ago.\n\nThe detailed study of fish teeth unearthed at the Gesher Benot Ya’aqov site, situated on the edge of the ancient lake Hula, revealed that some of our early ancestors — most likely Homo erectus — were able to cook fish, said study author Dr. Irit Zohar, a researcher at Tel Aviv University’s Steinhardt Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe lakeside dwellers feasted on a large freshwater species, according to Zohar, who is also a curator of the Beit Margolin Biological Collections at Oranim Academic College.\n\nNo human remains had been found at the site, but the stone tools matched those found at Homo erectus sites across Africa, Zohar said. She said the lake would have been shallow, and it might have been easy to catch large fish like the extinct Luciobarbus longicep, which could grow up to 6.5 feet (2 meters), by hand.\n\n“This is an incredibly important discovery,” said archaeological geochemist Dr. Bethan Linscott, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\n“Evidence for the controlled use of fire in the (early Stone Age) … is ephemeral at best, and as such, the evidence of anthropogenically (because of human activity) accumulated and cooked fish remains described here will undoubtedly have a wide impact on the research community,” said Linscott, who is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe shift to eating cooked meals meant humans expended less energy on the intensive work of searching for and digesting fresh, raw food, freeing up more time in which to develop new social and behavioral systems.\n\n“Diet has had a big impact on the evolution of our species. It has been suggested that the consumption of meat in particular contributed to the increase in relative brain size of our early Homo ancestors — but pathogenic bacteria make the consumption of uncooked meat a risky business,” Linscott said.\n\n“Cooking, however, kills bacteria and increases the energetic value of meat — thereby creating a new, reliable food source for early hominins. Understanding when this happened is therefore a topic of great interest, because it might help to explain why our hominin ancestors evolved the way that they did.”\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution on Monday.\n\nThe Israeli research team includes: (from left) Dr. Irit Zohar, Dr. Marion Prévost, Professor Naama Goren-Inbar, Dr. Guy Sisma-Ventura, Professor Nira Alperson-Afil, Professor Israel Hershkovitz. Tel Aviv University\n\nDoes burning equal cooking?\n\nPrevious research by Zohar, who has worked at the site for 16 years, had found that the layers of sediment where stone tools were found — suggesting human occupation — were associated with a high number of fish teeth from two particular species (Luciobarbus longiceps and Carasobarbus canis) that were part of the carp family but now extinct.\n\nThere were, however, very few fish bones, which unlike teeth soften under high temperatures and easily decay. Other work by study coauthor Nira Alperson-Afil, professor in the department of Israel studies and archaeology at Bar-Ilan University, had identified traces of hearths — some of the earliest outside Africa.\n\nTo determine whether the prehistoric inhabitants of the site actually cooked fish there and didn’t just discard fish remains in a fire, the researchers identified changes in the size of tooth enamel crystals, which respond differently to changes in temperature.\n\nIn the experiments, Zohar and collaborator Dr. Jens Najorka, who is X-ray lab manager at the Natural History Museum in London, analyzed 56 teeth belonging to prehistoric and freshwater fish that allowed them to identify the changes caused by cooking at low versus high temperatures. The results suggested the fish were cooked at temperatures between 392 and 932 degrees Fahrenheit (200 and 500 degrees Celsius).\n\nA 3D reconstruction of the skull from the fish species Luciobarbus longiceps shows the location of the teeth. Tel Aviv University\n\n“We do not know exactly how the fish were cooked but given the lack of evidence of exposure to high temperatures, it is clear that they were not cooked directly in fire and were not thrown into a fire as waste or as material for burning,” Najorka said in a news release.\n\nThe team was also able to determine that fish were a regular part of the diet — they weren’t just a seasonal treat or a last resort when other sources of food were scarce. The researchers did this by looking at the geochemical composition of oxygen and carbon isotopes in the enamel of the teeth to figure out during which season the fish died. The results suggested that they were cooked and eaten year round.\n\nEarly migration\n\nHomo erectus was the first hominin to migrate outside Africa, and the research suggested ancient Lake Hula might have been a key staging post on the route of these early migrations.\n\nExactly when humans first began cooking fish — or any other type of food — is unknown, and there’s no consensus on when ancient hominins first developed the ability to start fires and cook. Until this study, the earliest hard evidence of the use of fire to cook was by Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, who cooked starchy roots in what’s now South Africa about 170,000 years ago.\n\nThe cumulative weight of the evidence put forward in the study suggested the fish was cooked, said John McNabb, a professor at the Centre for the Archaeology of Human Origins at the University of Southampton’s department of archaeology. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“When and where deliberately set and controlled fire first appeared, and when we began to cook our food, are two of the really big questions that researchers into human origins have long sought answers for,” he said via email.\n\n“Fire is not just about safety and protection. It prolongs the working day and provides a really important mechanism for social bonding — we literally built our societies around our fires. Cooking opens up new dietary opportunities and brings new food stuffs on-line, as well as increasing the nutritious potential of what we eat. Was cooking the reason Homo erectus was able to move into strange new territories.”", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}]}

Still, most subscribers (63 percent) said they would stick with the service.\n\nMost Netflix subscribers (61 percent) had heard about the price increases, the survey found. Two-thirds (65 percent) said they would consider a lower-priced or free version of Netflix with advertisements.\n\n“In the past, many Netflix users were adamant they would never tolerate ads on the streaming service,\" the site's founder and editor-in-chief Chris Brantner said in the survey results. \"However, the latest round of price increases has most subscribers reconsidering.\"\n\nPrice is even more important than content, digital content provider Limelight Networks found in its State of Online Video report, based on a survey of 5,000 consumers worldwide. Sixty-two percent of U.S. consumers said price is the top reason they would cancel a streaming service, while 21 percent said sub-par content would be the main reason for cancelling.\n\n“To remain competitive in an increasingly crowded streaming market, Netflix needs to keep their current subscribers while winning over new paying viewers,” said Limelight senior director Mike Milligan. “However, their new price hike may not be the best strategy, as consumers are more price conscious than ever.\"\n\nNew subscribers are more likely to be influenced by the price increases than current ones, says Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. That's because Netflix's future growth will come from median income and below median income households, he said in a note to investors Wednesday.\n\n“We do not expect significant churn given the utility provided by the service to existing subscribers, but attracting new subscribers will likely be more challenging because of the higher prices,\" he wrote.\n\nWith a wave of new streaming services in the works from Disney, AT&T's WarnerMedia, and NBCUniversal, it's likely Netflix competitors are taking note of how subscribers respond.\n\nNetflix announces its fourth-quarter subscriber additions Thursday after the stock market closes.\n\n\"Netflix is the most highly valued (Streaming Video on Demand) service and enjoys the most loyal subscribers,\" Greeson said. \"As such, if it encounters resistance at these pricing levels, undoubtedly others will, as well.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/10/16/netflix-continues-earnings-roll-5-3-m-new-subscribers-stock-hits-record/768391001/", "title": "Netflix adds 5.3 million subscribers, stock hits record", "text": "Netflix continues to grow faster than predictions, powered by hit series such as Orange is the New Black and House of Cards.\n\nThe online-delivered television provider, based in Los Gatos, Calif., added 5.3 million new subscribers from July to September — 850,000 million in the U.S. and 4.45 million internationally. That brings Netflix's total subscriber base to 109.25 million.\n\nOf those, 104 million are paying customers and the rest are viewers with trial subscriptions.\n\nNetflix had forecast third-quarter additions of 4.4 million new subscribers, with 3.65 million coming from international markets. But the streaming service provider \"continued to benefit from strong appetite for our original series and films, as well as the adoption of internet entertainment across the world,\" CEO Reed Hastings said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nWhile net income of $129.6 million fell short of the $143 million analysts had estimated, revenue came in at $2.99 billion, surpassing expectations by $20 million. Netflix (NFLX) shares Monday rose 3% to a $202.68, a record, and shares rose more than 2% in aftermarket trading.\n\nWith the boost in popularity, the company has been able to raise prices. Two weeks ago, Netflix announced it would raise its prices, increasing the cost of its most popular plan (two screens, HD video) by $1 to $10.99 monthly and the $11.99 premium plan (four screens and 4K video) to $13.99.\n\nCurrent subscribers will begin seeing the monthly price increase this week, while new subscribers began paying it two weeks ago. \"Existing members will be notified and their prices will be adjusted on a rolling basis over the next few months,\" Hastings said. \"Increased revenue over time will help us grow our content offering and continue our global operating margin growth.\"\n\nNetflix shows no signs of slowing its drive to create new content to keep subscribers on board. Two months ago, Netflix signed Scandal and Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes to a multiyear production deal. And the streaming provider signed filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo) for a western anthology called The Ballad of Buster Scruggs to debut in 2018 and acquired comic book publisher Millarworld, home of franchises such as Kingsman and Kick-Ass.\n\nThat was Netflix's first-ever acquisition but may not be its last, the company's chief content officer Ted Sarandos said. \"Obviously we are looking at a lot of things and when there can be these kind of efficiencies meaning that much creativity under one roof, we’ll definitely want to explore that,\" Sarandos said in a video interview after the company's earnings were released.\n\nAfter spending about $6 billion on content this year, Netflix plans to spend $7 billion to $8 billion in 2018.\n\n\"We’re very pleased with our progress in transforming Netflix from a service with not just second run content but also must-see releases,\" Hastings said. Programming includes not only Orange is the New Black and House of Cards, but Stranger Things, Fuller House, Making a Murderer, Narcos, The Crown and 13 Reasons Why.\n\nLast year, Netflix added 3.6 million during the third quarter, compared to 1.7 million and 7.1 million in the second and fourth quarters, respectively. Netflix's growth rate so far this year is up 29% over last year, Hastings says.\n\nThis successful third-quarter subscriber boost follows Netflix's record second-quarter growth from the April to June period, during which it added 5.2 million new subscribers, more than 1 million of them in the U.S.\n\nNetflix expects to add 6.3 million more subscribers by the end of the year, slightly down from the 7.05 million added during the fourth quarter last year — the most in a quarter so far. \"The year-over-year growth in (subscriber) adds is remarkable,\" said Rich Greenfield, a media and technology analyst for BTIG Research.\n\nNetflix's recent success \"portends continued momentum,\" CFRA Research analyst Tuna Amobi said in a note to investors Monday.

More importantly, its streaming business has been costly. It lost $1.5 billion in the quarter, compared to a loss of $630 million in last year’s fourth quarter.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was $20.1 billion, up 9% from last year. Analysts, however, were expecting over $21 billion. Profit was $162 million, which was up 1% compared to last year.\n\nThe results sent Disney’s stock down roughly 10% in after-hours trading.\n\n“The rapid growth of Disney+ in just three years since launch is a direct result of our strategic decision to invest heavily in creating incredible content and rolling out the service internationally,” Bob Chapek, Disney’s CEO, said in a letter to investors on Tuesday. “We expect our [direct to consumer] operating losses to narrow going forward.”\n\nChapek added that the streaming unit will still “achieve profitability in fiscal 2024.” However, he added an important note of caution to that promise by saying “assuming we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate.”\n\n“By realigning our costs and realizing the benefits of price increases and our Disney+ ad-supported tier coming December 8, we believe we will be on the path to achieve a profitable streaming business that will drive continued growth and generate shareholder value long into the future,” he said.\n\nDisney’s earnings come at an inflection point for how investors measure success in the streaming world.\n\nFor many years, Wall Street’s focus was on how much and how quickly a streaming service could grow. That’s changed this year as services like Netflix received more scrutiny when it comes to profitability.\n\nDisney appears to be under the same microscope.\n\nGrowth in its streaming unit was solid this quarter, with the company totaling more than 235 million subscribers across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Even so, its stock sank on Tuesday evening due to the extent of those losses.\n\nUltimately, the costs associated with Disney’s streaming endeavors were behind the company’s decision to increase its prices earlier this year. It’s also introducing a new ad-supported subscription tier to offset those losses.\n\nThe Disney+ premium tier, which comes without commercials, jumped by $3 to $10.99 per month, the company announced in August. That’s the largest price increase for the platform since its November 2019 debut.\n\nIts new ad plan will debut in the United States on December 8 at a cost of $7.99 a month. That price point is what consumers were paying for Disney+ without the ads.\n\nElsewhere in Disney’s media kingdom, the company’s parks, experiences and products division reported revenue of $7.4 billion — a 36% boost from last year.\n\nThat’s impressive considering that coronavirus restrictions have hit Shanghai Disneyland and Disney World in Florida briefly closed due to Hurricane Ian in September.\n\nWhen it comes to its movies, Disney has a lot to look forward to at the box office.

(The 2020 charge had been $49.99 monthly.)\n\nIt's still cheaper than most cable packages, which top $100 monthly, and YouTube, which boasts of over 2 million subscribers, has an advantage in no additional equipment and hidden fees, which cable is notorious for. But the price hike was such a cable-like move that many consumers cried foul. YouTube justified the decision by announcing new channels to the lineup, including MTV and Comedy Central. Many consumers said they didn't want the new channels – just leave the pricing as is, please.\n\n$$$$$:Cutting the cord: What now, after YouTube TV's price increase?\n\nPhotography:Google Photos app gets refresh look, new features\n\nEnter Sling TV. While YouTube TV is now the most expensive offering for streaming cable and local channels, Sling is far and away the cheapest, starting at $30 monthly. And Sling went out of its way this week to let those furious YouTube customers know that there will be no price hikes from Sling, through at least August 2021. (If you sign up for service by Aug. 1, 2020.)\n\nSo we decided to dive in and take a good look, again, at Sling, as a savings of $35 monthly is a lot of money, nearly $400 yearly. How much are you missing out by not having YouTube TV? How's the interface? How's the lineup?\n\nShort answer: Sling TV isn't as good as YouTube. But it does the job. I cut the cord for a reason. Not just to save money, but because I didn't want to pay through the nose to get channels I never watched. And the streaming experience was better.\n\nStart watching on the TV, finish on the phone, tablet or computer. A less cumbersome DVR that's a one-click setup. And since YouTube is owned by Google and has followed my every move, it knows my tastes and could make some good recommendations.\n\nNeed WiFi? Park in front of the library\n\nBut you know what? For that extra $35 extra a month, I don't need Google's recommendations. I can figure out what to watch, thanks.\n\nSling's lineup isn't as robust as YouTube's, with 50 channels to the 90 from YouTube. If you're a sports fan, there are way more regional sporting networks you may crave on YouTube.\n\nSling does have some sports as well, along with ESPN, but you have to be careful when you order. There's the \"Blue\" package, which I signed up for, and doesn't have the ESPN channels. For them, you'll need the \"Orange\" package. Both are $30 separately or $45 for the combo.\n\nLike YouTube, Sling lets you sort the channels to only display your favorites, use a program guide to find stuff to watch, or just watch the shows you've recorded. (I paid an extra $5 for the DVR service.) The TV interface, which I watched via Apple TV's streaming box, is interchangeable with the mobile app or viewing on your computer.\n\nSling's program guide is superior to YouTube's in that it can show you the lineup for seven days at a glance, while YouTube's is only day and date. YouTube says it's updated the guide to 7 days at a glance, but in our tests this week, nothing has changed.\n\nSling is at a major disadvantage over both YouTube and rivals Hulu with Live TV and AT&T Now (both $55 monthly) in offering local channels and networks. In Los Angeles, where I live, I was able to pick up the local NBC and Fox stations, but Sling says they're not available in every market.\n\n(Philo, another streaming option, is actually the lowest priced of all, at $20 monthly, boasting of 60 entertainment channels, but is missing many networks, including sports, news and local TV.)\n\nTo those of you who would miss having CBS, NBC, Fox and ABC in your lineup, Sling recommends just connecting an antenna. That could work, but you might have some reception issues.\n\nI've got another solution.\n\nCBS All-Access has the complete CBS lineup and costs $5.99 monthly. NBC's new streamer, Peacock, launching July 15th, will have much of the NBC lineup, but if shows are missing, you can sign up for a premium version at $4.99 monthly. And for your ABC and Fox fix, the stand-alone Hulu streaming service has those shows (along with NBC's) for $5.99 monthly. Total cost: $48 and if you'd like to add cloud DVR (and you will) another $5 will get you to $53.\n\nThat's $12 less monthly than YouTube TV or a savings of $144 yearly.\n\nIt's a more complicated way to go about it, but it's one option.\n\nThe better one, of course, is to vote with your wallet and cancel YouTube TV. If we don't fight back against the price increases, and this nasty TV habit of throwing all these channels at us that we don't want, prices will only keep up going more.\n\nIn making the announcement, YouTube actually made it easy for fans to show their disgust for the move, by including the link to cancel or pause the subscription.\n\nAre you with me TV fans?\n\nIn other tech news this week\n\nFacebook. Over 700 brands, including Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Unilever, joined the bandwagon to pause their advertising on Facebook, in protest over the social network's stance regarding hate speech. The #StopHateforProfit campaign – launched June 17 by civil rights groups including the NAACP, Color of Change and the Anti-Defamation League – comes as corporate America grapples with racial inequality following the death of George Floyd while in police custody. Meanwhile, have Facebook fatigue? We offered some alternatives choices in a recent column, including MeWe, Cake and that old standby, LinkedIn.\n\nSocial networks got more proactive about trying to curb hate speech. Amazon-owned Twitch suspended the official Donald Trump channel – launched in October 2019 – for violating its rules against hate speech, while website Reddit banned a group devoted to Trump. Meanwhile, Facebook has removed a network of accounts, groups and pages on Facebook and Instagram connected to the “boogaloo” anti-government movement that encourages violence in the United States and YouTube said it banned six channels for violating its policies, including those of white supremacists David Duke and Richard Spencer.\n\nApple closed down 28% of its retail stores in response to the pandemic. By late in the week, some 77 stores that had reopened are now temporarily closed again. Other stores throughout the country are only open for pickup of online orders and by appointment for \"in-store Genius Support.\" The new temporary closures include 15 in California, another 10 in Texas, five of Georgia's six locations, four of Nevada's five stores and two more in Florida.\n\nThis week's Talking Tech podcasts\n\nMeet the new no. 1 app: Trivia Royale\n\nMeet MeWe, the \"anti\" Facebook\n\nI weigh in: my favorite of the Facebook alternatives\n\nYouTube's 30% price hike\n\nFollow me on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, where I'm @jeffersongraham", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2022/07/19/why-did-netflix-lose-subscribers-and-what-does-mean-you/7531540001/", "title": "Netflix lost a million more subscribers, plans cheaper version with ...", "text": "Netflix lost subscribers this year for the first time since 2011\n\nAds are coming to Netflix in early 2023\n\nThe number of shows and movies Netflix produces each year could fall\n\nIt turns out that not everyone is watching Netflix.\n\nThe world's largest streamer lost 970,000 subscribers in the three months ending June 30, the company announced Tuesday in its second-quarter earnings report, ahead of its dire prediction in April of losing 2 million.\n\nIt's been a bad few months, businesswise, for the streaming service, which has upended the TV and film industries since it began debuting original programming almost 10 years ago. After its stock price plunged 71% since November, the past year, the company is testing charges for password sharing in Latin America and plans a cheaper version of the service with ads – a major reversal. Employee layoffs have made the news even as competitors from HBO Max to Disney+ and Hulu have made gains.\n\nSo what is happening at Netflix? And more importantly, will it change what you get to watch when you chill on a Saturday night?\n\nWe spoke to experts in the entertainment industry about what's going on at Netflix, and what might happen next. It might be as wild a ride as any Netflix original series.\n\nWhat happened at Netflix?\n\nIn an April earnings call, the streamer announced that it had lost 200,000 subscribers, marking its first decline since 2011. It then predicted a loss of 2 million subscribers in the three months ending June 30. The news and the prediction panicked Wall Street and reverberated through Hollywood, damaging the company's reputation and prompting layoffs. And changing priorities might alter what shows and movies get made, how long they last, and if subscribers can afford Netflix without the interruption of commercials.\n\nProduction of new TV shows and movies takes some time, so \"any moves Netflix makes today won't be felt for another two years, or possibly more when it comes to the consumer,\" says Tom Nunan, a former network and studio president who now teaches at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nThe second-quarter subscriber loss beat the company's own expectations – and Netflix is forecasting a gain in the next three months – so all may not look so terrible for the streamer, for now. Analysts say the release of \"Stranger Things\" Season 4 in two parts, which Netflix claims is its most-streamed English language series, may have helped stem more pronounced losses this quarter.\n\nSo why did Netflix lose subscribers?\n\nThe subscriber loss \"seems to be due to increased competition from other streaming services, adverse global economic circumstances, and the fact that the company already has a very high level of subscribers,\" says Ferran G. Vilaró, CEO of streaming video analytics company NPAW. Netflix has 220.6 million subscribers worldwide, dwarfing the 74 million total for HBO Max and 87.6 million for Disney+, which are available in fewer countries.\n\nAt some point. there may be a ceiling on how many people want to subscribe to a streaming service.\n\n\"The scale of such ambition is impressive, but it turns out it's unsustainable,\" says Nunan, who cites the easing of pandemic restrictions as one of the reasons some might ditch the ’flix. Consumers are \"looking closely at their streaming bills and asking, 'Do I really need all of this content, and more importantly, can I afford it?'\"\n\nWhen will Netflix get ads? What will they look like?\n\nA lower-priced, ad-supported tier of Netflix subscriptions is on the way, due in early 2023, Netflix said Tuesday. The service didn't really explain what those ads would look like, and in what markets they'd appear first. \"Like most of our new initiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering. So, our advertising business in a few years will likely look quite different than what it looks like on day one.\"\n\nThere are similar plans already available from HBO Max, Hulu and Peacock (which also offers a free ad-supported tier), and soon Disney+ will join their ranks. It's just a matter of how long it takes Netflix, which last week agreed to partner with Microsoft for help, to get it up and running.\n\nThe price has not yet been announced (the most basic current ad-free monthly subscription costs $9.99, but the standard tier is $16.49) and it's not clear how the ads will fit into the programming. Will they be jammed into the middle of episodes never designed with a natural break for them, like those for network series are? \"The elegance (of TV commercials) comes when they think about how many ads to place, where to place them and at what pace,\" Nunan says.\n\nNetflix's ads could also be very specifically tailored for its subscribers.\n\n\"The industry is increasingly moving toward highly targeted and personalized ads that are able to maximize the value for advertisers,\" says Vilaró. \"Netflix certainly has the data capabilities needed to implement these types of ads, but that doesn’t mean it would necessarily do so.\"\n\nWill Netflix make fewer shows and movies?\n\nThe sheer churn of new content on the streamer will probably slow down, experts say.\n\n\"Netflix has taken an expensive and extremely high-risk approach to streaming which seems to be: Let's outspend everyone and be all things to all streaming consumers. The scale of such ambition is impressive, but it turns out it's unsustainable. They are learning to become more strategic,\" Nunan says.\n\nThere's a new mandate for \"Bigger, better, fewer\" movies at Netflix, the Hollywood Reporter says, suggesting the streamer will seek more tentpole, A-list fare like \"Red Notice,\" and fewer \"vanity projects\" such as Martin Scorsese's \"The Irishman.\" Netflix's latest high-profile film, \"The Gray Man\" (in theaters, streaming on Netflix on Friday) starring Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans, is an example of one of these bigger films, reportedly costing $200 million.\n\n\"Netflix at this point is caught between a clear push to become more populist and broad-ranging and the fact that what's drawing people to other streamers is their strong connection to franchises,\" says Myles McNutt, an associate professor of communications at Old Dominion University.\n\nAlready, production budgets for upcoming Netflix series are being squeezed, according to a studio executive, except for the biggest titles like \"Stranger,\" which cost more than $25 million an episode for its newest season, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nWill Netflix still save shows like 'Manifest'? Will my favorite show last longer than three seasons?\n\nThe business of \"saving\" shows canceled elsewhere, as Netflix did for NBC's \"Manifest\" and Fox's \"Lucifer,\" among others, seems to have moved to the free streamers: Roku nabbed a follow-up film to NBC's canceled \"Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist\" in 2021, and Amazon's Freevee picked up Season 2 of Showtime's \"American Rust,\" starring Jeff Daniels. Those streamers are jockeying for a place at the table, and name-brand series are helping them get there.\n\n\"Netflix picked up 'Manifest' because it has data that proves the show has enough avid audience members to make the renewal a good business investment,\" says Nunan. These renewals on new networks or streamers are \"always because the new 'show parent' believes in the property and has data to back up their beliefs. It's always a business decision, never an emotional 'saving' decision.\"\n\nNetflix has earned itself a reputation for canceling series after just two or three seasons, a result of a business model focused on luring new subscribers with new content.\n\n\"Longer-running shows tend to cultivate a loyal, more invested audience and build deeper relationships between the platform and its subscribers. But they can also be more expensive,\" says Vilaró, referring to the increase in salaries for actors and creatives as a series ages. Series that aren't major tentpoles like \"Bridgerton\" or \"Stranger Things\" will last for multiple seasons only if they continue winning or retaining subscribers.\n\nWhat else might change at Netflix?\n\nIt's a tough time in the economy, and Hollywood isn't immune. Netflix might make big changes as the ripple effects continue to be felt. Streaming TV is starting to look more like basic cable, as bundles emerge (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+), ads become more prevalent and shows are increasingly released weekly instead of all at once.\n\n\"The most important lesson of our current moment is that Netflix's disruption was temporary: one by one, its qualities that shaped every streaming service after them – binge releases, no advertisements – are being undone,\" McNutt says. \"The future of television will, despite what might have seemed true five years ago, look closer to television's past than we might have imagined.\"\n\nContributing: Brett Molina, Gary Levin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/10/12/upcoming-earnings-netflix-subscriber-growth-could-surpass-own-forecasts/73746470/", "title": "In upcoming earnings, Netflix subscriber growth could surpass own ...", "text": "Mike Snider\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNetflix's $1 price increase to its monthly subscription is unlikely to be even a speed bump on the streaming video leader's road to continued growth.\n\nLast week, when Netflix upped the monthly price for basic service — two simultaneous high-def content streams — to $9.99 for new subscribers, there was little clamor from customers. In part, because current customers will continue to pay $8.99 monthly for one year before the rate hike kicks in.\n\nBut, in general, the service is a good value, say analysts, heading into the Netflix's third quarter earnings announcement, which is scheduled to be released after the market closes Wednesday. \"Netflix is increasingly becoming an always-on service,\" wrote Stifel Financial Corp. analysts n a note after the price increase Thursday.\n\nThe price increase, they said, \"is being done from a position of strength.

Stifel forecasts growth of 3.68 million, an additional 130,000 or so more than Netflix's predictions. In its post-rate hike report, Wedbush Equity Research analysts forecast growth of 1.25 million U.S. subscribers and 2.5 million international subs, and another 2 million U.S. and 2.5 million international subscribers over the last three months of the year.\n\nWedbush also expects Netflix to beat expectations by posting Q3 revenue of $1.77 billion and earnings per share of 7 cents — the consensus is $1.75 billion and earnings of 8 cents, while Netflix had forecast 7 cents.\n\nNetflix's own forecast for expected subscriber growth for the fourth quarter can drive shares up on Thursday, says BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Salmon. \"Netflix is set to benefit from growth in the overall internet TV industry, particularly as broadband penetration increases globally, much the same way that cable networks benefited from the growth of cable systems in the (Eighties and Nineties),\" he wrote in a report last week initiating coverage of the company.\n\nGiving the stock a market perform rating and a $115 target, Salmon said, \"all in all, we view Netflix as a highly dynamic company and an innovation leader in our coverage universe.\"\n\nNetflix (NFLX) shares were up slightly Monday — 0.2% to $113.58 — after closing Friday at $113.33, up 6% for the week and 14% over the last month.\n\nStifel's analysts expect shares to rise, advising to buy the stock with a $143 target price. \"Combined with growing global momentum in the Netflix brand and international growth, we believe Netflix will be able to post strong subscriber growth as the company heads into its seasonally strong 4Q,\" they said.\n\nBut Wedbush isn't as bullish with its target price of $40 and underperform rating. The price increase, the Wedbush analysts say \"increasing content costs rather than pricing power, and expect most, if not all, of the incremental revenue to be absorbed by spending. ... This is the second price increase in 18 months, and we expect another within two years as the expensive Disney deal commences in January. The $1 increase is unlikely to trigger significant customer attrition, but it is insufficient to take Netflix to the high level of future profitability that its valuation implies.\"\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/01/15/netflix-raising-prices-all-its-plans/2578957002/", "title": "Netflix is raising the prices of all of its plans", "text": "‪Your Netflix subscription is about to get pricier. ‬\n\n‪The popular streaming service announced that it will raise prices across its U.S. plans for new subscribers on Tuesday, and for existing users over the next three months. ‬\n\n‪Netflix’s most popular plan, previously $10.99 a month for two HD streams, will rise to $12.99.

Hulu offers two plans, a $7.99 per month option that has ads and an $11.99 per month plan that is commercial-free (Netflix, Amazon and HBO are all ad-free).\n\nNetflix stock jumped on the news, rising over six percent in early trading to $353.18.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/08/11/disney-plus-hulu-price-hike/10295197002/", "title": "Streaming costs: Disney Plus without ads will rise $3 to $10.99, Hulu ...", "text": "It will soon cost more to stream Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company announced plans to raise prices on both streaming services as it rolls out an ad-supported version of Disney+ this December.\n\nSubscribers to the current Disney+ plan without ads will see the biggest increase, with prices rising $3 from $7.99 a month to $10.99 a month.

Netflix, which has long pushed against running ads, said it was exploring an ad-supported tier for a lower price during a quarterly earnings call in April.\n\nMeanwhile, the price for streaming content continues to climb.

Current subscribers are starting to see their monthly bill reflect that increase now.\n\nThe price increase is a sign that Disney is comfortable with its growth pace.

Rite Aid even said in a Sunday statement that it has raised $3.45 billion in financing from lenders as it continues to operate its stores while in bankruptcy.\n\nWhen the company last filed a financial report in June, it had $3.3 billion in debt, compared to the $135.5 million in cash it had on hand.\n\nIn the statement about Chapter 11 filing, Rite Aid laid out a restructuring plan that includes closing underperforming stores.\n\nUAW Strikes:How does autoworker union pay compare to other hourly jobs?\n\nWhat do we know about store closures?\n\nFounded in 1962, Philadelphia-based Rite Aid is one of the largest pharmacy chains in the nation with more than 2,000 stores in 17 states.\n\nMost customers won’t have to worry about the bankruptcy filing disrupting their ability to shop or fill prescriptions at their local stores — unless, of course, that store is now slated to close. Rite Aid, which has closed several stores in recent months, said in its media release that it's preparing to close more.\n\n\"Rite Aid regularly evaluates its store portfolio to ensure it is operating efficiently while meeting the needs of its customers, communities and associates,\" the company said in a statement. \"These efforts will further reduce the company’s rent expense and are expected to strengthen its overall financial performance.\"\n\nJoy Errico, a spokesperson for Rite Aid, declined to release further information about how many stores were slated to close or what the timeline for closures would be when reached Monday morning by USA TODAY.\n\nRite Aid said in the statement that it will communicate with customers of stores that will be closing and ensure they are able to get access to the services they need at other nearby locations. Employees at closing stores will also be transferred \"where possible,\" Rite Aid said.\n\nWhat other plans does Rite Aid have?\n\nRite Aid plans to use the bankruptcy to resolve its legal disputes and also sell some of its businesses, including prescription benefit manager Elixir Solutions that it bought in 2015 for $2 billion.\n\nAs part of the bankruptcy plan, Rite Aid appointed on Sunday a new CEO to lead restructuring, Jeff Stein, who will also serve as a member of its board. Elizabeth Burr had been serving as interim CEO since January and will remain on the company’s board, Rite Aid said.\n\nStein, the founder of financial advisory firm Stein Advisors, said in a statement the company plans to remain in business for the long term.\n\n“My priorities will include overseeing the actions now underway to strengthen the company’s financial position and further advance its journey to reach its full potential as a modern neighborhood pharmacy,” Stein said in the statement. “I have tremendous confidence in this business and the turnaround strategy that has been developed in recent months.”\n\nInflation:How inflation is reshaping what employees need from their benefits\n\nWhy is Rite Aid facing opioid lawsuits?\n\nRite Aid's legal troubles related to its alleged role in the nationwide deadly abuse of opioids only further contributed to its mounting debt.\n\nThe many lawsuits filed against Rite Aid accuse the company of knowingly filling prescriptions for the addictive painkillers that did not meet legal requirements. In March, the Justice Department filed a complaint against Rite Aid asserting that it violated the Controlled Substances Act by filling prescriptions for excessive quantities of prescription pain killers that had “obvious red flags.”\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the rise in U.S. opioid overdose deaths can be tied to the uptick in opioid prescriptions starting in the 1990s. Drug overdose deaths from prescription opioids jumped from 3,442 in 1999 to 16,706 in 2021, according to data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nContributing: Bailey Schulz\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

A sign in the window at the Pathmark states the pharmacy there will transfer prescription files to a Rite Aid on East Basin Road on Nov. 8.\n\nAll three stores have posted signs about prices being slashed from 40 to 50 percent, along with printed notices about the hours of operation now running from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n\n“I don’t like it at all,” said Larry Quinn, who lives about 2 miles from the Pathmark.\n\n“I like the convenience of the store being so close and come here often for odds and ends,” he said. “I guess those quick little runs are going to be over.”\n\nManagers at all three stores referred questions to A&P’s corporate office, which directed inquires to the New York public relations firm Sard Verbinnen & Co.\n\nA spokesman for Sard Verbinnen declined to comment.\n\nThe impending closure of three grocery stores follows the recent shut down of two other A&P-owned supermarkets in New Castle County.\n\nA Pathmark at 3901 Lancaster Pike near Wilmington and a Superfresh at 2105 Philadelphia Pike in Claymont were among 25 stores that A&P shuttered within weeks of its bankruptcy filing, due to a “lack of interest and significant ongoing store operating losses.”\n\nFord recalls 129,000 SUVs to fix fuel leaks\n\nA&P has since sold off 120 of its 300 supermarkets and other stores to three grocery chains for nearly $600 million.\n\nAcme Markets Inc. acquired 71 of those locations, including four in Delaware. Those stores include a Milltown Pathmark at Kirkwood Plaza off Kirkwood Highway (Del. 2) near Milltown, a Brandywine Hundred Superfresh at Branmar Plaza off Marsh Road (Del. 3), a Newark Pathmark at College Square shopping center off Library Avenue (Del. 72) and a Rehoboth Beach Superfresh at Pelican Square off Coastal Highway (Del. 1).\n\n“The company is on an aggressive timeline to convert all locations to the Acme banner within the next month or so,” Acme spokeswoman Danielle D’Elia wrote in an email. “Typically, the stores will be closed for just a few days while we convert them into an Acme.”\n\n7 things to know about insurance open enrollment\n\nConversion of the grocery stores is expected to occur around Thanksgiving. D’Elia said Acme plans to make job offers to nearly all the store-level workers at the supermarkets acquired from A&P.\n\nAs of its bankruptcy filing, A&P had about 28,500 employees nationwide, most of whom are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.\n\nAltogether, the two New Castle County grocery stores already shuttered and the three stores now slated to close will leave more 300 people unemployed, said union spokesman Casey Hoag.\n\n“It’s a truly awful situation,” he said. “For 300 of our members in Delaware, through no fault of their own, the world has come crashing down.”\n\nA U.S. Bankruptcy judge ruled in September that workers at the first 25 stores to be shut down will be eligible for only 52 percent of the severance pay that had been negotiated as part of their current labor deal – more than twice the 25 percent A&P had sought to pay them.\n\nUnder their contracts, those workers had been entitled to $300 for each year of work. The judge’s order cut that to $156.\n\nHoag said the union is planning resource fairs aimed at helping its members hone their résumés and obtain new job skills. Other local union grocery stores also are being asked to participate in those events in the hopes of finding jobs for displaced workers at other chains, he said.\n\nA&P, meanwhile, is seeking permission to reject terms of existing union contracts – including an obligation to pay benefits to retired employees – as it seeks to find suitors for its remaining store holdings.\n\nThe three Delaware grocery stores slated for closure are among more than 100 A&P-owned stores operating under Superfresh, Pathmark and other brand names that are still on the auction block.\n\nSam & Sam Meats, a 30-year-old independently owned, full-service grocery store in Upland, Pennsylvania, is reportedly nearing a deal with A&P to take over the lease for the Superfresh at Crossroads Plaza, which has housed a grocery store since the late 1950s.\n\nSam & Sam Meats owner Sam Kushto could not be reached for comment, but the shopping center’s owner said he is hopeful another supermarket will replace Superfresh in the nearly 29,000-square-foot anchor store.\n\n“The community certainly needs it, and we think a well-managed supermarket could do very well there,” said Terence Ryan, president of R&R Property Managers in Gilberton, Pennsylvania.\n\nClaymont boy prints hand, wins arm wrestling match\n\nLarry Poteat, a frequent shopper at Superfresh near New Castle, said he assumed a grocery store always would be located at the shopping center.\n\n“You just get used to something being there; you think it’s always going to be a part of the neighborhood,” he said. “I’m going to miss some of the staff. It’s been here so long that I’ve gotten to know some of them.”\n\nR&R Property Managers also owns the 51,000-square-foot, standalone property in Claymont that contained a Superfresh until mid-September.\n\nRyan said that property is more likely to be subdivided and leased to multiple tenants.\n\nOwners of other properties that already have – or will soon – lose their grocery stores did not return messages.\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\n\nWoman sexually assaulted in city", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/07/23/lane-bryant-store-closures-list-closing-stores-outet-locations-bankruptcy/5489894002/", "title": "Lane Bryant store closings: These 157 stores closing in bankruptcy", "text": "More than 150 Lane Bryant stores, including 52 of the plus-size brand's outlet stores, are expected to permanently close as part of parent company Ascena Retail Group's bankruptcy.\n\nNew Jersey-based Ascena, which also operates the Justice tween brand, Ann Taylor Loft, Catherines, Lou & Grey and Cacique, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Thursday with plans to shutter a \"significant number\" of the company's 2,800 stores, according to court documents.\n\nLane Bryant has 688 specialty retail and outlet stores, documents show, and had approximately $969 million in sales for the 2019 fiscal year.\n\nCatherines, which also is a plus-size retailer, will close all of its 320 stores but is expected to continue to operate as an online store under new ownership, Ascena said in a news release Thursday.\n\nSave better, spend better: Money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox.

Journal News\n\nWHITE PLAINS, N.Y. — New York A&P unions have a chance to save jobs but some workers may be faced with choosing between no job or one with a lower salary and less benefits.\n\nSince U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert Drain suggested last week that the United Food and Commercial Workers negotiate a compromise with A&P to spare as many jobs as possible, local unions have been scrambling to map out what that would mean for their members.\n\nDrain, who met privately with bankruptcy lawyers, made it clear he was seeking a compromise that would save jobs and not be costly for A&P, which is the midst of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a union official said.\n\nThis so-called \"cost-neutral\" stipulation has thrown some local unions into turmoil because each one has slightly different versions of bumping rights — a provision that allows a senior worker at a closed store to take the job of a less senior worker at a location slated to stay open. This could force some longtime employees who are making $25 an hour into taking a job that pays $10 an hour — or be unemployed.\n\nDrain has said if A&P and the unions can't reach a compromise, he will rule on the matter.\n\nAs part of filing for bankruptcy, A&P is closing 25 stores and selling the roughly 275 other locations. Three supermarkets — Acme Markets, Stop & Shop and Key Food — have put in bids for 118 stores. In the Lower Hudson Valley, the three have place bids on 20 stores with 11 others still looking for buyers.\n\nLast week, A&P asked Drain for permission to suspend employee bumping rights, saying its purchasing agreement with the three bidders barred the company from honoring that provision. But union lawyers countered the contract language around those provisions was vague.\n\nIn arguing in favor of bumping rights, Local 1776, which is based in Pennsylvania, introduced the idea of cost-neutral bumping rights.\n\nUnder 1776's collective bargaining agreements, only some workers with four or more years of experience are eligible to bump another employee. The most senior workers also are allowed to bump the next least senior worker, who in turn can bump an even less senior worker, the cycle continuing until there are no more open junior positions available. Under its provisions, workers not only assume the position but the same salary and benefits of the person they replace, allowing bumping to not cause the company economic hardship.\n\n\"Our contract gives us a great deal of flexibility,\" said Wendell Young, head of Local 1776.\n\nOther local unions have completely different bumping rights. In Local 464a, workers with as little as six months of experience qualify for bumping rights. Also, under 464a's provisions, the worker with the most seniority bumps the one with the least seniority. If the senior worker declines the bump, the next senior worker becomes eligible.\n\nFor 464a, the worker maintains their pay and benefits when they assume the new position — which is one reason why the pay differential could be as high as $15.\n\nJohn Niccollai, head of Local 464a, which has an office in Tarrytown, said the union spent all weekend mapping out the possibilities and is continuing to work on the permutations, which can be complicated because the scenario changes depending on whether workers agree to the bump.\n\n\"It's really difficult stuff,\" he said.\n\nIn total, 94 workers in 464a are eligible for bumping. Niccollai said the union may go back to the judge and ask for a compromise that provides an allowance for some sort of pay differential in certain cases.\n\nIt's unclear when the unions and A&P will return to Drain with the results of their negotiation though it's likely to occur before Sept. 5, when the first set of stores are scheduled to close.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, Drain approved the sale of pharmaceutical assets at 22 out of the 25 stores slated to close. Twelve of the stores in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware had pharmacy records and inventory sold to Rite Aid and its affiliates for $8 million. There were buyers for pharmaceutical assets at 10 other stores, but no additional details were available.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/04/29/payless-shoesource-bankruptcy-creditors-lenders-question-alden-global-capital-hedge-fund/3340048002/", "title": "Payless bankruptcy: Creditors, lenders, question Alden Global Capital", "text": "This story has been updated to clarify the 2012 acquisition of Payless ShoeSource by Blum Capital Partners and Golden Gate Capital.\n\nWhen Payless ShoeSource emerged from bankruptcy protection in August 2017, the national discount footwear company vowed to reinvent itself. But today the retailer and a hedge fund that controls it are locked in a contentious battle over its second turn through bankruptcy.\n\nIn February, just a year-and-a-half after its first Chapter 11 reorganization case, Payless landed back in bankruptcy court – this time wiping a decades-old retailer off the map in the U.S. and Canada. The turn of events has destined an estimated 16,000 workers for unemployment and disappointed consumers who relied on the chain's 2,500 stores and website for affordable shoes, boots, and sandals.\n\nThe company intends to keep Payless' overseas operations running.\n\nSome of the chain's lenders and creditors claim the collapse may stem in part from self-inflicted causes. They cite the role of Alden Global Capital, a prominent hedge fund that is Payless’ majority shareholder as well as a major lender.\n\nCritics maintain Alden has invested in distressed companies and then in some cases installed unseasoned executives who cut costs and sold assets while failing to take steps needed for successful corporate turnarounds. Some Payless creditors and lenders also have raised questions about what they characterized as conflicts of interest between Alden and Payless.\n\nAfter hearing Alden-focused court arguments last Wednesday in St. Louis, Missouri, Chief Judge Kathy Surratt-States of the Eastern District of Missouri ordered anti-conflict-of-interest measures to ensure that Payless creditors and lenders receive equal treatment with the hedge fund. The provisions include the unusual appointment of a monitor to oversee the five-seat Payless board, three with Alden ties, including Heath Freeman, the hedge fund president.\n\nAlden also is the controlling shareholder of MediaNews Group, the company that in January announced a hostile takeover effort for Gannett, which owns USA TODAY and more than 100 local media properties in the United States. MNG had nominated a six-person slate of candidates for Gannett’s board that, if elected, would have made up a majority of the company's board of directors.\n\nIn a surprise move, MNG on Thursday halved its slate to three candidates, which means they would not control Gannett's board, even if elected. The board will consist of eight seats, down from nine. A vote is scheduled at Gannett's May 16 annual shareholder meeting.\n\nWhen Payless emerged after its first bankruptcy, the company pledged to cut prices, invest in online operations and entice shoppers with a treasure-hunt style of shopping akin to popular budget chains Marshalls or TJ Maxx.\n\nBut during the ensuing months, what some loyal shoppers noticed were changes for the worse. \"From the minute you walked in the door, you knew they were struggling,\" said Kathryn Carrington Bogert of Port St. Lucie, Florida. \"Before I used to go in, and they would be jam-packed.\"\n\nErin Tucker, a data analyst from Grand Rapids, Michigan, said the Payless stores she visited \"were not as neat and appealing.\"\n\n\"The displays were somewhat bare, and they hadn't really updated their style in a while,\" said Tucker.\n\nPayless blamed its collapse on unexpected delays from key suppliers, a glut of shoe inventory last fall, an inability to equip all its stores with an online digital sales presence and lingering problems from the company's previous bankruptcy.\n\n“The challenges facing retailers today are well documented, and unfortunately Payless emerged from its prior reorganization ill-equipped to survive in today’s retail environment,” Stephen Marotta, Payless’ chief restructuring officer, said in a Feb.18 statement that sounded a virtual death knell for a shoe chain popular with families on a budget.\n\nThe new bankruptcy has cast a spotlight on the Payless-Alden business relationship. The hedge fund controls more than 60% of the footwear company and is a secured creditor, placing it closer to the front of the line than others for repayment. In bankruptcy court filings and courtroom statements, some of the chain's lenders and creditors claimed Payless:\n\nFailed to put in place a permanent chief executive officer to run the retailer after the company emerged from its first bankruptcy, and replaced departing senior management members with \"inexperienced and unqualified\" Alden executives.\n\nOpened a new headquarters in a Dallas office building, hundreds of miles from Payless' base in Topeka, Kansas, in what some lenders suggested may have been a move to \"bail out\" an Alden affiliate that controls the Dallas building.\n\nNegotiated a $45 million loan from Alden during a 2018 cash crunch, a transaction that lenders claimed \"had little beneficial effect\" on the company's financial health but enabled the hedge fund to get ahead of other lenders seeking repayment in the new bankruptcy.\n\nAgreed to a shared service contract with Aerosoles, a company that Alden bought during an unrelated bankruptcy case. Lenders want to know whether the deal terms conformed with market norms.\n\nRaised questions about a potential conflict of interest stemming from Alden-linked board members reviewing and voting on Payless matters that involved the hedge fund.\n\nSparked separate conflict of interest concerns by seeking the appointment of a law firm to serve as the 2019 bankruptcy co-counsel for Payless after the firm represented Alden in past and current legal matters.\n\n“Given everything that has happened, we have serious concerns with how this company is being run and controlled by Alden,” Stephen Zide, one attorney for an ad hoc group of Payless lenders, said during a bankruptcy court hearing in February.\n\nThose lenders and some Payless creditors are pursuing an investigation of the claims while the bankruptcy case proceeds.\n\nAttorneys for Payless and Alden say the allegations have no merit.\n\n“We hear it again today that somehow we were the architects of the demise of the company, which we think is completely inappropriate and unsupported,” Allan Brilliant, an attorney representing Alden, said during a March 14 bankruptcy hearing. Payless lenders were trying to “manufacture issues here to try to get leverage in this case and derail the process,” he added.\n\nAt its newspaper company, which operates as MediaNews Group/Digital First Media, Alden has imposed deep cuts and sold real estate. Critics say the quality of the news product deteriorated, while Alden said the moves improved the company's finances. At another investment, Memphis-based retailer Fred's Inc., the Alden-linked board also presided over asset sales and cost-cutting while the business declined, critics claim.\n\nAlden's strategy of cutting costs and selling assets falls in line with a customary hedge fund strategy of serving as a de facto “liquidator” of financially distressed businesses, said James Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business who specializes in global financial markets.\n\n“If you look at their history, they’re going to be very conscious of cost and try to cut corners wherever they can,” Angel said. “The question to ask is, are they tunneling resources out and just leaving the bankrupt shell behind? That’s the real issue.”\n\nIt’s not atypical for investors to capitalize on a business sector's downfall, he added.\n\n\"One of the reasons for buying another business is to say, ‘Hey, I think I can run that business more efficiently than the current owners.’ Now maybe that means cutting costs or maybe it means taking advantage of other opportunities,” Angel said. But “are they doing things like having sweetheart management deals or other deals that wind up basically tunneling the assets out, leaving a bankrupt shell behind where the creditors end up eating it?\"\n\nAlden attorney Brilliant, in an email response to a series of questions from USA TODAY, said the hedge fund and its predecessors \"have a long history of investing in stressed, distressed and bankrupt companies. Such companies are often subject to court proceedings, capital structure optimization, shifts in strategic direction, corporate headcount reductions and leadership changes.\"\n\nThe bankruptcy questions are playing out while Payless stores across the U.S. hold going-out-of-business sales.\n\nIn early April, shoppers came and went at Payless’ New York City location in mid-Manhattan, diagonally across West 34th Street from retailing giant Macy’s. Although store closing signs in English and Spanish announced the news, a smaller sign advised that new inventory was still arriving each week.\n\n“I’m sad, because they have good prices, and I can get my size 12 here,” said Vilma Rosales, a Brooklyn resident.\n\nIn Jensen Beach, Florida, Justine Allegrezza, a mother of three, said she's shopped at a local Payless for her family at least six times a year.\n\n“They had great sales and the sneakers were great quality for the whole family,” said Allegrezza, who was a fan of the buy-one-get-one promotion and coupons. “The kids wear them out and grow out of them fast, and they lasted just as long as the more expensive name brand ones I have bought.”\n\nBest foot forward\n\nPayless debuted in 1956 in Topeka, Kansas, the brainchild of cousins Louis and Shaol Pozez. It pioneered the concept of allowing customers to self-select their footwear, a feature that survived and thrived over the ensuing decades.\n\nPayless eventually went public and was acquired by May Department Stores in 1979. Spun off from May, Payless became Collective Brands after a 2007 purchase of Stride Rite.\n\nIn 2012, private equity companies Blum Capital Partners and Golden Gate Capital joined footwear company Wolverine Worldwide in buying Collective Brands for $2 billion. When the deal closed, Wolverine acquired Collective Brands' Performance + Lifestyle group, while Blum Capital and Golden Gate acquired Payless and Collective Licensing International.\n\nIn part, corporate debt amassed during that transaction led to the April 2017 bankruptcy. Just over four-and-a-half months later, after shedding more than $435 million in debt and closing approximately 673 stores, a slimmed-down Payless emerged with Alden as a major financial investor.\n\nAt that time, interim-CEO Martin R. Wade III said that with less debt, the company would invest in digital infrastructure, reduce prices and adopt the \"treasure-hunt nature\" of retailers TJ Maxx and Marshalls.\n\nWade also said Payless envisioned an opportunity in servicing other retailers by handling their shoe inventory or sales.\n\n\"We’ve got to redesign our model, so we can make all that happen,\" Wade told USA TODAY in a story published in January 2018.\n\nTripped up\n\nWhen the company emerged from its first bankruptcy in August 2017 then-CEO W. Paul Jones told Footwear News that Payless was positioned \"to create substantial value for our stakeholders and achieve long-term success.\"\n\n\"Payless is the first to successfully emerge as a stronger and healthier enterprise for the benefit of its customers, employees, suppliers, business partners and lenders,\" Jones added at the time.\n\nNonetheless, the company faltered.\n\nBy August 2018, Moody’s Investors Service warned that despite Payless’ reduced debt, “financial risk remains high owing to persistently weak trends in its core U.S. brick and mortar business and its still heavy debt service costs and modest operating margins.”\n\nThe treasure-hunt style of retail promised by Wade never happened, said Sheena Butler, senior business editor at Footwear News, who tracked Payless. She said the company may have suffered from strategic mistakes like having too many stores after the first bankruptcy and too much debt to invest in significant retail changes.\n\n“The everyday-low-price model was challenging because they didn’t have that other component, which was the thrill of the find,” Butler said.\n\nThe company also never pulled off a significant rehash of its online strategy, she added.\n\n“They didn’t really evolve digitally,” Butler said. “They weren’t relevant.”\n\nAs Payless' retail prospects worsened in 2018, supplier disruption and a computer breakdown took a toll on the company’s operations.\n\nBy autumn, Payless faced an inventory glut and was \"forced to sell merchandise at steep markdowns, which depressed margins and drained liquidity,\" the company said in a bankruptcy court filing. \"Customers filled their closets with these deeply discounted products, which served to reduce customer demand for new product.\"\n\nPayless said it sold \"millions of pairs of shoes\" for below-market prices in the weeks leading up to its second bankruptcy filing. The company’s $66 million loss in 2018 for its North America stores added to a loss of $11 million in 2017 for that division.\n\nIt is not shocking to see the company’s North American operations fall apart, given the retail sector’s challenges. However it is surprising for a company like Payless to slip back into bankruptcy so quickly – especially because the footwear firm had emerged from its first bankruptcy with less debt, profit forecasts and “a certain sense of optimism,” said Josh Friedman, global head of restructuring data at Debtwire.\n\n“Either you had these projections that you were going to exit bankruptcy and move forward that were just wildly wrong, or there was merit to them and you missed the mark,” Friedman said.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nSome Payless lenders took aim at Alden following what they characterized in a bankruptcy court filing as \"mismanagement suggested by the stunningly swift collapse\" of the company.\n\nThe lenders, joined by hedge fund Axar Capital Management, Payless' second-largest creditor, filed an objection that cited Payless' borrowing of $45 million from Alden during a cash crunch in 2018.\n\nThe loan \"may not have only delayed the inevitable,\" but also may have been harmful because it prevented Payless from seeking bankruptcy court protection even sooner, at a time when the company might have secured more favorable terms and higher recoveries for creditors, the companies argued.\n\n\"All the transactions that occurred between Alden and the company were at arm's length and in fact benefited the company more than that they benefited Alden,\" Brilliant, the hedge fund's lawyer, said during a recent bankruptcy court hearing.\n\nSeparately, the committee of Payless' unsecured creditors questioned why the company has sought bankruptcy court approval to pay an aggregate of roughly $84,000 per month to Payless' Alden-dominated board.\n\n\"If they are retained at Alden's insistence simply to preserve its control of the board, it should be at the expense of Alden, not creditors,\" the committee contended in a court filing.\n\nThe company responded in an April 23 court filing that the Payless board members have \"taken an active role in an extremely complex liquidation and sale process,\" and the board \"has determined to pay the board members commensurate with the board's significant commitment of time and resources.\"\n\nPayless lenders also questioned why the company \"inexplicably\" leased office space in Dallas as part of a plan to move the company's headquarters there from Kansas. The filing said the plan represented \"paying for twice the space\" during a bankruptcy when the company could least afford it.\n\nPayless separately disclosed that it had sold the Kansas headquarters property for $2 million in a deal that enabled the company to lease back part of the building.\n\nOffering a potential alternative rationale, Payless lenders cited a November 2018 Bloomberg News report that said the move in part seemed aimed at helping \"bail out\" a Dallas real estate investment of Randall Smith, Alden's founder.\n\nAccording to the report, Smith owned real estate development company Spire Realty, whose holdings included a Dallas office building called Bryant Tower. The building's largest tenant last year announced plans to move elsewhere in 2020, a decision that could lead to a loan default for the tower, the report said.\n\nThe arrival of new tenant Payless may have eased the financial concerns, the report said.\n\nAlden said the claims are \"without merit.\" The hedge fund sponsor said the Dallas relocation was approved by a special Payless board committee, received a fairness opinion from a national real estate valuation firm, and produced a lease that was on \"below-market terms.\"\n\nThe lenders separately argued that the shared services contract Payless signed with Alden-affiliated Aerosoles lacked disclosure \"as to whether the contract and the associated costs conform with market terms, the debtor's credit documents ... and applicable law.\"\n\nAlden said the deal was \"fully vetted by an independent director, disclosed to the (Payless) board, and approved in the directors' business judgment.\" The agreement called for Aerosoles to pay for any services from Payless for fair consideration, the company added.\n\nAlong with the failure to name a permanent Payless CEO, lenders' attorney Zide contended during a recent bankruptcy hearing that \"many senior members of management left the company over the last 18 months ... only to be replaced by inexperienced and unqualified Alden executives.\"\n\nAlden said Payless' senior management team consisted of \"experienced and qualified executives\" who were chosen in a process that included many Payless executives, \"including Mr. Zide's clients.\"\n\nDuring bankruptcy court arguments, the lenders separately criticized what they said was Payless' lack of corporate governance safeguards to prevent Alden-linked members on the company's board from weighing and voting on matters that involved the hedge fund. The issues included the search and approval of lenders for debtor-in-possession financing during the bankruptcy, lenders claimed in a court filing.\n\n\"We have a board stacked with Alden appointees and employees making a decision on what consists of a conflict and how to address it,\" Daniel Fliman, an attorney for creditor Axar Capital, said during a recent bankruptcy court hearing. \"And they're being advised by Akin Gump, a counsel that has a longstanding relationship with Alden.\"\n\nThe arguments continued during Wednesday's roughly two-hour hearing in St. Louis. The Payless creditors and lenders tried to block the appointment of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld as bankruptcy co-counsel to Payless because the Washington, D.C.,-based firm received millions of dollars in fees by representing Alden in past legal matters.\n\nAkin Gump attorneys said the law firm had disclosed its Alden-related work at the start of the bankruptcy. Echoing arguments by Alden, they also said the hedge fund sponsor does not control the Payless board. Two board members with links to the hedge fund sponsor are deemed to be independent under the laws of Delaware, where Payless was incorporated, said Akin Gump lawyer Abid Qureshi.\n\nLawyers for the Payless lenders and creditors nonetheless argued that further restrictions were crucial to prevent potential conflicts of interest from giving Alden an advantage over other parties in the case.\n\nSaying she would \"help the parties come together,\" the judge said she would issue an order that:\n\nRequires Payless to form a special board committee consisting solely of the company's two independent board members with no Alden ties. That committee will have exclusive authority to “review, consider, negotiate and adopt or approve any document, action or transaction,” including any reorganization or liquidation plan, “in which Alden or its affiliates and any director is either interested or may be implicated.” The committee will also have the sole power to investigate, prosecute, release or settle any claims involving Alden, its affiliates and any past or current directors.\n\nRequires that decisions on any conflict claims related to Alden be determined solely by the two independent directors in consultation with attorneys from Seward & Kissel, a law firm with no ties to the hedge fund.\n\ndecisions on any conflict claims related to Alden be determined solely by the two independent directors in consultation with attorneys from Seward & Kissel, a law firm with no ties to the hedge fund. Directs Akin Gump to establish and enforce a protocol to ensure that its attorneys working for Payless do not discuss those matters or share records with the firm's attorneys who handle unrelated work for Alden.\n\nGives the Payless lenders and creditors a role in choosing a special Payless board observer who will monitor the board’s meetings and report any inappropriate conduct to the court.\n\nThe conditions seemed similar to provisions that were adopted voluntarily as part of settlements or without the requirement of judges' orders in other bankruptcy proceedings, said Marc Carmel, a partner at Chicago law firm McDonald Hopkins and co-chair of a subcommittee of the American Bar Association's Business Bankruptcy Committee. However, the appointment of an outside board monitor \"seems like a pretty extreme thing,\" he added.\n\n\"It seems to presuppose that there needs to be an observer or a 'police person' to make sure nothing happens that conflicts with the judge’s other conditions,\" Carmel said. He and his law firm have no involvement with the Payless bankruptcy case.\n\nPayless' lenders and creditors haven’t proven that Alden engaged in improper conduct with Payless, said Friedman, Debtwire's global head of restructuring data. These \"sorts of allegations require detailed due diligence to get to the bottom of it to see what was done,\" he said.\n\nAttorneys for Payless and Alden did not respond to messages seeking comment on the judge's order.\n\n\n\nTroubled Fred's investment\n\nIn late 2016, Alden invested $158 million in Memphis-headquartered Fred's Inc., a general merchandise retailer and pharmacy chain. The purchase gave Alden an ownership stake of nearly 25%.\n\nThe Fred's investment stemmed from Strategic Investment Opportunities LLC, a subsidiary of MediaNews Group Enterprises, the Alden-controlled newspaper publishing company. Alden is the investment adviser for Strategic Investment Opportunities, according to a Delaware lawsuit.\n\nThat lawsuit was filed by Sola Ltd and Ultra Master LTD, affiliates of a New York hedge fund and MediaNews Group's largest minority investor. The plaintiffs also questioned whether MediaNews Group transactions with Alden \"are arms’ length and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\"\n\nMNG denied the allegations. The parties agreed to a dismissal of the case in October.\n\nMonths after the investment in Fred's, the retailer placed two Alden-linked appointees on its board of directors. Four of the board's five current members have ties to Alden.\n\nOne is Freeman, the hedge fund sponsor's president. The others are: Dana Goldsmith Needleman, whose husband represented Alden in the 2017 renewal of its Manhattan office lease, according to online commercial real estate industry publication citybizlist.com; Steven Rossi, former CEO and president of Alden-controlled MediaNews Group; and Timothy Barton, former CEO and president of Freightquote, a company that previously included Smith, Alden's founder, as an investor.\n\nThe Fred's board has presided over a cost-cutting strategy. From the beginning of 2017 through the first quarter of 2018, the employee count at Fred’s headquarters dropped from 440 to 274, according to a recent earnings call.\n\nFred's also faced disruption when plans to profit from a planned mega-merger between pharmacy giants Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid collapsed in late June 2017 amid federal anti-trust concerns.\n\nThe turn of events left Fred’s without a clear path to growth in a pharmacy business in which size has a significant impact on negotiating power and profitability.\n\nFaced with competitive challenges and a share price in the $3 range, Fred’s appointed MediaNews Group veteran executive Joseph Anto as the company's chief financial officer on Feb. 1, 2018. Anto was named interim CEO on April 27, 2018, and he got the top executive post on a permanent basis in February.\n\nAnto, who had no previous experience running retailers or health care companies, embarked on a cost-cutting plan aimed at lowering Fred's debt and generating positive earnings.\n\nFred's reported $964.7 million in net sales for the first nine months of the company's 2018 fiscal year a nearly 6% decrease from the same period of fiscal 2017. Same-store sales, a key financial metric for retailers, fell by 4.9% during the first nine months of the company's 2018 fiscal year, more than double the 2.3% decline during the same period in 2017.\n\nFred’s stock, which Alden had purchased in late 2016 at an average price of $17.06 per share, has declined about 91%. The shares closed at $1.56 on Friday.\n\nThe company's decline makes it uncertain whether Anto will deliver on his previously announced goal of returning Fred's to profitability by the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year. The company told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 19 that it will be late reporting its fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nAlthough Fred’s faces the same challenges as other retailers in an increasingly digital age, the company’s operational missteps have also contributed to its decline. Sales suffered in 2018 in part because of too many out-of-stock items, Anto acknowledged in a recent earnings call.\n\nIn an April 11 announcement, Fred's said it was closing 159 \"underperforming\" stores, launching clearance sales at 360 locations and hiring investment banking adviser PJ Solomon to \"evaluate strategic alternatives to maximize value for all shareholders.\"\n\nFred's said it is also trying to sell its remaining pharmacy holdings as part of a previously announced plan to monetize non-core assets.\n\nThe company said it had no current plans to seek bankruptcy court protection. However, when businesses say they are evaluating strategic alternatives, the options often include a potential restructuring or sale.\n\nFred's representatives did not respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment.\n\nContributing: Kelly Tyko", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/29"}]}

Tart, sour German cherries are added (never maraschino) along with a healthy 2 1/4-ounce pour of Maker’s Mark bourbon. A pre-smoked ice ball is plopped in the glass.\n\nWhile some might know the cocktail best as an old-fashioned, it’s the final, modernist twist that Houser adds that brings the wowsa factor.\n\nHe finishes the drink not with a swizzle stick, but points a smoking gun in the glass to create puffy white and gray clouds that further enhance the cocktail’s woodsy perfume. Lift the napkin off the top of the glass and it’s like you let a genie out of its bottle.\n\n“And this is why everyone who sees it starts ordering more,” Houser says of the theatrical display.\n\nThe Copperhead Saloon is a sophisticated bar, somewhat in the speakeasy-style vein, that quietly opened June 9 in The Powder Mill Square shopping center at 3826 Kennett Pike. Leave the kids at home, this is an adults-only establishment with a taproom license that only allows patrons to enter who are 21 and older.\n\nNeo speakeasies have been a hot trend of the American bar culture for almost 15 years. Some have unmarked doorways, such as Hummingbird to Mars, a speakeasy atop Catherine Rooney’s in Wilmington’s Trolley Square. You need to press the intercom at the 16th Street to enter.\n\nOthers are accessed by a password or by way of a secret entrance such as the phone booth door at PDT (Please Don’t Tell), a New York business within a hotdog establishment that was awarded a 2012 James Beard Award for Outstanding Bar Program.\n\nCopperhead Saloon is absent such kitsch, but still has an air of mystery. The simple Copperhead sign outside of the 1,731-square-foot building, the former Dagmar’s Reason spa and beauty salon, does little to explain that inside its doors is a modern day cocktail lounge open daily from 3 p.m. to 1 a.m.\n\nThe only real ideas Copperhead borrows from other speakeasy operations are its use of fresh juices and boutique spirits. The menu does include drinks from the pre- and post-Prohibition era such as the Monkey Gland, which sounds like nothing you want to put in your mouth. But don’t let the name steer you away from giving it a try. The obscure $10 drink, made with gin, orange juice, homemade grenadine and absinthe, is delicious. Penicillin, a post-Prohibition cocktail, has blended scotch mixed with lemon, honey syrup and muddled ginger.\n\nBeer and wine are also available. A limited small plates menu has 10 items, which will change frequently, that now include cheese trays and charcuterie boards ($20), flamed goat cheese with olive and sundried tomato tapenade ($14), duck confit with gorgonzola grits and spicy tomato chutney ($18), bacon-wrapped dates ($10) and sweet & spicy bar nuts ($7). Discounts at happy hour, from 3 to 6 p.m. Mondays through Fridays, include $1 off draft beer and wine by the glass and $8 classic cocktails.\n\nHouser, a St. Louis, Missouri, native, attended the University of Oklahoma to study architecture. He soon fell in love with the bar culture and owned and managed beer and wine bars, gastropubs and a brewery in Norman, Oklahoma, near Oklahoma City, where he met his fiancee Erin Wallace, who grew up in Delaware and graduated from A.I. du Pont High School. The couple, who now have a 15-month-old son, Conner, moved to Delaware in 2014 to be near Wallace’s family and to open a business.\n\nHouser says he began scouting bar locations in 2014 and eventually settled on the site in Greenville’s Powder Mill Square. “I came in and looked at it and I loved the location. I like the charm of the place and its intimacy.” Houser says the area “really does remind me of St. Louis in some ways.”\n\nRenovations on the former beauty salon began in October. Wallace says she and Houser wanted the decor to feel somewhat like a comfortable, upscale living room. The sunny space is snug with 40 seats, including comfortable, black leather bar stools, some low tables and a few high-tops, along with a faux fireplace.\n\nThe beer tap handles are wooden sculptures of animals and figurines that Houser found in stores and websites. Some of the glasses were purchased from thrift stores and estate sales. The bar top is made from reclaimed oak planks, dating back to the 1970s, that were once the building’s flooring.\n\nPennies decorate the front and back of the bar as well as the restroom floors. It’s one of the few nods to another “speakeasy-style” style bar in the area. Philadelphia’s Hop Sing Laundromat, the four-year-old swanky bar on Race Street known for its meticulously made cocktails, has a vestibule whose floor is coated in pennies.\n\nHouser says he hopes Copperhead, which gets its name from the pennies, will become a traditional neighborhood gathering place with really good drinks and interesting conversation. Building relationships with the clientele is the best part of his job, he says.\n\n“This really is my idea of a cocktail party,” Houser says. “We might not know everyone when they come in, but we’ll know you when you leave.”\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 orptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter@pattytalorico\n\nIF YOU GO:\n\nWHAT: The Copperhead Saloon is a new 40-seat bar and lounge offering classic cocktails (pre- and post Prohibition) as well as beers on tap, wine and a variety of small plates like bacon-wrapped dates ($10) and pork rillete ($16).

A few shuttered spots that come to mind: Ground Round and its peanut shell-covered floor; Bennigan's, one of the first casual dining chains; and Chi-Chi's, which made fajitas a mainstream dish in America.\n\nOver the years, we have said goodbye to many. Here is a look back at 10 restaurants we miss.\n\nOld Time Tavern in Toms River\n\nEveryone who grew up in Toms River remembers this restaurant, a historic place near the intersection of Routes 9 and 37, in the old Dover Mall (there was a movie theater there, too). For many, it was where you went to celebrate special occasions - graduations, birthday, bridal showers.\n\nThe tavern housed a piece of township history: A portion of the building came from The Ocean House, an 18th-century hotel that was relocated from downtown Toms River in the 1950s to avoid demolition (A 7-Eleven now stands at the site, at Main and Water streets). After considerable renovation, the portion that was saved became the dining room and southeast part of the tavern.\n\nOld Time Tavern was demolished in 2008, prior to the widening of Route 9 and the construction of a new plaza that now houses Buffalo Wild Wings, Social 37 and Panera Bread, among other businesses.\n\nDover Diner\n\nLike the nearby Old Time Tavern, this Toms River landmark was torn down in 2008 to allow for road widening and improvements on Route 9. The diner - which attracted customers with a sign that read \"Eat here - or we'll both starve!\" - opened in 1949 and was housed in a stainless steel 1950 Silky City dining car.\n\nIt was a small place, as many of the great ones are - a counter stretched the width of the restaurant and a handful of booths were available - and it was a part of town before the Garden State Parkway ran through Toms River.\n\nWinkelmann's Restaurant in Lakewood\n\nIn 1961, at the age of 19, a man named Hermann Winkelmann emigrated to the United States from Germany. Within a few years, he had opened a butcher shop, then a liquor store. In 1972, he opened Winkelmann's German-American restaurant on Route 9 in Lakewood.\n\nThose who don't remember Winkelmann's surely know the location: The grand space, with its own version of a German clock tower (figurines included) become Chateau Grand, then a shopping plaza.\n\nBut what happened to Winkelmann's? The restaurant grew and grew over the years, but the bank that lent Hermann the money to expand became the subject of a federal investigation. The bank was seized in the early 1990s, and the restaurant subsequently closed.\n\nCircus Drive-In in Wall\n\nThis is the most recently closed restaurant on this list, but after 63 years, it deserves a mention. The beloved Circus Drive-In - known for serving hamburgers, hot dogs and milkshakes under a striped big top.\n\nThe drive-in got its start in 1954, when Richard Friedel and his wife, Barbara, took out a mortgage and a loan from family. Barbara designed the restaurant's mascot, a smiling clown that overlooks Route 35.\n\n\"It stood the test of time,\" Friedel, 90, recently said of the business, which he sold 13 years ago. \"I was proud of it, and I'm still proud of it. And I'm sorry to see it go. But, like everything else, nothing is forever.\"\n\nSteak & Ale\n\nIf you have ever filled your plate at a salad bar, you can thank (in part) restaurateur Norman Brinker, who founded the British-style Steak & Ale in 1966 and helped put make-it-yourself salads on the map.\n\n\"The customer can get a salad while the waiter is turning in the order and delivering it,” Brinker told a National Public Radio reporter in 2002. “The speed was much faster. And you, the customer, ate what you wanted from the salad bar, right off the bat.\"\n\nRemember Bennigan's and Steak & Ale? This Long Branch native bringing them back\n\nThe restaurant, which had locations in Middletown, Cherry Hill and Upper Saddle River, closed nearly a decade ago when its parent company went bankrupt. But Steak & Ale is making a comeback: A new owner has revamped the concept, and Food & Beverage magazine reports a location has opened in Cancun, with more planned for India and Australia.\n\nIt could also be making a comeback at the Jersey Shore thanks to a Long Branch man.\n\nSizzler\n\nAh, Sizzler. Who can forget the commercials - happy families, in the latest '80s fashion, enjoying steak, fried shrimp, baked potatoes and burger toppings from the fixins' bar - and that line from the 1992 film \"White Men Can't Jump\": \"We going Sizzler, we going Sizzler\"?\n\nIt all started in 1958 with the opening of a restaurant that served a steak dinner for 99 cents. Today, there are dozens of Sizzlers throughout the country - mostly out West, plus one in Florida - still dishing up rib-eyes and crispy shrimp.\n\nFuddruckers\n\nWhat makes the World's Greatest Hamburger? The folks at Fuddruckers do - or so they say.\n\nThe 37-year-old chain, which remains in Parsippany and Succasanna, was among the first to put custom-made burgers in a customer's hands.\n\nThe restaurant's cooks grill third-, half-, and two third-pound patties to your liking and put them on store-baked buns. Then, it's off to the fixins' bar for pico de gallo, sliced jalapenos, diced onions and cheese sauce.\n\nAnd yes - they still have the buffalo, elk and wild boar burgers.\n\nHoward Johnson's\n\nThere is one Howard Johnson's restaurant left in the country, in New York's Lake George.\n\nBut at its peak in the 1960s, there were hundreds of these orange-roofed restaurants, which founder Howard Deering Johnson started in the early 1920s as an ice cream shop. A full-service restaurant followed in 1929, then smartly planned franchises took off: They were built in close proximity to the nation's highways.\n\nKnown as “a landmark for hungry Americans,” HoJos dished up fried clam strips, the \"frankfort\" (a hot dog sandwiched in a buttered roll), steaks, sandwiches, and Johnson's nearly 30 flavors of ice cream.\n\nDenny's\n\nIf you didn't spend late nights in your 20s eating bacon cheese fries and piles of pancakes at Denny's, you missed out.\n\nThere still is time - there are 10 of the 24-hour restaurants left in New Jersey, mostly in the southwest part of the state. The Brick location closed in 2011 - it is now an Asian fusion restaurant - and the closure marked the chain's departure from Ocean County. There are no Denny's locations in Monmouth County.\n\nA bit of trivia: Denny's Grand Slam breakfast - two buttermilk pancakes, two sunny-side-up eggs, two bacon strips and two sausage links - was introduced in 1977 in honor of Milwaukee Brewers' slugger Hank Aaron.\n\nChevy's\n\nHere is what I remember about this Mexican chain: a woman making tortillas by hand, a delicious corn dish called tomalito, and very large margaritas.\n\nThis was at Chevy's in Brick, which closed in 2012 and became Quaker Steak & Lube. The Tex-Mex chain had some troubles - parent companies experienced bankruptcies - but today, nearly 40 remain. Most locations are in northern California, and the Chevy's closest to the Shore is in Linden.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/17"}]}

The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine’s government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.\n\n“We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,” SpaceX’s director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter.\n\nAmong the SpaceX documents sent to the Pentagon and seen by CNN is a previously unreported direct request made to Musk in July by the Ukrainian military’s commanding general, General Valerii Zaluzhniy, for almost 8,000 more Starlink terminals.\n\nIn a separate cover letter to the Pentagon, an outside consultant working for SpaceX wrote, “SpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy.”\n\nThe documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a rare breakdown of SpaceX’s own internal numbers on Starlink, detailing the costs and payments associated with the thousands of terminals in Ukraine. They also shed new light on behind-the-scenes negotiations that have provided millions of dollars in communications hardware and services to Ukraine at little cost to Kyiv.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed they received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of the Starlink satellite communications product in Ukraine, a statement from Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Singh confirmed the Pentagon had been in communication with SpaceX but did not say whether it was over the funding of the Starlink satellite communication product.\n\nMusk on Friday said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musk’s Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: “F*** off.”\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musk’s claimed peace plan for Russia’s Ukraine war by saying: “F*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk.”\n\n“We’re just following his recommendation,” Musk said on Friday, responding to a tweet that referenced CNN’s reporting and Melnyk’s comments, even though the letter SpaceX sent to the Pentagon was sent before the Twitter exchange.\n\nReports of outages\n\nThe letters come amid recent reports of wide-ranging Starlink outages as Ukrainian troops attempt to retake ground occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n\nSources familiar with the outages said they suddenly affected the entire frontline as it stood on September 30. “That has affected every effort of the Ukrainians to push past that front,” said one person familiar with the outages who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. “Starlink is the main way units on the battlefield have to communicate.”\n\nThis photograph taken on September 25 shows an antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere was no warning to Ukrainian forces, a second person said, adding that now when Ukraine liberates an area a request has to be made for Starlink services to be turned on.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the outages which resulted in a “catastrophic” loss of communication, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a tweet responding to the article, Musk didn’t dispute the outage, saying that what is happening on the battlefield is classified.\n\nSpaceX’s suggestion it will stop funding Starlink also comes amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musk’s allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nAfter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he “still very much support[s] Ukraine” but fears “massive escalation.”\n\nMusk also argued privately last month that Ukraine doesn’t want peace negotiations right now and that if they went along with his plan, “Russia would accept those terms,” according to a person who heard them.\n\n“Ukraine knows that its current government and wartime efforts are totally dependent on Starlink,” the person familiar with the discussions said. “The decision to keep Starlink running or not rests entirely in the hands of one man. That’s Elon Musk. He hasn’t been elected, no one decided to give him that power. He has it because of the technology and the company he built.”\n\nOn Tuesday Musk denied a report he has spoken to Putin directly about Ukraine. On Thursday, when a Ukrainian minister tweeted that Starlink is essential to Ukraine’s infrastructure, Musk replied: “You’re most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.”\n\n“The gall to look like heroes”\n\nMore than seven months into the war, it’s hard to overstate the impact Starlink has had in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops as well and NGOs and civilians have relied on the nimble, compact and easy-to-use units created by SpaceX. It’s not only used for voice and electronic communication but to help fly drones and send back video to correct artillery fire.\n\nCNN has seen it used at numerous Ukrainian bases.\n\nElon Musk pauses and looks down as he speaks during a press conference at SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Village in South Texas on February 10, 2022. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Starlink has been absolutely essential because the Russians have targeted the Ukrainian communications infrastructure,” said Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. “Without that they’d be really operating in the blind in many cases.”\n\nThough Musk has received widespread acclaim and thanks for responding to requests for Starlink service to Ukraine right as the war was starting, in reality, the vast majority of the 20,000 terminals have received full or partial funding from outside sources, including the US government, the UK and Poland, according to the SpaceX letter to the Pentagon.\n\nSpaceX’s request that the US military foot the bill has rankled top brass at the Pentagon, with one senior defense official telling CNN that SpaceX has “the gall to look like heroes” while having others pay so much and now presenting them with a bill for tens of millions per month.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX figures shared with the Pentagon, about 85% of the 20,000 terminals in Ukraine were paid – or partially paid – for by countries like the US and Poland or other entities. Those entities also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity, which SpaceX says costs $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. (Over the weekend, Musk tweeted there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine.)\n\nIn his July letter to Musk, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Gen. Zaluzhniy, praised the Starlink units’ “exceptional utility” and said some 4,000 terminals had been deployed by the military. However, around 500 terminals per month are destroyed in the fighting, Zaluzhniy said, before asking for 6,200 more terminals for the Ukrainian military and intelligence services and 500 per month going forward to offset the losses.\n\nSpaceX said they responded by asking Zaluzhniy to instead take up his request to the Department of Defense.\n\nOn September 8, the senior director of government sales for SpaceX wrote the Pentagon saying the costs have gotten too high, approaching $100 million. The official asked the Department of Defense to pick up Ukraine’s new request as well as ongoing service costs, totaling $124 million for the remainder of 2022.\n\nThose costs, according to the senior defense official, would reach almost $380 million for a full year.\n\nSpaceX declined repeated requests for comment on both the outages and their recent request to the Pentagon. A lawyer for Musk did not reply to a request for comment. Defense Department spokesman Bob Ditchey told CNN, “The Department continues to work with industry to explore solutions for Ukraine’s armed forces as they repel Russia’s brutal and unprovoked aggression. We do not have anything else to add at this time.”\n\nBreaking down the costs\n\nEarly US support for Starlink came via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which according to the Washington Post spent roughly $3 million on hardware and services in Ukraine. The largest single contributor of terminals, according to the newly obtained documents, is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals.\n\nUS Pentagon in Washington DC building looking down aerial view from above Ivan Cholakov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe US has provided almost 1,700 terminals. Other contributors include the UK, NGOs and crowdfunding.\n\nThe far more expensive part, however, is the ongoing connectivity. SpaceX says it has paid for about 70% of the service provided to Ukraine and claims to have offered that highest level – $4,500 a month – to all terminals in Ukraine despite the majority only having signed on for the cheaper $500 per month service.\n\nThe terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlink’s website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month.\n\nThat’s just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying.\n\n“You could say he’s trying to get money from the government or just trying to say ‘I don’t want to be part of this anymore,’” said the person familiar with Ukraine’s requests for Starlink. Given the recent outages and Musk’s reputation for being unpredictable, “Feelings are running really high on the Ukrainian side,” this person said.\n\nMusk is the biggest shareholder of the privately-held SpaceX. In May, SpaceX disclosed that its valuation had risen to $127 billion and it has raised $2 billion this year, CNBC reported.\n\nLast week, Musk faced a barrage of criticism on Twitter – including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – after presenting in a series of tweets his peace plan to end the war. It would include giving Crimea to Russia and re-do referenda, supervised by the United Nations this time, in the four regions Russia recently illegally annexed.\n\nIt echoed comments he’d made last month at an exclusive closed-door conference in Aspen, Colorado called “The Weekend,” at which Musk told a room full of attendees that Ukraine should seek peace now because they’ve had recent victories.\n\n“This is the time to do it. They don’t want to do it, that’s for sure. But this is the time to do it,” he said, according to a person in the room. “Everyone wants to seek peace when they’re losing but they don’t want to seek peace when they’re winning. For now.”", "authors": ["Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/22/stranger-tourists-phish-plague-kinkajou-attack-news-around-states/39994527/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: The city is trying to figure out how to ban guns from a water park were two people were shot. The Decatur Daily reports officials say they need a change in state law before banning visitors from bringing guns into Point Mallard water park. But a state lawmaker from the city says minor changes would allow a gun ban. The issue is a state law that allows weapons at many public venues. A teenager was arrested after two people were wounded during a shooting at Point Mallard in June. City attorney Herman Marks says state law prohibits an outright ban on guns. Republican state Sen. Arthur Orr of Decatur says lawyers tell him the city could prohibit guns if it also controls access and increases security.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The governor has vetoed additional funding for the state’s ferry service that was placed in the budget by the Legislature. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed $5 million Monday that was added to the Alaska Marine Highway System budget, CoastAlaska reports. The Legislature previously cut $43 million from the ferry system’s budget. A fiscal note attached by the governor’s office called the budget item “premature” ahead of a $250,000 study, due in October, commissioned to reshape the ferry system. “I don’t know how it could be premature,” independent state Rep. Dan Ortiz of Ketchikan says. “We could see that these areas were going to be without needed services.” Coastal residents have told Ortiz they’re prevented from traveling even in emergency situations unless they find airplane travel while facing up to seven months without ferry service, he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Arizonans spend more time on their phones on average than everyone else in the country, according to a study based off Apple’s screen-time tracking system. SimpleTexting, a text marketing service, used screen-time data from 2,103 survey respondents to show how much of the day users spend tweeting, watching YouTube videos and more. Arizona had the highest average daily screen time at 276 minutes – more than twice the 131-minute average of the lowest state, Oklahoma. Weekly, Arizonans spend an average of 32.2 hours on their phones. That’s roughly 12 hours more than the national average, according to the study. That means that over a year, the state’s residents average about 70 full days using their smartphones.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor and attorney general are setting aside $1.5 million to create a legal services clinic for military veterans. Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Tuesday announced they were each allocating $750,000 to create the University of Arkansas Little Rock William H. Bowen School of Law’s Veterans Legal Services Clinic. The clinic is the first of its kind in Arkansas and will enable students at the law school to provide legal services free of charge to veterans throughout the state. Enrolled students will be trained to represent veterans on various legal issues under the supervision of a clinical facilitator. The clinic will also provide free continuing legal education for practicing attorneys on veteran-specific legal issues.\n\nCalifornia\n\nHayward: A 400-pound security robot that was knocked over by a vandal last month in Northern California may help bring its attacker to justice. The Hayward Police Department on Tuesday released images of the suspect that the Knightscope K5 robot captured before it was damaged. The 5-foot-tall robot, described by police as an “R2D2” figure, was guarding a parking garage when it was pushed over Aug. 3. K5’s photos show a young man in a black T-shirt and jeans running up moments before the attack. Police are asking for the public’s help in finding him. The company that built the robot, Knightscope, tells the Fresno Bee that the robot is expected to make “a full and speedy recovery.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Thousands of people who planned to camp during three days of Phish concerts at a stadium outside the city will no longer be able to because of concerns that fleas in and around nearby prairie dog burrows could spread the plague. The Denver Post reports public health officials are still finding infected fleas in fields surrounding Dick’s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City. The stadium’s owner decided to ban camping during the concerts over Labor Day weekend, and the band posted the notice on its website Tuesday. Between 2,000 and 3,000 people were expected to camp. The band’s well-known Shakedown Street, where fans sell souvenirs and food, also will not be allowed because the area normally used by vendors outside the stadium is on a dirt road.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is looking to purchase up to 2,000 megawatts of offshore wind power. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection says it has released a request for proposals for offshore wind power as required by a new state law. The department says it’s the state’s first solicitation dedicated specifically to offshore wind development, and the timing aligns with a similar offshore wind solicitation by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources. Connecticut already plans to purchase about 300 megawatts of offshore wind power from the Revolution Wind project, which is planned for federal waters south of Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont says the new request represents “the future of the state’s environmental, energy and economic potential.” Bids are due by Sept. 30.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: A wealthy developer has won a court battle against neighboring property owners in a fight over oceanfront views from their multimillion-dollar homes. A judge ruled Tuesday that Louis Capano III can build his beachfront mansion in Rehoboth Beach without complying with setback rules that were informally agreed to, but never formally adopted, by his neighbors. The judge noted that while other property owners voluntarily built to those more restrictive setback standards, they tried and failed three times to formally amend the community’s declaration of restrictive covenants. Other property owners complained that Capano’s house will obstruct their own panoramic views of the ocean. They wanted to prevent Capano from building within 30 feet of the coastal construction building line established by state environmental regulators to protect the beach and dunes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district has enacted emergency regulations to stop the federal government’s plan to house unaccompanied migrant children there. The Washington Post reports the regulations by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s administration were adopted Friday and prohibit licensing facilities housing more than 15 residents. They also require the director of the city’s child welfare agency to sign off on facilities housing between eight to 15 children. The rules expire in December. Maryland-based Dynamic Service Solution applied to open a temporary 200-bed shelter in the district. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded it a $20.5 million contract to operate the shelter for children ages 12 to 17. DHHS has defended the shelter and its treatment of unaccompanied minors.\n\nFlorida\n\nLake Worth Beach: Officials say a small, raccoon-like rainforest creature ran into an apartment and bit a man after he opened the front door to head to work. WPEC-TV reports the kinkajou bit his foot and scratched his leg but didn’t seriously injure him. A woman who witnessed the incident at the Lake Worth Beach apartment said it sounded “like a 300-pound man was tackling him in the kitchen.” Natalie Dulach said the furry mammal with sharp claws clung to the man’s leg as he fought to get it out. The man managed to lock the long-tailed animal in the bathroom until wildlife officers arrived. A Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission report says the kinkajou was taken to a wildlife facility. Officers didn’t say where it came from.\n\nGeorgia\n\nPalmetto: A small-town grocery store has grown in popularity and sold more Eggo waffles than ever in recent years, thanks to Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” Fans of the ’80s-set sci-fi show have sought out filming locations such as the former Bradley’s Big Buy grocery store since the show premiered in 2016. The third season has prompted more fans to visit Georgia, benefiting local businesses. Fans are dressing up as characters, reenacting scenes and taking photos at a grocery store, a mall, downtown Jackson and more. Creators Matt and Ross Duffer set the series in fictional Hawkins, Indiana, but filmed in Georgia, which offers tax breaks and other film industry incentives. A building on Emory University’s Briarcliff Campus in Atlanta served as the show’s Hawkins Laboratory. In Duluth, crews transformed a vacant wing and food court in Gwinnett Place Mall into Starcourt Mall.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: Officials say an island stream is coming back to life with help from a watershed restoration project. The Garden Island reports the project funded through a state Department of Health grant has produced positive results in the Waipa Stream on Kauai. The effort that began in 2016 aims to remove dense bush from stream banks and surrounding areas while clearing space for native plants. Officials say food forests are taking root, and there is a new swimming hole. The project overseen by the Waipa Foundation has placed fencing around fields to block feral pigs and in pasture land with horses and cows. The fencing keeps the animals out of the water and helps lower bacteria levels below the state threshold for clean streams.\n\nIdaho\n\nMurphy: The largest-ever project in the U.S. to remove thousands of juniper trees to help imperiled sage grouse has started in the state. The Bruneau-Owyhee Sage-Grouse Habitat Project aims to remove junipers on 965 square miles of state and federal land in Owyhee County. Officials say the multiyear project that started this spring could become a template for other western states, as junipers have expanded due to fire-suppression by humans and are taking over vast sagebrush areas and forcing out sage grouse. Sage grouse survival is entirely dependent on sagebrush. Between 200,000 and 500,000 sage grouse remain, down from a peak population of about 16 million. Environmental groups fought the project, contending it was being driven by grazing interests. But federal officials gave final approval earlier this year.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: New security measures will be put in place next month for tours of the governor’s mansion. State Police acting director Brendan Kelly says starting Sept. 3, individuals will have to sign up in advance for tours, provide a photo ID for proof of identity when they arrive, and be screened by metal detectors. Kelly says the measures, adopted after a review of other states’ mansion tour policies, show a commitment to giving mansion guests a safe and welcoming experience. The mansion reopened last year after renovations that cost $15 million. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner spearheaded the renovations because maintenance had been deferred for years. Officials say thousands have visited the mansion since it reopened.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Larry Bird likes the mural but not the tatts. An artist says she’ll remove most tattoos from a large painting of the former NBA star on a multifamily residence in the city. The tattoos include two rabbits mating on his right arm and a spider web on a shoulder. Artist Jules Muck says she was just trying to be funny. The mural is a replica of Bird’s appearance on a 1977 Sports Illustrated cover when he played college ball for Indiana State. Bird’s attorney, Gary Sallee, says the former Indiana Pacers executive “needs to protect” his brand and “doesn’t want to be seen as a tattooed guy.” Muck says an “Indiana” tattoo will remain on Bird’s arm in the mural.\n\nIowa\n\nJohnston: The first waterway access point of the Central Iowa Water Trails project opened Tuesday, with the inaugural launch for a new carry-down access site on Beaver Creek. Entering the creek before the access point was constructed was difficult, Mayor Paula Dierenfeld says. “You used to have to drag a canoe across leaves and mud ... but, now, that’s all changed,” she said. As part of the ceremony, Dierenfeld was one of the first to hit the water in a kayak – something she had never done before, she said as she was getting in. She’s previously only been in canoes. The mayor was also given a ceremonial paddle with “Johnston” inscribed on it. Johnston approved the $350,000 plan last year to build the boat ramp. Next year construction will launch on an access point near Terra Park. The overall project plan is to transform 150 miles of waterways in central Iowa into a recreational amenity.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: The struggling Kansas City T-Bones baseball team is being evicted from its stadium because of unpaid debts. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City Kansas announced Monday that it’s ending its management agreement with the T-Bones and has given the team until Sept. 13 to remove all its property from the publicly owned stadium. The government said in a news release that the T-Bones owed a total of nearly $763,000 in current and past-due utility bills and past-due payments for use of the stadium. The Unified Government said it intends to pursue all remedies to collect the debt. The T-Bones are part of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball and not affiliated with Major League Baseball.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Two Democratic lawmakers say they have a proposal that would eventually more than double the state’s minimum wage. Sen. Reggie Thomas of Lexington and Rep. Kathy Hinkle of Louisa say they’ll introduce the measure in the House and Senate during the 2020 session, and it would gradually raise the state’s minimum wage until it reaches $15 an hour by 2027. The lawmakers say the increase would result in a livable wage for more Kentuckians. Hinkle says the bill is aimed at helping people now juggling two or three jobs to support their families. The minimum wage in Kentucky is $7.25 an hour. Their bill would not apply to businesses with annual gross revenues under $500,000. Previous efforts to raise the minimum wage have died in the Legislature.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLivingston: U.S. Rep. Garret Graves says Livingston Parish will receive a $5.3 million federal grant to fund the elevation of 88 homes that were substantially damaged during the 2016 flood. Graves says the money is part of the $300 million in federal hazard mitigation funds he worked to secure in the months after the flood. Officials say that money is part of the overall $3 billion in federal funding for Louisiana flood protection and drainage improvements. WAFB-TV reports Livingston Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparation Director Mark Harrell said all of the 88 properties will be elevated above the Base Flood Elevation and in compliance with local building ordinances.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The National Endowment for the Humanities is going to help a pair of cultural institutions engage more with the public about the state’s bicentennial. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree says the funding is going to the Maine Humanities Council and the University of Maine, Augusta, both slated to receive $100,000 for public discussion programs. Pingree says the grants will help “lift up diverse voices and increase access to cultural programming for all Mainers.” The Maine Humanities Council plans to use its funding to support programming for Maine’s bicentennial celebration next year. UMA’s funds will help with a 15-part speaker series called “Maine’s Midcentury Moment” that will also be a part of the university’s bicentennial programming.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Scientists in the state have been warning of a growing “dead zone” in the Chesapeake Bay. Now the numbers are in, confirming their dire warnings were correct. Natural Resources Department data shows an area with little to no oxygen spread to 2 cubic miles by late July, making it one of the worst in decades. By comparison, July dead zones averaged about 1.35 cubic miles for the past 35 years. The worst section includes the lower Potomac and Patuxent rivers and much of the bay, from Baltimore to the mouth of the York River. University of Maryland environmental scientists say heavy rains washed wastewater and agricultural runoff into the bay and produced oxygen-stealing algae. Scientists fear it could harm crabs, oysters and the state’s seafood industry.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A state public transit agency is considering a fare-free bus system. The Telegram & Gazette reports the Worcester Regional Transit Authority Advisory Board voted unanimously last week to conduct a fare analysis that includes consideration of a fare-free system. In a report in May, The Research Bureau called the WRTA “a perfect candidate” for a fare-free bus system. The report calculated that the $2 million to $3 million annual cost to provide free service could be made up through cost savings, increased governmental aid and partnerships. The report said offering the service for free would reverse the system’s declining ridership. WRTA Administrator Dennis Lipka says to go fare-free, “we have to find a sustainable way of making that up,” and one-time grants would not be sufficient.\n\nMichigan\n\nEmpire: Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore has welcomed its 50 millionth visitor. The National Park Service says other visitors applauded when Meghan Boertman entered Sleeping Bear’s visitor center in Empire, in northern Michigan west of Traverse City. She was joined by her husband, Spencer, and their children, Jacoby and Levi. It was the first visit for the Boertmans, who live in Norton Shores, near Muskegon. They received an annual park pass, along with a plush black bear, souvenir books and a DVD. Officials say the milestone comes a year ahead of Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore’s 50th anniversary. Visitor statistics are culled from road, visitor center and campground counters as well as North and South Manitou islands.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state’s film and TV production incentive program is changing after questions were raised about past awards, including $267,000 for Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight Show.” Minnesota Public Radio News reports the board that runs the Snowbate program announced the changes Monday. Awards would not go to shows built around a national event in Minnesota, nor to projects featuring political candidates. The idea is to fund projects that rely most on in-state workers or feature Minnesota prominently. MPR reported last month that some Minnesota Film and TV board members had questioned the rebate for Fallon’s show to come to Minneapolis during the 2018 Super Bowl. Questions were also raised last fall about a documentary on politician Ilhan Omar.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The University of Mississippi will open a new $32 million campus recreation center this month. The center will include workout space, an indoor climbing wall, fitness studios, basketball courts and other facilities. It’s in a former warehouse of a Whirlpool appliance factory that closed in 2009. Ole Miss began construction in 2016. Campus recreation director Peter Tulchinsky says the new center will accommodate a student population that has doubled since 1983, when Ole Miss opened the Turner Center, its existing recreation facility. The Turner Center will remain open. Ole Miss is basing its parking and transportation department at the center south of Mississippi 6, creating a bus hub and a 700-space parking lot. The center is free for students. Faculty, staff, alumni and community members must buy memberships.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge has temporarily blocked a new state law that sought to shield large hog, poultry and cattle farms from stringent local health rules. Cole County Presiding Judge Patricia Joyce’s action means the measure won’t take effect as scheduled Aug. 28. Critics of the law have requested it remain on hold through a Sept. 16 court date. If implemented, it would prevent local officials from passing more stringent regulations than the state on large farms. It’s directed at protecting the interests of industrial farms known as concentrated animal feeding operations, which can produce beef, pork, poultry, dairy and eggs more efficiently than traditional farms can but also stoke concerns about air and water pollution.\n\nMontana\n\nTwo Dot: U.S. Forest Service officials have reached a deal with a landowner meant to increase public access to the eastern side of the Crazy Mountains. The Great Falls Tribune reports the Forest Service will allow landowner Mac White motorized access across public land to reach isolated parcels he owns. In return, the Forest Service will get an easement to build a trail into the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest. That will allow access from the eastern side of the southwestern Montana mountain range into the remote Big Elk Canyon. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports that work will also begin on a new trail on the western side of the Crazy Mountains next week. The project is meant to reroute and replace parts of a trail where access had been in dispute.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Officials are moving 24 teenage girls out of a state-run facility for female juvenile offenders after learning that many were confined to buildings with fire hazards, holes in the wall, and mold and water damage. The Department of Health and Human Services announced the move Monday after some state lawmakers voiced concerns about the conditions and a lack of staff and programming at the Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center in Geneva. The campus in rural central Nebraska serves as a rehabilitation center for girls ages 14-18 who have broken the law and been rejected by other private treatment facilities. All of the 24 girls who live on campus were sent there by the courts as a last resort, and many have significant behavioral and mental health problems.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Burning Man Project has announced it will be hosting a ticketed conference in the city next year. The May 6-9 conference, dubbed “Learning Man,” aims to explore how Burners can “build bridges between our realities and work to create a better world.” Tickets will go on sale in October. The organization has not released the ticket pricing, nor the location of the conference, but says it will be far from a boring, nametag convention. More than 1,500 creators, connectors and cultural ambassadors from the Burning Man community and beyond will gather to “ideate, learn, build networks, and support thriving year-round communities made stronger by their intelligent and conscious integration of Burning Man culture,” a statement says.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDerry: Town officials are trying to figure out how a recently opened time capsule from 50 years ago has nothing in it. Library director Cara Potter tells WMUR-TV that since she started there five years ago, the safe has been sitting on a shelf. Before that, it was kept at the old municipal building in town. The combination was on the back of the safe. Potter said it took several tries to get it open recently on the 50th anniversary of when it was sealed in 1969. But it was empty. No one has a list of what was originally put inside. Officials said they have no idea who could have opened it and taken the items. They even speculated that nothing was put in there in the first place.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: A young girl discovered something slithery at an airport security checkpoint – a 15-inch-long snake. Transportation Security Administration officials at Newark Liberty International Airport said in a release that it appears the thin, black snake with a yellow ring around its neck was forgotten by a traveler Monday night. The girl alerted a TSA officer, and a gray checkpoint bin was placed over the snake that officials said was harmless. Officials closed the security lane temporarily, and Port Authority police took the snake away. New Jersey Federal Security Director Tom Carter says Newark has a robust lost-and-found system, but the owner of the snake should not call them or expect to be reunited with the reptile. It’s unclear where the snake was taken.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A new report says the state is now on track to collect an unprecedented $7.8 billion in the budget year thanks to skyrocketing oil production. According to the Albuquerque Journal, the report says total state revenue collections were roughly $273 million above projected levels through April largely because of oil production in southeastern New Mexico. The higher-than-expected revenue surge for the budget year that ended June 30 could allow for additional spending increases on public schools, roads and other programs. Legislative and executive economists will release new official revenue estimates at a legislative hearing in Red River later this month. New Mexico was already expecting a $1.3 billion budget surplus for the fiscal year.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A landmark Pepsi sign along the East River will also promote JetBlue for the next six weeks, and critics are finding it hard to swallow. An illuminated blue logo advertising the airline was added to the 60-foot Pepsi-Cola sign in Long Island City, Queens, this week. The new signage celebrates a partnership in which JetBlue will serve PepsiCo drinks on flights. The city Landmarks Preservation Commission issued a permit for the JetBlue logo through Oct. 1. But City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, a Democrat who represents the area, says some constituents are complaining. Van Bramer says that even a temporary JetBlue sign “shouldn’t be there.” Nancy Rooney, a PepsiCo vice president of marketing, says the iconic Pepsi-Cola sign is “the perfect symbol” to celebrate Pepsi’s JetBlue partnership.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislation that prohibits production and possession of smokable hemp next year while laying regulatory groundwork to expand the state’s industrial and medicinal hemp industry has cleared a second legislative chamber. The state House voted 63-48 on Wednesday for the General Assembly’s annual farm bill. Smokable hemp lacks the concentration of the compound that gives marijuana its high. But law enforcement wants smokable hemp banned because it looks and smells the same – making it otherwise impossible to differentiate during police stops. House members defeated an amendment to delete the proposed May 1 smokable hemp ban. Hemp growers say smokable hemp is an emerging moneymaker for them. The bill now returns to the Senate, where a version already passed, but the measure’s top backer wants the ban delayed until next June.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Lawsuits from environmentalists and landowners have made investors skittish and delayed progress another year on the proposed $800 million oil refinery near Theodore Roosevelt National Park, the developer’s top executive says. Meridian wants to build the refinery just 3 miles from the state’s top tourist attraction, drawing more than 700,000 visitors annually. Environmental groups argue pollution from the factory will spoil scenery and air quality at the 30,000-acre park. Meridian began site work last summer, aiming to have the Davis Refinery operating by mid-2021. Meridian Energy Group CEO William Prentice says the company now plans to have the factory running in 2022 due to funding and legal setbacks. Securities filings show the company has raised less than 5% of construction costs. And the company has two disputes pending before the state Supreme Court.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: Comedian and Buckeye State native Dave Chappelle is coming home to host the Gem City Shine block party from 4 to 10 p.m. Sunday. The Oregon District Benefit Concert and Community Event will be hosted by the Yellow Springs native. The Oregon District is where a shooter killed nine people Aug. 4. Local and national entertainment will be featured on the main stage during the block party, according to a release. The event will be used to honor the lives of people lost and “reclaim the community’s favorite places to shop, dine and enjoy time with family and friends,” according to the news release from Downtown Dayton Partnership. There will be opportunities at the block party to donate to The Dayton Foundation’s Oregon District Tragedy Fund and the Oregon District Business Association.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A judge is expected to rule next week on whether consumer products company Johnson & Johnson helped fuel the state’s opioid epidemic in the first such case against a drugmaker to go to trial. A court spokesman says Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman is expected to read his decision in open court at 3 p.m. Monday. Before the six-week trial began May 28 , two other groups of defendants who manufactured opioid drugs reached settlements with Oklahoma. The state claims the companies helped create a public nuisance by aggressively marketing painkillers and downplaying the risk of addiction. The state estimates it will cost as much as $17 billion to abate the crisis. Attorneys for the company maintain they acted responsibly and followed strict industry regulations.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A free legal assistance program for immigrants in the city has provided nearly 350 people with lawyers to represent them in deportation hearings in its first year. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the program called Universal Reception also helped at least 105 people apply for refugee status. Portland’s City Council approved the service last year and put $500,000 toward its budget from property tax collections. This year, Multnomah County allocated $290,000 to the initiative, and the state approved an additional $2 million to expand the service statewide – the first state to do so in the nation. The people who have received free legal services through the program come from Colombia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, Iran, Iraq, Mexico, Nicaragua, Russia, Ukraine and Venezuela.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A committee of Pennsylvania Game Commission staff has recommended a statewide ban on feeding white-tailed deer. The agency biologists say that banning artificial feeding stations would help slow the spread of wildlife diseases. They’re asking residents to voluntarily stop feeding deer. The commission often addresses wildlife outbreaks of insect-borne infections, West Nile virus and other flare-ups, but its scientists are most concerned about chronic wasting disease in deer. The neurological disorder is fatal, and exposure cannot be detected until shortly before the deer’s death. The disease has spread to herds in 23 states. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports that municipalities that have proposed feeding bans in the past have faced opposition and eventually abandoned the idea after backlash from voters who enjoy the pastime.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state ethics commission has decided to open a formal investigation into Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo’s dealings with the company that runs the state’s lottery. The Rhode Island Republican Party filed a complaint. WPRI-TV reports the commission voted Tuesday to open the investigation. Brandon Bell, special counsel for the party, alleges Raimondo violated state law by negotiating and entering into a tentative agreement with International Game Technology to extend its services until 2043 without going through a competitive bid process. Jonathan Berkon, a lawyer for Raimondo, says they’re confident the commission will find this “latest partisan complaint has no merit.” Raimondo and legislative leaders announced the proposed terms in June. The deal needs legislative approval.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Population growth and crowded highways have paved the way for a passenger ferry service in the area that’s expected to begin in October. The Post and Courier reports the Daniel Island Ferry is expected to carry up to 49 passengers from a Wando River dock near Children’s Park on Daniel Island to the Charleston Peninsula. There will be stops at the Charleston Maritime Center and Joe Riley Waterfront Park. It won’t be the first time Daniel Island residents have been able to commute by boat to the peninsula, but it would be the first regular commercial ferry service the area has seen in decades. Last year, Charleston Water Taxi temporarily offered a commuter schedule when the James B. Edwards Bridge between Daniel Island and Mount Pleasant was shut down.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The city is expected to lose more than $2 million in state funding over the next two years following the congressional repeal of South Dakota’s tax on internet service. The 2016 Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which required the state to stop taxing internet services by mid-2020, is projected to lead to a $700,000 loss in state funding next year and $1.4 million the following year for Rapid City. The South Dakota Municipal League estimates it will result in a total revenue dip of $7 million to $10 million for all of the state’s municipalities by 2021. The tax applies to retailers that conduct more than $100,000 worth of business in South Dakota annually or more than 200 transactions a year.\n\nTennessee\n\nTownsend: The Great Smoky Mountains National Park has received what it calls a “priceless” donation of Cades Cove artifacts. The cove was a thriving community before the National Park Service began purchasing the land in 1927. Dan and Sidney Lawson were two of its residents. According to the park, Dan Lawson led singing at the Methodist Church, and Sidney Lawson helped to educate children in the cove. Their cabin is preserved as part of the Cades Cove Historic Landscape. Now their great-granddaughter Robin Derryberry, of Chattanooga, has donated a handmade dresser, a family Bible, and wedding and other portraits. Derryberry says her family wants the items to be in a place where they can be enjoyed by the public and preserved for future generations.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: NASA is flying drones over the city to test the safety of the unmanned devices in a dense urban environment. The tests this month in Corpus Christi are part of a four-year project with the Federal Aviation Administration to develop a national drone traffic management system. NASA says in a news release that the drones are flying at altitudes between 200 and 400 feet. It says a city presents obstacles that can reduce line of sight and hinder communication. Urban weather conditions can hamper flight, and cities often lack safe landing options. NASA spokesman Darryl Waller said Tuesday that the agency is gathering and reviewing data with the aim of addressing these issues. He said the Corpus Christi testing has gone well and will conclude Friday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is reminding members that coffee is prohibited no matter how fancy the name, that vaping is banned despite the alluring flavors and that marijuana is outlawed unless prescribed by a competent doctor. The new guidance in the August issue of a youth magazine for members of the Utah-based church doesn’t include any fundamental changes to the religion’s strict health code. But the significant clarifications seem to reflect growing concern about young Latter-day Saints’ adherence to the rules. The article says it aims to clarify issues that could be confusing to young people about the religion’s “Word of Wisdom,” a set of rules about foods and drinks. The article warns that drinks with names that include the terms cafe, caffe, mocha, latte or espresso or that end in -ccino usually have coffee in them.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The Vermont Agency of Transportation is planning to start a program to provide residents in recovery with transportation assistance. Ross MacDonald, public transit coordinator for the agency, says the program will be first introduced in Rutland and the Northeast Kingdom and will work in cooperation with recovery centers and transportation providers. The goal is to help residents having trouble getting to treatment appointments or to and from their employment. The Rutland Herald reports the recovery centers will contact the regional transit center for clients to see if any trip costs are covered through eligible health care programs. If it is not covered, the recovery center will use its allocation and budget to pay for the trip. The Federal Transit Administration has provided $160,000 to fund the program.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The city is suing the state in an attempt to remove an 80-foot Confederate monument from its downtown. The city of Norfolk’s suit, filed in federal court, targets a Virginia law that prevents the removal of war memorials. The suit claims the city’s free speech rights are being violated because it’s being forced to project a message it no longer supports. The 1907 monument was erected at a time when the South was being romanticized and slavery was de-emphasized. Council members voted in 2017 to move the monument to a cemetery. University of Virginia law professor Richard Schragger said Norfolk is employing a relatively novel and untested legal strategy in federal court. The main legal question is whether cities have free speech rights.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A new federal lawsuit seeks to establish a “protection zone” for endangered orcas in the Pacific Northwest. The Center for Biological Diversity and the Orca Relief Citizens’ Alliance sued NOAA Fisheries in U.S. District Court in Seattle, saying the agency has failed to act on a petition it filed in 2016 that sought to bar vessels from a 10- to 12-square-mile area west of San Juan Island where the orcas feed from April through September each year. Canada has already announced that no vessel traffic will be allowed from June through October in three sanctuary zones in prime orca feeding habitat. Advocates say vessel noise interferes with the echolocation the orcas use to hunt. The whales are struggling with a dearth of their preferred prey, Chinook salmon.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Can a governor be forced to live in the capital city? A persistent lawsuit seeking to do just that with Gov. Jim Justice was back in a courtroom Wednesday. The Republican billionaire has been frequently criticized by members of both major parties for being absent from the statehouse. A Democratic lawmaker’s lawsuits have accused Justice of violating a passage of the state Constitution that says the governor “shall reside at the seat of government.” The result has been a legal back-and-forth on the definition of the word “reside.” There are also issues on the authority and ability of the courts to chaperone the whereabouts of the state’s chief executive. Wednesday’s hearing rehashed some of those questions. After a short discussion, a circuit court judge extended the case by asking for more documents from Justice’s legal team and Del. Isaac Sponaugle, who filed the suit.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Milwaukee Bucks now have an official team chocolate milk. The Bucks and the state’s cult-favorite gas station and convenience store Kwik Trip partnered up on the chocolate milk, the pair announced in a news release Wednesday. The chocolate milk with a green label and Milwaukee Bucks logo will be available at all Wisconsin Kwik Trip locations beginning Oct. 1. The team’s official milk will also be served at the Bucks’ training center and the Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin Sports Science Center. The 16-ounce bottles come in 1% and whole milk. The milk comes from Kwik Trip’s Nature’s Touch brand.

The Casper Star-Tribune reports the state’s Select Committee on Tribal Relations passed draft bill language Monday and asked the Corporations, Elections & Political Subdivisions Committee to sponsor the legislation this fall. State lawmakers say the proposed bill would allow driver’s license numbers and Social Security numbers to be printed on tribal ID cards, allowing tribal citizens to use one card when registering to vote. Officials say federal law states a tribal ID can currently be used to vote if presented with a driver’s license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/14/carney-charts-familiar-course-governor-run/75541174/", "title": "John Carney charts familiar course in Delaware governor run", "text": "Jonathan Starkey\n\nThe News Journal\n\nCongressman John Carney is back in a familiar position – next in line to win Delaware's top political office.\n\nIt was eight years ago when Carney, 59, first staked a claim on the governorship, only to end up on the wrong side of a bruising Democratic primary battle.\n\nThis time around, Carney's path to power could not be clearer. He has cornered Democratic support in a deeply blue state, quickly raising more than $200,000 and capitalizing on three decades of government experience to secure the backing of virtually all of Delaware's top Democratic officeholders.\n\nAmong his most vocal supporters is Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, the same politician who in 2008 rejected pleas from Democratic Party leaders hoping to avoid a primary contest and went on to beat Carney that September and Republican Bill Lee in the general election.\n\nNow, a year from Election Day, no other Democratic candidates seem interested in challenging Carney, a tested candidate who has won five statewide elections as lieutenant governor and congressman.\n\n\"The experience, the number of times he's been on the ballot statewide, there is a comfort level that Democratic primary voters in Delaware have with Carney,\" said Erik Raser-Schramm, a longtime Delaware Democratic operative.\n\nEven Republicans are wary of launching a challenge.\n\nCarney's front-runner status is so cemented that Delaware Sen. Colin Bonini, the favorite to earn the Republican nomination, may walk away from his earlier expressed intentions to seek the Republican nomination for governor. Two Republican sources close to Bonini said he is instead eyeing a campaign for lieutenant governor, where he might have a greater chance against lesser-known statewide politicians.\n\nBonini's own internal polling shows him down more than 20 points against Carney, hardly surprising in a state where registration figures show there are 125,000 more Democratic voters than Republicans. Democrats control registration in all but a few conservative districts in Harrington, Selbyville, Greenville and Pike Creek.\n\nIn some areas of Kent and New Castle counties, Republicans are outnumbered by voters who do not identify with either of the major parties.\n\n“My message is going to be, if you like things the way they are, vote for John. If you think things need to move in a different direction, I’m asking for your vote,\" Bonini said recently, discussing his campaign strategy.\n\nDelaware's open 2016 governor race is the most significant, but will likely not be the most competitive, on next year's ballots. Three Democrats and two Republicans already are seeking Carney's congressional seat in Washington. Primary elections are scheduled for Sept. 13, with the general election nearly two months later on Nov. 8.\n\nThe Carper connection\n\nCarney's Delaware's political pedigree is unmatched among 2016 candidates – even if his executive branch experience says little about how he would address the political challenges of 2015, including a slow-growing economy and financial uncertainty in Legislative Hall.\n\nHe was deputy chief of staff and finance secretary to then Gov. Tom Carper in the 1990s, brokering tax deals and leading the administration's efforts in 1995 to secure the purchase of the Port of Wilmington from the city.\n\nCarney still draws on support from his time in Carper's office, when he worked alongside a tight-knit group of Democrats who have played significant roles in Delaware government and politics over the past three decades.\n\nCarney was hired into state government by Carper's chief of staff, Jeff Bullock, who was later tapped as Markell's secretary of state, a key Cabinet position that protects Delaware's billion-dollar brand as a leading legal home for U.S. corporations.\n\n\"I always admired his work ethic and his dedication to the job,\" Bullock said recently. \"When you're in a governor's office, you're asked to do a variety of different roles ... running the government day-to-day and carrying out the governor's agenda. So you need somebody who can take complex problems, figure them out and then implement whatever the solution is. That's John's greatest strength.\"\n\nDelaware Chief Justice Leo Strine, a lawyer in Carper's governor office, remains close to Carney, too, though he would not be interviewed for this story. He could be a key ally on criminal justice and other issues if Carney wins the governor's office. Two Democrats running to replace Carney in Congress also worked in the Carper administration. Delaware Rep. Bryon Short, a state lawmaker since 2007, was a young constituent relations aide and later a transportation official. Lisa Blunt Rochester served in Carper's Cabinet as labor secretary.\n\nAfter his tenure as a key Carper aide, Carney won two terms as Delaware's lieutenant governor, presiding over the state Senate and forging deeper bonds in the Delaware General Assembly. Since his defeat in the 2008 governor race, he has won three terms to Congress.\n\nThere are critical questions about how Carney would govern in 2016, a time of waning tax collections and exploding costs in health care and public education that are forcing difficult budget discussions in Dover.\n\nHis tenure in the Carper administration was vastly different, marked by a wealth of resources and a booming economy.\n\nThe DuPont Co. employed more than 20,000 people in Delaware. Gambling taxes poured into state coffers, increasing 371 percent during Carney's time in the Carper administration with the introduction of slot machines to Delaware's racetracks. And a roaring stock market meant millions more in revenue from new Delaware corporations.\n\nDuring his first year with Carper, in 1994, Delaware state spending rose 11.5 percent. \"I've told members of my Cabinet that we're not going to have this kind of spending growth in the future,\" Carper told reporters after midnight on July 1, 1994, after lawmakers passed the budget in Dover.\n\nEarly look: Delaware's 2016 political races\n\nBig challenges await next governor\n\nDelaware financial records show spending grew on average 8.9 percent through the second half of the 1990s under Carper, with Carney helping lead the charge. As finance secretary, Carney gained favor in the General Assembly by brokering budget deals that included dramatic tax cuts paired with increases in spending.\n\nIn 1999, lawmakers and the Carper administration enacted sweeping personal income tax cuts, gave tax breaks to seniors and raised spending 18 percent over two years, directing millions more to public education, Delaware's colleges and universities, prisons and the state bureaucracy.\n\nPredictably, the largesse won Carney friends on both sides of the political aisle in Dover. \"He was a good negotiating partner and certainly a man who comes ready to work,\" said Wayne Smith, the former Republican majority leader of the Delaware House of Representatives who negotiated budget deals with Carney. \"He tends to be moderate in his views, which I think makes him more of a centrist. That's what you want in a governor.\"\n\nSmith noted that, financially, the times have changed. Lawmakers negotiated past 4 a.m. on July 1 to balance this year's budget, tapping more than $30 million in one-time financial settlement money to cover just 2.6 percent higher operational spending.\n\n\"The tenor of the times could not be more different,\" Smith said. \"Back then we had more money than we knew what to do with.\"\n\nCarney would not agree to an interview, saying he remains focused on his work in Washington and is not ready to discuss his plans for the governor's office or his approach to problems in Dover. \"The congressman is focused on his work in Washington on behalf of the people who elected him,\" said Jessica Borcky, a spokeswoman for the Carney campaign. \"There will be plenty of time in the future to talk about the governor's race.\"\n\nCarney had not lost his bug for big spending by his second term in the lieutenant governor's office. During his last bid for governor, Carney proposed a universal health care program, funded with extensive Delaware taxpayer subsidies, but failed to identify a detailed price tag.\n\nHis plan included a \"major expansion\" of Medicaid, additional state insurance assistance for low-to-moderate-income families, and, to help foot the bill, higher taxes on cigarettes and businesses that failed to offer insurance to their employees. Delaware families of four making up to $103,250 might have qualified for new assistance.\n\nWith the passage of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, in 2010, the federal government made similar changes, including a Medicaid expansion paid for primarily at the federal level. \"I would hope that after a few years, we would be closer if not fully transitioned to universal health care for everyone,\" Carney said in rolling out his plan in October 2007.\n\nElecting Democrats they know\n\nKey Carney allies insist he is ready for the job and is uniquely qualified to negotiate deals in Legislative Hall.\n\n\"The hardest job in the government is being governor. He's coming back to accept that responsibility. He could have taken that train for the next 20 years,\" said Robert Gillian, the former Democratic House speaker who worked with Carney in the Legislature. \"He understands finances. He knows how to put a budget together, and he knows how to work with people. All those things are going to help him.\"\n\nCarper said Carney was an important member of his administration in the 1990s. He said Carney built relationships in Dover and was critical in negotiating a 1995 deal that secured the purchase of the Port of Wilmington, a move that had been panned by labor leaders in the city.\n\n“People in Delaware are fortunate that a person with his abilities and his integrity is willing to make this run. I respect him greatly,” Carper said in an interview.\n\nOn balance, Carney's political experience looks like an advantage. Delawareans already have a propensity to not only elect Democrats, but Democrats they know.\n\nFormer Delaware Gov. Ruth Ann Minner, who served in Delaware’s top office from 2001 to 2009, had been lieutenant governor during Carper’s eight years as governor in the 1990s. Delaware Attorney General Matt Denn was a lawyer for Minner, before winning two terms as lieutenant governor and securing the attorney general's post last November.\n\nIt is telling that Markell was considered an insurgent, outsider candidate in 2008, even after he served for a decade as Delaware's elected state treasurer.\n\n“It’s a little bit depressing for folks who might be on the outside and what we would call first-generation candidates,” Hoff said. “How do you get to the threshold of name recognition? Or come up with donors who can put you in the big leagues for funding of a serious campaign?”\n\nIt's a question that could play out in the 2016 race to replace Carney in Congress. Delaware Sen. Bryan Townsend, a Newark Democrat and corporate lawyer in Wilmington, has rallied the support of younger Democrats, but has less institutional backing than Short and Rochester, both of whom worked for Carper's gubernatorial administration.\n\nTownsend wears his independence as a badge of honor.\n\n\"People have reached out to me and said I'm very glad I'm not the next man up on someone's bench. People do want a fresh and independent approach to things,\" Townsend said.\n\nOn the Republican side, the situation is even more difficult for first-time candidates without deep political roots here like those propelling Carney's campaign. When Ken Simpler won the 2014 state treasurer's race, he became the first non-incumbent to win statewide office in two decades.\n\n“It has always struck me that it’s not necessarily beneficial to have a group of people who have not ever worked outside of government, running government,” Simpler said recently. “I think I bring some ideas different to the table because I didn’t grow up around the same water cooler.”\n\nContact Jonathan Starkey at (302) 983-6756, on Twitter @jwstarkey or at jstarkey@delawareonline.com.\n\nJohn Carney rakes in $200K at Hotel du Pont fundraiser\n\nFrom staff assistant to gubernatorial candidate\n\nCongressman John Carney, 59, of Wilmington, has risen through the ranks of political positions and is now running for Delaware governor.\n\n1986-1989: Staff assistant, Office of U.S. Sen.

Development, from busy McGalliard Road to downtown, was Muncie's top story in 2014\n\nThis was the year Muncie grew.\n\nThe city's boundaries didn't expand, but 2014 felt like a year when the city's horizons broadened.\n\nNew development downtown, along McGalliard Road and near Ball State University and even at the city's southern edge made it seem like Muncie was one big construction zone this year. It made getting around a little dicey at times.\n\nBut it was all in the name of progress.\n\nThere was little new development as visible as the Muncie Marketplace shopping center along McGalliard Road. For months, thousands of cars each day drove past where a nine-acre property, formerly home to a car dealership, was being redeveloped.\n\nThen, on the last day of September, a high school band, Charlie Cardinal and Mayor Dennis Tyler turned out for the grand opening of Dick's Sporting Goods. City officials — who approved $2 million in incentives for the $12-million development — had said their hope was that the private development would bring to Muncie businesses that were not already here and that might keep locals from driving to the Indianapolis area to spend their money.\n\nDick's was followed by the Michaels crafts store, Men's Wearhouse and AT&T and, in the weeks to come, Five Below, Jersey Mike's Subs and McAlister's Deli. With the exception of the phone store, none previously had a presence locally.\n\nYou didn't have to locate in Muncie Marketplace if you wanted to open along McGalliard Road in 2014: Eateries like Culver's and Firehouse Subs joined Muncie's restaurant row.\n\nIf you ventured off McGalliard Road in 2014 and along University Avenue, you saw the massive Village Promenade project. One of its two buildings was wrapped around a city parking garage and together the $60-million private investment offered more than 200 apartments for more than 500 people — mostly Ball State University students — and 20,000 square feet of commercial space that's already home to the Brothers sports bar and restaurant.\n\nNew development and redevelopment was sprinkled around Muncie in 2014, including the southside traffic roundabout, which opened this fall. And more will come in 2015, including an overhaul of South Madison Street that officials hope will revitalize the once-vibrant commercial corridor.\n\nBut at the heart of the city, in downtown, the most significant development of 2014 — and potentially 2015 — is the Courtyard by Marriott hotel and city parking garage on High Street. The project — priced at $40 million when you count a city railroad quiet zone — will not only serve the Horizon Convention Center but will be a first-of-its-kind hospitality industry training center for people with intellectual and development disabilities.\n\nThe Arc of Indiana teaching hotel is touted by its backers for its potential not only to serve visitors to the community when it opens in December 2015 but also help a greatly under-served population: the disabled, whose work and life options are now severely limited by a lack of job training.\n\nIn a year marked by growth for Muncie, it might turn out that the possibility for personal growth for our most vulnerable family members, friends and neighbors might be the biggest story of all.\n\n2. 'Looks like we're on the same team now'\n\nAfter the difficult task of spearheading the consolidation of Central and Southside high schools into Central High School, longtime educator Tim Heller, superintendent of Muncie Community Schools, announced his retirement effective June 30, 2015.\n\nThe financially distressed school corporation also is searching for a new chief financial officer after Chip Mehaffey burned out on the job after only half a year.\n\nBefore the merger, two former Purdue University football players — current Washington Redskin Ryan Kerrigan, a Central graduate, and former New England Patriot Brandon Gorin, a Southside graduate — teamed up for a \"One Muncie\" video.\n\n\"Looks like we're on the same team now,\" Gorin said.\n\nDuring a ceremony, the flag at Southside High School was lowered for the last time, and the school was transformed into Southside Middle School, to which the state board of education awarded a grade of \"F\" in its annual school accountability report. Central, meanwhile, earned a \"B.\"\n\nIn another uplifting moment, the combined Spirit of South and Bearcat Pride marching bands performed at the IPL 500 Festival Parade before the Indianapolis 500.\n\nAnxiety over the potential of brawls at the new Central High School proved to be \"totally unfounded,\" Principal Tom Jarvis said recently. \"We've had very few scuffles, and those were not not Central versus South, just in the neighborhood (disagreements) brought to school with them. It's been very peaceful. The kids have been great.\"\n\nBefore his exit, Mehaffey discovered nearly $20,000 in unaccounted for/misappropriated/diverted funds from athletic ticket sales at Central High School, leading to the termination of secretary Angela Mock. She denied any wrongdoing, but the Indiana attorney general's office demanded that she repay the money.\n\nAppraisers determined that the market value of 19-year-old Wilson Middle School, which was abandoned during consolidation, is no more than $700,000. The assessed value of the 58-acre property for taxing purposes is $14.7 million, though the school is exempt from property taxes.\n\n3. BSU investment scams still mysterious\n\nAs 2014 wound down, the public still had been given no clue as to the motivations of the former Ball State University employee who lost $13.1 million of university funds to two investment scam artists.\n\nThat's because no civil or criminal litigation has been brought against the ex-employee, Gale Prizevoits, the director of cash and investments who was fired in 2011 for concealing the fraudulent investments from her supervisors. She wouldn't talk to The Star Press.\n\nOthers whose names surfaced as a result of a federal investigation that started in Manhattan either have been convicted, sued, disbarred or bankrupted, including George Ceasar Montolio, Bronx, N.Y. (wire fraud); Seth Beoku Betts, Boynton Beach, Fla. (securities fraud); attorney Jon Divens, Beverly Hills, Calif. (disbarred); Peter Sollenne, San Diego (bankrupt); Fred Todd, aka Rabbi Fishel Todd, Lakewood, N.J. (wire fraud and transacting in criminal proceeds); George Charles Cody Price (sued for fraud); and attorney H. Bruce Abbott, San Diego (sued for fraud).\n\nPrizevoits had direct dealings with Betts, who falsely claimed to be a college graduate, and Montolio, whose attorney said in reference to Ball State, \"Mr. Montolio advertised on the Internet that he had certain things for sale to sell, which of course he didn't, and got money from whoever was foolish enough to order these things from him.\"\n\nBetween them, Betts and Montolio spent BSU's investment dollars on beachfront property, luxury automobiles, Mickey Mantle/Mike Tyson sports memorabilia and other property. Ball State could receive several hundred thousands dolalrs in restitution from Betts and Montolio.\n\nThrough September, the university had spent more than $170,000 in legal fees that it declined to itemize in response to an Access to Public Records Act request from The Star Press, citing attorney-client privilege.\n\nThe university has not sued Prizevoits or anyone else. But BSU officials said they hired Deb Daniels, an ex-federal prosecutor, to gather and turn over any criminal evidence implicating Prizevoits to Delaware County Prosecutor Jeff Arnold. He and Daniels have been playing phone/email tag. This past week, Arnold told The Star Press there is nothing new to report.\n\n4. Tabbs sentenced in child's death\n\nOne of the community's more shocking stories of 2013 involved the brutal slaying of a 5-year-old girl.\n\nIn 2014, two Muncie residents received lengthy prison terms for their roles in the events that led to the death of Marie Pierre.\n\nIn May, a jury found 30-year-old Charlene Tabb — the young victim's cousin — guilty of murder, neglect of a dependent resulting in death and eight other charges stemming from her abuse and neglect of her three younger siblings.\n\nTestimony indicated Tabb — later sentenced to 87 years in prison — encouraged her siblings to participate in her repeated torture and abuse of their cousin. The children had moved from Florida to live with Tabb and her husband, Marcus, in 2012.\n\nIn October, another jury found Marcus Tabb, 55, guilty of neglect and other charges based on the same allegations. Tabb, who made video recordings of his wife beating her siblings with an electrical cord, was accused of failing to report, or take any actions to stop, the abuse that caused Marie's death.\n\nDuring both trials, jurors were moved to tears by photos of the young victim's body, which a pathologist said had more than 80 cuts, bruises and burns, in various stages of healing, when she died.\n\nCharlene Tabb's youngest two siblings, ages 14 and 11 at the time of the 2013 slaying, are being prosecuted as juveniles for their roles in Marie's abuse.\n\n5. BSU hires 'evolutionary' new president\n\nPaul W. Ferguson hasn't made a lot of waves as Ball State University's 15th president, but he's only served in the position for five months.\n\nRick Hall, chairman of the trustees, said Ferguson will be an \"evolutionary\" president, not a \"revolutionary\" one, because Ball State is already in \"great shape.\"\n\nHall told The Star Press, \"His experience allows us to continue the positive momentum. He's an experienced captain. Jo Ann Gora left us a really strong foundation. But he's not just going to mind the store. He's a leader. He will bring fresh ideas. He will take us to the next level and help us further get the message out about the impact of Ball State on Indiana's economy.\"\n\nLured away from the presidency at the state flagship University of Maine, Ferguson is the first scientist to lead BSU, a well-timed move as the school embarks on growth in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education, research funding and up-to-date science classrooms/labs.\n\nBefore landing at UMaine as president less than three years ago, Ferguson taught in Louisiana, returned to California as a toxicologist for a Los Angeles petroleum company, then went back into teaching in Louisiana. He was later a professor, dean and vice president for research at UNLV and a professor and provost at the Edwardsville campus of Southern Illinois University.\n\n\"He's got lots of experience, an easy demeanor and works well with people,\" trustee Tom Bracken said.\n\nThe faculty loved him at the fall convocation. His talk drew applause, laughter and a standing ovation. The faculty's first impression of him was that he warm, personable and, for an administrator, funny.\n\n\"He doesn't sound like a guy who's caught up in mindless metrics,\" said James McClure, a professor of economics. \"That's not typical. If he's a typical guy, he doesn't sound like it.\"\n\n6. Fatal blaze claims life of 3-year-old boy\n\nClayton Carnes, his mother would recall, loved to ride his bicycle, take his puppy on walks and make his baby brother laugh.\n\nOn May 8, Clayton, who was 3 years old, died when a fire broke out in a house in the 1700 block of South Daly Avenue.\n\nClayton's mother, carrying her 16-month-old son, was able to escape from the burning structure through a bedroom window. But Clayton's position in another part of the house, and the intensity of the flames, made a rescue impossible.\n\nAn autopsy confirmed the youngster died of smoke inhalation. His puppy, Woody, died at his side.\n\nIn September, Robert Mead, chief investigator for the Muncie Fire Department, said the specific cause of the blaze would likely never be determined, adding there was nothing to suggest it was anything but an accident.\n\n7. The long, cold winter of 2014\n\nThe winter of 2014 was a tough one, no doubt about it.\n\nRepeated bouts of snow and subzero temperatures delayed school for days on end at times. During one weekend storm in early January, snow fell at a rate of more than an inch per hour in Muncie, and the combination of snowfall, arctic cold and wind prompted Ball State University to delay the reopening of campus after the holiday break.\n\nStatewide, the average temperature this past January was 19.1 degrees, almost 7 degrees below the normal level, while February's average temp of 21.7 degrees was almost 9 degrees below normal. January 2014 actually tied with 1982 as the state's eighth coldest January since 1895, according to National Weather Service reports.\n\nDavid Call, a severe weather expert at Ball State University, told The Star Press that only six days in February did Muncie temperatures reached above-average levels.\n\nThe official arrival of spring didn't seem to bring much relief, with cold temps lingering\n\nStaffers at Prairie Creek Reservoir rushed to install piers in time for the May 1 start of boating season after that work was delayed by ice.\n\nThe winter's cold and snow even delayed the start of swim season, with some public pools, including Muncie's Tuhey Pool, delaying the start of regular weekday hours post-Memorial Day weekend opening because schools were still in session well into the start of June to make up for all the class time lost to snow cancellations.\n\n8. Missing persons: One found, two still gone\n\nThere's nothing more painful than uncertainty over a missing loved one, except perhaps the discovery that the loved one had died under mysterious circumstances.\n\nThree Muncie-area people were missing for weeks and in some cases months in 2014. One was found, although the mystery didn't have a happy ending, and two were still gone as the year came to a close.\n\nBrianna DiBattiste, a 25-year-old Dunkirk woman, went missing on June 16. Her mother and father, as well as thousands of friends and well-wishers on social media, encouraged law enforcement agencies to find clues that might lead to the young woman's return. Her body was found in a remote area of Jay County on Sept. 1 and her family set about trying to make some good come from her tragic end, encouraging those with addictions and their families to seek help.\n\nBy the end of 2014, 28-year-old Ashley Morris Mullis had been missing for 15 months. The disappearance of the young mother of three children 5 years old or younger baffled investigators and traumatized her parents, who took to the Internet and even street corners, holding up signs pleading for information related to her whereabouts.\n\nAs the year closed, Jeremy Johnson, a 23-year-old Gaston man, had been missing since mid-October. Like DiBattiste, Johnson had struggled with drug addiction. Like DiBattiste and Mullis, Johnson had a family that tried to get the word out about his disappearance and prayed for his safe return.\n\nAnyone with information on the whereabouts of Mullis or Johnson is encouraged to contact Delaware County Sheriff's Office investigator Kurt Walthour at (765) 747-7881.\n\n9. Wes-Del, Wapahani win state titles\n\nTwo Delaware County high school teams turned in IHSAA state titles during 2014. One team took the county to a height it had never reached before, while the other continued a long tradition of such success.\n\nThe Wapahani baseball team won the Class 2A state championship at Victory Field in Indianapolis, the first state baseball championship for a team from Delaware County. The Raiders had finished as the state runner-up on the same field 10 years earlier, but this year's team was finally able to take Delaware County all the way.\n\nSophomore left-handed pitcher Zack Thompson unleashed a dominant postseason run, and the Raiders also found a way to get him the runs he needed, sometimes through late-game heroics. When the 2015 season begins, Wapahani and the rest of the county's teams will be chasing Delaware County's second state title.\n\nDelaware County has a long history of volleyball state championships, but Wes-Del broke a bit of a drought with its crown. The county was not represented at all at the state finals in 2013, something which had not occurred since the multi-class era began in the late 1990s.\n\nThe Warriors were the only Delaware County team at the state finals in 2014, but they made their appearance count, claiming the Class A crown and continuing the county's legacy. It was the second state title in Wes-Del's school history, three years after the first championship.\n\n10. Supreme Court suspends Muncie judge\n\nThe Indiana Supreme Court on Dec. 18 suspended Dianna Bennington from her duties as Muncie City Court judge.\n\nThe resignation, with pay, is pending resolution of a complaint, filed Dec. 11 by the Indiana Commission of Judicial Qualifications, that alleged 13 counts of misconduct.\n\nSome of the complaints focus on Bennington's actions on the bench, accusing the 43-year-old judge of \"abuse of judicial power (and) repeated violation of statutes and court rules.\"\n\nOthers involve her personal life, accusing her of \"injudicious and prejudicial public conduct\" stemming from conflict with the father of her twins, Delaware County Chief Deputy Jason Walker.\n\nThe state Supreme Court — which will ultimately determine whether the allegations are valid, and what resulting action, if any, will be taken — has ordered Delaware County's five Circuit Court judges to preside over Muncie City Court in Bennington's absence.\n\nBennington wasn't the only local official with legal problems in 2014. In April, Delaware County Treasurer John Dorer was charged with 47 crimes, most of them alleging he had failed to deposit county funds in a timely manner. His trial is set for February.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/20/8-takeaways-delaware-gov-john-carneys-state-state-speech/6527389001/", "title": "8 Takeaways from Delaware Gov. John Carney's State of the State ...", "text": "Gov. John Carney promised to invest in schools, jobs and infrastructure in 2022 during his annual State of the State address delivered Thursday in the House chamber of Dover’s Legislative Hall.\n\nCarney began his speech, the fifth of his tenure, acknowledging the nearly two years of sacrifices and loss that Delawareans have endured during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“If nothing else, we all have that in common,” Carney said. “And as we’ve learned the hard way over the past few weeks, we aren’t through it yet.”\n\nWhen he gave the same speech two years ago, a crowd of lawmakers and other officials were beaming in that same House chamber over a projected $200 million surplus in revenue and ambitious promises on how to spend the money.\n\nThose 2020 promises were not fulfilled once the virus took its toll on the economy and, in turn, state revenues. But now, lawmakers expect an even more generous revenue forecast this year of $800 million. Carney is expected to release his spending plan next week.\n\nThursday’s speech was given to a room of lawmakers wearing KN95 and N95 masks. The event was largely closed to the public but streamed online.\n\nThere were few if any surprises and much of what Carney mentioned in his speech has been announced or promised in previous press conferences.\n\nHowever, the biggest theme on Thursday was economic development despite the imminent threat of the omicron variant.\n\nEarly in his speech, he thanked the Delaware National Guard and public health officials for addressing the ongoing pandemic, which has reached all-time highs and was overwhelming Delaware hospitals as Carney stood at the podium. The day before, lawmakers had passed a bill to shorten the nursing certification requirement by 59 hours to hasten the deployment of nurse assistants to facilities struggling with staff shortages.\n\nBut job access and infrastructure appeared to be top of mind. Carney said expanding economic opportunity for Delaware families “must be job number one.”\n\nHere are eight takeaways from the address:\n\nWATCH SPEECH:Delaware Gov. John Carney gives his State of the State speech\n\nREAD SPEECH:Read Delaware Gov. John Carney's full State of the State address\n\n1. Filling jobs\n\nDelaware’s unemployment rate is just over 5% compared with the high of 13.4% in April 2020, Carney said – part of a rebound quicker than “we could’ve imagined.”\n\nBut because filling jobs is still a dilemma (local employers have more than 33,000 open positions compared with 26,000 residents looking for work), the state plans to spend $50 million in federal stimulus funds to “strengthen our workforce training programs,” Carney said.\n\nMost of that money will go to Forward Delaware, a program to help people who lost work during the pandemic get training and hiring opportunities in industries where workers are in demand such as health care, building trades, food services, transportation and tech. Carney's administration created Forward Delaware in 2020 with federal CARES Act money. They announced in October that they’ll use $40 million in American Rescue Plan aid to beef it up.\n\nThe state will also spend $8.3 million on a $15.8 million public-private expansion of Delaware’s Pathways, a program created in 2015 that helps students gain \"real-world work experience\" while in school. It serves about 20,000 high schoolers.\n\nBy 2023, those investments will expand the Pathways program to reach more than 6,000 middle school students and 80% of high school students, Carney said.\n\nCarney also promised to include in his spending plan next week a plan to support low-income state employees.\n\nSHORTENED NURSE CERTIFICATION:Facing staffing shortage, Delaware lawmakers move to shorten nurse assistant certification\n\n2. Federal money brings new spending opportunities\n\nCarney also took time to praise the federal monies from President Joe Biden’s administration and Congress, which most recently gave more than $1 billion to Delaware via the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\n\n“In terms of national and international attention, it certainly doesn’t hurt to be home of the President of the United States,” Carney said.\n\nCarney didn’t offer dollar amounts, but he did allude to some spending items.\n\nAmong the things they plan to spend money on are building and upgrading libraries, modernizing nonprofits’ buildings, increasing resources for Wilmington's and Dover’s gun violence prevention programs, improving mental health services, repairing roads and bridges, investing in public transit, building more electric vehicle infrastructure and climate action.\n\nCarney also said the state plans to “supercharge” its largest infrastructure plan.\n\n3. Businesses coming to Delaware\n\nCarney praised several arriving businesses that he said present employment opportunities.\n\nHe named the financial tech startup Investor Cash Management, which announced in December that it will move to Wilmington from Chicago. The company plans to spend $15 million on its new headquarters downtown and create almost 400 new jobs, Carney said.\n\nCarney also pointed to Prelude Therapeutics, a company focused on innovative cancer treatment, that recently signed a 13-year lease for a new headquarters at DuPont’s old Chestnut Run campus.\n\nHe also pointed to Incyte, a biopharmaceutical company that has nearly finished its Wilmington building meant to hold 500 employees.\n\nThe Baltimore-based textile manufacturer Avalon Industries is relocating in Dover, Miller Metal is adding jobs in Bridgeville, and WuXi STA Pharmaceuticals plans to add 500 jobs and a half a billion dollars in capital investment at a “massive” new manufacturing facility in Middletown, Carney said.\n\nMARIJUANA LEGALIZATION:Will marijuana ever be legal in Delaware? New attempt hoping for more lawmaker support\n\n4. New school construction, a push to revamp Wilmington schools\n\nCarney promised to spend more than $300 million in the next two years on school construction “from Wilmington to Dover to Georgetown.”\n\nCarney also advocated for the creation of the “Wilmington Learning Collaborative,” which would include a new governing board and partnership among the Christina, Red Clay and Brandywine school districts to better the city’s education system.\n\nCarney said Wilmington’s children “are not getting the education they need to be successful in life,” and that the collaborative is based on successful models in other parts of the U.S. that gives more decision-making power to educators and local communities.\n\n5. Support for paid family leave\n\nGov. John Carney showed his support for a bill to create a statewide paid family and medical leave insurance program.\n\nCarney and business leaders were initially hesitant of the idea when Sen. Sarah McBride, a Wilmington Democrat, introduced it last year. McBride plans to introduce a new version of the bill this year that will include amendments based on feedback from stakeholders, including from the business world. Carney’s support means it will likely pass.\n\n“It’s the right thing to do – and it will make Delaware more attractive for younger workers,” Carney said.\n\nMEDICAL AID IN DYING:Delaware House committee clears bill allowing terminally ill people end their own lives\n\n6. Housing\n\nUsing federal funds, the State Housing Authority is partnering with the private sector to rebuild the Riverside community in northeast Wilmington, Carney said.\n\nIn October, officials announced that the state will give $26.4 million of federal funds to an existing Riverside neighborhood revitalization project run by the nonprofit REACH Riverside. The money is meant to help build 350 affordable homes in two years, they said.\n\nCarney promised to invest federal dollars over the next three years to “revitalize and develop” more than 1,200 affordable housing units in Kent and Sussex counties.\n\nThe state will also expand down payment and settlement assistance for homebuyers, and the Housing Authority has allocated $50 million for rental and mortgage assistance, Carney said during his speech.\n\n7. Internet access\n\nThe state plans to spend more than $100 million in federal money to give more people internet access, mostly in Kent and Sussex counties.\n\nState officials claimed in an August document to the federal government that the investment will make Delaware the first state to \"close every last mile of connectivity statewide.”\n\nClose to 11,600 Delaware homes and businesses don’t have high-speed broadband access, Carney said on Thursday.\n\nSEN. DARIUS BROWN'S ETHICS INQUIRY:NAACP demands end to punishments of Sen. Darius Brown, threatens to sue over ethics probe\n\n8. Spending plan will look a lot like past years\n\nCarney’s spending plan, which he is expected to release next week, will look a lot like his past spending plans as governor: dedicating extra revenue to one-time expenses while also putting some away into savings for less fortunate years.\n\nCarney promised to use the extra revenue to “continue the largest infrastructure program in Delaware history.” In 2021, he signed the largest bond bill in Delaware history at $1.3 billion, which was nearly double the $708 million bill he signed in 2020.\n\nOn Thursday, Carney also promised no budget cuts, no tax increases and no layoffs to state employees.\n\nHe also promised to expand Opportunity Funding, which Carney created in 2018 to give schools additional funding for English learners and low-income students. In October 2020, the state reached a legal settlement making \"opportunity funding\" a permanent fixture in how the state allocates tax dollars for students.\n\nThe investments are possible in part thanks to Biden’s infrastructure spending bill, he said.\n\n“With these investments, we’ll strengthen our economy, expand opportunity, and support families as we finally emerge from this pandemic,” he said.\n\nSarah Gamard covers government and politics for Delaware Online/The News Journal.

House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels said in a news conference that it is difficult to craft a budget when the state is still trying to assess the pandemic’s impact on revenue, small businesses, schools, unemployment and other factors. “Moving forward when there are more questions than answers isn’t just illogical, it’s fiscally irresponsible and it’s just bad public policy,” Daniels said. Legislative leaders plan to resume the session on May 4. They said the priority will be passing the two state budgets for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Daniels said it would be better to wait until income tax collections are received in July so the state isn’t “budgeting in the the blind.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Four Alaska oil field service companies have alerted state officials that they will lay off workers at their North Slope operations after oil prices crashed and drilling activity declined because of the coronavirus pandemic. The job cuts include 63 layoffs at Baker Hughes Co., 81 at Schlumberger Technology Corp., about 80 at Halliburton Energy Services Inc. and more than 50 at the Peak Oilfield Service Co., Alaska’s Energy Desk reported Wednesday.The companies sent the layoff notices to the state officials over the past month and the most recent notice was filed Monday. The layoffs include heavy equipment operators, engineers, technicians and mechanics, the notices said. Companies providing oil field services and equipment nationwide are cutting jobs and bracing for bankruptcy filings as the pandemic delivers a devastating blow to the oil and gas industry. Baker Hughes, Schlumberger and Halliburton have dismissed workers and slashed spending at operations across the globe.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson:Three truckloads carrying thousands of pounds of assorted fruits and vegetables made their way Wednesday from the U.S.-Mexico border to three Indian communities in northern Arizona to help feed families struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Arizona National Guard members loaded the donated produce Wednesday morning from a warehouse in Nogales, then drove the three refrigerated trucks up north. The trio was destined for the Navajo, Hopi and White Mountain Apache tribes in northeastern Arizona. Bruce Bracker, chairman of the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors in Nogales, said it’s an example of Arizona rural communities looking after one another during a trying time. Distributors of imported Mexican produce in Nogales donated the food, storage space and the refrigerated trucks to get the supplies to some of the communities hardest hit by the pandemic. The Navajo Nation, in particular, has been hit hard by the pandemic. As of Wednesday afternoon, the tribe reported at least 1,873 positive cases and 60 deaths. Although the reservation spans four states, tribal data shows that most of the cases are in Arizona. Jesse Thompson, chairman of the Navajo County Board of Supervisors, expressed his gratitude. He said the donated produce would make a big difference to members of the three tribal communities in his county.\n\nArkansas\n\nTown: Arkansas restaurants can reopen their dining rooms starting May 11, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said as he began lifting business restrictions imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Hutchinson said restaurants, which have only been allowed to sell food via carryout, curbside and delivery since March 20, will be limited to 33% occupancy and will face other social distancing restrictions. “That’s where we need to start at this particular time,” Hutchinson said. The Republican governor said the state will later raise the capacity limit to 67%. Hutchinson also announced a $15 million grant program that would help restaurants and other businesses comply with new coronavirus restrictions by paying for protective equipment, sanitizer and other expenses. By Wednesday night, the state had stopped taking applications for the grants after receiving more requests than funding available. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that didn’t issue a broad stay-at-home order, but it had other restrictions in place. Hutchinson has eased other limits in recent days, including a ban on elective surgeries and overnight camping in state parks.\n\nCalifornia\n\nWoodland: A homeless man accused of stealing a coronavirus test sample from a Northern California hospital has been rearrested days after he was released from jail under COVID-19 bail changes, authorities said. Shaun Lamar Moore, 40, of Davis was back in court Wednesday in Yolo County to face new charges of petty theft and misdemeanor sexual battery. Instead of the zero-bail amount he received the last time, the court set Moore’s bail at $10,000 and he remained jailed, the county district attorney’s office said. Moore was charged with attempted possession of a restricted biological agent, burglary and petty theft by false pretenses. It wasn’t clear whether Moore had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. Prosecutors contend that on April 11, Moore pretended to be a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee who was picking up a biological sample believed to contain COVID-19 from Sutter Davis Hospital in Davis. The sample was awaiting testing and a California Department of Public Health courier arrived only minutes after Moore left, prosecutors said. The sealed sample was found hours later in a shopping cart at a pharmacy. It hadn’t been tampered with and was returned to the hospital, authorities said. Moore was arrested but then released without bail until a May hearing, although he had to wear a GPS monitor. On April 20, he was rearrested on suspicion of committing a petty theft in West Sacramento and sexual battery in Woodland, authorities said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado’s largest prison has become the site of the state’s largest coronavirus outbreak, with 252 people testing positive as of Wednesday at the Sterling Correctional Facility. Data updated weekly by the state health department showed that 241 inmates and 11 staff members have been confirmed to have COVID-19 at the prison with about 2,500 inmates on the state’s northeastern plains. Four of the inmates have been hospitalized, Colorado Department of Corrections spokeswoman Annie Skinner said. The prison tested 472 inmates last week in order to isolate those who had the disease and minimize its spread. Prisoners have been kept in quarantine in their cells since April 14. Meals are delivered and they are only allowed out to use restrooms and showers, according to the department. Michelle Pemberton of the Northeast Colorado Health Department told The Denver Post that steps taken to protect prison staff have been effective. She said Sterling Regional MedCenter has a surge plan in place but has had no unusual concern about the effects it might see as a result of the outbreak at the prison. The second-largest outbreak in the state involves the JBS USA beef plant in Greeley, where 245 cases and five deaths have been reported.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s largest teacher’s union has urged Gov. Ned Lamont to be cautious before deciding whether to reopen schools this spring. Jeff Leake, the president of the Connecticut Education Association, wrote Thursday that the state must not bow to the pressure to reopen public schools and businesses prematurely. “Easing up on social distancing too quickly could be deadly,” he wrote. Before opening the schools, Leake said, the state must develop new protocols designed to keep students and teachers safe. He said those should include staggering start times, implementing new seating formats and changing the way students walk down the halls between periods. The governor’s executive order keeps schools closed through May 20. He has said he will make a decision within 10 days. “Let’s stay the course and continue to flatten the curve, saving the lives of our family members, friends, and neighbors,” Leake wrote. “It’s better to be safe than sorry.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover:A Zoom meeting that included state lawmakers from Delaware as well as members of Congress was hacked. The Delaware State News reported that the hacker displayed a racial slur as well as pornography. The virtual conference call was focused on helping black-owned businesses and organizations that receive federal money. The meeting was hosted by the Delaware Legislative Black Caucus, which is an informal panel of eight state lawmakers. The hacker scribbled a racist term and drew a swastika on the screen. U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt took over and urged participants not to let it bother them. “We rebuke hate, we know that there’s a bigger plan here, and it’s all about love and caring for each other as part of a large community,” she said. A sexually explicit image also appeared onscreen. The call hosts regained control of the call, which ended a few minutes later.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser said the District will get two new hospitals to “bring equity to D.C.’s health care system.” The mayor signed new funding agreements that will include the construction of the hospitals, a 136-bed facility at St. Elizabeth’s East in Ward 8, and a 225-bed Howard University Hospital on Georgia Avenue NW in Ward 1. Funding of $306–million is available for the St. Elizabeth’s hospital, which is expected to open in 2024. Through a $225 million tax abatement provided by the District, Howard University and its new operating partner Adventist Healthcare, envision a $450 million trauma and academic teaching hospital, with plans to be complete by 2026.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey Largo: A bus driver was jailed after deputies said he chased a rider down the street and swung a metal pole at him because the rider had pulled down his coronavirus mask. The Monroe County Sheriff’s Office said a 21-year-old man boarded Denys Santos’ bus in Key Largo on Wednesday night, took a seat and pulled down his mask to talk on the phone. The man told deputies that as he was exiting, Santos used a metal pole to tap a sign saying masks are mandatory on the bus. After a brief argument, the man said he left the bus and was walking away when Santos began chasing him and swinging the pole at him. A witness confirmed his story, deputies said. Deputies pulled over Santos’ bus and found the pole. He was charged with felony aggravated assault and was being held Thursday at the Monroe County Jail. Court records do not indicate if he has an attorney.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta:Gov. Brian Kemp allowed his statewide shelter-in-place order to expire at midnight Thursday but is extending his emergency powers to June 12 and telling the elderly and medically fragile to stay at home until then. The first-term Republican governor had carved sizable loopholes in his order that applied to all 10 million Georgians and signaled it would end when he allowed some businesses to reopen last week and Monday. Social distancing requirements and bans on large gatherings remain in place. Kemp told the Associated Press in a Thursday interview that he has been pleased with how his effort to reopen some businesses – among the most aggressive in the nation – has gone in the face of a continuing COVID-19 pandemic that has sickened 26,000 people in the state and killed more than 1,100. Last week, Kemp allowed elective medical procedures to resume, and barbers, hair stylists, massage therapists, tattoo artists and bowling alleys to go back to work beginning Friday. Restaurants were allowed to begin serving diners on-site again on Monday. They and other businesses are operating under restrictions meant to retard virus transmission through May 13. But Kemp’s moves drew sharp criticism from within the state and nationwide, including multiple public rebukes from President Donald Trump.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Mayor Kirk Caldwell said Wednesday some businesses will be allowed to restart operations beginning Friday as the city eases its emergency orders aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Public and private golf courses will be allowed to reopen, as long as patrons observe social distancing requirements. Car dealers would be allowed to resume operations by appointment. Pet groomers who provide service on a mobile basis and do not interact with human customers can also restart. The order will remain in effect through May 18. Caldwell said the city, the governor and the other county mayors were working to determine how to keep everyone safe. The mayor made his announcement after Gov. David Ige approved the rule changes. Ige told a news conference that officials were discussing allowing hair salons to resume operations but noted it’s a business with a high level of contact between people and thus carries a high risk of spreading the disease.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A committee helping oversee Idaho’s $1.25 billion share of the federal government’s $2.2 trillion coronavirus rescue package on Wednesday voted to distribute money to local governments based on population. The Coronavirus Financial Advisory Committee also unanimously approved caps on how much state agencies will receive. The recommendations that add up to about $150 million now go to Republican Gov. Brad Little for his consideration. Little earlier this month formed the 14-member committee that’s headed by his budget chief, Alex Adams. The committee is planning to meet Friday to look at providing economic support for small businesses. “You’ll see us move quickly on that,” Adams said. It also is looking at using some of the money to improve broadband infrastructure to help schools with distance learning, as well as businesses that have employees working from home. Committee member Seth Grigg, executive director of the Idaho Association of Counties, said counties were comfortable with the population-based approach. “Cities are on board as well,” said committee member John Evans, the mayor of Garden City.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Police officials said they will issue a citation in connection with a wedding party at a North Side residence last week that spilled into the street in violation of efforts to fight the spread of the new coronavirus. The Chicago Tribune reported a video of the April 23 party showed several dozen revelers, all white with some wearing masks, dancing to loud music before officers enforcing Illinois’ stay-at-home orders broke up the crowd. No citation was issued at the time. The announcement that a citation would be issued came two days after police ticketed the owner of the northwest side home where they broke up a large gathering of young blacks over the weekend. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Wednesday both incidents should be treated “exactly the same.” “We can’t tolerate it anywhere. It’s not just the black millennials,” Lightfoot said. ”It’s a problem wherever it rears its head.” Police didn’t explain why it was taking longer to issue a citation for the North Side party than for the weekend event. “While officers are provided with enforcement discretion in certain aspects, enforcement of the statewide stay-at-home order is expected to be universal, regardless of neighborhood, community or district,” said Chicago police spokesman Luis Agostini. Janeal Wright, 26, who threw the weekend party captured on Facebook live and prompting the ire of politicians and others, issued an apology Wednesday. He said the party was thrown to honor two friends killed in gun violence in 2018.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A series of flyovers by the Indiana Air National Guard’s 122nd Fighter Wing in several central Indiana cities has been postponed to Saturday because of weather. The flyovers by four A-10 Thunderbolts are intended to salute hospitals and to lift morale during the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. The flyovers now are scheduled for downtown Terre Haute at 11:35 a.m., the Johnson Armory near Franklin at 11:50, then, minutes later, Community Hospital East, St. Vincent Hospital in Carmel, the VA Hospital and University Hospital in downtown Indianapolis, the Lawrence Armory, downtown Anderson at 12:05 p.m., then downtown Muncie, and the Marion VA hospital.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Iowa Legislative Council voted unanimously Wednesday to continue the suspension of the legislative session until at least May 15. Meeting by telephone, the 24-member council agreed to reconvene at 10 a.m. May 15 unless it meets and sets a different date before then. The council, which makes rules when the legislative body is not in session, has suspended the session since March. House Speaker Pat Grassley and Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver faced questions by Democratic senators about the criteria they’re using to evaluate whether it’s safe for lawmakers to come back to the Capitol and how the public will be able to participate given the continued concerns about the virus. Whitver said leaders are talking with Gov. Kim Reynolds and state health officials to ensure it’s safe to return. Although Iowa coronavirus cases continue to rise and the state hasn’t yet reached a peak, Reynolds has begun to allow some businesses in some counties to reopen. Democratic leaders have asked that all those entering the Capitol undergo a health screening, use face coverings and hand sanitizer before entering the chamber and that social distancing be enforced. Whitver and Grassley did not commit to those requests but said safety options were under discussion.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Spirit AeroSystems is offering voluntary layoffs to all of its union-covered technical and professional workers in Wichita as the company continues to respond to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and the coronavirus pandemic. It wasn’t immediately clear how many jobs will be affected by the move, which was announced in an email to employees Wednesday night, The Wichita Eagle reported. The final day of work for those who take the buyout will be no later than May 14. Last year, the employees’ union, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, represented more than 1,600 technical and professional workers at Spirit, but the company has since announced several layoffs, early retirement offers and furloughs. The announcement came after Boeing said Wednesday it would cut its workforce by 10% as the demand for new airplanes continues to drop during the pandemic. Spirit spirit also is struggling because it makes about 70% of the Boeing 737 MAX, which was grounded last spring after two deadly crashes. The new voluntary layoffs are a “first step” in the company’s plans to deal with Boeing’s announcement, according to the email from Spirit CEO Tom Gentile.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:The first Saturday in May has yielded to the legs of a bunch of slowpokes: Seattle Slow headlines a field of turtles will race in the Kentucky Turtle Derby. With Old Forester bourbon signed on as a sponsor, Saturday’s race will run at 7 p.m. on YouTube.com/OldForester. The sounds might be familiar for Derby fans: Triple Crown announcer Larry Collmus is calling the race and bugler Steve Buttleman will serenade viewers before the turtles take off. The race is just one more offbeat sport that has had a moment during the coronvirus pandemic. The Derby, America’s longest continuously held sporting event, had been scheduled for May 2. It will now be run Sept. 5, kicking off Labor Day weekend. It’s the first time the Derby won’t be held on its traditional first Saturday in May since 1945, when it was run June 9. The federal government suspended horse racing nationwide for most of the first half of the year before World War II ended in early May, but not in time to hold the first leg of the Triple Crown that month. Looking for a slower substitute, the first Kentucky Turtle Derby was hatched. The event went down like this: 20 turtles were herded into seven qualifying races and the winners went on to compete in a 20-foot finale. The Kentucky Derby Museum reported that Broken Spring paid $2.50 on his victory and $8,000 was raised to support a local children’s health charity.\n\nLouisiana\n\nCentral: A Louisiana police department has been bombarded by callers looking to voice their support of a pastor who was accused of attempting to hit someone with his church bus while violating a ban on mass gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic, police said Wednesday. In a Facebook post, police in the Baton Rouge suburb of Central apologized to residents who couldn’t get through to the agency. Officials said a huge amount of calls supporting Life Tabernacle Church Pastor Tony Spell have tied up the phone lines. Central Police Chief Roger Corcoran said Spell’s mother, Magi, shared the department’s phone number on social media and encouraged people to inundate the line with calls. Corcoran said the phone number is the department’s only line and residents need it to request assistance. He told residents to keep calling if they need help or, in the event of an emergency, to call 911. Spell was arrested April 21 and charged with assault after he admitted to driving his church bus toward a man protesting Spell’s decision to hold mass gatherings in defiance of public health orders during the coronavirus pandemic. Spell was placed on house arrest and on Sunday violated both orders by again holding a church service. District Attorney Hillar Moore III said his office didn’t plan to pursue the matter.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Maine company that makes specialized swabs for coronavirus testing is teaming with construction company Cianbro and Navy shipbuilder Bath Iron Works to double production, officials said Thursday. The Trump administration is providing $75.5 million to Guilford-based Puritan Medical Products through the Defense Production Act to boost production of the swabs, which are needed to ramp up testing. Cianbro is providing a building in Pittsfield and help setting up the production line, and Bath Iron Works is making 30 machines Puritan needs to increase production, company officials said. Puritan’s production will double to 40 million of the swabs per month through the partnership, said U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. The effort will create as many as 150 jobs in Pittsfield on top of the 300 to 500 workers already employed by Puritan in Guilford, officials said. The swabs that are produced by Puritan for coronavirus testing are longer than most swabs and have a synthetic material on the end. They’re used for nasal swabs for tests for the coronoavirus. Puritan is one of two manufacturers in the world that make the specialized swabs in large numbers. The other is in Italy.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Several pounds of free frozen chicken were delivered Wednesday to residents of Baltimore’s west side by street vendors who usually sell produce from horse-drawn carts. Baltimore-based distributor Holly Poultry donated 2,000 pounds of chicken to the University of Maryland-Baltimore’s Community Engagement Center to assist residents for whom it might be difficult to go to a grocery store amid the coronavirus pandemic. The center partnered with the Southwest Baltimore’s Arabber Preservation Society to deliver the chicken door-to-door. Anthony Savoy wore blue disposable gloves and a face mask as he pulled his horse-drawn cart along streets in West Baltimore. Much like his yell when selling fruits and vegetables, Savoy’s yell cried “free chicken.” Residents at one intersection ran up to a cart and lined up while another Arabber handed out a bag of frozen chicken and a bag of hot dog buns to each person. He turned away a woman who was not wearing a mask or gloves and told the crowd everyone needed to be protected. The woman returned and chased the cart while putting on her gloves and mask before receiving the food. The university estimated the distributor’s donation will help 900 families.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Many of the protective face masks distributed by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency in the fight against the new coronavirus were deficient, according to a published report. The state last week began notifying police departments, nursing homes and other recipients that recent tests by Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists revealed that some of the masks provide little protection, The Boston Globe reported Thursday. Although the tests showed some of the masks filtered out more than 90% of airborne particles, none performed as well as the U.S. industry standard N95 mask, which filters out at least 95% of airborne particles, according to the publicly posted results. One type of mask distributed by the state filtered only about 28% of airborne particles, according to the results. According to state data, all of the respirator masks distributed to public safety entities were from China and flown to the U.S. on the New England Patriots’ plane in early April. The MIT tests were performed on all China-made masks, said Sharon Torgerson, a spokeswoman for the state’s COVID-19 Response Command Center.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:A handful of loved ones in a chapel on Detroit’s west side and hundreds of mourners participating online said goodbye Thursday to the daughter of a police officer and firefighter who is Michigan’s youngest victim in the coronavirus pandemic so far. The reality of the public health crisis that has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Detroit residents was clear in the livestreamed service for 5-year-old Skylar Herbert, who died April 19 after complications from the virus. In other times, her family’s church would have been packed with mourners bidding Skylar farewell. But only about a dozen family members could be seen in the first two pews at the James H. Cole funeral home. Social distancing guidelines prevented more from attending, and each mourner wore a mask, as did the funeral home staff, the pastor and the line of flower bearers. About 800 people viewed the livestream of Skylar’s funeral as the eulogy was read. Two video screens played a montage of photos of the girl and her family to gospel music. A bouquet of pink flowers spelled out her name. After Skylar’s death, Mayor Mike Duggan called her “a real daughter of the city of Detroit.” Skylar’s mother, LaVondria Herbert, has been a Detroit police officer for 25 years, and Skylar’s father, Ebbie, a firefighter of 18 years.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths continue to climb in Minnesota, but the state is making progress toward more testing, new figures Thursday from the Minnesota Department of Health showed. The department reported 24 new deaths to raise Minnesota’s death toll to 343. A new one-day high of 492 confirmed cases pushed the state’s total to 5,136. And a daily high of 3,532 new tests brought the total to 70,276. Officials have warned that the case count will swell as testing accelerates. Gov. Tim Walz last week announced a partnership with the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic to expand the state’s testing capacity to 20,000 daily within a few weeks. The department also reported that 365 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 as of Thursday, up 45 from Wednesday, and 130 of them were in intensive care, up 11 from the day before. Health officials said the real number of Minnesotans infected with the coronavirus is likely much higher because most people don’t get tested, and studies suggested that people can be infected without feeling sick\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said he will ask state lawmakers to provide legal protection for businesses that might be sued if they reopen and customers or employees become ill with COVID-19. Reeves said he does not think he could provide liability protection through an executive order. The Legislature is scheduled to return to the Capitol on May 18 to restart its session that was put on hold in mid-March because of the pandemic. Reeves was also asked Wednesday whether Mississippi will cut off unemployment payments for people who choose not to return to work because they are concerned about contracting the highly contagious virus. The governor said he strongly encourages people to return to their jobs when possible. He noted that a federal boost to unemployment payments because of the virus expires at the end of July. Reeves said his “safer at home” order, in effect until the morning of May 11, requires people who are medically vulnerable to remain home. He said that category of people, and people 65 or older, “need to work with their employer and try to do the right thing” about deciding when to return to work.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Advocates for state workers on Thursday called on Gov. Mike Parson to do more to protect employees from the new coronavirus. Union leaders, Democratic state lawmakers and other advocates for worker rights want no-strings-attached premium pay for workers, more N95 masks and the chance for more employees to work from home. Danny Homan, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees for Missouri, Kansas and Iowa, said many workers are getting only cloth face masks at veterans homes and mental health centers where people have tested positive for COVID-19. “No public employee should have to give up their life to provide the service that is essential to the citizens of Missouri, or any state. Period,” Homan said. “Get the PPE equipment to those that need it, and quit calling a stupid cloth mask personal protective equipment.” A request for comment to Parson’s spokeswoman wasn’t immediately returned Thursday. Parson’s administration is offering state employees who show up for work at places where someone has tested positive for the coronavirus an additional $250 per paycheck as long as they don’t miss any days. But Democratic Rep. Keri Ingle of Lee’s Summit called that “a gesture at best.” Ingle said that policy encourages people to come to work sick. She said all state workers should be getting premium pay, and any workers who contract the virus should get two weeks of paid leave without penalty. Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel also said state employees should get free COVID-19 testing before they return to work and members of the public should have their temperatures checked before coming face-to-face with state workers.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:The Great Falls Public Schools Board of Trustees will be meeting at noon on Friday to make its final decisions on reopening schools, graduation and discuss other COVID-19-related board policies. The meeting was originally scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Monday. Friday’s meeting will not be open for in-person public participation, but can be livestreamed on the GFPS Facebook page. Public comment can be sent via email to superintendent@gfps.k12.mt.us and must include the name and address of the submitter to be read and added to the public record. The complete board meeting agenda can be found online at gfps.k12.mt.us/school-board. Earlier this week, the board discussed the issue of reopening schools before the end of the school year. The district invited guests to weigh in on what steps would need to be taken in order to open schools in accordance with recommendations outlined by Gov. Steve Bullock last week. Following Bullock’s announcement of the phased reopening of the state, the school district asked parents for feedback about the school district reopening before the end of the school year. According to Superintendent Tom Moore, 5,433 parents responded to the survey and 71% indicated that they would keep their child at home and 29% said they would send their child to school. Trisha Gardner, the Cascade City-County Health Department’s health officer, told board members that Bullock’s plan recommends health screenings be performed on everyone coming into schools and that students and staff wear face masks for the duration of the day.\n\nNebraska\n\nDakota City: Tyson Foods said Thursday that it was temporarily suspending operations at a Nebraska beef processing plant that serves as the largest employer for neighboring Sioux City, Iowa, after a surge of coronavirus cases in the area. Tyson announced in a news release that it would close the Dakota City plant Friday through Monday to perform a deep cleaning of the facility. State health officials in recent days have reported hundreds of new coronavirus cases in Dakota County, where the plant is located, and Woodbury County in Iowa, where Sioux City is located. Tyson previously disclosed that some workers at the plant had tested positive for the virus, but it has not said how many. The Arkansas-based company said it was screening Dakota City employees for the virus this week with the help of the Nebraska National Guard. The Dakota City facility is one of the largest beef processing plants in the country, employing about 4,300 people. The move follows recent closures of other meat processing facilities across the country because of the virus, which spreads rapidly among workers who often stand shoulder-to-shoulder on production lines.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas:Gov. Steve Sisolak is extending his directive asking people to stay at home to limit the spread of coronavirus until May 15. But he will ease restrictions on other outdoor activities and some businesses starting Friday. Sisolak’s office said Wednesday night that he would allow starting May 1 retail businesses and marijuana dispensaries to offer curbside pickup, as restaurants have been doing. He will also allow drive-in church and other religious services, as long participants stay in their cars and maintain at least 6 feet of distance from those outside their household. The governor said he was also again allowing golf courses, pickleball and tennis courts to open Friday, as long as they can do so safely. Frustrated Republican lawmakers sent a letter to Sisolak’s office Wednesday morning seeking definitive timelines for more economic activity to resume and a bipartisan task force to come up with a reopening strategy. They also want more workers hired and shifting of existing government workers to handle the crush of unemployment claims.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A cargo plane carrying more than 110,000 pounds of personal protective equipment to New Hampshire includes 4.5 million masks the state purchased for VA hospitals nationwide, Gov. Chris Sununu said Thursday. The shipment left Shanghai, China, on Wednesday and is expected to arrive Thursday afternoon. The masks will be sent to the VA for their distribution, said Sununu, a Republican. The VA will reimburse the state. “When VA Secretary Robert Wilkie reached out to me I knew this was a mission New Hampshire could take on,” Sununu said in a news release Thursday. “We owe those on the front lines taking care of our veterans the protection they deserve.” Wilkie said his department is proud to work with the state “as part of our ongoing effort to ensure our hospitals have access to the equipment they need to take care of our nation’s veterans.” The news release said the shipment was secured with the help of inventor Dean Kamen and others. Kamen had assisted with a previous cargo of PPE for New Hampshire.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s casinos are teaming with a hospital system to consult on protocols and best practices regarding the new coronavirus before the casinos reopen. No date has been set for the nine casinos to reopen. But The Casino Association of New Jersey said Wednesday it is working with AtlantiCare to share information on the virus and make recommendations, including lessons the health care system has learned in its own hospitals. Neither side gave specifics about things the casinos will do to protect guests and workers from the virus, but casino executives across the country are considering various measures including having everyone wear masks, staggering slot machines, more frequent cleaning and possibly using plexiglass barriers to enforce separation on the casino floor.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest Catholic diocese has filed a complaint against the U.S. Small Business Administration over its inability to apply for federal aid meant to help businesses affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The Archdiocese of Santa Fe claimed the low-interest loan applications that entities must complete state those businesses involved in bankruptcy proceedings will not be approved. The archdiocese filed for bankruptcy in 2018 in the wake of clergy sex abuse lawsuits that began decades earlier. The archdiocese said it’s struggling to make payroll because parishes haven’t been able to gather collections during Mass since Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued a public health order prohibiting gatherings. Church officials said most of their revenue comes from collections, especially during Holy Week and Easter Sunday. Archdiocese spokeswoman Celine Radigan said in a statement that the pandemic and its unknown trajectory is having a significant effect on the organization’s mission to “safeguard the sanctity of life and provide pastoral care and critical resources” to more than 90 parishes, 226 missions and 16 Catholic schools. Without access to the low-interest loans and federal aid, the archdiocese said it might be forced to furlough essential employees. Still, Archbishop John C. Wester was telling parishioners to “stay the course” and heed the advice of medical and public health experts.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city will shut down subway service each day from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. to increase cleaning of trains and stations during the coronavirus crisis, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday. The announcement came two days after he called conditions in the system “disgusting.” Subway trains, which had been disinfected at least once every 72 hours, will be cleaned once every 24 hours starting May 6, Cuomo said. Buses, vans and other alternative transportation will be provided at no charge for essential workers to get around while the system is closed, he said. Cuomo said the increased cleaning is a “daunting challenge,” but vital to keeping the subways safe as it continues to be a place of high density while much of the rest of society practices social distancing. Images posted on social media in recent weeks have showed packed subway cars. Dozens of transit employees have died of the new coronavirus and the system has become a haven for homeless people during the crisis. Subway ridership has plunged by 92% since the start of the pandemic, and most of the people commuting are health care workers, first responders and other front-line workers who’ve been keeping the city running. The cleaning shutdown affects the slowest part of the day for the subway system, in terms of ridership. Around 10,000 people ride the system during that period of time, Cuomo said. Commuter trains serving Long Island and the city’s northern suburbs will also be disinfected every 24 hours, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: College students in North Carolina are suing universities in hopes of getting reimbursements for tuition and fees after campuses shut down and moved classes online during the coronavirus pandemic. The Raleigh News & Observer reported Tuesday that the institutions that are being sued include schools in the University of North Carolina system. Students said in the lawsuits that universities made the right decision to shut down classes. But they claim that they were deprived of a college experience that includes in-person instruction, access to campus facilities and student activities. East Carolina University and UNC-Asheville said they are aware of the complaint and declined to comment on pending litigation. UNC System spokesman Josh Ellis and a UNC-Charlotte spokesperson also declined to comment. The UNC System has started to distribute prorated reimbursements for unused housing and dining services.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The North Dakota Highway Patrol said it will increase patrols to catch intoxicated drivers after most restrictions are lifted on bars, restaurants and other businesses. Troopers said in a statement the increased patrols would run Friday through Sunday and are being done “to remove impaired drivers from the road.” Gov Doug Burgum intends to lift restrictions on most businesses beginning Friday, saying the state has made significant progress to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Two prison employees and 27 Ohio prison inmates have died from COVID-19, according to the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. A total of 3,890 inmates have tested positive, but the prisons agency has only conducted universal testing at three facilities to date, leaving actual positive cases up in the air. Correctional officers are being pushed to the brink, working multiple stretches of 16-hour shifts with many colleagues out sick and getting by with the bare minimum of personal protective equipment, especially masks, said Brian Miller, a guard at hard-hit Marion Correctional Institution who is out recovering from COVID-19. The prisons agency has two medical units in Columbus, including one at the Ohio State medical center, and guards there are overwhelmed as their numbers shrink even as the ranks of sick inmates needing treatment soar, said Michael Rider, a guard at the Ohio State facility and the Franklin Medical Center. Prisons director Annette Chambers-Smith said the system started planning for a pandemic after the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, when she was the department’s health director. Once the coronavirus hit, the system prohibited prison visitors early on, stopped movement between prisons, took measures to produce and acquire personal protective equipment, and stepped up sanitation measures, among many efforts.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Some Oklahoma businesses remain closed out of fear of being exposed to the new coronavirus, despite being allowed to reopen. Businesses such as barber shops, hair and nail salons, and spas began reopening April 24 in many cities. Gov. Kevin Stitt said they could resume business as long as they followed social distancing and sanitation guidelines. But massage therapist Syd Lowery in Norman said she will remain closed. “It’s a little terrifying to be honest. I work for myself, I go to peoples’ homes. … I don’t think we’re ready to reopen,” Lowery said, adding that massage therapy is “the opposite of social distancing.” In Oklahoma City, Zio’s Italian Kitchen will reopen it’s in-house service on Friday, in accordance with the governor’s guidelines, said Jennifer Holliday, a manager at the venue. Holliday said she has no fear of being exposed through contact with customers. She believes she had the virus in February, though it was not confirmed. “I feel maybe I’ve got some antibodies built up … but it’s my job, I’ve got to do it,” Holliday said.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: University of Oregon President Michael Schill said leaders are making plans to bring students back to campus after spring and summer terms are conducted online to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the Register-Guard reported. “I want to let you all know that we fully intend and are currently planning to be open for in-person, on-campus instruction this fall,” Schill said. He noted there remain many variables to COVID-19 outside of university control, but leaders are making adjustments with the guidance of public health officials. The plans also will comply with Gov. Kate Brown’s framework for reopening establishments throughout Oregon, Schill said. Deans and other administrators of schools and colleges are considering changes such as altering class schedules, reducing class sizes, changing room assignments for more distance and expanding online classes. Schill also noted areas of financial concern for the university, including early projections of low enrollment, and how COVID-19 could affect state funding for universities. Some ideas already circulated include a temporary pay reduction program for employees, which will continue to be discussed with employee groups, Schill said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: More than 30 Pennsylvania hospitals got $324 million in emergency state aid to help support them during the early stages of the pandemic, the Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration said Thursday. Hospitals lost revenue as they canceled elective surgeries and appointments, while also spending enormously to get ready for a surge in coronavirus patients.The state’s Hospital Emergency Loan Program, or HELP, is providing hospitals with short-term low-interest aid diverted from unused funds originally set aside for water and sewer infrastructure projects. The money is expected to be repaid, with interest, by the end of September after hospitals receive federal aid authorized in legislation signed a month ago by President Donald Trump.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s famous Big Blue Bug has donned a face mask to pay tribute to health care workers and others on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. The painted mask on Nibbles Woodaway, the giant blue termite that overlooks Interstate 95 in Providence and serves as the mascot of pest control company Big Blue Bug Solutions, is also a reminder for everyone to wear a mask in public, company officials said. “This is our way of thanking the incredible work being done every day by front-line workers of all kinds, delivering goods and services, keeping us well, and putting their lives on the line every day for us,” CEO Brian Goldman said in a news release.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: As parts of the state begin to reopen to commerce and recreation, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott is praising Gov. Henry McMaster’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, measures that have been met with criticism from both sides of the political aisle. “I think his slow progress in trying to find a way to open South Carolina’s economy is consistent with the president’s,” Scott said Thursday during a Facebook live conversation about the state’s business community. “I think the governor has handled this entire crisis really well.” Since beginning a stair-step economic shutdown as the new coronavirus spread in March, McMaster has repeatedly stressed his desire for a swift, yet safe, financial reopening, noting the severe toll the outbreak has had on individual workers and businesses. Hotels can start reopening Friday, and the Myrtle Beach City Council passed rules prohibiting more than one person or family to an elevator and requiring the cleaning of often touched surfaces like stair rails and doorknobs once an hour. The state’s most visited beach will only allow hotels to honor previously made reservations until May 15, when they can start accepting new reservations. Last week, McMaster announced his plans to begin scaling South Carolina’s economy back up, convening a task force set up to advise him on next steps and allowing businesses previously deemed nonessential – department stores, flea markets, florists, bookstores and music shops – to reopen.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Several organizations representing South Dakota meatpacking plant workers have signed onto a letter asking Gov. Kristi Noem to meet with representatives of plant workers before Smithfield Foods reopens its Sioux Falls plant. Noem discussed the meatpacking plant’s role in South Dakota, its shutdown and CDC recommendations with Smithfield officials over the last month as a coronavirus outbreak of more than 800 workers occurred at the plant, which has been closed for two weeks. President Donald Trump ordered beef, pork and poultry processing plants to remain open on Tuesday under the Defense Production Act. The move came amid worries of a national meat shortage caused by plants shutting down across the country because of coronavirus outbreaks. The letter, which was sent to Noem’s office on Thursday, asked Noem to meet with representatives of the immigrants and refugee community, as well as workers at Smithfield, before the plant reopens. Representatives said they want to discuss workers’ concerns about “dangerous working conditions” inside the plant and how to protect workers during the pandemic. The letter was signed by 10 organizations and 43 individuals, including state representatives from Rapid City, Pierre and Dell Rapids. Noem said she has seen the letter and is looking into how to facilitate the request.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Williamson Medical Center announced plans to resume performing elective surgeries on May 4. The announcement is in response to Gov. Bill Lee’s decision to lift the suspension of elective surgeries previously in place to conserve resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. Elective procedures will reopen in accordance to guidelines provided by the Tennessee Hospital Association. To minimize exposure to the virus, the hospital will screen all elective surgery patients preoperatively. If patients are exhibiting symptoms consistent with COVID-19, they will be asked to reschedule their procedure. Any essential caregiver accompanying a patient will also undergo the screening process. The hospital said will continue it’s no-visitor policy with limited exceptions determined on a case-by-case basis and will also continue to evaluate all who enter the hospital.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Oil field services giant Halliburton has closed down two sites in Texas and laid off 240 employees in Oklahoma in response to reduced customer activity because of plummeting oil prices. Halliburton closed its Elmendorf facility and is relocating operations to field camps in southern Texas. The Houston-based company is also closing a Kilgore center and moving operations to Bossier City, Louisiana. The number of people laid off at the Elmendorf location was not immediately available. But a Texas Workforce Commission notice said 233 workers have been laid off at the Kilgore facility. The closures and layoffs are the result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has cut global demand for oil and gas marking a historic industry downturn. On Tuesday, Halliburton laid off 240 employees from a service center in Duncan, Oklahoma, according to the Oklahoma Office of Workforce Development. The company laid off 350 personnel at the same facility earlier this month. Halliburton reported losing $1 billion during the first quarter and laying off 5,000 people. The company has laid off nearly 1,500 employees from Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and Louisiana in April, filings with state officials show.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A federal judge ordered a Utah man to stop selling silver products marketed as cures for the new coronavirus. U.S. District Judge David Barlow issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday against 60-year-old Gordon Pedersen and his companies, My Doctor Suggests LLC and GP Silver LLC, The Deseret News reported. U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber filed a civil complaint against Pedersen on Monday, saying he fraudulently markets silver products as a cure for COVID-19. “The defendants have made a wide variety of false and misleading claims touting silver products as a preventative for COVID-19,” a statement from Huber’s office said. The misrepresentations include claims that “having silver in the bloodstream will ‘usher’ any coronavirus out of the body and that ‘it has been proven that alkaline structured silver will destroy all forms of viruses, (and) it will protect people from the coronavirus,’ ” the statement said. Pedersen and his companies have promoted silver products as a treatment for various diseases including arthritis, diabetes, influenza, and pneumonia since about 2014, the civil complaint said. Prosecutors said in court documents that prices on the My Doctor Suggests website go up to $299.95 for a gallon of the silver solution, a mix of water, extract from silver wire and sodium bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda. Court documents did not list an attorney for Pederson and he did not immediately return an email message from the Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state will continue monitoring some traffic at its borders to see how many out-of-state vehicles are entering the state amid the coronavirus outbreak, though it is scaling back the effort. The monitoring started on April 1, with 38 high-priority border crossings staffed, the Bennington Banner reported. As of Tuesday, the number had dropped to 30 monitored border crossings with Canada, New Hampshire, New York and Massachusetts. At first, Vermont Department of Transportation employees were monitoring traffic 24 hours a day, in 12-hour shifts, said Bonnie Davis, one of those workers. The shifts have been reduced to seven hours, she said this week. The data collected can be used to help determine the effect of measures to slow the spread of the virus, Gov. Phil Scott said. A “number of people” had complained that out-of-state travelers were flooding Vermont, Scott said. Since the monitoring started, the state has seen consistent travel patterns, and nothing to indicated upticks or less compliance with the stay-home order or the travel advisory, Scott’s spokeswoman Rebecca Kelley said in an email on Thursday. That led the governor to scale back the program, she said.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: A judge rejected a petition from a gym owner who sought to reopen his facilities despite an executive order requiring the closure of fitness centers and other nonessential businesses. At a hearing conducted by telephone, Circuit Court Judge Claude Worrell said Virginia law gives the governor broad authority to issue executive orders during a public health emergency like the one caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Merrill Hall, who owns a chain of Gold’s Gym franchises and other gyms, sued Gov. Ralph Northam in Culpeper County Circuit Court. He said the governor exceeded his authority and that the closures have him on the brink of financial ruin. Virginia Solicitor General Toby Heytens argued that Northam’s orders are reasonable considering the public health threat, and that more than 40 other states have acted similarly with regard to fitness centers. Attorney General Mark Herring, whose office defended the governor in the case, said he will continue to support “the Governor’s targeted, effective measures to slow the spread of the virus.” The case is one of several in recent weeks challenging various aspects of Northam’s executive orders shutting down activity in the state to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nWashington\n\nWallula: A Tyson Fresh Meats beef plant near the Tri-Cities will remain closed for a while longer as county health officials await test results on all of the approximately 1,400 workers. Walla Walla County health officials reported Wednesday afternoon the coronavirus test results are still pending. “Once the test results are received, positive cases will be handled by the county in which the employee resides,” said the agency, according to the Tri-City Herald. As of Wednesday, 130 people – employees and others linked to the plant outbreak – have tested positive. They include 120 residents of Benton or Franklin counties, nine in Walla Walla County and one in Umatilla County in Oregon. One Tyson worker, a 60-year-old butcher who lived in the Tri-Cities, has died\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Thursday said he is lifting the statewide stay-home order next week as part of his plan to ease coronavirus restrictions. The Republican said a new rule will go into effect Monday encouraging people to stay home but not requiring them to do so. The move coincides with the reopening of small businesses, outdoor dining at restaurants and barbers on Monday. The governor is pressing forward with an aggressive reopening plan unveiled earlier this week, though he has loosened his testing benchmark without explanation. Justice has based his plan on having the state remain under a 3% positive test rate for three days, reversing a previous goal of having new cases decline for two straight weeks. Clay Marsh, a West Virginia University official leading the state’s virus response, has said he wanted the two-week benchmark. A White House guideline for states also pushed a two-week criteria.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wisconsin’s powerful chamber of commerce urged legislators Thursday to adopt its business reopening plan, telling an Assembly committee that Gov. Tony Evers’ stay-at-home order is crushing the economy and that the state has the coronavirus under control. Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce Executive Vice President Scott Manley told the Assembly’s Republican-controlled state affairs committee that unemployment is skyrocketing and hospitals haven’t experienced an expected surge in coronavirus patients. Some areas of northern Wisconsin haven’t seen any infections. “The economic impact of shutting down our economy and keeping it shut down has been absolutely devastating, and it’s getting worse every day,” Manley said. Committee Democrats complained that Republicans orchestrated the hearing, extending invitations to speak only to business representatives and ignoring workers and health care officials. Rep. Christine Sinicki of Milwaukee said the plan appears designed to reduce unemployment rolls by giving people jobs knowing they won’t go to work because they’re too scared of the virus. Evers’ stay-at-home order is set to expire on May 26 but Republicans are growing impatient as the economy flounders. They’ve asked the state Supreme Court to strike the order down; a ruling that could come any day.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Travel and tourism experts in Wyoming have estimated a $1 million loss in lodging tax revenue by the end of next year as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered travel plans across the country. The Natrona County Travel and Tourism Board was offered the estimate as one of three predictions for the county’s future tourism industry based on previous years data, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Brook Kaufman, who leads Visit Casper, the marketing and promotion entity of the board, provided the board a worst, a moderate and a best-case scenario for the next fiscal year. In the worst-case model, the tourism agency could see a $1 million shortfall with an average hotel occupancy of no more than 40% before May 2021, at least 25% less than is considered for a normal summer, Kaufman said. In the best-case model, the county would lose $500,000.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/12/surprise-vacation-yard-sale-reprieve-teacher-sick-day-news-around-states/114862294/", "title": "Surprise vacation, yard sale reprieve, teacher sick day: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State health officials are urging people to serve up a heaping side of precaution at Thanksgiving, as the holiday comes amid a national surge in COVID-19 cases. Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/13/el-paso-memorial-hogs-helicopter-trees-troops-news-around-states/40597251/", "title": "El Paso memorial, hogs by helicopter: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state’s tourism agency has been honored for its work promoting civil rights travel in 14 U.S. states. The office was presented with an award recognizing its marketing campaign for the U.S. Civil Rights Trail during an industry trade show in London last week. The trail promotes museums, churches and other African American landmarks across the South. Promotional materials include video interviews with civil rights participants from the 1960s and photos of landmarks. Alabama oversaw the project in partnership with the Atlanta-based TravelSouth USA and the National Park Service. The trail includes sites from Kansas to Delaware, including all of the Deep South. The state won an award for best regional destination.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Warm temperatures and an abundance of food are keeping bears out of their dens in south-central Alaska. KTVA-TV reports the Alaska Department of Fish and Game is warning people to be aware of bears that have not begun to hibernate. Anchorage area biologist Dave Battle says the department has received regular reports of sightings of both brown and black bears. Battle says most black bears enter dens by October, but brown bears are sometimes still up in November. Battle says denning is a response to both cold weather and food availability, but it’s not cold enough, and bears still have food available. Battle says bears are trying to pack in every calorie they can.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Sikh Community has donated 550 trees to low-income Phoenix neighborhoods. Local Sikh leaders gathered Sunday with Mayor Kate Gallego and other officials for a tree dedication ceremony. Planting of elm, Arizona ash and other drought-resistant trees has already started in some downtown neighborhoods. The gift worth about $68,000 is part of a worldwide observance of the anniversary of Sikh religion founder Guru Nanak’s birth in 1469. There were similar tree-planting campaigns in countries including Germany, Canada and Myanmar earlier this year. More trees are especially welcome in Phoenix, which suffers from an urban heat island effect that raises already high temperatures in areas covered by heat-retaining asphalt and concrete. Phoenix has planted thousands of trees in recent years in hopes of offsetting the effects.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: Mold contamination is so high at an election office that officials are considering moving. Jefferson County Election Commissioner Stuart Soffer says air quality technicians found an election room with small mold spores measuring 73,300 particles per cubic foot, exceeding the acceptable levels of 2,500 particles per cubic foot. Technicians found large mold spores measuring 16,800 particles per cubic foot; the acceptable level is 200 particles per cubic foot. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the mold is a health hazard and puts 150 voting machines at risk. Soffer said the county could be liable if it knowingly exposed people to mold. Mold can cause a stuffy nose, coughing or wheezing. Technicians recommended a $1,500 dehumidifier. County Judge Gerald Robinson, the CEO for the county government, says he’s exploring alternative buildings.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The head of a commuter train system apologized to a black rider who was detained and cited by police for eating a breakfast sandwich on a train platform after an outcry from people who assailed enforcement of a no-food rule as racist. More than two dozen people staged an “eat-in” at a Bay Area Rapid Transit station over the weekend, and others continue to protest the Nov. 4 encounter, which ended with a 31-year-old man, who was headed to work, in handcuffs and unable to leave until he had told BART police his name. BART officials said Monday that an independent auditor is investigating. Eating is not allowed in paid portions of stations to maintain cleanliness, but it shouldn’t be used to prevent people from getting to work on time, they said. Steve Foster says he knew eating was not allowed on trains but did not realize it was banned on platforms.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state law banning the sale and transfer of large-capacity gun magazines has not stopped the sale and transfer of magazines that hold more than 15 rounds of ammunition. An undercover investigation by 9Wants to Know found examples of gun stores in Colorado either ignoring the law altogether or finding a loophole to get around the law. “It’s shocking to see that people are doing this,” said state Sen. Rhonda Fields, D-Aurora. In 2013, a Democrat-controlled Legislature passed four comprehensive bills dealing with guns, including the bill sponsored by Fields banning magazines that hold more than 15 bullets. The bill, signed into law by then-Gov. John Hickenlooper, banned the sale, transfer and possession of a large-capacity magazine as of July 1, 2013.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterford: Environmental groups are planning to remove a 1970s dam that has blocked alewife herring from returning from the ocean to freshwater spawning grounds. The Day reports a recently announced $187,000 grant from the Long Island Sound Futures Fund will help pay for the removal of the dam in Alewife Cove along the Waterford-New London line. The grant was awarded to the Connecticut Fund for the Environment and Save the Sound, which are working on the project with the Alewife Cove Conservancy. The groups will be required to provide $128,000 in matching funds. The groups say the project will restore 3 miles of a migratory corridor that benefits alewife as well as sea lamprey and American eel. A timeline for the project has not been announced.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The Central YMCA downtown will end its housing program for the homeless next spring, cutting 41 guaranteed beds in the city and potentially relocating dozens of men. The beds are reserved for the chronically homeless, a group advocates consider to be the most vulnerable among homeless adults and the most challenging to help. Those who qualify can stay indefinitely. Their rooms are paid for by a $264,000 federal grant that the YMCA of Delaware this year declined to apply to renew. The current grant lasts until May. The YMCA and Housing Alliance Delaware, the nonprofit that coordinates shelter placements statewide, is finding ways for the current residents to stay in their rooms with other funding such as vouchers, to move toward paying rent like the YMCA’s other tenants or to be relocated to other housing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Authorities say a man was walking his 4-month-old pit bull when he was robbed of the puppy at gunpoint. News outlets report the dog named “L.A.” was stolen Saturday. A D.C. police statement says the man and L.A. were walking that afternoon when a vehicle slowed next to them, and the driver asked about buying L.A. The man refused, and the driver followed the pair. It says the driver then stopped the car and got out with a passenger, who pulled a handgun and told L.A.’s owner that “it’s our dog now.” The driver grabbed L.A. and fled in a burgundy Kia Forte. L.A. was wearing a blue collar at the time. A $1,000 is offered for information leading to an arrest.\n\nFlorida\n\nInverness: Controversy over a county commission blocking a library system from having a digital subscription to the New York Times has spilled over into the local tourism realm. The Citrus County Chronicle reports that people are canceling trips to Citrus County, and the repercussions are being felt as far abroad as London. John Pricher, director of the Citrus County Visitors Bureau, said as of Wednesday afternoon he’s received 10 anonymous and signed emails from tourists who all oppose county commissioners’ actions. In late October, commissioners discussed whether to buy the digital subscription but didn’t make a final decision. On Nov. 19, Citrus County Commissioners will decide whether to take the advice of library officials and spend $2,700 annually for a digital subscription to the paper.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Enrollment at the state’s public colleges and universities is rising again, led by its largest schools. The University System of Georgia reported Tuesday that total enrollment rose 1.5% in fall 2019 from fall 2018. More than 333,000 students are enrolled across the state’s 26 institutions. Among those schools, 11 showed growth, and 15 showed declines. The fastest-growing institution, proportionally, was Georgia Tech, where enrollment went up nearly 12% to 36,000. The Atlanta’s school 3,800-student gain made up more than three-quarters of all student gains statewide. Other schools showing large gains were Kennesaw State University, Middle Georgia State University and Georgia Gwinnett College. Atlanta Metropolitan State College saw enrollment drop the most, falling 16% to 1,844.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A public health study says Native Hawaiians experience fewer years of good health compared with other ethnic groups in the state. The study by University of Hawaii researchers published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Public Health found Native Hawaiians have 14 fewer years of healthy life than other groups. The study based on a self-reported survey calculates the number of healthy years among the state’s indigenous people and those with white, Filipino, Japanese and Chinese heritages. The study finds Native Hawaiians have 62.2 years of healthy life expectancy, compared with 75.9 years for Chinese, 74.8 for Japanese, 73.3 for Filipinos, and 72.1 years for white Hawaii residents. The authors say the analysis provides a more complete estimate of population health than life expectancy studies.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials have released a final plan for five open-pit phosphate mines and reclamation work in eastern Idaho proposed by J.R. Simplot Co. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service released the jointly prepared final environmental impact statement Friday for the Dairy Syncline Mine Project about 14 miles east of Soda Springs. The five mines, disposal areas, tailing ponds and other mine workings would cover about 4.3 square miles. The two federal agencies are taking comments before making decisions. The area contains one of the nation’s most abundant deposits of phosphate ore that’s turned into fertilizer needed by farmers to grow food. The area also contains more than a dozen federal Superfund sites needing cleanup from past phosphate mining activities.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is giving a legal aid group $30,000 to educate farmworkers about and to do research on pesticides. The EPA said in a statement that the money going to Legal Aid Chicago will, among other things, help it survey corn-detasseling workers and fruit harvesters in Illinois on their knowledge of pesticide use. It says the goal is to improve the health of migrant farmworkers. Legal Aid Chicago says the state Department of Agriculture has received a record number of nearly 1,000 complaints in 2019 on alleged misuse of pesticides. It says that’s 10 times recent averages and illustrates the need for better education. The money going to Legal Aid Chicago is part of a series of grants nationwide for groups working on similar measures.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is bringing an exhibition exploring the opioid crisis to its official museum early next year. The Indiana State Museum says “Fix: Heartbreak and Hope Inside our Opioid Crisis” aims to remove the shame and isolation surrounding opioid addiction. It will feature displays on the biology behind addiction, the history of health crises in America, and personal stories from addicts and their families. The Indiana Business Journal reports more than 1,700 people in Indiana died from drug overdoses in 2017. Most of those deaths were linked to opioid abuse. The exhibit will feature multimedia displays, hands-on installations and interactive artwork. One display will allow a visitor to enter a giant brain and watch how substance abuse affects it. The 7,000-square-foot exhibit will run for a year starting Feb. 1.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Madison: A monument marking a battlefield where 23 soldiers died has been installed in Fort Madison. The granite monument put in place last week includes a history of the military post on one side and the soldiers’ names on another side. Andy Andrews of the North Lee County Historical Society and Friends of the Old Fort says the $14,000 cost was underwritten by donations through Friends of Old Fort Madison. A flagpole will be installed nearby. The Fort Madison Daily Democrat reports that Fort Madison, originally known as Fort Bellevue, was built by the U.S. Army in 1808 and abandoned in 1813. It was the location of the only War of 1812 battle west of the Mississippi.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A cold front that froze much of the state set at least six records for low temperatures. The National Weather Service reports Wichita, Salina, Russell, Dodge City, Garden City and Medicine Lodge set low temperature records early Tuesday. The lowest temperature was in Garden City, which dropped to minus 1, breaking the record of 7 set in 2018. The highest temperature of the six cities was 8 in Wichita, which breaking the former record of 9. Wichita, Salina, Dodge City and Medicine Lodge broke records set in 1911. Much of Kansas experienced below-freezing temperatures after an arctic air mass moved from the Rocky Mountains to northern New England on Monday, with forecasters saying much of the affected region would see record-breaking cold temperatures Tuesday.\n\nKentucky\n\nLand Between the Lakes National Recreation Area: The war on feral hogs at Land Between the Lakes has escalated, with plans announced this week to shoot them on sight from helicopters. The winter campaign to eradicate feral hogs at the site also includes bait trapping and euthanasia, managed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the U.S. Forest Service. Feral hogs are non-native and threaten visitor safety, cultural sites, and native plant and wildlife species, Land Between the Lakes officials say. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service began assisting the Forest Service with trapping in 2014 with success but not at a rate that keeps up with the hogs’ rapid growth. Feral hogs can have two litters per year averaging five-10 piglets. Those offspring can give birth to a new generation in less than a year, according to a release.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s social services agency says 893 children in foster care were adopted over the past year. The Department of Children and Family Services says that’s the second-highest number of adoptions from foster care in a single year in state history, falling just below last year’s record of 912. The latest numbers are from the federal budget year that ran from Oct. 1, 2018, through Sept. 30. The department says the 893 children were adopted into 661 families. Of those families, 27% adopted more than one child, including 164 families who adopted siblings. First lady Donna Edwards hosted an adoption celebration with the families Thursday at the governor’s mansion.\n\nMaine\n\nBucksport: A company that intends to create a salmon farm at a former mill site is altering the plan to avoid a 19th-century farm identified during an archaeological survey. Arthur Spiess from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission said Whole Oceans will change the planned locations of an auxiliary building and an access road in Bucksport. He told the Bangor Daily News that the historical significance of the farmstead “is undetermined.” Whole Oceans plans to start building the $180 million salmon farm next spring. It’ll be located on the former site of a paper mill. Spiess declined to identify the contractor who performed the archaeological survey or release the contractor’s report, saying the exact location of historical sites, which the report identifies, is confidential under state law.\n\nMaryland\n\nWestover: Officials gathered over the weekend to celebrate Somerset County’s new technical high school that allows students to explore a whole host of career fields in a brand-new, state-of-the-art facility. Somerset County Technical High School opened its doors to students in September, but officials from the county, state legislators and Congressman Andy Harris’ office gathered Saturday for a ribbon-cutting ceremony and to tour the facility, according to a press release. The new $42 million building serves about 400 students from grades 8-12 and teaches them about a number of career fields including automotive technology, biomedical scienes, information technology and more, the release says. The funds for the building were provided by the state and loans from the federal government. The building is also eco-friendly and energy efficient, including a “vegetated roof” in some areas to provide insulation.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Medical marijuana products are set to become exempt from the state’s four-month vaping materials ban. Suffolk Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins ruled a week ago that marijuana cultivated for medical use must be exempted from Republican Gov. Charlie Baker’s ban starting Tuesday. Wilkins ruled that the ban can’t apply to marijuana card holders seeking to purchase cannabis vaping products. He said the ban as written undermines the state’s medical marijuana law. Officials said patients will be able to resume making purchases at noon Tuesday. A group representing medical marijuana patients argued that only the state Cannabis Control Commission can regulate marijuana products. Baker issued the emergency ban in September in response to lung illnesses attributed to use of e-cigarette products.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing: A new Michigan State University exhibit is built around a 20th-century guidebook that a generation of black motorists used during the segregation era to find places where they could safely sleep, eat, shop or find services while traveling. The exhibit for “The Negro Motorists’ Green Book” runs at the East Lansing school until the end of November. It will also introduce the guide’s creator, Victor H. Green. Green’s book listed 86 black-friendly Detroit businesses and five in Lansing from 1936 to 1966. The exhibit presents before-and-after pictures of the businesses, showing how they looked 50 to 80 years ago and today. The historical display follows the 2018 release of “Green Book,” an Oscar-winning film highlighting the guide that African Americans consulted when traveling in the South during the Jim Crow era.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: After completing coursework for her hectic senior year, statistics major Emilia Janik has an additional responsibility: sorting through multiple data sets to determine what more than 30,000 students at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities care most about on campus. As the solo research and data coordinator for the Minnesota Student Association, it is Janik’s job to work with student government to create surveys for the student body every semester. Usually, the work is completed by more than one person, but Janik is a one-woman show. The survey results help discover the issues students want to see changed or advocated for at the University, the Minnesota Daily reports. The latest survey, which MSA says is its best yet, received more than 3,000 responses on questions about grocery stores, off-campus living, environmental justice issues and freedom of speech, among others.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The University of Mississippi says a lecture by a conservative journalist is back on after initially being canceled. The Oxford Eagle reports Daily Wire contributor Elisha Krauss will speak in the university’s student union Wednesday. The talk was originally set to be inside the Overby Center for Southern Journalism and Politics, but Krauss said she was told by a professor that a policy mandated no ideological groups could host speakers there. The event is hosted by the school’s Young Americans for Freedom chapter, a conservative youth activism organization. Krauss tweeted about the cancellation last week. Hours later, the university responded on Twitter saying the decision to cancel was made by two individuals and wasn’t authorized by the administration. The school rescheduled it and affirmed its commitment to free speech.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A 12-year-old girl has died from injuries suffered last month when a St. Louis County patrol vehicle struck her. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports Akeelah “Ke Ke” Jackson had been in critical condition since she was hit Oct. 14 while crossing a street in Jennings. Her family’s attorney, Robert Merlin, says she died about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. County Police Sgt. Benjamin Granda has said the officer told police he was trying to get closer to a suspicious car to make a traffic stop and wasn’t using lights and sirens. The patrol vehicle reached a top speed of 59 mph on a stretch of road with a limit of 30 mph, although the exact speed at the time of impact wasn’t known.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Park officials in the state have closed public comment on a road management plan intended to help officials better handle increased visitation. The Flathead Beacon reports Glacier National Park officials will begin weighing comments as they attempt to mitigate crowds and congestion on Going-to-the-Sun Road. Park officials say the alpine highway plan was released in September after receiving more than 3 million visitors this year. Officials say the plan suggests expanding the shuttle service, implementing a partial parking permit system, improving and adding trails and bathrooms, and extending visitor hours in some locations. Some comments say the plan omits determining a carrying capacity for the Sun Road, raising concerns about the long-term solutions to crowding. A former park official says a plan limiting use would be a better-suited first step.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is planning construction of a reflection area for its Veterans’ Tribute project. The university said in a news release Monday that the area will run from the steps of the Military and Naval Science Building to the Coliseum. The $3.75 million project is part of an upgrade of the mall just east of Memorial Stadium. The fundraising goal through the University of Nebraska Foundation is $4.5 million, which will cover construction and create an endowment for maintenance. Words on steps in the reconfigured space will honor career moments and personal sacrifices of veterans. The tentative design will embody the concept of glass panels featured in the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in Washington, D.C. Construction is tentatively scheduled to begin in spring 2020.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Federal land managers have withdrawn more than 500 square miles of public land from a swath of eastern Nevada where oil and gas drilling leases go to auction this week after a judge blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to ease protection of sage grouse habitat. The acreage pulled from Tuesday’s scheduled sale covers more than half the lease area the Bureau of Land Management originally planned to auction. It roughly corresponds to priority habitat designated in a 2015 federal sage grouse plan completed under President Barack Obama for Nevada and northeastern California. The Trump land-use plans finalized in March had removed the most protective habitat designations across millions of acres. A federal judge temporarily blocked the rules last month because they could allow activity likely to harm the struggling bird species in seven Western states.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A bridge has been replaced and rededicated to a World War II submarine crew member who died when the vessel sank in August 1944. George Laderbush, of Portsmouth, was a torpedoman’s mate about the USS Flier when it sank after striking a Japanese mine. Seascoastonline.com reports the Woodbury Avenue bridge over the Route 1 Bypass in the city was originally dedicated to Laderbush when it was built in 1949. But the plaque wasn’t in a prominent location. The bridge was closed two years ago and was replaced. The plaque was removed and refurbished and is being featured in a more visible area. Laderbush’s niece and nephew, Marga Coulp and George Laderbush, were guests of honor at the Veteran’s Day bridge rededication.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: Police say a convertible traveling at high speed went airborne and crashed into the second floor of a commercial building, killing both of the car’s occupants. Toms River police say the red Porsche Boxster went out of control just after 6:30 a.m. Sunday. The car hit the center median, struck an embankment and went airborne into the building. Police said two Toms River men, 22-year-old Braden DeMartin and 23-year-old Daniel Foley, were deceased when emergency responders arrived at the scene. Police said the structure, which was unoccupied at the time, had been deemed unsafe by a building inspector. Sgt. Vincent Padalino said the building, which is across from Hooper Avenue Elementary School, houses four businesses, including a counseling service and a real estate company.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Clara Pueblo: Federal officials say a tribe will see an increase in federal disaster aid as it continues to recover from flooding that occurred several years ago. A significant portion of Santa Clara Pueblo’s watershed was wiped out by wildfire in 2011 and the flooding that followed. President Donald Trump recently authorized an increase in the level of funding for public projects undertaken as a result of flooding that occurred during the summer of 2012. Under the disaster declaration issued for the state in August 2012, the federal share for public assistance was 75% of total eligible costs. Trump’s order increases that to 90% for the pueblo. The tribe is in the midst of rehabilitating the Santa Clara Creek and surrounding areas by building erosion-control structures and replanting.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state’s court system says it plans to expand the gender options on jury documents in an effort to be more inclusive of people who do not identify as male or female. State court spokesman Lucian Chalfen says the system aims to have the updated juror information card set for distribution by early January. Chalfen says the new categories will include female, male, transgender, nonbinary, intersex and other. He says the cards, which tell people when they must attend jury duty, only have male and female gender options right now. The court system is also changing up its juror questionnaire.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Education officials had to warn parents not to use Google to search for two schools because the results included explicit images. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports searches for Four Oaks Middle School and South Johnston High School over the weekend returned an “explicit image” in the top results. The newspaper described the image as “graphic and overtly sexual.” A search of the two websites Monday showed the offending images appear to have been removed. Johnston County Schools said it was working with the schools, law enforcement and Google to get the images taken down, and it asked faculty and staff to help remove the image by reporting it as inappropriate to Google.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: A break-in at a sorority house at the University of North Dakota has some students on edge. Police are looking for a man who broke into the Gamma Phi Beta house early Monday and took pictures of a woman who was sleeping. Senior Matthew Ely tells KVLY-TV the crime is “kind of weird, kind of scary” because it’s something that doesn’t happen very often on campus. Chloe Shelton, a freshman and sorority member, says she always walks with a group of people, especially at night. University administrators sent an alert to students after the crime occurred.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Tree farmers are joining forces with the state to send a little holiday cheer to the troops overseas. The Ohio Department of Agriculture and the Ohio Christmas Tree Association are partnering on an effort that will ship more than 100 Christmas trees to military members stationed overseas. Growers will donate the trees, and state inspectors will make sure they are free of pests and disease. Both groups will work with volunteers Tuesday to wrap, load and ship the trees at the Ohio Department of Agriculture in Columbus. Each shipment will also include decorations provided by schoolchildren, churches and veterans’ groups.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group working to reduce the state’s prison population is launching a new initiative petition that could lead to the release of hundreds more inmates. A group of business, political and religious leaders filed the constitutional ballot initiative Tuesday. The proposal would prohibit prosecutors from using previous felony convictions to enhance sentences in nonviolent cases. It would also allow people who already had such sentence enhancements to petition the courts for relief. Once its petition is finalized, the group will have 90 days to gather nearly 178,000 signatures from registered voters to place the proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot. The same group launched a successful initiative in 2016 that reduced criminal penalties and ultimately helped lead to the release of hundreds of inmates from prison last week.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A Portland State University study found tiny pieces of plastic in the vast majority of razor clams and oysters sampled along the state’s coast. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports up to 700,000 of the microscopic fibers are shed by yoga pants, fleeces and other active outerwear made of synthetic textiles during a wash. These fibers are in the wastewater from laundry machines that eventually winds up in the ocean. Some of the tiny plastic fibers could also come from derelict fishing gear. The study’s authors collected and sampled shellfish from 15 sites from Clatsop in the north to Gold Beach near the California border. Of the roughly 300 shellfish studied, all but two contained at least some microplastics. There was an average of 11 pieces of microplastic in each specimen.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The family of a sick inmate who died inside a rural jail two years ago claims guards and medical professionals ignored and even ridiculed his distress but documented his agony. A federal lawsuit filed Friday by the mother of 40-year-old Shawn Kitchen blames Clinton County, jail officials and medical staff for mishandling what began as a urinary tract infection and led to a fatal kidney infection. The lawsuit claims Kitchen exhibited symptoms shortly after being jailed for an alleged probation violation and within three days was seen crying in his cell and unable to stand without assistance. It accuses medical and jail staff of responding to his complaints by putting him in a restraint chair and solitary confinement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University has announced plans to double the number of veterans it enrolls by changing admissions policies, increasing financial support and bolstering recruitment. The Ivy League university announced in a press release on Veterans Day that standardized test scores will be optional for veterans in the admissions process. The release indicates changes in financial aid will eliminate “all out-of-pocket costs” for undergraduate tuition and fees for veterans. “We owe an immense debt of gratitude to our veterans,” university President Christina Paxson says. The Providence Journal reports there are currently 21 undergraduate veterans at the school, out of about 7,000 undergraduates.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Clemson University and WYFF 4 Greenville are partnering to create an on-campus satellite news bureau. The bureau gives Clemson students the chance to work alongside industry professionals. “Our students will have the opportunity to work alongside WYFF journalists in the bureau on campus and gain tremendous professional experiences doing that,” says Clemson University Department of Communications Chair Joseph Mazer. The bureau, housed at Hendrix Student Center next to the Student Media offices and studio, was unveiled Tuesday. WYFF 4 news director Bruce Barkley says the Clemson bureau won’t be a main fixture during the station’s newscasts but will be used by reporters and crew members while on assignment in the Clemson area. WYFF 4 sports reporters will be able to use the office as a home base during major sporting events.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Visiting and camping in the state’s parks will be a little more costly after legislators gave a proposed fee increase the final OK on Monday. The legislative Rules Review Committee agreed the process was complete for implementing the increased park entrance and camping fees, which was the final step for the proposal that began in September. Sen. Lance Russell, R-Hot Springs, was the sole opposition in the 5-1 vote. Beginning Jan. 1, an annual state park pass will cost $36, and a daily pass will cost $8. Prime campsites will cost $26, preferred campsites will cost $23, and modern campsites will cost $20. A new statewide $15 fee will begin for all non-electric, tent-only campsites. A seven-day motorcycle pass to Custer State Park will cost $20. Currently, an annual park pass costs $30, and a daily pass is $6, while the seven-day Custer motorcycle pass is $10, and campsites start at $17 for a modern campsite.\n\nTennessee\n\nLynchburg: The distillery that produces Jack Daniel’s whiskey is once again teaming up with a military support group to help service members and their families get home for the holidays. For the ninth year, the distillery is working with the Armed Services YMCA for the “Operation Ride Home” campaign. It provides financial assistance to active-duty junior-enlisted military members and their families to travel home during the holidays. Distillery officials say that since the campaign began, about 7,230 service members and their relatives have been assisted. Jack Daniel’s says it has again donated $100,000 to kick off the campaign. Military members have been able to travel to all 50 states thanks to the program.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The makeshift memorial formed after the Aug. 3 mass shooting was completely removed Tuesday in anticipation of the reopening of the Cielo Vista Walmart. City officials say some materials will be preserved for historical purposes. A permanent memorial for the 22 killed in the shooting is being built by Walmart in the south end of the store. Construction crews could be seen building the memorial Tuesday morning. Some materials have been moved to a smaller memorial in Ponder Park. Staff from the El Paso Museum of Art, El Paso Museum of History and the Public Art Program, along with Zaragoza Rotary volunteers, began selecting items from the memorial Tuesday to take to Ponder Park. Erica Marin, a registrar at the El Paso Museum of History, says they selected a mix of items, from handmade ones like a string of paper cranes and wooden stars to religious items like rosaries and memorial wreaths.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: City officials have bought more than 100 new hybrid sedans for the police department, but some have criticized the vehicle’s size. KUTV-TV reports some officers from the Salt Lake City Police Department have warned city leaders that the Ford Fusion Responder hybrid sedan is too small for use by officers or people they have in custody. Officers say the vehicle is a liability, citing concerns with safety in the event of a collision and lack of all-wheel drive in wintry conditions. City leaders say replacing police cruisers with hybrid models is more sustainable. Officers say the cars could still be used in other areas, but it doesn’t solve the patrol car problem. Officers say some cars are more than a decade old and have thousands of miles.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state auditor says numerous questionable choices were made in the administration of the state’s remote worker program aimed at attracting new residents by paying them to move to the Green Mountain state. In a report released Tuesday, Auditor Doug Hoffer wrote that the program’s cost-effectiveness cannot be determined because it’s not known for certain if the grantees moved to Vermont because of the program. He also says the program has serious structural flaws by requiring applicants to prove their Vermont residency before applying. Hoffer writes that “spending taxpayer funds on programs of questionable value is bad enough,” and the problem is made worse by not spending that money “on programs with demonstrable and quantifiable long-term benefits.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An army of Confederate monuments dots the state’s landscape, but some of those statues could soon start coming down after Election Day gave Democrats control of the General Assembly for the first time in decades. Members of the new legislative majority say they plan to revive proposals to make it easier to remove the public displays honoring Civil War soldiers and generals in a state that was home to two Confederate capitals. Previous attempts to do so were quickly dispatched in the Republican-controlled General Assembly, in votes largely along party lines. Del.-elect Sally Hudson, a Democrat whose district includes Charlottesville, says she plans to reintroduce legislation her predecessor, David Toscano, sponsored, giving cities and counties the ability to remove Confederate monuments. Local governments are currently hamstrung by a 1904 state law.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A new federal lawsuit aims to kill plans for building one of the world’s biggest methanol refineries along the Columbia River. Plans for the $2 billion refinery, shipping terminal and pipeline project in Kalama, Washington, are already stalled after a state board required further environmental review. Now conservation groups including Columbia Riverkeeper are suing in U.S. District Court in Tacoma. They said Tuesday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not consider the huge amount of greenhouse gases the project would emit or the effect on endangered orcas. The refinery would turn fracked gas from Canada into methanol, which would be shipped to China to make plastics. The project’s backer, Northwest Innovation Works, says the project would provide a cleaner source of plastics than coal-based methanol.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginians are being told to be on the lookout for an invasive insect. The state Department of Agriculture says in a news release that a small population of the spotted lanternfly was detected in the Eastern Panhandle community of Bunker Hill last month. The insects are devastating to trees and crops such as grapes and hops. They lay eggs in the fall on surfaces including vehicles, firewood, outdoor furniture and campers. That allows them to hitch a ride to new areas. Agriculture Commissioner Kent Leonhardt says protecting the fruit orchards and wineries in the Eastern Panhandle is a concern. The agency says landowners should inspect their property for lanternfly egg masses. The insect is native to China and likely arrived in North America on goods imported from Asia.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers has signed an executive order designed to promote diversity and inclusiveness in state government. Evers signed the order at a state office building Tuesday surrounded by Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, members of his Cabinet, Democratic state lawmakers and others in his administration. The order requires state agencies to develop and implement equity and inclusion action plans. It also calls for creating and providing mandatory equity and inclusion training for all state agency employees. Evers is also creating a diversity and equity advisory council. He says the state is taking a proactive role in making make sure government employees feel empowered and heard in the workplace. Supporters say the effort will help address racial disparities in Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: An interim legislative committee has rejected a proposed bill to raise the state’s property tax. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports that members of the Joint Revenue Interim Committee took the action during their meeting Monday in Cheyenne. The bill would have raised the tax rate on real and personal property from 9.5% to 11.5%, a jump that calculates to a roughly 20% increase in taxable property. Under the bill, minerals and industrial property would have been excluded from the increase. Proponents of the idea say the increase is essential to help the state deal with declining mineral industry revenue in the coming years. But opponents say raising the property tax could place an unfair burden on low-income people.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/new-jersey/governor/2018/02/08/phil-murphy-promise-tracker-minimum-wage-nj-transit-and-more/1034208001/", "title": "Phil Murphy campaign promise tracker: On minimum wage, PARCC ...", "text": "Last updated Oct. 19, 2021.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy made a lot of promises while running for governor. Now he has to try to fulfill them. The Record and NorthJersey.com have compiled a list of those promises and is publishing them here as a way of informing the public and to hold Murphy accountable.\n\nThis list is comprehensive but not exhaustive, and is culled from statements Murphy made during the campaign or posted on his website. The Record will update this list as needed with the status on these promises as Murphy moves through his tenure.\n\nTaxes, spending and the economy\n\nPromise: Pass a millionaire's tax\n\nMurphy has supported raising taxes on New Jersey's highest earners for a while, and he has not moved off his position despite wavering by other Democratic leaders.\n\n“Everything we’ve talked about this entire campaign is to back the truck up and get back to reinvesting in the middle class and asking those, the biggest among us, the wealthiest among us, to pay their fair share,” Murphy said in November 2017.\n\nUnlike past attempts by Democrats to pass a tax on high earners, Murphy said on MTP Daily on Jan. 17, 2018 that he wants a true millionaire's tax.\n\nRelated:Gottheimer to Murphy - Don't hike taxes on NJ millionaires\n\n\"When we talk about a millionaire's tax, that's a millionaire,\" Murphy said. \"We'll figure it out because the middle class needs, in our state, at all costs to be rescued,\" he added.\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nIn his March 13, 2018 budget address, Murphy called on the Legislature to pass a measure \"asking those with taxable incomes in excess of $1 million to pay a little more.\" He anticipated raising rates from the top 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent on incomes over $1 million to raise $765 million in the 2019 fiscal year.\n\nHe faced a major obstacle, though. Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, had expressed resistance to the millionaire's tax and said it should be the \"absolute last resort\" after passage of President Donald Trump's federal tax overhaul.\n\nAfter intense negotiations to avoid a government shutdown, Murphy abruptly abandoned his years-long quest to pass a true millionaire's tax and agreed to a Sweeney-backed proposal increasing the top tax rate to 10.75 percent on incomes over $5 million — a \"multi-millionaires\" tax, as Murphy put it. When asked what changed enough for him to change his mind and accept the higher income threshold, Murphy said it was the tax rate.\n\n\"A millionaire's tax was an existential item for me and for us, I believe, in order to achieve tax fairness,\" Murphy said in a June 30 news conference to announce a budget agreement. \"The notion of how we did it was never as important as doing it and establishing that recurring revenue for the wealthiest among us.\"\n\nThat is quite a turnaround in philosophy from just one day earlier, when Murphy called the $5 million threshold a symbolic gesture from legislative Democrats because, he said, about 21,000 millionaires earning up to $5 million would be exempt from the new rate. And raising the threshold would dramatically reduce the expected revenue for the budget — about $280 million compared to the $765 million from a true millionaire's tax.\n\n\"We've got folks who are trying to protect 21,000 millionaires. I literally don't get that,\" Murphy said during a June 29 news conference.\n\nThat all changed after the COVID-19 pandemic hit, causing a major drop-off in revenues along with a public health disaster.\n\nIn a deal brokered by Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, Sweeney and Murphy agreed to raise the top rate on incomes over $1 million to 10.75% in exchange for rebates of up to $500 for parents. Murphy pitched it as middle-class tax relief, although it excludes a large portion of the middle class and wasn't expected to arrive to households until summer 2021, when he and lawmakers are expected to run for re-election.\n\nMurphy signed the millionaire's tax into law on Sept. 29, 2020 as part of a nearly $33 billion budget.\n\n\"Importantly, this budget lives up to the ideal of shared sacrifice in trying times by including meaningful tax fairness,\" Murphy said.\n\nPromise: Create a state bank\n\nThis was one of Murphy's big policy ideas at the outset of his campaign. He envisions it to invest tax dollars in small businesses, student loans and infrastructure projects and offer low-interest loans.\n\n\"I can look back at periods in this state under the leadership of both or either party, when we were both fiscally responsible, proudly progressive and we dreamt and took chances and took risks and embraced big ideas,\" Murphy said at a gubernatorial forum held by the New Jersey Bankers Association in April 2017. \"If we believe in our future, let's put our money where our mouth is. Let's again think deeply and do more,\" he added.\n\nHe told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in March 2017 that the bank would be owned by the residents of New Jersey \"and the business that it does would be restricted to New Jersey.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise launched but unfulfilled.\n\nOn Nov. 13, 2019, nearly two years into his term, Murphy signed an executive order creating an \"implementation board\" to work out the details of how a state bank would be run in New Jersey. The 14-member board had one year to present its plan. As of November 2020, that hadn't happened and the board was set back by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMurphy acknowledged at the time that \"this is one of the few (promises) that we haven't gotten to.\"\n\nPromise: $15 hourly minimum wage\n\nMurphy made this one of his top campaign promises and said on Jan. 17, his first full day in office, that it is \"high on that list\" of his legislative priorities. But Murphy favors a \"clean\" bill to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and said last March during a forum with the New Jersey Working Families Alliance that he would veto what the forum moderator called a \"watered down\" proposal.\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nOn Feb. 4, 2019, Murphy signed the wage increase to make New Jersey the fourth state to pass a $15 hourly minimum wage law.\n\n\"Big day for New Jersey,\" Murphy said in an interview after the bill-signing.\n\nThe increase won't be automatic. The 2019 minimum wage of $8.85 an hour is scheduled to increase to $10 in July, then rise by $1 each January until 2024.\n\nThere are also exceptions. Seasonal workers, employees at businesses with fewer than six workers and farm laborers will have their pay increase on a slower timeline, beginning with an increase to $10.30 an hour in 2020.\n\nPromise: Legalize recreational marijuana\n\nMurphy has said marijuana legalization is a social justice issue and that the revenue generated from it is one of the last reasons he is in favor of it. He has said that as a father of four, it has taken him some time to come around to the idea of legal marijuana, but he has come to view laws being unevenly applied to minorities and young people.\n\n\"I want to legalize it, regulate it. I'm glad we're not the first state, because a lot of other states have done it and made mistakes,\" Murphy said during a debate on Oct. 18, 2017. \"And at the end of the day, will we earn some revenues from it? Yes. But it's got to be social justice first.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nMurphy had hoped to legalize marijuana through legislation, but after failing to reach agreement with fellow Democrats in the Legislature, he and lawmakers put it before voters to decide. They overwhelmingly approved it in November 2020.\n\nBut it took nearly three months for Democrats to agree on the legal framework to start the new industry, another sign of the difficulties New Jersey's policy makers had in fulfilling a long-sought objective.\n\nAfter weeks of negotiations that appeared at times to collapse chances of a marketplace rising up in 2021, lawmakers delivered bills to decriminalize and legalize the drug to Murphy on Feb. 22. He signed it within an hour.\n\n\"New Jersey's broken, indefensible marijuana laws — which permanently stained the records of many residents and short-circuited their futures, disproportionately hurt communities of color and failed the meaning of justice at every level, social or otherwise — are no more,\" Murphy said in a press conference.\n\n\"In their place are laws that will usher in a new industry, based on equity, which will reinvest dollars into communities — laws which promote both public health by promoting safe cannabis products and public safety by allowing law enforcement to focus their resources on serious crimes.\"\n\nThe laws signed he signed allow the possession and use of marijuana by anyone over 21 years old within the state of New Jersey, who can have up to 6 ounces of weed on them without facing any penalty. They also allow the purchase and sale of the drug at state-licensed dispensaries.\n\nSome marijuana offenses will remain criminal, including drug distribution and growing cannabis plants without a license.\n\nPromise: Guarantee earned sick leave\n\nPaid sick leave, like the $15 minimum wage, is another one of Murphy's central promises that he included to be \"high on that list\" of policy priorities early in his term. At a Jan. 17 round table in Newark on the two topics, Murphy said that even though about a dozen towns have passed sick leave ordinances, \"we have 565 communities in our state and we need a statewide agenda, we need a statewide law that ensures earned sick leave.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nOn May 2, 2018 Murphy signed bill A-1857 giving most workers an hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. It caps sick time at 40 hours.\n\n\"This is not just about doing what's right for workers and their families,\" he said of paid sick leave. \"This is about doing the right thing for our economy and protecting more New Jerseyans' place in that economy.\"\n\nThe law took effect at the end of October 2018.\n\nPromise: Equal pay for equal work\n\nMurphy aims to close the gender wage gap with a statewide law. On inauguration day he signed an executive order, his first, prohibiting state agencies from asking about a job applicant's pay history, saying employers should \"pay people based on what their job is, not on what their past pay was.\" His campaign website said that he would sign a bill that \"strengthens penalties for wage discrimination, bans employers from asking job applicants for their salary history, and prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who discuss compensation.\"\n\nOn inauguration day he called for lawmakers to deliver.\n\n\"They don't need urging on this one, trust me, they lead on this one,\" he said on inauguration day. \"Send the bill to my desk to make this simple and common sense practice state law. As I said earlier, I will sign it.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nIn an April 24, 2018 ceremony at the Trenton War Memorial, Murphy signed that bill, known as the Diane B. Allen Equal Pay Act. It is considered one of the strongest, if not the strongest, wage discrimination laws in the country. Among other things, it prohibits employers from paying a woman or minority less than a male doing \"substantially similar\" work and allows for up to six years of back pay to be awarded to workers.\n\nPromise: Create a new retirement plan for employees of small businesses.\n\nAccording to his campaign website, \"Phil will offer, just as a growing number of states do, a simple, opt-in retirement plan for small business employees. Doing so will help ensure that all workers in our state can adequately save for their retirement.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nOn March 28, 2019, Murphy today signed the New Jersey Secure Choice Savings Program, requiring employers with 25 or more workers to participate in a retirement savings program administered through automatic payroll deductions. They will be automatically enrolled in the program, which is funded through a payroll deduction, but can also opt out. Employees of businesses of any size can also participate.\n\nBy creating the program, Murphy said in a statement, \"we are ensuring that every worker in New Jersey will have the opportunity to save for the future. \"\n\nPromise: Make home ownership affordable and accessible.\n\nAccording to his website, Murphy plans to achieve this by \"stopping Governor Christie’s practice of diverting affordable housing funds to plug holes in the budget; expanding counseling programs to keep people in their homes and repurposing foreclosed properties as affordable housing; expanding tax credits to create new housing; and lowering property taxes by funding our schools, incentivizing shared services, and restoring rebates to low-income, seniors and disabled residents.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise partially kept.\n\nIn Murphy's 2019 budget, $59.3 million was dedicated for affordable housing and neighborhood preservation. The Neighborhood Revitalization Tax Credit, which among other things is used to develop affordable housing, increased from $10 million to $15 million for the fiscal year.\n\nAnd after maintaining a cut in his budget proposal to the Homestead rebate program that helps low-incomes, seniors and disabled residents, Murphy restored $150 million to to bring the total appropriation to $298 million.\n\nOn Aug. 14, the Department of Community Affairs announced a new mediation program designed to save up to 2,000 homeowners from foreclosure. The New Jersey Housing and Finance Agency is providing $1 million to the program and there are at least two counseling agencies serving each county, according to the department, which is led by Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver.\n\nUnder the program, homeowners who have been served with a foreclosure notice will be notified of free U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-certified counseling services and a counselor will help them navigate the process. The counselor can also determine if further assistance, such as negotiating with the lender or transition assistance, is needed.\n\nIn many cases, mediation can help avoid foreclosure.\n\nPromise: Expand Earned Income Tax Credit\n\nThe earned income tax credit, or EITC, is a state benefit intended to help poor and low-income households. Christie had cut the state credit percentage relative to the federal credit in leaner years, but he raised it to 35 percent of the federal credit in 2017, his final year in office.\n\nMurphy wants to raise the earned income tax credit to 40 percent of the federal level, his website said, \"so that working families can lift themselves out of poverty.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promised kept.\n\nMurphy outlined a plan in his 2019 budget address to reach the 40 percent level in three years. Aides said the credit would help more than 510,000 low-income families who could see an average benefit of more than $1,160.\n\nIncreasing the credit from 35 percent to 40 percent was included in the budget package Murphy signed July 1.\n\nPromise: Create a new child care and caregiver tax credit\n\nThis didn't get much attention during the campaign, so there aren't many specifics. Murphy told the AARP Bulletin that he would create a credit similar to the state's child-care tax credit and, the bulletin wrote, \"educate caregivers about how they can use the New Jersey Family Leave Act and make it more accessible.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nIn his budget address, Murphy said he would create a \"Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit\" for middle-class and working families. His office later said it would be tied to the federal program and would help more than 70,000 people in New Jersey earning less than $60,000 \"with assistance to support the care of a child or other dependent when necessary for the taxpayer’s employment.\"\n\nLike the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, the child care tax credit was part of the budget Murphy negotiated with Democrats and signed July.\n\nPromise: Close loopholes for \"wealthy individuals and large corporations\"\n\nMurphy talked often about closing loopholes without identifying them to help bring in revenue.\n\n\"We're going to stand for tax fairness,\" he said in the Jan. 17 MTP Daily interview. \"If you're a hedge fund and you're getting away with carried interest that we should close as a loophole at the federal [level], we're going to find a way to do that at the state level, I hope with other allied states. If you're a big corporation that's living off of loopholes,\" he added, \"we're going to close those loopholes.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nThe 2019 budget recommended changes that would \"modernize and improve\" business taxes and bring in an extra $110 million to the state.\n\nMurphy's proposals included several changes, including combined reporting of corporate business taxes and re-instituting taxes on international holding companies.\n\nIn his budget agreement with Democrats, Murphy signed into law a business tax modernization that includes:\n\nCombined reporting, which targets tax avoidance of companies by requiring multi-state corporation to add together the profits of all of its subsidiaries, regardless of their location, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.\n\nRecapturing income made available through the enactment of the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n\nAddressing \"abusive\" profit-shifting activities\n\nA four-year tax on corporations earning more than $1 million\n\nClosing various loopholes\n\nThese changes are expected to yield $861 million in the 2019 fiscal year, many times more than Murphy had anticipated his initial business recommendations would.\n\nPromise: Divest pension funds from hedge funds and private equity\n\nThis is one of the ways, along with closing loopholes and raising taxes, that Murphy plans to raise revenue to support his policy ideas. In an interview with NorthJersey.com and The Record in April 2017, he said that the state pays \"exorbitant fees to hedge funds and private equity managers\" but \"the evidence is overwhelmingly the case you no longer get what you pay for.\"\n\n\"The space is overcrowded, the returns are mediocre, the fees are exorbitant. That's one obvious area,\" to save money, he said. \"Probably not the only area, but it's the area that I'd look to first.\"\n\nThe State Investment Council, already facing criticism in Gov. Chris Christie's later years for its hedge fund investments, began scaling back its allocations in 2016 and seeking better fee structures.\n\nStatus: This is a promise launched.\n\nUnder Murphy, the State Investment Council has continued to decrease its investments in hedge funds. The council moved in March 2018 to hold off making any commitments to hedge funds given Murphy's view that the fees are too high for questionable returns.\n\nAt that time, equity-oriented hedge funds accounted for 1 percent of the public employee pension fund's assets and credit-oriented hedge funds represented 1.15 percent of assets, according to the trade publication Pension & Investments, citing a report submitted to the council.\n\nAs investment council chairman Tom Byrne noted in the body's annual report issued in February 2018, \"No member of this Council has ever moved to get rid of hedge funds entirely.\" But Byrne also announced his plan to leave the council and the decision may rest with Murphy, who will choose Byrne's successor.\n\nPromise: Establish a state-level Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and strengthen existing regulations in light of President Donald Trump’s efforts to roll back the federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.\n\nMurphy has not spoken much about specifics on this idea, but said when he named Assemblywoman Marlene Caride his choice to be the next Department of Banking and Insurance Commissioner that it is up to the state to push back against what he views as harmful policies of Republican President Donald Trump. Murphy specifically named the administration's actions to take control of the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as the sort of \"destruction that's coming at us from Washington.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nOn March 27, 2018 Attorney General Gurbir Grewal announced the appointment of Paul Rodriguez as director of Division of Consumer Affairs, the lead agency in charge of protecting consumer rights.\n\nAlthough Murphy has not established a state-level Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an Attorney General spokeswoman said Rodriguez \"the existing office will be used in a new way to tackle consumer financial protection.\"\n\nPromise: Prosecute financial fraud\n\nThis is another promise light on details but was included on Murphy's multi-step plan of \"ending Wall Street's influence on State Street.\" The state Attorney General's office already does prosecute financial fraud with regularity.\n\nPromise: Reclaim the innovation economy\n\nMurphy often talked about New Jersey being \"Silicon Valley before there was a Silicon Valley.\" According to Murphy's website, he wants to return New Jersey to its technological glory by:\n\n\"Launching a “Computer Science for All” initiative to offer computer science education to every public school student; partnering with companies to expand access to science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, internships and vocational programs; providing loan forgiveness for STEM educators in high-need schools and creating a new STEM-educator fellowship program to recruit and train a new class of STEM teachers.\"\n\nMurphy said he would also establish a Grant Management Office \"to make sure we get our fair share of federal funds for research and development,\" increase state funding for research and development, provide affordable, high-speed internet for all New Jerseyans and configure public spaces to be digitally and universally accessible; convene an \"innovation cabinet,\" increase access to capital for small businesses and startups and forgive student loans for new graduates launching businesses in \"under-served and distressed communities.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise launched.\n\nMurphy's 2019 budget includes $2 million for a \"Secondary School Computer Science Education Initiative,\" which his office says fits into his \"computer science for all\" plan.\n\nAnd on May 29, 2018 Murphy announced plans to pay interns and chip into student debt in STEM fields.\n\nUnder Murphy's student debt plan, the state would pay up to $1,000 annually for four years toward eligible workers' college debt through the New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority. Employees must live in New Jersey and work in eligible science, technology, engineering and math fields for four years before becoming eligible. The state would then pay for the next four years. And Murphy's office said employers would have to match the cost, giving the worker $8,000 toward student debt.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers said at the time they planned to sponsor bills for the debt relief, but the measures had not made it to Murphy as of July.\n\nMurphy's paid internship proposal would also apply to the STEM fields. Through the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the state would reimburse participating employers up to 50 percent of wages paid to student interns in information technology, life science and health care fields. The program would cap employer reimbursements at $1,500 per student, Murphy's office said.\n\nMurphy planned to pay for the initiative by increasing the state's Career Accelerator Program from $1.5 million to $4 million. But the 2019 budget he signed included $3 million for the program, which will come from the $34.5 million Workforce Development Partnership Fund, according to his office.\n\nOn Aug. 13, Murphy named Beth Simone Noveck, director of the Governance Lab at New York University Tandon School of Engineering, as the state's first chief innovation officer.\n\nThat position's responsibilities include \"designing and deploying more effective and agile government services,\" using new technologies and collaboration with other governments, higher education institutions and private sector businesses to solve public problems; and helping to craft policies to \"respond to the opportunities and challenges of new technology,\" Murphy's office said.\n\nNoveck was the country's first deputy chief technology officer, under former President Barack Obama, before being appointed as former United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron's senior adviser for open government. She is a graduate of Harvard University and Yale Law School and is a member of the Scholars Council of the Library of Congress.\n\n\"Beth is an experienced, high-caliber professional who will make New Jersey a leader in government effectiveness,\" Murphy said in a statement.\n\nNoveck will be paid $140,938 a year through Rutgers University, where she will be a visiting senior fellow at the university's Heldrich Center. That money will come from a $500,000 line item in Murphy's budget to Rutgers for an office overseeing coordination and improvements to technology and innovation.\n\nOn Dec. 14, Murphy signed into law a STEM Loan Redemption Program within the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority providing graduates of colleges and universities employed in STEM fields with $1,000 each year, for a maximum of 4 years, towards their student loans. The loans would be matched by the graduate's employer.\n\nHealth\n\nPromise: Restore Christie's annual $7.5 million cut to Planned Parenthood\n\nChristie repeatedly cut funding to Planned Parenthood and vetoed efforts from the Democratic Legislature to pass annual funding of $7.5 million. Murphy promised to restore that funding throughout the campaign, and during his inaugural address called on lawmakers to send him a bill to do so.\n\n\"To my partners in the Legislature: I ask you to send me the bills, among others, to reaffirm our support for women’s health and Planned Parenthood,\" Murphy said.\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept. After eight years of denials by Christie, the Democrats who control the Legislature were eager to send the bill appropriating $7.45 million for family planning services to Murphy for approval. Murphy signed the bill — his first — during a Feb. 21, 2018 ceremony at the Trenton War Memorial, where he was surrounded by lawmakers, his wife, Tammy, and Planned Parenthood's outgoing president, Cecile Richards.\n\nPromise: Lower insurance premiums by reining in excessive out-of-network costs\n\nLawmakers in Trenton have tried for nearly a decade to end surprise medical bills due to out-of-network costs. Murphy has made doing so part of his plan to raise about $1.3 billion in revenues.\n\nWhen he named Dr. Shareef Elnahal his choice to be the next health commissioner on Jan. 10, Murphy said that one of his challenges is going to be \"helping close the out-of-network loopholes that erode affordability.\" Murphy likely has an ally in Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, who, before being named to lead the chamber, sponsored legislation to rein in excessive costs.\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nMurphy signed the \"Out-of-network Consumer Protection, Transparency, Cost Containment and Accountability Act” on June 1, 2018 making New Jersey one of the rare states with such a strong consumer protection law.\n\nIt requires healthcare providers disclose what they expect to charge for out-of-network services and for insurers to disclose what they expect to pay. Patients will be able to find out in advance what their financial responsibility will be.\n\nOut-of-network doctors and hospitals will have to enter into baseball-style arbitration over reimbursement disputes, which will be decided by an independent arbitrator.\n\nPromise: Work to identify the state’s 75,000 uninsured children and enroll them in health coverage\n\nMurphy listed this promise on his campaign website, but did not lay out how he would achieve it.\n\nStatus: This is a promise launched.\n\nMurphy signed a \"Cover All Kids\" bill in 2021 that would put New Jersey on a path to universal health coverage. The governor's budget set aside $20 million to expand New Jersey FamilyCare, the state’s Medicaid program, and it would reach about 88,000 children over two years.\n\nPromise: Expand access to addiction treatment and services\n\nAnother unclear promise on his website. Murphy suggested during his inaugural address that he would continue Christie's work combating opioid addiction, but did not specifically say how in his speech.\n\n\"There is much in your body of work from which to choose, but, in particular, your work to save lives from the epidemic of opioid addiction is a legacy worth applauding and continuing, and I intend to do so,\" Murphy said.\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nMurphy's 2019 budget included $100 million in opioid funding. That is half of what Christie budgeted in his final year budget, but Murphy said in April 2018 that just about $90 million of that was spent on treatment. A key component of Christie's push in his last year to highlight the heroin and opioid epidemic was a series of commercials and advertisements.\n\nMurphy said most of the money he budgeted, $87 million, was to be directed to expanding treatment access and maintaining existing programs, such as linking overdose victims with recovering addicts and providing housing and workforce training to families and individuals. The remaining $13 million was planned to build out a \"modern\" data infrastructure to collect and analyze drug-related information and increase the use of electronic health records for providers.\n\nPromise: Tackle opioid epidemic\n\nAccording to his website, Murphy would do this by: pooling state, federal and private resources to expand access to addiction treatment facilities statewide; requiring health insurers to cover Medication-Assisted Treatment and allowing nurse practitioners, pharmacists and physician assistants to prescribe any medications necessary to treat addiction; and lowering the cost of Narcan.\n\nEnvironment\n\nPromise: Rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative\n\nMurphy said he would \"immediately\" restore New Jersey's place in the cap-and-trade program that Christie pulled out of in 2011 because, he said, it was a failure. Murphy sees it as a necessary tool to help reduce emissions and follow a standard of environmental stewardship. In an April 2017 press release, Murphy's campaign said \"he would make rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) one of his first acts in office.\"\n\nStatus: Murphy signed an executive order on Jan. 29, his 13th day in office, directing his administration begin the process to rejoin the cap-and-trade program. But it is not an immediate re-entry. The administration must work with the nine other member states to determine the best way to get back into the program and the state must create regulations on how to administer the program.\n\nPromise: 100 percent clean energy by 2050\n\nIn an April 26, 2017 press release, Murphy outlined details of his plan and \"committed, within his first 100 days in office, to starting the process of creating a new State Energy Master Plan to set New Jersey on a path to 100 percent clean energy by 2050, with higher renewable standards to motivate public and private sector actors to adapt and expand the clean energy market.\"\n\nHis plan also includes: A target of producing 3,500 megawatts of offshore wind generation by 2030, a goal of 600 megawatts of energy storage by 2021 and 2000 megawatts of storage by 2030; increasing funding and incentives for energy efficiency; and \"prioritizing solar energy expansion and ensuring that New Jersey regains its status as a national leader in solar energy production and job creation — including the establishment of a community solar program, allowing low-income communities to work together to afford clean energy options.\"\n\nAnother component of his clean energy plan is a ban on fracking and storage of fracking waste in New Jersey, as well as a fracking ban in the Delaware River.\n\nStatus: This is a broken promise on clean energy and a promise launched on wind production.\n\nMurphy signed an executive order on Jan. 31 directing his administration to develop on offshore wind plan, specifically with the 3,500 megawatt power generation goal by 2030.\n\nMurphy announced a day later that the state intends to vote in favor of a fracking ban in the Delaware River basin.\n\nBut Murphy has broken the main component of his promise: 100 percent clean energy. He unveiled the state's Energy Master Plan on Jan. 27, 2020, saying that \"in the absence of climate change leadership in Washington, these reforms will help propel New Jersey to 100 percent clean energy by 2050.\"\n\nBut the Murphy administration defines clean energy as \"carbon neutral,\" meaning the carbon is captured or eliminated. That change allows the state to use other energy sources, such as natural gas, a fossil fuel that emits carbon. As a candidate, Murphy had pledged to \"eventually\" reach 100 percent carbon-free electricity.\n\nRead the plan here.\n\nThe energy plan also does not include a moratorium on pending fossil fuel projects, which environmental groups had called for. Not including the moratorium, they say, will hamper Murphy's clean energy goals.\n\n\"Governor Murphy has changed the definition of clean energy to dirty energy,\" said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club. \"If Murphy really cared about reaching 100% clean energy, he would put a moratorium on all fossil fuel projects and make sure New Jersey divests from fossil fuels.”\n\nOn offshore wind production, the Board of Public Utilities took the first step toward meeting Murphy's power production goal by voting Sept. 17, 2018 to solicit applications for developers to build facilities to produce 1,100 megawatts of energy. The board said it intends to act on the applications by July 1, 2019.\n\nBeyond that, Murphy called on the board to open two more 1,200 megawatt solicitations, in 2020 and 2022.\n\n“In the span of just nine months, New Jersey has vaulted to the front of the pack in establishing this cutting-edge industry,” Murphy said in a statement the day of the board vote.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2019, at an event with former Vice President Al Gore, Murphy said he plans to double the state's wind energy production, to 7,500 megawatts by 2035.\n\n\"When we meet this goal, our offshore winds will generate enough electricity to power more than 3.2 million New Jersey homes,\" Murphy said.\n\n\"We will meet half of our electric power need,\" he said. \"We will generate billions of dollars in investments in our state’s future that will, in turn, generate thousands of union jobs.\"\n\nPromise: Protect the Jersey Shore\n\n\"We will resist the dangerous and wrong attempt to allow drilling for oil off our precious shore. We will not allow this threat to our environment and our economy to stand. Our administration, along with the bipartisan support of our federal delegation, will not back down in our fight to protect the Jersey Shore from President Trump and the energy industry special interests,\" Murphy said in his inauguration speech.\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nDuring a beachside ceremony on April 20, 2018 Murphy signed into law a measure banning offshore drilling in state waters. But state waters extend just three miles from the coastline and Murphy does not have the power to extend the ban beyond that, into federal territory.\n\nConceivably the federal government could allow drilling off the Jersey Shore past the three mile point, but the bill Murphy signed includes prohibitions on pipelines and infrastructure crossing state territory, acting as a strong deterrent.\n\nPromise: Preserve open space\n\nAccording to his website, Murphy will \"stop the practice of diverting constitutionally-dedicated open space funding away from its intended purpose\" and \"will also depoliticize key environmental staff and commissions — including those that protect the Highlands and Pinelands — and restore New Jersey as a leader in smart planning.\"\n\nGuns\n\nPromise: Sign all gun legislation Christie vetoed\n\n\"You can assume the measures he's vetoed we would have signed, and we'll endeavor to do so,\" Murphy said on an Aug. 24, 2017 conference call, where he accepted the endorsement of Americans for Responsible Solutions.\n\nStatus: This is a promise partially kept.\n\nChristie vetoed more than a dozen gun-related bills during his eight years as governor, but the Legislature, as of July 2019, had not sent Murphy all those measures for his promised signature.\n\nBut Murphy has signed what he could. On July 16, 2019, he approved a bill to open the market up to smart guns, personalized firearms that use a fingerprint or radio frequency chip to identify just one authorized shooter. The intent is to prevent accidental deaths.\n\nAnd Murphy signed six gun-related bills on June 13, 2018. Of them, three had been vetoed by Christie: reducing the magazine capacity limit from 15 to 10; requiring background checks for private gun sales; and codifying the state's justifiable need standard for a concealed carry permit.\n\nThe three other bills Murphy signed that day were:\n\nA-1217: Allows a police officer, family or household member of a gun owner to petition for an “extreme risk protective order,” authorizing authorities to seize the weapon.\n\nA-1181: Requires law enforcement to seize firearms from individuals deemed by a mental health professional to pose a threat to themselves or others.\n\nA-2759: Adopts the federal definition of “armor-piercing ammunition” into state law.\n\nPromise: Tax gun sales to prevent violence\n\nFrom his website: \"All gun sales should be subject to a tax that will fund law enforcement, drug treatment centers, and mental health services.\" And on an Aug. 24, 2017 conference call, Murphy said he supports a tax on guns but he lacked specifics.\n\n\"We have not picked a particular level yet. That’s something we’re still trying to work through,\" Murphy said.\n\nStatus: This is a promise unfulfilled.\n\nMurphy proposed the tax in his 2019 budget. While he did not specify a rate, he did anticipate $1.4 million in revenue from the fee increase, which he said haven't been updated in many years. But he did not have the support of legislative leadership and it was stripped from the budget he signed.\n\nPromise: Create a regional gun coalition\n\nMurphy offered the idea of a gun coalition as a way to cut down on illegal weapons crossing state lines. It was a plan modeled loosely on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to reduce carbon emissions. He didn't have much detail on the gun coalition plan at the time he discussed it with The Record in October 2017, but he said, \"You’re stronger if you do this in numbers.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nMurphy announced the States for Gun Safety coalition on Feb. 22, 2018 during a conference call with the participating governors of Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island.\n\nMurphy said the coalition will strengthen ties between the states by sharing intelligence and information on guns, such as protective orders for individuals that would prohibit them from purchasing firearms. The states will also study gun violence, he said, and create a cross-state task force to trace and intercept illegal guns.\n\nDays later, Delaware, Massachusetts and Puerto Rico joined the coalition. Murphy said he hopes to add more states in the future.\n\nImmigration\n\nPromise: Make New Jersey a sanctuary state*\n\nDuring the Oct. 10, 2017 debate with Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, Murphy said: \"if need be, we'll be a sanctuary, not just city, but state.\"\n\nMurphy quickly backed off that language after the election, saying he recognized that the term was charged. He instead adopted \"welcoming community.\" Still, he has not provided a clear definition of what that may mean. In a December 2017 interview, Murphy explained his thinking:\n\n\"How we get it done, what the trigger is, I haven’t given more thought to that. But I will repeat what I said on the campaign trail: We’ll do what we have to do. And, by the way, that also is invariably going to mean we’re going to need to engage the federal government. And I don’t mean engage in a Kumbaya. I mean we’re going to need an attorney general, a governor, a lieutenant governor who are prepared to stand up to the Trump administration, probably locking arms with other like-minded states.\"\n\n*There's a catch. Murphy did not propose making New Jersey a sanctuary state as something he would pursue on his own. It is a measure he would take in response to President Donald Trump's immigration policies. It isn't clear what exactly would prompt him to pursue sanctuary policies.\n\nPromise: Protect immigrant rights\n\nMurphy was vocal about being resistant to policies put forth by President Donald Trump that he found un-American and perhaps unlawful. He vowed to protect so-called \"Dreamers\", young immigrants who came to the United States illegally, and said he would oppose \"any efforts,\" according to his website, to use state and local police to assist in mass deportations.\n\nMurphy said he would extend immigrant protections to identification and education.\n\n\"I'm all in and I've been all in for years on everyone gets access to (a) driver's license, not just some of us, everyone gets a state identification card, everybody gets not just in state tuition but in state financial aid,\" he said at the March 2016 New Jersey Working Families Alliance forum. \"That can't be for some. You're either in or you're out. And I want to be in, and you have my word I will be.\"\n\nStatus: The Murphy administration has kept the promise to oppose efforts to use state and local police in mass deportations, but New Jersey remains a popular place for the federal government to hold immigrants.\n\nAttorney General Gurbir Grewal announced a new directive on Nov. 29 restricting law enforcement's cooperation with the federal government's immigration operations.\n\nUnder the Immigrant Trust Directive, local police officers can no longer stop, search or detain any individual over immigration status or detain immigrants at the request of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, except in cases of serious or violent crimes or final deportation orders.\n\n\"There is a difference between state, county, and local law enforcement officers, who are responsible for enforcing state criminal law, and federal immigration authorities, who enforce federal civil immigration law,\" Grewal said. \"Put simply, New Jersey’s law enforcement officers protect the public by investigating state criminal offenses and enforcing state criminal laws.\"\n\nBut arrests of immigrants rose 35 percent in 2017, and ICE warned after Grewal issued his directive that more raids would come to New Jersey.\n\nNew Jersey jails are popular holding spots for detainees as well. The federal government pays Bergen, Essex and Hudson counties to hold immigration detainees, a practice that has been protested as hypocritical.\n\nPromise: Create an Office of Immigrant Defensive Protection\n\nMurphy wants to develop an office he described to The Washington Post as a \"legal services-oriented\" resource for immigrants. He said on MSNBC on Jan. 17 that there are a lot of \"scared\" people in the state and a \"lot of rumors\" going around under Trump. \"We want one point of contact where folks can call up and get the right answer,\" Murphy said.\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nOn July 4, 2019 Murphy signed an executive order to \"design\" an Office of New Americans — a name different from what he'd promised but whose function is \"the same thing\" he proposed during the campaign, according to his office.\n\nThe office is will \"work to empower immigrants and refugees throughout the state\" and must submit a plan to Murphy by the end of the year detailing its actions.\n\nThe office's objectives, according to the order are: \"promoting trainings that inform new Americans of the availability of services and their rights, including in the employment context; working with organizations and advocacy groups to increase accessibility to state programs for new Americans; and ensuring that services are accessible to New American populations, including those who speak languages other than English.\"\n\nIn announcing the new office, Murphy also said his administration had submitted its intent to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement to regain the state's role in overseeing New Jersey's resettlement program. Republican former Gov. Chris Christie pulled out of that program in 2016.\n\nMurphy had already taken one \"legal services-oriented\" step toward aiding immigrants when he made the announcement.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2018 the Treasury Department announced that it would allocate $2.1 million out of Murphy's first budget to help pay for legal representation for immigrants. The state's principal contractor, Legal Services of New Jersey, was scheduled to receive $925,000 for direct representation services to eligible immigrants. Another $925,000 was expected to go to the American Friends Service Committee for its direct representation services, and $125,000 for each of the law school clinics at Rutgers University and Seton Hall University.\n\n“Families who came to New Jersey for a better life do not deserve to be torn apart by the federal government’s cruel and discriminatory policies,” Murphy said in a statement.\n\nEducation\n\nPromise: Fully fund school funding formula\n\nMurphy made it a feature of his candidacy to fully fund education under the Corzine-era School Funding Reform Act, which has not been done since it was passed in 2008 and upheld by the state Supreme Court in 2009. Three days after he was elected, speaking at the New Jersey Education Association conference in Atlantic City, he made his first big promise as governor-elect.\n\n“For too long our educators, our students and New Jersey property taxpayers have suffered from under-funding,” Murphy said. “We are going to stop the under-investment in public schools. It is priority number one.”\n\nMurphy has not said exactly how or when he would do that.\n\nStatus: This is a promise launched.\n\nMurphy's 2019 budget increases school funding by $283 million, or 3.5 percent more than last year. Most districts — 94 percent — would receive extra aid, with the remaining districts getting flat funding. Total state education spending under Murphy's proposal would be $14.9 billion.\n\nMurphy said he intends to reach full funding under the School Funding Reform Act in four years.\n\nPromise: Tuition-free community college\n\nMurphy announced the promise during a Sept. 18, 2017 news conference in Trenton with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker. He said it would cost between $200 million and $400 million.\n\n\"This is investing in the economy,\" he said. \"This is investing in our most important asset, which is our people, so the return on the investment, if you will, is significant and relatively soon.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise launched.\n\nMurphy presented a path toward free community college within three years during his budget speech. In his first fiscal year, 2019, he has allotted $50 million that would allow about 15,000 low-income students attend college next spring. But the spending must be approved by the Legislature before he signs the budget into law. It's also unclear how Murphy arrived at the tuition cost, and other analyses suggest tuition-free college would ultimately cost much more than Murphy's estimate of $197.5 million.\n\nUnder the first budget Murphy signed July 1, 2018 his initial plan to spend $50 million was cut to $25 million.\n\nWith the reduced funding, Murphy formally rolled out a pilot program that July 31 to cover tuition and mandatory fees for students of the select colleges who make less than $45,000 in adjusted gross income and take at least six credits in the spring 2019 semester.\n\nDue to limited funding, not all 19 community colleges in New Jersey will be selected for the pilot program. But every college that applies will receive at least $250,000 to either implement the program or \"build capacity\" for future rounds of funding.\n\nPromise: End PARCC testing and eliminate exit test graduation requirement\n\n“Good teachers and good students can have bad test days. Too much emphasis is being put on a single test, as opposed to weighing a student’s progress through years of instruction,\" Murphy said on his website.\n\nMurphy said he is \"committed\" to ending Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, or PARCC, testing and the requirement that students take an exit test to graduate high school. Instead, Murphy said he would direct the state Department of Education to create an assessment that would meet the standards set in the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA.\n\nStatus: This is a promise launched but unlikely to be fulfilled in the near future.\n\nIn March 2018, Murphy instructed education commissioner Lamont Repollet to form an advisory group “fulfilling the governor’s call to transition away from and to improve upon the current system of PARCC assessments.”\n\nThat advisory group conducted about 75 meetings and traveled the state over two months seeking input on the testing. It recommended number of changes that Murphy embraced, but during a July 10 news conference in Atlantic City he acknowledged that \"we're not eliminating PARCC completely.\"\n\nDuring that news conference Murphy announced that the state would transition away from the testing beginning with the 2019 school year by cutting down the length of testing and reducing the weight of assessments on teacher evaluations.\n\nBefore dropping PARCC, the state has to consider new testing vendors and costs, and make sure the new tests align with New Jersey’s education standards, Repollet said.\n\nThe transition is expected to take a couple of years, Murphy said.\n\n“While I would have personally liked to have ditched PARCC on day one, that simply wasn’t feasible,” Murphy said. “But we are now on a clear path away from it.”\n\nPromise: Expand universal pre-kindergarten\n\nProviding pre-kindergarten statewide “is absolutely our aspiration,” Murphy told NJTV in September 2017. “I don’t think you can get there overnight, though. I think you have to phase it in over some number of years.”\n\nStatus: This is a promise launched.\n\nNew Jersey will not get to universal pre-K overnight, as Murphy acknowledged. But his budget proposal for the 2019 fiscal year would direct $57 million in new funding for pre-kindergarten, the largest increase in more than a decade, for a total of $83 million. The new money will support pre-k expansion in the current year as well as prepare districts for future expansion. More than 3,500 4-year-old students are expected to \"gain access\" to pre-k this year, the administration said.\n\nMurphy's 2019 budget includes $403 million for education, including the pre-k expansion.\n\nHe's added more money in subsequent budgets and said in September, 2021 that true universal pre-k would be a reality in \"several years.\"\n\nDiversity, equality and military\n\nPromise: LGBTQ equality\n\nOn his website, Murphy said he would work toward equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people by: Allowing transgender people to select their gender on birth and death certificates and ensure that access to facilities is non-discriminatory; ensuring that all residents, regardless of sexual orientation or gender, have equal access to healthcare and fertility treatment; expanding state contract set-asides to include LGBTQ-owned businesses;and reclassifying veterans dishonorably discharged due to the discriminatory “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy to an honorable discharge so they will be eligible for state benefits.\n\nStatus: This is a promise launched.\n\nOn July 3, 2018 Murphy signed a pair of bills into law allowing transgender people to select their gender on their birth and death certificates. He also created a 17-member Transgender Task Force to study issues on health care, housing and criminal justice, among many others, affecting the lesbian, gay and transgender community.\n\nPromise: Gender parity and diversity\n\nAccording to his website, \"Phil believes the perspectives of women and minorities must be represented in every rank of government. He will appoint a cabinet that reflects the diversity of New Jersey, establish a Chief Diversity Officer position, and publish an annual review of state diversity contracting and procurement.\"\n\nStatus: New Jersey already has a Chief Diversity Officer, identified by the Treasury Department as Maurice Griffin.\n\nChristie approved the position's creation in 2017 with his signature of A-1869. That person's duty is \"to monitor the state’s public contracting process for the purpose of compiling information on the awarding of contracts to minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises, the total value of all contracts and the percentage of the value of those contracts awarded to minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises.\"\n\nGriffin earns an annual salary of $130,000, according to Treasury Department records.\n\nThis counts as a promise kept by default. But Murphy had nothing to do with it.\n\nStill, Murphy named his own choice for the position on April 20, 2018: Hester Agudosi, a 19-year veteran of state government. An attorney who previously worked in the Attorney General's office, Agudosi most recently served as director of the Office of Equal Opportunity and Public Contract Assistance at the Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nAgudosi will earn an annual salary of $135,000, according to the Treasury Department. She will replace Maurice Griffin, who had been assigned the role while still working as the department's director of purchase and property. Griffin will return to his previous position. Agudosi will be full time, which the department said is more in line with the intent of the legislation.\n\nPromise: Reflect New Jersey's diversity in his administration\n\n\"We will put together an administration that looks like our state in all its great diversity, experience and intelligence. We will seek the right people working in public service for the right reasons trying mightily to do the right things,\" he said on election night.\n\nStatus: Murphy has kept his promised to make his administration a diverse one. On Feb. 20, 2018 Murphy became the first governor in state history to nominate a majority of females to his Cabinet, he announced.\n\nThe female Cabinet nominees were: Zakiya Smith Ellis as the secretary of higher education; B. Sue Fulton as chief administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission; Deirdre Webster Cobb as chief executive officer of the Civil Service Commission; Elizabeth Maher Muoio as treasurer; Marlene Caride as commissioner of the Department of Banking and Insurance; Tahesha Way as secretary of state; Carole Johnson as commissioner of the Department of Human Services; Diane Gutierrez-Scaccetti as commissioner of the Department of Transportation; Catherine McCabe as commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection; and Christine Norbut Beyer as commissioner of the Department of Children and Families.\n\nMurphy's Lieutenant governor, Sheila Oliver, also serves as a Cabinet member, leading the Department of Community Affairs.\n\nMurphy's Cabinet includes many minorities. Gurbir Grewal was the first Sikh attorney general in the country. Murphy's first health commissioner, Dr. Shareef Elnahal, was the first Muslim-American Cabinet member in state history. And he also named two African Americans to his Cabinet: Lamont Repollet for education commissioner and Col. Jemal J. Beale to lead the state National Guard.\n\nAll those nominees left the administration in the first term.\n\nPromise: Help people with disabilities\n\nMurphy said in his inauguration speech that having a stronger and fairer economy means that it \"remembers that we all have value and we all can contribute, including, and especially, the differently abled.\" And on his campaign website he said that the state budget \"is a $35 billion statement of our priorities. We must get back to prioritizing services for the people who need them the most, including those struggling with disabilities.\" He added that he is \"determined to make New Jersey the most inclusive and most accessible place to live, work, and raise a family for people with disabilities.\"\n\nMurphy plans to achieve that by better coordinating state services and making sure that people with disabilities \"have a seat at our policy-making table.\"\n\nStatus: This is a promise kept.\n\nMurphy named former Ridgewood Mayor Paul Aronsohn on April 19, 2018 to lead the Office of the Ombudsman for Individuals with Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities and Their Families, an office created by a law signed by former Gov. Chris Christie a week before he left office in 2018.\n\nIn the ombudsman position, for which he will be paid $120,000 a year, Aronsohn will be \"the administration’s lead advocate and ally for New Jersey residents in need of critical services ranging from early childhood through adulthood,\" Murphy's office said.\n\nAmong other things, the office is charged with providing information to people with disabilities about resolving disagreements with state agencies, identifying concerns for disabled individuals and coordinating state programs. The office will also have to issue an annual report on its work.\n\nPromise: Divide the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs into two agencies — one with responsibility for the National Guard and another responsible for veterans\n\n\"Veterans’ issues are fundamentally distinct from military affairs, and our bureaucratic structure should reflect that reality,\" Murphy said on his website.\n\nMurphy said that \"at a minimum,\" the new veterans affairs department should consist of divisions for employment and skills development; mental health; higher education; veteran-owned businesses and military transitions and families.\n\nTransportation\n\nPromise: Improve NJ Transit\n\nMurphy has said that NJ Transit was once a model for the nation, but it has in recent years become a \"national disgrace.\"\n\nOn his website, Murphy outlined a number of immediate steps for near-term commuter relief: \"Appointing an emergency manager to re-convene a working relationship with Amtrak — a relationship that currently is broken — around issues at Penn Station, as well as coordinate with various state and federal agencies, including the Port Authority; undertaking an immediate capital and personnel audit of NJ Transit to understand the true needs of the agency; improving customer service by deploying more uniformed NJ Transit personnel in NY Penn Station, Secaucus, and Newark Penn, among other key stations.\"\n\nMore from the website: \"Murphy also would require NJ Transit to have push notifications about delayed trains on its app, create a “Where’s my train?” app that would mirror the “Where’s my bus?” app, and make it easier for commuters to obtain delay letters both online and through the app; expanding options for alternative service by creating an indefinite cross-honoring agreement with PATH and also cross-honoring with ferries and bus services, including private carriers; increasing transparency by requiring weekly reports by NJ Transit including data on number of trains on time during peak and off-peak hours and length of delays, as well as opening more NJ Transit board meetings to the public and streaming them online; holding Amtrak accountable on repairs to ensure that no hour in which tracks are closed is wasted and disruptions are minimized disruptions, including requiring work to be done during off-hours and through holiday weekends.\"\n\nIn the long term, Murphy said he would: Restore operating assistance for NJ Transit; work with New Jersey’s Congressional Delegation and federal and regional officials to secure funding for the Gateway Tunnel Project and the Port Authority Bus Terminal among other critical infrastructure investments; and would work to build new relationships with public sector actors throughout the region – including both legislators and Port Authority commissioners – to better coordinate infrastructure investment.\"\n\nFinally, Murphy said he would: \"Restore professionalism to NJT management by implementing the recommendations of the capital and personnel audit to hire a new class of professional and nationally-qualified management,\" and \"ensure NJ Transit’s board has commuter representation to better allow the agency to respond to consumer concerns, establish an ongoing working arrangement with Amtrak, NJTransit, and the LIRR to fund capital improvements in and around Penn Station, including those that would facilitate better passenger movement\" and \"expedite implementation of safety measures, including positive train control automatic braking technology, to guarantee long-range passenger safety.\"\n\nStatus: Murphy took the first steps toward his promise of improving NJ Transit but has a long way to go. He signed an executive order on Jan. 22 directing an audit of the transportation agency to be completed \"as expeditiously as possible.\" He also named Kevin Corbett the agency's new executive director on Jan. 30, promising he would \"yank it back from the brink.\"\n\nMurphy also earmarked $242 million in his 2019 budget for NJ Transit, though much of that makes up for money the agency stands to lose from off-budget sources. Still, the infusion of cash will keep fares flat for the year, Murphy said, and allow the agency to hire more than 100 new employees and invest in improved communication with customers.\n\nThe long-awaited audit, released in October 2018, showed an agency where \"morale is at an all-time low.\" It had become politicized, underfunded, lacked succession plans and had high vacancy rates in key areas, according to the audit.\n\nOn Dec. 6, Murphy unveiled a new initiative, called \"Engage. Inform. Improve.\" It aims to improve customer service by having transit workers actively engage customers and identify problem, improve communications and upgrade technology. That included an upgraded smartphone app with transit alerts and the ability for customers to make purchases.\n\nMurphy also said the agency was in the process of purchasing 113 new multi-level rail cars and 182 cruiser buses.\n\nThe agency successfully installed Positive Train Control by the end of 2018 and is moving to meet a 2020 deadline to have the safety system operational.\n\nAnd on Dec. 20, 2018, Murphy signed into law the first major restructuring of NJ Transit in a generation. The law will expand the agency’s board of directors, add transparency requirements, streamline procurement procedures and create a new “consumer advocate” to represent the needs of commuters inside the agency.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/23/fact-checking-the-republican-debate-live-updates/70612471007/", "title": "GOP debate live fact check: What the candidates get right -- and wrong", "text": "The leading Republican presidential candidates – most of them, at least – are on stage tonight in Milwaukee for their first debate ahead of the 2024 primary.\n\nFollow along here with the USA TODAY Fact Check Team as we dig into candidates' claims and add context on expected campaign themes, including election fraud, the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, the war in Ukraine and more.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's decision to skip the debate means eight candidates will participate, including Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, widely seen as Trump's most formidable challenger. The other candidates expected on the debate stage are North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott.\n\nRepublican debate live updates: GOP primary candidates take stage − without Donald Trump\n\nHere's some background from our archives on key topics we expect to see through the campaign and perhaps tonight:\n\nDeSantis claimed: He eliminated critical race theory from Florida K-12 schools\n\nRon DeSantis: “We eliminated critical race theory from our K-12 schools.”\n\nThis is misleading, because teachers, school officials and districts across Florida have said critical race theory was not being taught in their elementary, middle or high schools in the first place, PolitiFact reported.\n\nIt is taught primarily in colleges and universities, including in law schools and other levels of graduate study.\n\n“CRT is a law-school concept, and teachers have been saying all along, it isn’t taught in K-12 here and never was,\" Andrew Spar, president of the Florida Education Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, wrote in an email to PolitiFact.\n\nCritical race theory is an academic concept that examines the role systems and policies have in perpetuating racism. While it has existed for more than 40 years, in recent years it has been co-opted by conservatives as a synonym for anti-racism work taking place in institutions like schools.\n\n-Joedy McCreary\n\nPence claimed: Indiana had nation’s largest school choice program when he was governor\n\nMike Pence: “When I was governor, we doubled the size of the largest school choice program in America.”\n\nThis depends on how you measure program size.\n\nThere were nearly 35,000 students in Indiana’s Choice Scholarship Program in the 2016-17 academic year, up from about 9,000 in 2012-13, according to the 2017 edition of The ABCs of School Choice, published by the school-choice advocacy group EdChoice.\n\nThe total did double during Pence’s term as governor.\n\nBut while Indiana does have the single largest education voucher program in any state, Ohio had more students who receive vouchers, the Washington Post reported. That state had a total of 47,000 students participating in its five voucher programs as of 2017.\n\n-Joedy McCreary\n\nHaley claimed: 11 European countries have given more aid to Ukraine in terms of GDP than the U.S.\n\nClaimed by Nikki Haley\n\nWhile outlining why she would continue giving aid to Ukraine, Haley claimed that 11 European countries have given more in terms of GDP than the U.S. This is true.\n\nThe Kiel Institute for the World Economy’s Ukraine Support Tracker shows that while the U.S. has provided by far the most support to Ukraine in terms of dollars, with more than $75 billion committed, that only equates to about 0.3% of total U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nNearly a dozen European countries have provided more in terms of GDP. They include Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Denmark, Netherlands, Finland, Czech Republic, Norway and the U.K. Estonia leads the way and has provided support that equates to about 1.3% of its GDP.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nScott claimed: DOJ labels school parents ‘domestic terrorists’\n\nTim Scott: “We keep seeing not only the weaponization of the Department of Justice against political opponents, but also against parents who show up at school board meetings. They’re called domestic terrorists.”\n\nThis is false and mischaracterizes an exchange starting with a September 2021 letter written to Attorney General Merrick Garland by an education group asking the federal government to help with threats of violence against school officials.\n\nThe letter from the National School Boards Association claimed that some of those threats “could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism.” The group later apologized for its word choice.\n\nGarland did not use that phrase in his response.\n\nInstead, he discussed the increase in harassment, intimidation and threats of violence against school officials and directed the FBI to meet with leaders across the country to talk about ways to deal with those threats.\n\nRead more:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDeSantis claimed: Florida's crime rate is at a 50-year low\n\nRon DeSantis: \"Crime is at a 50-year low in Florida.\"\n\nThis is misleading. DeSantis has made the claim before, but it's based on incomplete data, according to The Marshall Project, a news organization that covers criminal justice issues.\n\nAbout half of the law enforcement agencies that police more than 40% of Florida's population aren't included in statewide crime statistics. Less than 10% of the state's police departments were included in a federal crime database.\n\nIn Miami, the state's second-most populous city, violent crime has declined so far this year, with murders down more than 30%, according to WTVJ/NBC 6, a local television news station.\n\nRead more:\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nChristie claimed: Hunter Biden was charged with a gun crime that had a 10-year mandatory minimum\n\nClaimed by Chris Christie\n\nThis is inaccurate. Hunter Biden was charged in June by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware with one count of unlawful possession of a firearm by a person prohibited. The charge claims the president’s son possessed a firearm while “knowing that he was an unlawful user of and addicted to a controlled substance” in October 2018.\n\nIf convicted Hunter Biden would face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, not a minimum, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.\n\nHere are a few of the other Hunter Biden-related claims we’ve previously addressed:\n\n-Brad Sylvester, Chris Mueller\n\nHutchinson claimed: I cut Arkansas government workforce by 14%\n\nAsa Hutchinson: “We had 14% fewer state employees in Arkansas after I left government than when I took over as governor eight years ago.”\n\nThis isn't quite right according to state figures. It's a variation on a claim Hutchinson has made before. In announcing his presidential bid in April, he said he cut the state’s executive workforce by 14%, KARK-TV reported.\n\nThere were nearly 3,000 fewer employees in the executive branch of the state’s government when he left office in 2023 than there were when he took office in 2015, the El Dorado News-Times reported in January.\n\nThat workforce total fell from 26,108 in 2015 to 23,111 earlier this year, according to the newspaper. But that works out to a drop of just over 11% – not the 14% he claimed.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDeSantis claimed: Florida's COVID-19 policies 'led the country'\n\nRon DeSantis: \"We led the country out of lockdown.\"\n\nThis description ignores the fact that Florida's lack of lockdowns led to more than 86,000 deaths and a death rate that was among the highest in the nation.\n\nIn April 2020, DeSantis did issue a safer-at-home order, but by the end of the month, he announced that most of the state could begin its reopening process. DeSantis issued another order months later that claimed Florida \"suffered economic harm as a result of COVID-19 related closures.”\n\nDeSantis has more recently pushed lawmakers to make state bans on vaccine passports and mask requirements permanent.\n\nRead more:\n\nWe’ve previously debunked numerous claims stemming from the Sunshine State:\n\n-Chris Mueller\n\nScott claimed: Bidenomics cost $10,000 spending power per family\n\nTim Scott: “Joe Biden’s Bidenomics has lead to the loss of $10,000 of spending power for the average family.”\n\nWhile there are a number of ways to examine average spending power, two economic reports show Scott is more or less correct.\n\nA recent report from Casey Mulligan, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, found that Biden administration regulations have cost Americans about $10,000 per household as of the end of 2022.\n\nA separate analysis published in January by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, found that the average American family has lost about $7,400 in annual income since Biden took office.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nRamaswamy claimed: Climate change is a 'hoax'\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: \"The climate change agenda is a hoax.\"\n\nScientists from all disciplines say climate change is very real and having a very real impact.\n\nThe rate of warming has more than doubled since 1981, rising at a rate of more than .3 degrees per decade for a total of nearly 2 degrees since 1880.\n\nThe global warming trend has resulted in an overall increase of nearly 2 degrees in the annual global average surface temperature. This amount of global warming has already caused consequential environmental changes, including sea-level rise, decreased sea ice, and changes in weather patterns like drought and flooding, according to experts.\n\nThat level of increase is historically significant, with the current global warming trend “occurring at a rate that is more than 10 times greater than seen in historical climate cycles coming out of ice ages,” Howard Diamond, senior climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Air Resources Laboratory, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nGlobal warming causes global sea level rise because warming ocean water expands. Additionally, melting glaciers and ice sheets have increased the amount of water in the oceans.\n\nRead more: Timing of ice ages is connected to CO2, but not how this viral post claims | Fact check\n\nRead more: Fact check: Experts say extreme weather events are increasing in severity, not decreasing\n\n-Eric Litke\n\nHaley claimed: Donald Trump added $8 trillion to our national debt\n\nClaimed by Nikki Haley\n\nHaley touted this stat in asserting a lack of fiscal restraint by Republicans. The figure is correct.\n\nUsing Treasury Department data, the total public debt, which includes intragovernmental holdings and public debt, increased by approximately $7.8 trillion from the start of Trump’s presidency on Jan. 20, 2017, to when he left office on Jan. 19, 2021.\n\nRead more: False claim Trump increased debt more than any president | Fact check\n\n-Eric Litke\n\nUS aid to Ukraine divides Republican candidates\n\nNearly a year and a half after Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, there remain differing views among Republican presidential candidates when it comes to continuing U.S. support for Ukraine's defense.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who isn’t on the debate stage, has repeatedly suggested the U.S. is providing too much support to Ukraine. He has also refused to say whether he wants Russia or Ukraine to prevail in the conflict.\n\nRon DeSantis has also been skeptical of U.S. support for Ukraine, and Vivek Ramaswamy said the U.S. has done enough to help. Mike Pence, who visited Ukraine in June, has said he supports providing Ukraine with military aid to fight back against Russia. Chris Christie too has said he supports continuing U.S. support for Ukraine, as does Tim Scott and Asa Hutchinson. Nikki Haley said support should be through collaborating with allies to be sure Ukraine has \"the equipment and the ammunition to win.\"\n\nPublic debate over the best approach in Ukraine has also sparked a wide array of misinformation:\n\n– Chris Mueller\n\nJan. 6 riots play key role in Trump, Pence campaigns\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots loom large during the campaign because several of that day’s central figures – Trump and Pence – are in the race.\n\nTrump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that Pence had the power to overturn the 2020 election results while he presided over the ceremonial certification process. Pence has made his handling of the day’s events a central theme of his campaign, saying he chose loyalty to the Constitution over demands from Trump to give him the election.\n\nIn the worst attack on the Capitol in 200 years, a mob of thousands of Trump supporters overwhelmed police and raided the building on the day lawmakers formalized Biden’s victory. Some rioters chanted that they wanted Pence hanged.\n\nOther candidates have brought up the attacks, with DeSantis calling it not an insurrection but a “protest” that “ended up devolving, you know, in a way that was unfortunate.” Ramaswamy blamed the riots on “pervasive censorship” and called it “unproductive” to point the finger at Trump.\n\nThe attacks have been a consistent source of misinformation during the past 2½ years. Here are some we’ve previously debunked:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate comes amid indictments of Trump, allies\n\nTrump won't be on the debate stage, but the former president looms large over the debate in light of both his commanding lead in the polls and his unprecedented legal troubles.\n\nMost recently, Trump and several allies were indicted Aug. 14 by a Georgia grand jury that accused them of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, where Trump lost to President Joe Biden by about 12,000 votes.\n\nThe charges against Trump in Georgia are only the latest in a series of prosecutions against him that began in March, when he was indicted for allegedly falsifying business records related to hush-money payments intended to silence two women before the 2016 election. Trump also faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and allegedly conspiring to steal the 2020 presidential election, including his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nTrump's legal woes have been the subject of an array of false or misleading claims on social media:\n\n– Chris Mueller\n\nElection integrity critical issue in GOP race\n\nOne key issue for the candidates is whether they will trust – and abide by – the elections that will decide the winners and losers.\n\nState-level reviews of the 2022 midterm elections found no indication of systemic problems with voter fraud, in line with reviews of the 2020 election. That’s significant because baseless allegations from Trump and his allies have penetrated the Republican Party and eroded confidence in the process.\n\nSeveral candidates have pushed election-related changes in their home states.\n\nDeSantis created Florida’s Office of Election Crimes and Security. A year ago, his administration accused 20 felons ineligible to vote in 2020 of illegally casting ballots and charged them with third-degree felonies.\n\nHaley as governor signed a law in 2011 that requires South Carolina voters to show photo ID. Christie vetoed a bill in 2016 that would automatically register New Jerseyans to vote when they obtain or renew their driver’s license, calling it “a cocktail of fraud,” NJ.com reported.\n\nWhat none of these agencies found, of course, is any sign that election outcomes had been compromised or votes had been miscounted. But claims to the contrary have circulated widely online. Here are a few of our recent debunks:\n\n-Joedy McCreary", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/23"}]}

Here's when to turn ...", "text": "We haven’t made it through summer just yet, but fall is on the horizon, and soon after, daylight saving time will once again end as our clocks fall back for the winter.\n\nEach fall, those who observe daylight saving time, commonly referred to as daylight savings time, set clocks back one hour to allow for more daylight during winter mornings, according to Timeanddate.com.\n\nAlthough we’re more than two months away from the annual event, here’s a refresher on daylight saving time and related information to keep in mind.\n\nWhen does daylight saving time end?\n\nFor those wondering when daylight saving time begins, we have a secret for you: we’re already in it.\n\nDaylight saving time began Sunday, March 12 this year, when clocks in the United States jumped to 3 a.m. once the clock struck 2 a.m.\n\nWhat you’re really wondering is when daylight saving time will end.\n\nDaylight saving time officially ends Sunday, Nov. 5 at 2 a.m. Clocks will fall back one hour to 1 a.m., returning us to standard time for the winter months.\n\nStandard time will be in effect until Sunday, March 12 at 2 a.m., when daylight saving time returns after clocks spring forward.\n\nWhy do we practice daylight saving time?\n\nThe idea behind daylight saving time is that it allows us to use natural daylight better, according to Almanac.com.\n\nMoving clocks forward one hour in the spring provides more daylight in the evenings during the warmer months. Moving clocks back one hour in the fall provides more daylight during the winter mornings.\n\nAdvocates of the practice say brighter afternoons and early evenings help stimulate the economy, though the practice originally began to save fuel during World War I, according to Almanac.com.\n\nDespite the seemingly simple solution, daylight saving time has faced opposition in recent years, with many wanting to do away with the practice.\n\nWho observes daylight saving time?\n\nOver 70 countries use daylight saving time, fewer than 40% of all countries in the world, and many have different beginning and end dates. More than 1 billion people participate in the phenomenon each year, according to timeanddate.com.\n\nThe only U.S. regions to not participate in daylight saving time are Hawaii, parts of Arizona, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nWho's in charge of time?\n\nSurprisingly, the U.S. Department of Transportation is in charge of daylight saving time and all time zones in the U.S.\n\n\"The oversight of time zones was assigned to DOT because time standards are important for many modes of transportation,\" according to the department's website.\n\nThe department is a proponent of the practice, as they say it conserves energy.\n\nAre daylight saving time clock changes going away?\n\nIn March, the U.S. Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent this November.\n\nThis would end the twice-annual clock-changing routine by making daylight saving time the official standard time at 2 a.m. on Nov. 5, extending the eight-month practice to year-round.\n\nThe legislation was reintroduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and is supported by more than half the states.\n\nThe House of Representatives, which has held a committee hearing on the issue, must past the bill before it can end up on President Joe Biden’s desk for signing.\n\nStates may exempt themselves by state law in accordance with the Uniform Time Act, as amended.\n\nICYMI:New law will ban polystyrene, some single-use plastics from Delaware restaurants\n\nSupport for permanent daylight saving time\n\nIf permanent daylight saving time takes effect, the biggest benefit would be no sleep disruption. No need to change your clock twice a year before, at or after 2 a.m. on a Sunday in the fall and spring. Experts say ending the adjusting of clocks and disruption of established sleep patterns is better for our health.\n\nOther perks would be and end to resetting clocks and other devices, and more time during the day to be out and about in daylight hours.\n\nObjections to permanent daylight saving time\n\nOpponents of permanent daylight saving time say extending sunlight later into the evening will result in greater sleep loss and pose a public health threat.\n\nThis doesn’t mean opponents of permanent daylight saving time enjoy changing clocks twice a year, though. Those who oppose daylight saving time often voice a preference for making standard time, also known as winter time, the permanent timeframe.\n\nWhat to do for the end of daylight saving time\n\nAt least for now, Delaware remains a participant of daylight saving time and will fall back in November.\n\nWith most of our computers, smartphones and other devices automatically changing the time for us, it's not as much of a chore as it used to be. Unless you have smart appliances, microwaves and ovens are on the short list of household items that will need a manual adjustment, as will manual clocks.\n\nUnlike the spring forward earlier this year, where many people woke up grouchy after losing an hour of beauty sleep, you can sleep soundly on Nov. 5 knowing you’ll be getting an extra hour of rest.\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

Reintroduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, the act would permanently extend daylight saving time for the entire year. However, the measure has not yet been signed into law by President Joe Biden as it hasn't yet been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, where it was \"held at the desk.\"\n\nBelow are some commonly asked questions about the time shift.\n\nWhat is the Sunshine Protection Act?\n\nThe Sunshine Protection Act would permanently extend daylight saving time from just eight months to the entire year. in January 2021, Rep. Vern Buchanan first introduced the bill, which was reintroduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and seven other bipartisan members of Congress in March 2022.\n\nThe measure, which would make daylight saving time permanent across the country, still needs to be passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into law by President Joe Biden.\n\nFor more information on the Sunshine Protection Act of 2021 bill from congress.gov click here.\n\nDid the Sunshine Protection Act pass?\n\nThe Sunshine Protection Act of 2021 passed the Florida Legislature, but the state needs Congress approval and the U.S. House has not passed the law.\n\nRubio sponsored the bill in the Senate while Buchanan, R-Longboat Key, filed the House companion bills. In 2021, Rubio introduced it and in 2022, the House \"held at the desk\" meaning they never voted on it, according to the bill on congress.gov.\n\nOn March 2, 2023, 12 U.S. senators reintroduced legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent, nearly a year after the Senate voted unanimously to do so.\n\n“Changing our clocks twice a year is inconvenient and entirely unnecessary. It's time to end this antiquated practice,” Buchanan said in a March 3 news release, just over a week before daylight saving time started for 2023.\n\nDid the Sunshine Protection Act of 2023 pass?\n\nOn March 1, 2023, Rubio’s bill was introduced and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. An identical bill by Buchanan was introduced and referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce the same day, then referred to the Subcommittee on Innovation, Data, and Commerce on March 10.\n\nWhen did federal time changes start?\n\nThe Standard Time Act of 1918 was the first law to implement standard and daylight saving times at the federal level.\n\n\"Federal oversight of time zones began in 1918 with the enactment of the Standard Time Act, which vested the Interstate Commerce Commission with the responsibility for establishing boundaries between the standard time zones in the U.S.,\" according to The U.S. Department of Transportation. \"This responsibility was transferred from the Interstate Commerce Commission to DOT when Congress created DOT in 1966.\"\n\nWhen was daylight saving time 2023?\n\nThis year's daylight saving time began at 2 a.m. Sunday, March 12.\n\nWhen is daylight saving time 2024?\n\nAfter ending this November, daylight saving time will return at 2 a.m. Sunday, March 10, 2024, and last until Sunday, Nov. 3, two days before the 2024 election.\n\nWho is in charge of daylight saving time?\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation oversees the observance of daylight saving time as well as U.S. time zones, according to transportation.gov. The DOT said energy reduction and reduced crime are reasons for having both standard and daylight saving time.\n\nWhich states don't observe daylight saving time?\n\nArizona and Hawaii do not recognize daylight savings time as well as territories Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas.\n\nHow many countries observe daylight saving time?\n\nMore than 70 countries in the world observe daylight saving time, however the start and end dates can differ.\n\nLess than 40% of countries globally still observe daylight savings time switches, despite over 140 countries implementing them previously, according to Statistica.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/02/14/daylight-savings-time-indiana-2023-when-does-the-time-change/69902714007/", "title": "Daylight savings 2023: When does the time change in Indiana?", "text": "Daylight Saving Time is beloved by business owners and despised by the average American as it comes and goes every year, providing extended daylight throughout part of the year.\n\nThere's no question there is much love for the extra time spent for outdoor activities and, of course, shopping.\n\nHowever, changing our clocks in the middle of the night twice a year is not ideal for most Americans.

Here's what you need to know about Daylight Saving Time:\n\nHistory of Daylight Saving Time:Looking back at Indiana's complicated relationship with time\n\nWhat is Daylight Saving Time?\n\nIt is a practice used to make use of the extra sunlight we receive in the spring, summer and fall evenings, according to timeanddate.com.\n\nThe website notes that over 70 countries worldwide use Daylight Saving Time with beginning and end dates varying from one country to another. More than one billion people are affected each year.\n\nWhich is correct − daylight saving time, daylight savings time or daylight saving's time?\n\nIn short, most people say it wrong and have for most of their lives.

However, conventional use actually leans significantly toward saying Daylight Savings Time despite being grammatically incorrect.\n\nFalling Back and Springing Forward:The Effects on Your Health, a Facebook Live discussion\n\nWhen is Daylight Saving Time 2023?\n\nAccording to timeanddate.com, Daylight Saving Time 2023 runs from Mar. 12 through Nov. 5 in the U.S.\n\nWhen does the time change?\n\nThe time in the U.S. changes at 2 a.m. twice a year for DST. In the spring, clocks move forward to 3 a.m. In the fall, clocks move back an hour to 1 a.m.\n\nWhich states don't participate in Daylight Saving Time?\n\nAs of July 25, 2022, the U.S. Department of Transportation notes that only Hawaii and parts of Arizona do not participate in Daylight Saving Time. The territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands also do not particiapte.\n\nAccording to the website, states may exempt themselves from observing Daylight Saving Time by state law in accordance with the Uniform Time Act, as amended.\n\nShould we continue Daylight Saving time?Op-Ed: Eliminating twice yearly clock changes makes sense. But there will be consequences.\n\nWhen does the time change or spring forward in 2023?\n\nAt 2 a.m. on Sunday, Mar. 12.\n\nWhen does the time change or fall back in 2023?\n\nAt 2 a.m. on Sunday, Nov. 5.\n\nWhat is the the Sunshine Protection Act?\n\nThe Sunshine Protection Act of 2021 would make Daylight Saving Time the new, permanent standard time, according to USA TODAY. This means once clocks spring forward next March, they would not change in November of next year. Clocks would no longer need to be changed twice a year.\n\nWhen does Daylight Saving Time end permanently?\n\nThis is still undecided. According to USA TODAY, the Sunshine Protection Act of 2021 was passed by the Senate and awaits a vote by the House. If completely approved by Congress and voted into law, Daylight Saving Time would become the official standard time at 2 a.m. Nov. 5, 2023.\n\nCan DST impact health when it is time to spring forward?\n\nSimply put, yes. According to timeanddate.com, there are several side affects associated with DST. They include:\n\nThe Monday after the start of DST is believed to be the main reason for increased traffic accidents due to tiredness from the time change.\n\nAnother study from Michigan State University applies the same thinking to workplace injuries, noting injuries were of greater severity compared to other Mondays through the year.\n\nMiscarriages for in vitro fertilization patients have been linked to the start of DST.\n\nThe DST switch in the spring also brings about an increased risk of heart attack over the first three days following the time change, according to a study out of Sweden.\n\nRenewable energy:Concerns about blackouts in the Midwest pit renewables against fossil fuels\n\nCan DST impact health when it is time to turn the clocks back?\n\nOnce again, yes. According to timeanddate.com, the main side affect associated with DST in the fall is depression. Moving back an hour can bring about mental illness such as bipolar disorder, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD). This also widely known as winter depression.\n\nMale suicide rates rose in the days following the spring and fall DST change, according to a study out of Australia.\n\nAccording to a Danish study, depression cases rose 11% after the time change. However, cases tend to clear up gradually after approximately 10 weeks.\n\nA positive side affect is a decrease in heart attack rates in the fall, according to a study.\n\nAnother study showed the number of car accidents in Canada fell slightly after DST in the fall.\n\nDaylight Saving Time in Indiana\n\nHere's a look at the history of DST in Indiana:\n\n1940s: Indiana passes a bill to keep the state on Central time and outlaw daylight saving time.\n\nIndiana passes a bill to keep the state on Central time and outlaw daylight saving time. 1950s: The General Assembly votes to make Central time the official time of Indiana, but permits any community to switch to DST during the summer.\n\nThe General Assembly votes to make Central time the official time of Indiana, but permits any community to switch to DST during the summer. 1960s: The previous law is repealed in 1961.

But unless you have smart appliances, microwaves and ovens are among the household items that will need a manual adjustment.\n\nWho's in charge of DST? When did it start? Why does the United States and more than 70 other countries observe it? Here are the answers to those questions, and more:\n\nDo we gain or lose an hour?\n\nWe all lose an hour of sleep when going to DST, as the day is only 23 hours long.\n\nWhen clocks go forward, that one hour of daylight is basically shifted from morning to evening as daylight saving time begins. We won't go back to standard time until Sunday, Nov. 5.\n\nWho's in charge of time?\n\nSurprisingly, the U.S. Department of Transportation is in charge of daylight saving time and all time zones in the U.S.\n\n\"The oversight of time zones was assigned to DOT because time standards are important for many modes of transportation,\" according to the department's website.\n\nWhat is the future of daylight saving time?:Year-round change depends on federal vote.\n\nWhen did the U.S. officially enact daylight saving time?\n\nDST became a national standard in the U.S. in 1966 with the passage of the Uniform Time Act. States either have to change the clocks at a specified time or stick with standard time throughout the year.\n\nIn 2007, the federal government expanded daylight saving time in order to reduce energy consumption. The law now specifies that daylight time applies from 2 a.m. on the second Sunday of March until 2 a.m. on the first Sunday of November\n\nDaylight saving time now accounts for about 65% of the year.\n\nFederal law does allow states to remain in standard time all year, but states must first get approval from Congress before making daylight saving time permanent.\n\nDid Benjamin Franklin invent the time change?\n\nWhile not necessarily advocating changing time, Benjamin Franklin urged his fellow countrymen to work during daylight and sleep after dark, thus saving money on candles. (It was likely a tongue-in-cheek comment.)\n\n'Zombie ant fungus' in humans?:Climate change sparks fungi fears — Some serious and some silly.\n\nHow many countries observe DST?\n\nMore than 70. It's known as summer time in some countries, including the United Kingdom and in Europe. No one is sure just how much daylight is saved, globally, each year, though physics indicates none.\n\nWhy was daylight saving time created?\n\nThe DOT says daylight saving time conserves energy. When the sun sets later, it's presumed that people will stay out longer and spend more time outside. Theoretically, that leads to less electricity for lights and appliances.\n\nThe debate over daylight saving time, which was first enacted by the federal government during World War I as a way to conserve coal, has picked up momentum in recent years.\n\nWhat are the downsides to DST?\n\nNot everyone agrees it offers energy-saving benefits. Some studies report the time switch saves energy on lighting, but is surpassed by increases in heating and air conditioning. It can also mess with our sleep patterns, at least temporarily.\n\nOther health impacts consequences, according to various studies and research, include increased headaches, heart attacks and depression.\n\nWhat states do not do daylight saving time?\n\nOnly two states don't observe it – Hawaii and Arizona. Other non-observers include American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\nDo some states want year-round DST?\n\nYes. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, in the past five years, 19 states have \"enacted legislation or passed resolutions to provide for year-round daylight saving time, if Congress were to allow such a change, and in some cases, if surrounding states enact the same legislation. Because federal law does not currently allow full-time DST, Congress would have to act before states could adopt changes.\"\n\nGrammar check: It's actually saving –not savings time\n\nThe correct term is daylight \"saving\" (not savings) time. However, the incorrect term “daylight savings time” is commonly used, especially in Australia, Canada and the United States. It's also supposed to be lowercase, not uppercase, according to the Associated Press stylebook.\n\nDig Deeper", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/09/13/first-day-fall-equinox-sunrise-and-sunset-times-daylight-saving-time/70840845007/", "title": "When does fall start?

This results in the days becoming shorter than nights, as the sun continues to rise later and nightfall begins earlier.\n\nThis change is in effect until the winter solstice occurs, after which days become longer again.\n\nWhen is sunrise?\n\nSunrise times will vary slightly based on the exact location, but the sun generally will begin to rise around 7 a.m. in early October.\n\nIn Delaware, the sun will rise at 7 a.m. on Oct. 3.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the sun will rise at 7 a.m. on Oct. 5.\n\nIn New Jersey, the sun will rise at 7 a.m. on Oct. 6.\n\nAfter these dates, the sun will continue to rise later as the season continues.\n\nWhen is sunset?\n\nAs with sunrise times, sunset times also will vary slightly based on the exact location.

While most of the United States prepares to set their clocks back an hour earlier on Nov. 6, a bill in Congress could change daylight saving time.\n\nThis year, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act, which was introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida. The bill would permanently extend daylight saving time from eight months of the year to the full 12 months. But the measure has not yet been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, nor has it been signed into law by President Joe Biden.\n\nWhen does daylight saving time end in 2022?\n\nDaylight saving time 2022 ends at 2 a.m. Sunday, Nov. 6. On that date, clocks must be set one hour earlier. That's falling back.\n\nWhat is the future of daylight saving time? Year-round change depends on federal vote\n\nWhat's the purpose of daylight saving time?\n\nDaylight saving time, which is regulated by the Department of Transportation in the U.S., was initially introduced during World War I by Germany in 1916, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\n\nThe idea was to conserve power and fuel by making daylight last longer, according to the Bureau. The U.S. adopted daylight saving time in 1918 but abolished it nationwide after the war, though it was allowed on a state-by-state basis, the Bureau reported.\n\nWhen the Department of Transportation was founded in 1966, it was granted regulatory power over daylight saving time and time zones. Only Arizona, Hawaii and U.S. territories including Puerto Rico permanently observe standard time.\n\nA Department of Energy study found the extra four weeks of daylight saving time saved around 0.5% in total electricity daily in the U.S., equalling energy savings of 1.3 billion kilowatt-hours annually.\n\nThe federal 1966 Uniform Time Act, which became law because of the random way states had been observing daylight saving time up until then, has been a roadblock for supporters of year-round daylight saving time. The act allows states either to change clocks to daylight saving time at a specified time and date or remain on standard time all year.\n\nWhat will Arizona do if daylight saving becomes permanent?\n\nThe Sunshine Protection Act would not extend to states such as Arizona, with the exception of the Navajo Nation, that do not observe daylight saving time.\n\nIf the legislation becomes law, Arizona and California would always be on the same time.\n\nWhile Arizona could decide to switch to Mountain Daylight Time, the idea is unpopular in the state. In 2015, state Rep. Phil Lovas, R-Peoria, unsuccessfully introduced House Bill 2014, which would have reversed a 1968 state law opting out of the federal Uniform Time Act.\n\nWhy does Arizona not follow daylight saving time?\n\nAccording to https://www.history.com, daylight saving time was introduced during World War I, although it did not become an annual observance in the United States until 1966. But not every state wanted it. Timeanddate.com points out that in Arizona we have too much sun in summer. Why stick people with another hour of scorching daylight? So state officials decided to leave the clocks alone.\n\nBut people in part of Arizona do change their clocks. The Navajo Nation — which extends from Arizona into New Mexico and Utah — observes daylight saving time so that everyone who lives on the reservation is on the same schedule.\n\nHawaii is the other state that doesn't observe daylight saving time. It doesn't need the extra daylight either: Hawaii sits at a tropical latitude and there isn’t much difference in the length of days in summer and winter.\n\nHow daylight saving time affects Arizona and California\n\nArizona is on Mountain Standard Time. When the rest of the country goes on daylight saving time in the spring, Arizona is three hours behind our East Coast friends and two hours behind Chicago. When daylight saving time ends in November, we're two hours behind the East Coast.\n\nYour favorite programs might come on later than usual after March 13. Check your DVR settings to make sure they will reflect daylight saving time or you might miss your shows.\n\nArizona sports fans have to account for daylight saving time, too, especially NFL fans. In September and October, football games that start at 1 p.m. on the East Coast come on at 10 a.m. here. Once daylight saving time ends in November, those games come on at 11 a.m.\n\nWhat happens when Congress votes on daylight saving time?\n\nIf the Sunshine Protection Act of 2021 becomes law, the bill would make daylight saving time the new, permanent standard time as of Nov. 5, 2023. That means once clocks spring forward next March, they would not change in November of next year.\n\nThe Senate voted unanimously to pass the bill on March 15. The bill now awaits a House vote.\n\n“It’s unclear if the House will vote this year, given everything else on the agenda once they return after the elections,” Ben Husch, natural resources and infrastructure committee director for the National Conference of State Legislatures, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nWhat are the benefits of daylight saving time?\n\nIf permanent daylight saving time takes effect, the biggest pro by far would be no sleep disruption. No need to change your clock twice a year before, at or after 2 a.m. on a Sunday in the fall and spring.\n\nOther perks would be more time during the day to be out and about, and experts say it's better for your health — no sleep disruption. No preparing-for-bed or waking-up habits to change.\n\nProponents of staying on standard time year-round say the same thing.\n\nArizona Republic reporters Shanti Lerner and Tara Kavaler contributed to this report.

Marco Rubio said at the time. “Just this past weekend, we all went through that biannual ritual of changing the clock back and forth and the disruption that comes with it. And one has to ask themselves after a while why do we keep doing it?”\n\nAnd yet, all these months later – and with the clocks set to be turned back – the Democratic-led House has not picked up the measure. And it seems unlikely to do so in the lame-duck session that will follow the next week’s midterm elections.\n\n“I can’t say it’s a priority,” Rep. Frank Pallone, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told The Hill newspaper in July.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she personally favors making Daylight Saving Time permanent, but said in March that “it’s not going to be much of an issue” for her caucus.\n\nWhich is odd. Because making Daylight Saving Time permanent is broadly popular. A Monmouth University poll conducted in March showed that 61% of Americans would favor getting rid of our twice-annual clock changes. The survey also found that 44% of Americans prefer making Daylight Saving Time permanent, while 13% (who are these people!) want to operate on standard time all year.\n\nThe debate of Daylight Saving Time has been going on for a very long time. And the misunderstanding about why we do it goes back at least as long. It is not, as is commonly assumed, because we wanted to give farmers more time to work in the fields in the spring and summer. Instead, it’s aimed at reducing our electricity consumption by making it light later in the day.\n\nIn fact, our current practices on Daylight Saving Time are fewer than two decades old. Prior to 2007, DST began in April and ended in October. But in 2005, President George W. Bush – in hopes of addressing the country’s long-term energy issues – made Daylight Saving Time start three weeks earlier and end a week later.\n\nThe Department of Energy found in 2008 that the four-week extension of Daylight Saving Time saved roughly .5% of electricity use every day. So there’s that.\n\n(Sidebar: The US is not alone in observing Daylight Saving Time. Seventy other countries around the world do too. But in Britain, France and Germany, the change is on a different schedule: clocks spring forward on the last Sunday in March, and fall back on the last Sunday in October.)\n\nThe origins of the idea are up for debate.

Maybe the confusion lasts a few groggy minutes, or even hours, before you realize there's nothing wrong with you.\n\nIt's the clocks. Again.\n\nWhen is daylight saving time?\n\nDaylight saving time ends for most of the United States at 2 a.m. on Nov. 6, which means another year of turning the clocks back and another four months of early sunsets as the weather starts to get colder.\n\nBut there's a new wrinkle this year: It might be the last time you have to turn the clocks back.\n\nIn March, the U.S. Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, which would permanently keep the country in daylight saving time and end the biannual clock-turning. The measure, championed by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., passed by unanimous consent. Some senators didn't realize until afterward what the bill actually entailed.\n\nWhile the bill is yet to receive a vote in the House, the Senate bill is the furthest the country has come in more than 40 years to ending our long national nightmare.\n\n\"Do we still need to spring back or fall back in the first place? It's a question that many of us ask every time we have to do it,\" U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-NJ, said at a congressional hearing on daylight saving time in March. \"And it's getting harder and harder to justify.\"\n\nUnder standard time, the sun will rise at 7:15 a.m. and set at 4:33 p.m. on Dec. 21, the shortest day of the year.\n\nWith daylight saving time, the sun would rise at 8:15 a.m. and set at 5:33 p.m.\n\nOn June 21, 2023, the longest day of the year, the sun will rise at 5:26 a.m. and set at 8:29 p.m. under daylight saving time. If standard time were practiced year-round, the sun would rise at 4:26 a.m. and set at 7:29 p.m.\n\nThe Senate vote in March has infused momentum into the push to stop the clock-turning for the first time in decades. It's not a new issue for states: According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 28 states have active legislation in support of keeping daylight saving time all year.\n\nAnd since 2015, daylight saving time bills and resolutions have been introduced in nearly every state.\n\nDayling saving time in New Jersey\n\nNew Jersey is one of them: state Sen. Shirley Turner, D-Mercer, has introduced a bill every legislative session since 2016 seeking to put New Jersey on Eastern Daylight Time permanently.\n\n\"Turning our clocks back is really an archaic practice that no longer serves a purpose in this modern age,\" she said when the bill cleared a state Senate committee last year.\n\nIn an era where \"divisiveness\" has become a dinner table conversation for many American families, there seems to be one area with which we can all agree: Turning the clocks back is the worst.\n\nAccording to a Monmouth University poll, 61% of Americans support a measure to end the practice. But the question that remains is a little harder to parse out.\n\nThe Monmouth University poll, in March 2022, found 44% support a permanent move to daylight saving time, while 13% of poll respondents support switching permanently to standard time.\n\nBut an October 2021 poll from the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs put the split at 43% to 32% in favor of standard time.\n\nOPINION:Time to ditch Daylight Saving Time, sleep experts say\n\nDaylight saving time proponents say making it the new norm is a no-brainer: Less darkness means less crime, fewer car crashes and less energy used. More sunlight means more recreation and commerce.\n\n\"The net benefits of evening sunshine far outweigh their costs,\" said University of Washington law professor Steve Calandrillo, testifying at the congressional hearing on daylight saving time. \"Any small, increased risk that evening sunshine creates is dwarfed by the benefits of living life during the early evening in more sunshine.\"\n\nBut who knows how long such appreciation for daylight saving time would last if made permanent: During the energy crisis of the 1970s, the U.S. stayed in it for two years.\n\nAbout 79% of Americans favored the switch, a poll showed at the time. But by the time Congress instituted a new four-month standard time, daylight saving time had just 42% approval.\n\nDaylight saving time opponents argue that our bodies are intrinsically linked to the sun and the seasons. Those early sunsets feel natural too, until we start messing with the clocks. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine believes permanent DST \"disrupts the natural seasonal adjustment of the human clock due to the effect of late-evening light on the circadian rhythm.\"\n\nBut most health experts agree that settling into daylight saving time or standard time is better than changing the clocks twice a year. Dr. Xue Ming, a neurology professor at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, said our circadian rhythms are already out-of-sync: We're tuned to operate on a 24.5-hour biological clock, but our lives operate on a 24-hour calendar.\n\nThat extra adjustment with the clocks is enough to have a noticeable effect on some people, especially young children and seniors, she said.\n\n\"We train ourselves to align with the light and the darkness,\" Ming said. \"When you push the clocks one hour forward or backward, everyone has to adjust.\"\n\nAnd disrupting our circadian rhythms isn't just a nuisance: It's dangerous.\n\nSleep-deprived drivers cause more than 6,400 deaths and 50,000 debilitating injuries on American roadways each year. According to the National Sleep Foundation, sleep-deprived drivers cause more than 6,400 deaths and 50,000 debilitating injuries on American roadways every year.\n\nAnd in 2004, a study by Rutgers University researchers posited that a permanent switch to daylight saving time would reduce pedestrian fatalities by 13% and motor vehicle fatalities by 3%.\n\nMing suggested people who have difficulty adapting use ambient light to help staying awake later or waking up earlier, depending on the time of year.\n\n\"Some of us don't do too well in the morning, in general. When you get up an hour earlier or later, it makes it that much harder,\" she said.\n\nMike Davis has spent the last decade covering New Jersey local news, marijuana legalization, transportation and a little bit of everything else.

But the city auditor examined a sample of 82 parking ticket appeals and determined the average wait time for a response was 40 days. One case took 78 days.\n\nFor drivers who later took challenges to the Justice of the Peace Court, the total appeals process lasted more than a year, on average, according to the audit. Long-delayed disputes can cause courts to dismiss city claims, leading to a loss in revenue, the audit report stated.\n\nCathy Rossi, vice president of public and government affairs at AAA Club Alliance, said in a statement that inefficiencies in parking ticket operations can hinder economic growth.\n\n\"By fixing parking problems, we can be paving the way for a better quality of life for residents and visitors, enabling economic development, and creating a more efficient, citizen-friendly city government,” Rossi wrote.\n\nGary Fullman, chief of staff to Mayor Dennis P. Williams, on Monday said a backlog of appeals existed until the first months of this year. The issue, he said, has since been resolved by \"better managing the workflow.\"\n\nCarolyn Martin-Pettaway, former director of the Office of Civil Appeals, said backlogs during the period of the audit happened because her office did not have enough workers processing appeals. It had two employees in 2014, according to the report.\n\n\"We didn't have adequate staff,\" said Martin-Pettaway, who now works as an assistant to Sen. Margaret Rose Henry, D-Wilmington.\n\nShe also disputed Fullman's claim, saying no backlogs in appeal requests existed when she retired in January.\n\nAAA Mid-Atlantic officials say appeals continue to take months, and as a result they are directing the company's considerable governmental advocacy efforts toward fixing perceived parking ticket inefficiencies.\n\nAAA spokesman Ken Grant said he personally endured a painfully slow process when appealing a parking meter ticket earlier this year. It took months for the city to respond to his challenge, he said.\n\n\"They claimed they sent the letter to me. ... They said they would send it to me again. I waited another week. Still nothing. So I finally had to go in and physically get the letter there at the (city) office,\" Grant said. \"It was a March ticket, and it was July before I got that part resolved.\"\n\nIn July, The News Journal documented persistent driver frustration over Wilmington parking fines.\n\nIf a parking ticket appeal is rejected by the city, drivers can challenge it again at Justice of the Peace Court. Those appellants, on average, endured a 404-day legal process between the time they received the parking violation and when it reached a resolution.\n\nThe 2014 audit, released as part of a Freedom of Information Act request, also determined that officials at the Office of Civil Appeals granted certain parking ticket appeals without documenting a particular reason. An appeal being granted means the ticket is dismissed.\n\n“There are insufficient controls in place to ensure that tickets are voided in a consistent and valid manner absent of personal discretion,” said the report, which was signed off by City Auditor Earl T. Jeter.\n\nOf the 1,651 appeals the auditor examined in 2014, more than 1 in 3 were granted. The percentage of voided tickets increased 11.3 percent between 2011 and 2014, according to the report.\n\nInformation in the audit was gathered by employee interviews, auditor observations and an examination of the parking violation database.\n\nThe civil appeals office, as a result of the audit, ended its use of Excel spreadsheets to track appeals and shifted instead to an automated system. It also became incorporated with the Mayor's Office of Constituent Services. Both actions reduced appeal wait times, according to the office's official response to the audit in 2014.\n\nGrant said he continues to help frustrated drivers appeal parking tickets and said response times still to take months. City officials have helped those individual drivers, he said, but they fail to acknowledge there are systemic issues.\n\nSTORY: No quarters? Rehoboth Beach meters now take plastic\n\nSTORY: Santa, is that you? Mystery donor pays kids' lunch bills\n\n“It’s almost like whack-a-mole, rather than saying there’s something that needs to be looked at holistically,” Grant said. “There seems to be a resistance to saying we need to look at the entire system as a whole.”\n\nThe city in 2012 also adopted a series of parking ticket changes, including discounts for early payment and improved training for parking enforcement officers. The city should take further action, AAA officials say, and regularly publish wait times for parking ticket appeals.\n\n“Audits clearly show multiple inefficiencies and missed opportunities,\" Rossi said.\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

The retiring sheriff also didn't want to shoulder a future sheriff with a program that he or she might not want, he told the Citizen Times recently.\n\nWilliams could never secure buy-in from outgoing Asheville Police Chief Tammy Hooper either, he said. She recently announced her resignation, effective Jan. 2.\n\n\"I think once we get one of those big law enforcement agencies on board, I would hope that other agencies would have no problem,\" Williams said before Tuesday's election. \"Hopefully, we'll see somebody step up who wants to approach these problems in a new way.\"\n\nEnter Quentin Miller.\n\nBy a resounding margin, the county chose Miller, a 25-year veteran of the Asheville Police Department, to helm the sheriff's office after Duncan retires at the end of November. And Miller, unlike either of his opponents in the heated race, has long touted the need for alternatives to incarceration.\n\n\"It may sound crazy, but in order for us to help some people, we can't always incarcerate them,\" Miller told the Citizen Times in an interview Thursday. \"We're willing to try something different so long as people are still safe.\"\n\nWhat is diversion?\n\nPre-charge diversion programs, such as Seattle's Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion, offer low-level offenders — namely drug addicts arrested for possession or small property crimes — an option: treatment or time in a cell.\n\nMore serious offenders, those charged with felonies or suspected of committing violent crimes, are not eligible for diversion.\n\nLEAD, which law enforcement started in King County, Washington, in 2011, has since received nationwide attention. The program has been replicated or otherwise outsourced to cities and counties across the nation, including in North Carolina.\n\nFayetteville, Wilmington and even Waynesville have adopted LEAD-styled programs, hoping to get at one of the main causes of criminality in the era of mass opioid dependency: addiction.\n\nRecognizing what he sees as the potential of these programs, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein has been holding statewide, roundtable meetings about pretrial diversion options for the past year and a half. Williams was the only district attorney to attend a recent such meeting, which was held in Raleigh on Oct. 29.\n\nStein told the Citizen Times that he's interested in pre-charge diversion programs because he believes they have a better shot at reducing drug dependency than simply locking addicts away.\n\n\"The physical urge to get heroin in their body is so strong that they will do almost anything to get the money to buy drugs; that's the cycle we have to break,\" Stein said, describing why drug addiction and small property crime often go hand in hand.\n\n\"If we want to address the criminality of people who use drugs, the most effective thing we can do is break them of their chemical dependency.\"\n\nBuncombe County already offers a host of post-charge diversion options.\n\nProsecutors can elect not to pursue cases against people who choose to seek treatment though a venue like the county's Drug Treatment Court. But post-charge diversion does little to address fact that there are currently some 370 inmates the Buncombe County Detention Facility currently being held awaiting trial. The jail holds about 600 people.\n\n\"Diversion programs will give us the opportunity to divert people coming into the justice system and to get those people help,\" Miller said. \"They allow law enforcement to divert people away from jail before they ever hit the system.\"\n\nMiller said that he wouldn't support the diversion of violent offenders, those accused of committing sex crimes or people suspected of committing crimes against children.\n\nThe cost of a charge\n\nCharges alone can be life altering for people. Charges — even without convictions — can disqualify people from employment. And they can derail families financially as posting bail can be expensive.\n\n\"Just having an arrest record has collateral consequences,\" said Williams, who as a prosecutor knows this better than many people. \"That's why a LEAD-style program is the next step of the evolution of diversion in Buncombe County.\"\n\nMiller said he'd have to speak with his deputies and take community advice before he committed to any pre-charge diversion program, but he shares Williams' concerns. He also recognizes another harsh reality of the status quo.\n\n“Charges don’t stop you from taking up bed space in the jail either,” Miller said.\n\nAs the county grows and as the number of open beds in the jail shrinks, this is worthy of concern, Miller said. And he's not the only person who thinks so.\n\nCounty Commissioner Jasmine Beach-Ferrara told the Citizen Times she remembers discussions about building a new jail from the winter of 2016, shortly after she was elected.\n\n\"Forty-seven million dollars was the price tag that we heard about building a new jail,\" she said. \"These are very real questions, and we need to look at every option and solution.\"\n\nThough those conversations ended without the county committing any funding to a new facility, Beach-Ferrara said, that discussion is likely not over. In an October interview, Duncan told the Citizen Times that the 604-bed jail typically holds close to 590 inmates on any given day.\n\nA $47 million price tag is high, but Stein shared a few more numbers that he finds relevant to discussions about incarceration. It costs about $100 a day to keep somebody in jail in North Carolina, and the state spends about $32,000 a year to hold people in prison.\n\n\"This is not a cost-effective way to treat people's illnesses,\" he said.\n\nBig changes in Buncombe County\n\nOne of Duncan's biggest hang-ups when asked about pre-charge diversions was cost.\n\nNobody yet knows exactly what a pre-charge diversion program in Buncombe County would look like, so it's hard to say how one might affect the sheriff's bottom line.\n\nWilliams and Miller both said that the community — including law enforcement officers, attorneys and judges — would need to weigh in before any program was put in place. The powers that be would need to decide who would be eligible for diversion and how such a program would work.\n\nElecting a sheriff that is interested in pursuing pre-charge diversion was just the first step, Williams said.\n\nBut the $1.75 million MacArthur grant recently awarded to Buncombe County with the goal of reducing the jail population should certainly help ease financial concerns.\n\nThe grant is part of a $148 million national initiative known as the Safety and Justice Challenge, which aims \"to reduce over-incarceration by changing the way America thinks about and uses jails,\" the county wrote in a press release announcing the grant late last month.\n\nThe Justice Resource Advisory Council, of which Williams is a member, will help advise the county when it comes time to allocate the $1.75 million award. Williams said that diversion programs would go a long way toward helping the county move toward the goal of the grant.\n\nMiller has been meeting with Williams and others in others in the criminal justice system for months to discuss diversion options. The most important consideration in determining whether such programs will become reality in Buncombe is whether the community is ready, he said.\n\n\"A lot of has to do with the community and with officers' buy-in,\" Miller said. \"I've talked about changing the mindset from being warriors to guardians. This is going to be the test. The mindset has been 'lock 'em up, lock 'em up, lock 'em up' and I was that way, too. But we've got to change.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/12/05/accused-loiterers-and-panhandlers-getting-banned-wilmington/2190018002/", "title": "Loitering, panhandling can get you banned from Wilmington", "text": "This story has been updated to reflect the changed narrative regarding the stabbing death of a woman in Baltimore.\n\nNineteen-year-old Isiah Barnett was standing at a Wilmington bus stop on a November afternoon when a police officer told him he was under arrest.\n\nThe crime, according to police, was his presence in downtown Wilmington.\n\nTwelve days before, Barnett had been banned from the city's business district. A justice of the peace ordered his exile from the 40-square-block area around Market Street on Oct. 25.\n\nIt was a condition of his bail for charges of \"aggressively\" panhandling and resisting arrest, records show. Barnett said he asked a friend for money — panhandling itself is not illegal — and walked away from a police officer.\n\nThe teen is one of at least a half-dozen people accused of nonviolent, minor crimes who have been ordered to have no contact with large areas of Wilmington as a condition of their release from jail, The News Journal has learned.\n\nSome defendants awaiting trial for low-level crimes like loitering, aggressive panhandling and disorderly conduct have been banished from the entire city.\n\n\"It’s outrageous,\" said Dan Atkins, executive director of the Community Legal Aid Society, Inc. \"Poverty is unpleasant. The solution to it isn’t to protect ourselves from it by pretending that it doesn't exist.\"\n\nNo-contact orders are a standard way to keep accused perpetrators of crimes away from their victims during the course of a criminal case, said retired Wilmington police officer Dan Selekman.\n\nThe restrictions, typically requested by police and approved by a justice of the peace, can prohibit a drug dealer from returning to their area of business or a domestic abuser from visiting their alleged victim between bail and sentencing.\n\n\"It's usually related to someone who is causing a tremendous amount of issues,\" he said.\n\nThe little-known use of broad bans for minor crimes, which experts said is unusual and ineffective, is supported by Wilmington Police, Mayor Mike Purzycki and at least some downtown business leaders.\n\nThey are being issued here as cities nationwide grapple with how to handle complaints of panhandling.\n\nLaws against aggressive begging were passed recently by officials in Erie, Pennsylvania and Ocala, Florida; the mayor of Indianapolis invested $500,000 last month in police and services to curb panhandling; and a Maryland man called for a panhandling crackdown after he claimed his wife was fatally stabbed while trying to give someone money in Baltimore. Police and prosecutors later said the man was responsible for his wife’s death.\n\nSelekman said the purpose of no-contact orders, in general, is to protect the victims.\n\n'\"It’s (the court's) responsibility to make sure the victim doesn’t get revictimized,\" he said.\n\nIn Barnett's case, the victim named in court records was \"society.\"\n\nCriminalizing poverty?\n\nWhile pre-trial geographic restrictions are not new in Delaware, the breadth of the orders issued for minor, poverty-related crimes has raised eyebrows in Wilmington criminal justice circles in recent weeks.\n\nLocal and national experts in the rights of the poor said it's unusual and inhumane to ban people — some of whom are likely homeless, addicted to substances or mentally ill — from Wilmington, which is a hub of social services.\n\n\"I see no evidence that people can comply with them,\" said Katherine Beckett, a University of Washington sociology professor.\n\nBeckett wrote a book called \"Banished: The New Social Control In Urban America\" about the tactics governments use to quietly remove \"unwanted\" people from public spaces. In her research, she has not seen the type of no-contact orders being used in Wilmington. Similar methods perpetuate incarceration, she said.\n\n\"What you get is the person is cycling in and out of jail more than they would otherwise,\" she said. \"It’s not a long-term solution. It's not even a short-term solution.\"\n\nAssistant Public Defender Meryem Dede represents Barnett and has witnessed three others facing vagrancy-related charges who were ordered not to enter Wilmington city limits at all until the conclusion of their cases.\n\nThose people, who she cannot name due to confidentiality obligations, have faced charges for some combination of aggressive panhandling, resisting arrest, loitering, disorderly conduct and noncompliance with their bond.\n\nShe said the no-contact orders cause hardship for clients experiencing homelessness.\n\n\"We don’t have shelters that are outside the city but are still close enough that you could make an 8:30 a.m. trial,\" she said.\n\nViolation of a no-contact order is punishable by up to a year in jail, Dede said.\n\nThe News Journal requested records from the city, state and the court system to gain an understanding of how many defendants are banned from Wilmington and municipalities throughout Delaware via pre-trial no-contact orders. It did not receive the information by publication.\n\nWilmington PD apologizes after advising people to ignore 'aggressive panhandlers'\n\nTina Showalter, a former Delaware prosecutor, said the no-contact orders she saw in her career with the Department of Justice were specific, such as prohibiting contact with a victim or place of business.\n\nEven in cases involving drug trafficking or a large criminal enterprise, Showalter said she isn't aware of anyone banned from an entire city.\n\n\"They were related to the subject of the underlying offense and structured by the court in a defined way,\" she said.\n\nDepartment of Justice prosecutors are not involved at Justice of the Peace Court in the setting of bail in low-level offenses like loitering and aggressive panhandling.\n\nWhen a News Journal reporter met Barnett in Wilmington on Nov. 29, he was not aware that his no-contact order was in place but said such restrictions would not be realistic for him because \"I got family up here.\"\n\nBarnett, who said he lives in Wilmington but whose court records state his residence is in Maryland, could not be reached for further comment.\n\nNot a new practice\n\nPolice Chief Robert Tracy said geographic restrictions have been used for decades but the department renewed its interest in the method about a year ago.\n\nPublic and private officials with an interest in tempering loitering and panhandling got together in November 2017.\n\nThe attendees were Justice of the Peace Court Chief Magistrate Alan Davis; Deputy Attorney General A.J. Roop; a Wilmington police officer; a representative of a local college; the deputy director of Downtown Visions, a nonprofit that promotes business interests; and a representative of Buccini/Pollin Group, Wilmington's largest developer, according to Davis.\n\nThe parties talked about complaints from downtown businesses regarding panhandling and loitering, Davis said. No-contact orders were discussed as a tool for combating these issues, said Downtown Visions Deputy Director Michael Maggitti.\n\nThe police representative expressed that the department should pursue geographic restrictions more often and would recommend it to the officers, according to Maggitti.\n\nBPG co-founder Rob Buccini could not be reached for comment.\n\nAfter the meeting, Davis said he relayed the business district's concerns to judges he oversees. He said that he did not make any directive to increase the use of geographic no-contact orders for vagrancy-related offenses.\n\n\"No one is under any order to put restrictions in place,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Davis, the practice is \"thoughtfully done.\"\n\n\"If somebody presents a significant risk that they’re going to re-offend in that area, a geographical restriction is not a bad idea,\" he said. \"Obviously, you want to tailor them as closely as you can.\"\n\nTracy couldn't say on Tuesday how many people are currently banned from parts or all of the city or whether the increased awareness of no-contact orders as a tool has resulted in more of them being issued.\n\nHe promised to research the question but said the citywide orders are rare.\n\nWilmington police chief says 'no new trend' in aggressive panhandling\n\nTracy recalled a sergeant told him that in one six-month period in 2017, about 15 people were banned from downtown Wilmington as a bail condition for various alleged crimes.\n\nAs for effectiveness in reducing crime, Tracy said the no-contact orders require \"a longer study.\"\n\n\"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t,\" he said.\n\nThe chief said he hadn't heard of the practice until he was briefed on the November 2017 meeting but has since incorporated the concept into his Compstat meetings. When an officer shares information about a habitual offender, Tracy asks: Have we sought geographic restrictions?\n\nIt's not illegal to simply ask for money or hold a sign soliciting donations. Tracy said police are not targeting people who conduct themselves without bothering or harassing others.\n\n\"We're not doing it unnecessarily because people are poor,\" he said. \"You can ask for money. No one is stopping that. It’s the behavior surrounding it.\"\n\nFor Tracy, no-contact orders are tools that help assuage the concerns of people who report alarming or menacing behavior by panhandlers.\n\n\"People are asking us what we're doing about it, and we’re trying to appeal to all needs of the community,\" he said. \"It’s a delicate balance.\"\n\nTracy emphasized that the orders are not unilateral decisions made by cops. They are approved by justices of the peace, he said.\n\nOfficers must demonstrate to the justice that the defendant does not live or work in the area and is there \"for no other purpose than to commit a crime,\" according to Tracy.\n\nIn Delaware, justices of the peace are not required to be lawyers. Some are not.\n\nDefendants sign off on the order to confirm they understand the conditions, Tracy said. If the restriction would limit their ability to visit their lawyer, doctor or social service provider, they may tell the justice, Tracy said.\n\nLegal questions\n\nBeyond moral and practical concerns, the use of broad no-contact orders may be unconstitutional, according to American Civil Liberties Union Legal Director Ryan Tack-Hooper.\n\n\"It’s an excessive and unreasonable condition of bail,\" Tack-Hooper said, noting the issues raises First Amendment issues and other legal questions.\n\nThe purpose of bail, as defined by law, is to protect public safety and ensure the defendant shows up to court. Showalter said banning a person from part or all of the city does neither.\n\n\"Are you trying to protect the community or are you just trying to kick someone out of that location?\" said Showalter, who heads Housing Alliance Delaware, which connects homeless people with shelter.\n\nEric Tars, senior attorney with the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington D.C., said he hasn't seen other jurisdictions use geographic no-contact orders like they're being utilized in Wilmington.\n\nThe practice, he said, is \"ridiculous.\"\n\nPushing poor people out of the city may be more politically expedient than investing in solving the root causes of poverty, Tars said, but it's counterproductive.\n\n\"If cities expended half the energy on looking for creative solutions than constitutional loopholes to continue enforcing these criminalization approaches, we’d be much further ahead,\" he said. \"But unfortunately that's where they do put all of their energy.\"\n\nTars pointed to Philadelphia's Hub of Hope as a model of how a city can tackle issues of homelessness head-on. Since 2012, the walk-in engagement center in Suburban Station has served as a place to get coffee, take a shower, wash laundry and connect with case managers who can help clients find treatment programs and permanent housing.\n\n\"The best approach is not to force those people to go somewhere else but give them a better choice,\" he said. \"Nine times out of 10, they will take that better option.\"\n\nAsked for an interview, Purzycki's office instead offered an emailed statement in which he stood by the use of the no-contact orders.\n\n“These restrictions are court-ordered,\" he said. \"There are times when a record of crime, aggressive behavior or repeated offenses warrant certain restrictions. I trust the judgment of the courts and the Wilmington Police Department to do what is right to protect the public and protect the rights of individuals.\"\n\nAccording to Selekman, when it comes to loitering and panhandling, broad geographic no-contact orders don't benefit anyone.\n\n\"You can pump them out into the county, but they’re still homeless, and they may have drug or alcohol addiction,\" he said. \"They’re still in need of whatever that service is.

The final vote was 21-15 with five lawmakers — all Democrats — opting not to vote at all.\n\nThe defeat marked the end of a nearly two-year effort to join states such as Colorado and California in legalizing the drug for use by adults 21 and older.\n\n\"We're devastated that the House of Representatives would vote against this citizen-led effort ... and vote in favor of allowing the criminal market to control the most lucrative cash drop in Delaware,\" said Zoe Patchell, head of the Delaware Cannabis Advocacy Network and the leading voice of the legalization movement here.\n\nFor co-sponsors Rep. Helene Keeley, D-Wilmington, and Sen. Margaret Rose Henry, D-Wilmington, the vote also signifies the end of a long crusade to reform Delaware's marijuana laws. Both women are retiring at the end of their current term.\n\nTogether, they sponsored legislation that in 2011 created the state's medical marijuana program and a 2015 decriminalization law that downgraded possession of an ounce or less from a criminal offense to a civil violation, like a parking ticket.\n\n\"Of course I wanted to be able to go out on a good note,\" Keeley said after the vote on full legalization. \"I'm a little sad I couldn't get it done. I couldn't get it over the goal line.\"\n\nAdvocates for full legalization have faced steep opposition since the bill was introduced in early 2017.\n\nDespite meeting with marijuana advocates, Gov. John Carney repeatedly said he was not in favor of House Bill 110, arguing that more time is needed to study the full impact of marijuana legalization elsewhere.\n\nThe Delaware Marijuana Control Act also was condemned by a coalition of influential organizations that represent police, hospitals, doctors and some of the state's largest employers.\n\nLed by AAA Mid-Atlantic, those groups argue that legalizing cannabis will result in a surge of drugged-driving crashes, emergency room visits, drug addiction and children being exposed to marijuana.\n\n\"We believe the final vote reflects the necessary caution before any major public policy change,\" said Cathy Rossi, vice president of public and government affairs for the Delaware-based car club. \"From a road safety perspective, we want Delaware drivers, passengers, bicyclists and pedestrians spared the increased risk of marijuana-impaired drivers that states like Colorado and Washington are now facing.”\n\nIn explaining their opposition, several Republican lawmakers cited various statistics — ranging from increased drugged driving to spikes in infant exposure — from states where marijuana has been legalized.\n\nBut Keeley said the concerns raised behind closed doors by her fellow Democrats — who ultimately decided the outcome — centered on the opposition of law enforcement groups such as the Delaware Police Chiefs' Council.\n\nRep. Trey Paradee, D-Cheswold, said those opposed to the legislation are on the wrong side of history, noting that 61 percent of state residents support legalization according to a 2016 poll conducted by the University of Delaware.\n\n\"This bill is going to pass,\" he said. \"Maybe not tonight but it is inevitable.\"\n\nAdvocates had attempted to counter resistance to the bill by arguing legalization would largely replace what is now a criminal industry with a legal one that could yield more than $20 million a year in tax revenue.\n\nTax dollars raised by the legal industry would have been directed toward education, helping prisoners re-enter society, drug abuse rehabilitation and prevention programs and initiatives aimed at training police officers to recognize whether drivers are under the influence of marijuana and other drugs.\n\nHouse Bill 110 also would have created a commission to regulate, license and tax the state's marijuana business, which could have included as many as 40 retail stores, along with growing operations and testing facilities. The state's three medical marijuana\n\ndispensaries would have been given the first opportunity to open retail operations.\n\nIntroduced in March 2017, the legislation managed to get out of committee last year but failed to get a vote on the House floor.\n\nThat led Keeley and Henry to create a 25-member task force that spent seven months studying how the state might regulate a legal marijuana industry. The hope was that the final report from the panel — made up of legalization proponents, opponents and representatives from various state agencies — might help sway undecided or uncommitted legislators.\n\nInstead, the task force ended in confusion and controversy with members refusing to endorse the final product.\n\nThat did not stop Keeley from using the task force's report to write an amendment that sought to address many of their concerns, while also reducing the total vote count needed for passage.\n\nThe prior threshold was set by the addition of new criminal penalties related to fines for underage consumption while the new version relies on existing laws to accomplish the same goal.\n\nThat change was not enough to secure the bill's passage, however. The amendment still required support from a three-fifths super-majority due to the new fees it created for licensing cannabis-related businesses.\n\n\"If it had been a simple majority, it would have passed,\" Patchell said. \"This is absolutely inevitable and we're going to continue our efforts to replace the dangerous, criminal market for cannabis with a legal, taxed and well-regulated system.\"\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/02/07/dart-restores-some-rodney-square-bus-routes-but-not-most/301877002/", "title": "DART restores some Rodney Square bus routes, not enough for riders", "text": "The Delaware Transit Corp. announced on Wednesday that it will return three bus routes to Rodney Square in Wilmington but is rejecting public demands to restore all stops to the former transportation hub.\n\nDART said it reviewed customer feedback from three public meetings and decided to \"make a series of improvements,\" according to a press release.\n\nStarting Sunday, the Rodney Square bus stop on 10th Street will service routes 2, 6 and 28. But the other 10 routes that were removed from the square will stay that way, scattered around downtown, DART said.\n\nGov. John Carney indicated the dismantling of the hub in December will help restore Rodney Square as the \"crown jewel of Wilmington.\"\n\n“The success of our state depends in large part on the success of Wilmington,” Carney said in a statement. \"We must continue the work to revitalize the Square as a historic public park. We’re continuing to make improvements to our transit system that balance the needs of riders and those who use Rodney Square.”\n\nBACKGROUND:Bus riders clash with DART over elimination of Rodney Square stops\n\nRoute 6 runs from Wilmington to Newark. Route 2 travels from the Amtrak station up Concord Pike to the Concord Mall and Brandywine Town Center, and Route 28 goes from Amtrak through Trolley Square to Nemours/A.I. duPont Hospital for Children.\n\nRiders and their advocates have complained for weeks at public meetings and in dozens of calls to the Governor's Office since Dec. 17 when changes took effect. On Wednesday night, about two dozen city residents spoke at a City Council committee meeting to demand the routes revert back to the way they were.\n\n\"This is a travesty of justice,\" said Tasmania Wootson, a disabled grandmother of eight who described a scary walk home from her new stop. \"It is dark. There is no complete lighting. There is no police protection around.\"\n\nOpponents to the changes are concerned about elderly and disabled riders who struggle to walk the distance to new connections. They are also confused about new routes, aggravated that some of the new stops lack benches and shelters and bothered that they feel there was no reason to change the routes in the first place.\n\nDART CEO John Sission said the changes were meant to reduce congestion but also to satisfy the visions Carney and Mayor Mike Purzycki have for the square.\n\nPurzycki said in an email last week that he believes Rodney Square \"can either be an aesthetically pleasing central square or it can be a congested bus hub.\"\n\nRiders and their advocates, including state Rep. Charles Potter Jr. and Sen. Robert Marshall, say the government is valuing the interests of the businesses around Rodney Square more than the customers who patronize the bus system.\n\n\"We want to make Rodney Square great again?\" said coalition member D. Marque Hall on Wednesday. \"Come on now. These are people. ... We can't have public transportation. We got public discrimination.\"\n\nPurzycki said in a statement on Thursday that his concerns about Rodney Square are \"focused on the congestion caused by a large number of buses.\"\n\n\"We want to create a more beautiful town square that everyone can enjoy,\" he said. \"Anyone who says or implies that my concerns or intentions go beyond this goal are ill-informed.”\n\nFive City Council members sent a letter on Wednesday afternoon asking DART to make adjustments to appease riders. It did not request that Rodney Square become a bus hub again. According to the date on the letter, it was sent after DART had already drafted a press release about its latest adjustments.\n\nMembers of the public criticized the council on Wednesday for allegedly not advocating for them earlier.\n\n\"I am pissed off that this body did not put out a statement before time,\" said Jakim Mohammed, a member of the Coalition to Keep Bus Service on Rodney Square. \"New Castle County Council, who I'm always beefing about, put out a statement.\"\n\nPublic commenter Deion Wilson called the council's response \"weak\" and \"a disgrace,\" especially, he said, because many council members are black. The council cannot control DART, he said, but it can advocate for its residents. Instead, he said the council has been more concerned with \"witch\" prayers and emotional support animals than \"real issues.\"\n\n\"You did nothing, and this is your city,\" he said. \"When I vote, not one of you getting my vote.\"\n\nCouncil members, included President Hanifa Shabazz and Councilwoman Michelle Harlee, defended themselves and emphasized DART is a state-level agency.\n\n\"We’ve made demands. They have answered to those demands,\" Shabazz said. \"I think we’re doing a great job.\"\n\nScott Spencer, a longtime transit consultant and coalition member, said the state's updated changes are \"minimal.\"\n\n\"It certainly does not address the widespread discrimination and disruption that people are suffering from,\" he said. \"It certainly is good they're restoring some service, but it doesn't restore the convenience of the bus hub that was there.\"\n\nCustomers, especially those who are elderly or physically challenged, say they struggle to make connections that are several city blocks apart. Some of the transfers require an uphill walk.\n\n\"I'm disabled,\" said 49-year-old Jeffrey Cassidy, who walked uphill to catch a bus last week. \"It's difficult because I've had a stroke and my balance is off so I've got to walk with a walker.\"\n\nIf riders miss their transfer bus, they can wait 30 minutes or sometimes an hour for the next bus — and some of the new stop locations lack bus shelters and benches.\n\nCity resident Robert Vesnaver used to travel out of Rodney Square. Last week, he caught a bus at a stop downtown that had no bench or shelter.\n\n\"If it snows or rains, you're getting soaked,\" he said as he stood in windy, 20-degree weather in a sweatshirt. \"What can you do?\"\n\nIn response to feedback, DART is adding benches to bus shelters on French Street at Eighth Street as well as 10th Street at Tatnall Street. Shelters and canopies are also being ordered for installation along King Street at 10th Street and at Ninth and Sixth streets.\n\nVesnaver said there has not been enough communication about the changes, and many riders are confused.\n\n\"They don't have no maps out here,\" he said.\n\nNothing compares to the convenience of having a central transit hub, Spencer said.\n\n\"Every transfer you needed to make was right there at Rodney Square,\" Spencer said. \"Now you're left to fend for yourself in the city. It's the most disruptive change DART has made in their history.\"\n\nDART is planning to build a replacement hub near the Amtrak station, but construction hasn't started. It won't be completed for at least two years. The opponents of the changes argue if the routes needed to change, officials should have waited until there was a new hub.\n\nRELATED: Wilmingtonians resist 'discrimination' in transportation, housing\n\nSpencer called DART's changes a \"shameful sham.\" He also alleged \"what DART did is illegal\" because he said the public notices outlining changes did not precisely match the changes that were implemented.\n\n\"Federal Transit Administration guidelines say if you receive federal funds, you need to give the public proper, complete and accurate notice of service and route changes,\" said Spencer, who has worked in transportation for 40 years.\n\nDART's marketing and public affairs officer, Julie Theyerl, said: \"We disagree with Mr. Spencer’s allegations.\"\n\n\"DART’s website clearly showed the proposed routing and bus stops prior to public hearing workshops, and the notices stated proposed changes to downtown bus routing and stops,\" she said.\n\nTheyerl sent The News Journal a public notice that was posted ahead of a Sept. 20 meeting. It alerted riders to \"bus route and schedule changes\" but makes no mention of Rodney Square.\n\nSpencer believes DART violated laws that protect citizens' civil rights. U.S. Department of Transportation civil rights complaint forms were passed out at Wednesday's meeting at the request of Councilman Samuel L. Guy.\n\n\"There's no way to make this right other than to put the buses back in a centralized hub,\" Spencer said.\n\nContact Christina Jedra at (302) 324-2837, cjedra@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/04/17/peltz-effort-raise-fears-dupont-research-hubs-will-cut/25958437/", "title": "Peltz plan raises fears DuPont research hubs will be cut", "text": "Jeff Mordock, and Maureen Milford\n\nWilmington\n\nActivist investor Nelson Peltz says he will work to slash between $2 billion and $4 billion from DuPont Co. if he wins a proxy fight with the company and secures four seats on its board – including one for himself.\n\nPeltz is coy on details, explaining he does not yet have inside knowledge to guide him on precisely where to cut. But many fear DuPont's celebrated research operations will be on the chopping block.\n\nDelaware is home to two of DuPont's most vital scientific laboratories – The Experimental Station, a 150-acre campus on Route 141 in New Castle County, and the Stine Haskell Research Center along Elkton Road in Newark. Combined, the two facilities employ 3,100, many in high-paying research-driven positions.\n\nSteve Isberg, an associate professor of finance at the University of Baltimore, said cuts to DuPont's research budget would have a devastating impact on the Delaware economy.\n\n\"There is a multiplier effect on the economy when you lose high-paying jobs,\" he said. \"Those people will leave their high-income homes, impacting the housing community, which will then reverberate into the local consumer markets.\"\n\nIn a two-hour interview with The News Journal, Peltz and senior officials for his New York hedge fund Trian Fund Management did not comment about specific plans for the research operations.\n\n\"Research and development is an important element of DuPont's future success, but like the rest of the business it needs to be well-managed and produce acceptable returns,\" he said.\n\nArthur B. Winkleblack, former chief financial officer of H. J. Heinz Co. and one of Trian's four nominees for DuPont's board, said costs could be streamlined by developing products that will generate the most sales – and producing those products in markets they're consumed.\n\n\"We would rather have research and development closer to the consumer,\" Winkleblack said.\n\nDuPont, which has market capitalization of $67 billion, operates in more than 90 countries with more than 150 research and development centers throughout the globe.\n\nIts Experimental Station in Wilmington was built in 1903 and is the birthplace of the company's most important and profitable products – nylon, Kevlar, Tyvek and the world's first synthetic rubber, neoprene. Roughly 2,500 employees work at the 150-acre campus, including hundreds of PhDs.\n\nStine Haskell, with 600 employees, is growing. DuPont is building a $35 million soybean research facility in Newark that will include two state-of-the-art automated greenhouses. The project is expected to be completed in 2016, with room for future expansion.\n\nWorldwide, DuPont employs 63,000 people. Its 7,000 Delaware employees constitute 11 percent of the state's workforce.\n\nGov. Jack Markell said a reduction in research and development would undermine the state's identity as a global science leader. He's worried about Peltz's plans to divide DuPont into separate companies.\n\n\"There is significant cross-pollination among the scientists working there,\" the governor said. \"If you split DuPont in two, what happens to that cross-pollination? My gut tells me that it would not be positive.\"\n\nPeltz also called for turning seven business units into two separate companies. Agriculture, nutrition and health and industrial biosciences would be split into one company. The remaining units, comprised of DuPont's cyclical, high-cash generating businesses, performance materials, safety and protection and electronics and communications, would become another single company.\n\nShould Peltz win, what was once DuPont could be split into three independent units. The company has already decided to spin off its performance chemicals unit, Chemours, this summer.\n\nShareholders vote on nominees in the proxy fight on May 13, and a recent Wells Fargo analyst report predicted a loss for Peltz. The meeting, open only to DuPont stock owners, is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. at the chemical giant's headquarters at Chestnut Run Plaza.\n\nJohn Roberts, an analyst at UBS Securities, said he has not seen any sound data to determine which side will win, but acknowledged that incumbents, or sitting companies, usually have the edge in proxy elections.\n\n\"This is like any other election process,\" he said. \"Some vote for the incumbent and some vote for change.\"\n\nTrian Chief Investment Officer Ed Garden argues it's been years since DuPont scored on a success innovation – a sign the company's research and development reputation is larger than its actions.\n\n\"It's clear something is wrong because there is no next nylon or Kevlar,\" he said. \"We need to go on the inside and work with other board members to figure out why that is.\"\n\nParry Norling, who worked 16 years at the Experimental Station as a research manager, argues that DuPont's research and development efforts are functioning well, and are crucial to the company's long- and short-term success. Separating DuPont's business units could negatively impact the station, he said, because groups across multiple sectors collaborated to create new products such as the ink Hewlett-Packard sells for printers.\n\n\"You can't separate those units,\" Norling said. \"Sometimes it was two units and someone from central research working as a three-way team.\"\n\nThe success of one unit can lead to a critical development for another unit, Norling added. For example, the printer ink innovation lead to the creation of a dye to color carpets.\n\nPeltz has called for DuPont to increase its debt-to-equity ratio, arguing a modest amount of debt could help the company improve its earnings-per-share target. Competitor Monsanto Co. took a similar step last year.\n\nSome analysts said the Trian proposal is flawed because it overlooks DuPont's standing as a global science leader. Products range from Mylar and fungicides to pharmaceuticals and bioscience products, creating an economic wake that includes numerous support businesses inside and outside Delaware.\n\nIsberg, of the University of Baltimore, said \"DuPont lives and dies by its research and development.\"\n\n\"It needs cash flow for its research efforts,\" he said. \"If DuPont loads itself up with debt and another fixed-interest payment, that cannibalizes your ability to do future research and development.\"\n\nTrian began gathering DuPont shares in the summer of 2013 when it disclosed the purchase of a 0.6 percent stake in the company. Since then, the hedge fund has amassed a 2.7 percent share of DuPont stock, estimated to be worth $1.8 billion. In September 2014, Trian sent a sharp letter to DuPont's board that lauded the company's decision to spin off its performance chemicals unit, Chemours, but demanded DuPont further divide the company into two distinct units.\n\nPeltz said he tried for two years to work with the company to reduce spending and improve performance before he initiated the proxy war, but he was rebuffed by Lead Independent Director Alexander M. \"Sandy\" Cutler, who also is CEO of Eaton Corp., a power management company based in suburban Cleveland.\n\nIn February, Peltz met with DuPont Chief Executive Officer Ellen Kullman and Cutler to discuss a potential compromise. Under the agreement, DuPont would support Myers for its board if Trian agreed to back its investor slate. DuPont officials said Peltz walked away from the agreement because the company would not select him as the potential board member.\n\nDuring his interview with The News Journal, Peltz said if DuPont does not want him on the board, he would be willing to step aside and let Garden, a proposed alternate nominee, take his seat.\n\nCutler said that a Trian nominee joining DuPont's board could have negative repercussions.\n\n\"People say, What harm can one director do?\" Cutler said. \"But this is a comprehensive attack on the leadership of DuPont's board with a present agenda to leverage the balance sheet and break up the company. We think it doesn't create value for shareholders.\"\n\nCutler denied that he campaigned to keep Peltz off the board. He said the board talked with the four Trian nominees and concluded they did not possess the skills needed for boardroom seats. Cutler called the proxy vote a \"comprehensive attack on the leadership of DuPont with a present agenda to leverage the balance sheet and break up the company.\"\n\nHe said a new concern is that Peltz wants to have to up to 20 Trian employees act as analysts for the four new board members. Allowing non-board members to play a role in board decisions has the potential to run afoul of Securities & Exchange Commission regulations, Cutler said.\n\n\"Trian, in a sense, becomes shadow management\" if the proxy vote goes its way, Cutler said. \"The corporate governance model that comes with Trian is very inappropriate. Their proposal is littered with corporate governance conflicts of interest that are simply unacceptable.\"\n\nDuPont says Trian's claims about lackluster growth are inaccurate. Kullman noted that their multi-year strategy has created a stronger company that delivered shareholder returns of 266 percent over the past six years she's been CEO, outperforming both the Standard & Poor's 500 and the company's proxy peers. Employees also benefited from stronger returns, she said.\n\n\"We are both a long-term and short-term company,\" Kullman said in an interview with The News Journal.\n\nShe claimed Peltz is focused on generating a short-term stock bump at the expense of DuPont's long-term growth. And she worries what would happen to the company down the road.\n\n\"Our long-term approach has helped us emerge stronger from the financial crisis,\" she said. \"We've seen that strategy generate shareholder returns. The change has been hard in the short-term, but in the long-term it makes sense.\"\n\nIn February, she blasted Peltz's record with Chemtura, a manufacturer of flame-retardant plastics. Trian founding partner Edward Garden got a seat on Chemtura's board. Garden eventually resigned from the board in 2009 and Chemtura declared bankruptcy a few months later.\n\nFormer DuPont Chief Executive Edgar S. Woolard Jr., the former Apple Computer Inc. board chairman credited with helping to bring Steve Jobs back to the company, said he believes Kullman has developed a winning strategy.\n\nPeltz, by contrast, is proposing to take the company in an unknown direction that \"may or may not work,\" solely for the purpose of a short-term boost in the stock price, he said. Woolard finds distasteful the quick-turn approach employed by activist investors, noting that companies also have a responsibility to their communities and employees.\n\n\"To totally disrupt the company to get the stock price up in the short term, including laying off a lot of people, seems reckless and inappropriate,\" Woolard said. \"I can't believe Trian is going to get a majority of shareholders to vote for it.\"\n\nHe praised the leadership of both Kullman and the board.\n\n\"I'm sure if Peltz's logic was compelling,\" he added, \"the board and leadership would listen.\"\n\nPeltz believes his overarching moves could elevate DuPont's stock price above $120 per share. On Friday, the stock traded at $71. As Peltz sees it, DuPont will become a leaner, stronger operation – and the benefits will trickle down to other business in the state.\n\nIf the company does not right its ship, Peltz said, its headquarters city of Wilmington, which has struggled in recent years to overcome its reputation for violent crime, will take another punch in the gut.\n\n\"If DuPont starts to grow, Wilmington will get better,\" Peltz said.\n\nHowever, he criticized the company for assembling a hospitality portfolio created for the benefit of the employees and the community. In the wake of the Peltz proxy fight, the company in January sold The DuPont Theatre in downtown Wilmington to The Grand Opera House, a move that \"represents a strategic and mutually beneficial business decision,\" Kullman said in a statement at the time.\n\nCompany officials later announced plans to move the entire company headquarters out of the DuPont Building at 10th and Market streets at Rodney Square, home to central offices since 1908. About 1,000 workers will be relocating to Chestnut Run Plaza at Lancaster Pike and Centre Road in July. The downtown space will then house offices for Chemours.\n\nDuPont also is taking bids for sale or management of the Hotel du Pont and the DuPont Country Club, a source familiar with the process said. Three hotel parking lots also have been sold recently.\n\nAnother concern among Delawareans is the possibility that Peltz could cut DuPont retiree health benefits. DuPont has an estimated 81,000 retirees, 10,000 who call Delaware home.\n\nThere are no federal or state regulations prohibiting companies from eliminating or reducing retiree health care benefits. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, does not protect retiree health benefits. Retirees only recourse is a breach of contract claim under the 1974 federal statute.\n\nMadan Joshi, a microbiologist who retired from DuPont in 2007, said a cut in retiree health care benefits could be \"a big blow\" for DuPont retirees who did not have high-paying jobs.\n\nHe also is concerned about current employees in their 50s who are nearing retirement. If Trian wins the proxy fight, he asked, would its board members push for cuts to retirement benefits of current employees?\n\n\"My concern is about people who are on the edge financially and in terms of their ability to retire,\" Joshi said. \"These Trian people, their goal is not to make the company more productive and stabilize things. It's to get in and makes cuts, cash in and go somewhere else. That's what their track record is.\"\n\nPeltz has not threatened to cut DuPont retirees health benefits, but his actions at ketchup maker H. J. Heinz Co. have local retirees worried. After two Trian candidates joined the board, Heinz stopped providing retirees with health insurance and created a reimbursement account. The company started with a $7,000 contribution the first year, but eventually lowered it to $3,500.\n\nIn March, a group of former DuPont employees discussed the possibility of filing a class action lawsuit if the company reduces or eliminates retiree health benefits. They have not yet spoken with an attorney about a potential case.\n\nIn a statement, Trian said its plan to improve DuPont's performance is the best way to protect retiree benefits.\n\n\"Trian's interests are fully aligned with those of DuPont's current and former employees, customers, stockholders and the Wilmington community,\" Carissa Felger, a spokeswoman for the hedge fund. \"If elected, Trian's nominees will strive to help DuPont to always be in a position to honor its obligations to current and retired employees.\"\n\nThis proxy battle is unprecedented, the first in DuPont's 213-year history. Throughout the majority of its history, the company was controlled by the du Pont family. While there was a nasty public fight among family members from 1915 to 1918 over the sale of company stock, this is the first time DuPont has fended off an activist investor.\n\nPeltz came to national attention in 1997 when one of his investment vehicles, Triarc Cos., acquired Snapple from Quaker Oats. Snapple was combined with other beverage brands and sold to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000.\n\nHe founded Trian in 2005, and within a year launched a proxy war for Heinz. He succeeded in placing two new directors, including himself, on the company's board.\n\nPeltz pushed for cost-saving ideas that resulted in Heinz selling or shuttering 15 factories and reducing spending by $355 million. The leaner Heinz attracted a venture between Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Capital. The companies paid $28 billion, or $72.28 per share, in an April 2013 sale, generating a 20 percent return on investment for shareholders.\n\nIn 2008, Triarc merged with fast-food giant Wendy's. Peltz pushed the burger chain to sell Tim Horton's, an under-performing doughnut subsidiary. Wendy's also consolidated three marketing units into one and cut 375 corporate jobs in a series a moves that saved $100 million.\n\nGarden said the goal was to eliminate unneeded spending and concentrate on core products.\n\n\"We are focused on driving growth while reducing oppressive bureaucracy,\" Garden said. \"It is not just about cutting costs.\"\n\nWinkleblack, the former Heinz official, disputes Cutler's view that Trian is looking to divide companies. Peltz waged a successful proxy battle with Heinz in 2006, and Winkleblack initially opposed Peltz's admittance to the company board of directors on similar grounds. When the dust settled, Winkleblack said, Peltz worked with the board and had success creating shareholder value.\n\n\"To Nelson's credit, he sat down with me after a bitter proxy war and said, 'Let's make money for shareholders,' \" Winkleblack said.\n\nTrian's Garden said the hedge fund wants to help reposition DuPont, to bring in new ideas and to help it make smart decisions. Trian officials have said DuPont is too tied to its science legacy and isn't creative enough.\n\n\"We are not dogmatic,\" Garden said. \"What we are trying to do is facilitate a debate on why DuPont's business units are not best in class when it comes to sales growth and margins.\"\n\nThat view is fiercely opposed by DuPont officials, who hammer home the fact that shares have increased 266 percent since Kullman became chief executive in 2009.\n\nThe Peltz plan is fundamentally flawed, Kullman argued. Were DuPont to make all of the \"functional and corporate costs\" proposed by Trian, Kullman said, it would only total $2.8 billion – less than the $4 billion in fat Peltz believes to exist in the company.\n\n\"If we do all the cuts Peltz wants, we could not close the books,\" she said, adding later, \"We are not an underperforming company.\"\n\nPeltz's lack of details troubles Markell.\n\n\"How can I take comfort in words that are not backed up without a focused strategy?\" the governor asked.\n\nThe question comes down to whether the company is performing as poorly as Peltz claims, said Roberts of UBS in New York. If that's the case, layoffs are inevitable regardless of the proxy war's outcome, he said.\n\n\"If Peltz is correct, those jobs are a matter of time,\" Roberts said. \"If DuPont is not producing results, sooner or later something has to change and he could bring the change earlier rather than later.\"\n\nMatt Arnold, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis, said it's likely any staffing reductions will be spread across the entire portfolio.\n\n\"Job losses could not just be a Delaware situation, it could be an everywhere situation,\" Arnold said. \"The heightened amount of scrutiny on costs could imply a headcount reduction across every element of the business all around the world.\"\n\nIsberg predicted that no matter the outcome of the proxy vote, DuPont will change.\n\n\"The real question is not will some kind of restructuring happen,\" he said. \"The real question is how is it going to happen. There has been too much attention paid to DuPont for the company not to do some kind of restructuring.\"\n\nA sign that DuPont may consider structural reform came in February with the additions of Edward Breen and James Gallogly to the company's board.\n\nGallogly is former chairman and CEO of LyondellBassell Industries, a tightly integrated chemical company similar to DuPont. While guiding it out of bankruptcy, Gallogly resisted urges to separate LyondellBassell's business sectors.\n\nBreen was chairman and CEO of security systems-maker Tyco International, where he faced his own battles for control of the company's board. Immediately upon being appointed CEO, Breen sought to replace Tyco's entire board of directors.\n\n\"The two new directors have worked in the area of restructuring,\" Isberg said. \"To me, bringing those two directors say DuPont is going to do more house cleaning here.\"\n\nIn that respect, it's likely DuPont will continue feeling pressure to analyze core business operations even if Trian is not successful in gaining seats, Arnold said.\n\nAsked about what DuPont will look like with himself and three other Trian board members, Peltz said he has the best interest of the company in mind – restoring the company to greatness.\n\n\"My career was not built on cutting costs,\" he said. \"I don't believe you can cut your way into prosperity.\"\n\nContact Maureen Milford at 324-2881 or mmilford@delawareonline.com.

The decision garnered opposition before it was made and has received criticism since.\n\nThere are some remaining lines that stop in the square, but only buses that travel outbound to suburbs like Newark and Hockessin or downstate to places like Dover and Odessa said John Flaherty, who leads the Coalition to Keep Bus Service on Rodney Square.\n\nThe organization said it has collected over 1,300 signatures opposing the changes.\n\nDART designed the meeting as a quiet meet-and-greet for bus riders to weigh in on recent service changes. But Flaherty had other ideas.\n\nHe came armed with a wireless microphone and speaker that advocates used to voice their feelings to the room.\n\n\"There's no rhyme or reason for this,\" Flaherty said, adding that he feels the dismantling of a city's transit hub is an unusual and radical move. \"I can't think of any other place in the country that's doing this.\"\n\nRELATED: Wilmington officials kick off land bank, 'key' to new development\n\nDART's main explanation for changing the routes is that it wanted to reduce \"congestion and overcrowding.\"\n\nThe transit organization had attempted to remove buses from the area before but folded under public opposition to moving a hub to Shipley Street.\n\nIt decided to pursue the effort again after it received complaints from the downtown business community and had discussions with Gov. John Carney and Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki, said John Sisson, DART's chief executive officer.\n\n\"I believe that Rodney Square can either be an aesthetically pleasing central square or it can be a congested bus hub,\" Purzycki said in an email on Tuesday.\n\nRodney Square is surrounded by businesses like the Hotel DuPont, owned by the Buccini/Pollin Group, and the Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor law firm.\n\nSisson said corporate interests \"were a voice like anyone else’s voice,\" but several rider advocates expressed their skepticism about that.\n\n\"The governor and the mayor accommodated the corporate tenants around Rodney Square and didn't give sufficient consideration to the riders,\" said state Sen. Robert Marshall.\n\nFlaherty has filed Freedom of Information Act requests for state officials' correspondence relating to Rodney Square. He hopes to learn more about how the decision was made.\n\nDART insists it's all for the good of transportation.\n\nJulie Theyerl, DART's marketing and public affairs officer, said many of the buses that used to drive south down King Street now use French and Shipley streets too.\n\n\"We expanded the transit footprint downtown,\" she said.\n\nBut some riders are confused about DART's reasoning.\n\n\"I didn't think it was congested,\" said DART customer Charles May, 67. \"Rodney Square is perfect for buses.\"\n\nThere was no traffic study done to justify a response to congestion, Sisson said.\n\n\"It’s anecdotal and the idea that Rodney Square is a park and not a transit center,\" Sisson said.\n\nHaving it be both would not be ideal, according to Sisson.\n\n\"What happens when the bus operation works around the park, you create a certain level of congestion, the buses surround the park to the point that there are no sight lines, and there's a lot of activity like nuisance crimes,\" he said.\n\nThose alleged nuisance crimes are \"not necessarily\" committed by riders, he said, but he believes the crowds invite panhandling, and the illegal sale of cigarettes and bus passes.\n\n\"The idea that there were so many people there attracted that element,\" Sisson said.\n\nThe DART official said he feels there would be less of that activity if Rodney Square were simply a park.\n\nCoalition member D. Marque Hall, 30, said the changes are \"strategic\" and discriminatory because they disproportionately affect the poor, especially minorities.\n\n\"They're trying to appeal to people they want to buy apartments,\" he said. \"It's reminiscent of the Jim Crow south... Just because we're poor, we're not desirable.\"\n\nRELATED: Wilmingtonians resist 'discrimination' in transportation, housing\n\nDART is planning the construction of a new Wilmington transit hub near the Amtrak station, but it won't be operational for at least another two years, Sisson said.\n\nThe transit organization could've waited to change routes until then, but it wanted to get buses out of the square sooner.\n\n\"Really the desire to restore Rodney Square to a park, the desire by the mayor and governor's office to do that, and make sure downtown is a safe and vibrant pace, was the driving force of making these moves when we did,\" Sisson said.\n\nThe governor's office has received approximately 50 calls about the route changes around Rodney Square since the changes took effect, said Communications Director Jonathan Starkey.\n\n\"The governor takes the concerns he has heard seriously, and DelDOT is hosting a series of community meetings to address any issues with the new routes that may be adversely impacting riders,\" Starkey said.\n\nDART said it's listening to riders' stories and may make adjustments based on their experiences. For instance, several riders have complained about a lack of benches at new stops.\n\nTheyerl said DART decided not to install benches at all new stops because nearby businesses and neighbors are sometimes bothered when vagrants sleep on them. But DART is willing to provide them if riders ask.\n\n\"We'll see if we get specific requests for it,\" she said, adding that a compromise could be installing benches with dividers that make sleeping on them difficult.\n\nA public hearing on the bus route changes is scheduled for March, and permanent changes take effect in May.\n\nBut the reality is that the feedback will only go so far.\n\nAbsent extraordinary circumstances, Rodney Square as riders knew it is over. On Monday afternoon, the benches situated under the square's bus shelters sat empty.\n\n\"It is not our desire to return Rodney Square to a transit hub,\" Sisson said.\n\nContact Christina Jedra at (302) 324-2837, cjedra@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/07/pig-trick-record-blocking-sunscreen-bans-philly-suburb-shift-news-around-states/40563013/", "title": "Pig trick record, blocking sunscreen bans: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The City Council has rejected a proposal to punish people who give cash to panhandlers with jail time. The vote was unanimous after protesters packed a council meeting Tuesday night. Many wore stickers declaring that “poverty is not a crime.” One man held a sign saying, “Jesus was a panhandler.” The amendment would’ve criminalized passing money or objects through car windows to someone on a public road. It was tacked onto an ordinance that requires panhandlers be jailed for at least two days. That ordinance still stands. It was unanimously passed in July but has yet to be enforced or signed by Mayor Todd Strange, who’s in the final days of his term. Mayor-elect Steven Reed takes over the office next Tuesday.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Anyone with unpaid parking fines at the University of Alaska Anchorage campus has the option to reduce or cover the cost of their tickets with peanut butter and jelly. KTUU-TV reports the university says it will take donations for its annual payment tradition until Friday to help combat student hunger. Officials say the food goes to students in need. University officials say each person may use PB&J payments for two citations issued within the past 45 days. Officials say two 16-ounce jars offer a $10 credit, three jars offer a $35 credit, and five jars offer a $60 credit. Officials say any unopened commercially produced nut butter – almond, cashew, peanut – or any flavor jam, jelly, marmalade or preserves will be accepted.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Voters in one of the state’s most liberal cities rejected an initiative Tuesday that would have created the state’s only sanctuary city amid concerns that it went too far in restricting police officers. The measure drew fierce opposition from the mayor and city council, all of them Democrats, who said the initiative risked public safety and millions of dollars the city gets from the state and federal governments. The measure was pushed by activists who wanted to give a voice to Tucson’s Latino community. They said it would have sent the message that immigrants are safe and protected in Tucson at a time when many are fearful of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Officials said Tucson police have already adopted rules that go as far as legally possible to restrict officers from enforcing federal immigration laws.\n\nArkansas\n\nHelena-West Helena: The city is shelving a plan to establish a 24-hour curfew in high-crime neighborhoods. Helena-West Helena officials have discussed instituting the measure after three homicides in two days last month. Police Chief James Smith said at the time that he planned to put the issue on the City Council agenda at a meeting Tuesday. But the city is now delaying a decision. Mayor Kevin Smith told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Tuesday that one problem with implementing such a plan is the shortage of facilities for holding people who get arrested as a result of increased police activity. Smith said Helena-West Helena will focus on high-crime areas using current laws and will increase officer training. The city already has a curfew for minors.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Police say they recovered $800,000 worth of prints by Scottish abstract expressionist Benjamin Creme after a caller told them they were in their San Fernando home. Police believe the 1,200 signed prints were there for several years, but the person who had them only recently checked a law-enforcement database and discovered they were stolen. Detectives said Tuesday that the caller, who was not identified, told them they were found in a late relative’s storage locker. They include “Flame-Coloured Deva,” “Shakti II” and other works by Creme, who in later years became better known for his belief in UFOs and predictions of a second coming of Christ and other messiahs. He died in 2016.\n\nColorado\n\nGrand Junction: A former U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist who pleaded guilty to selling Colorado bobcat pelts to fur traders has been sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay $55,100 in fines and restitution. During a hearing Tuesday in Grand Junction, U.S. District Judge Marcia Krieger also ordered Thad Bingham never to use or possess a firearm again, including weapons he transferred to his wife. He had faced up to 18 months in prison. The Daily Sentinel reports his lawyer, Ashley Petrey, asked for leniency since he lost his job and won’t be able to hunt again. Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Matt Evans said Bingham has two previous poaching convictions and hasn’t learned his lesson. He said Bingham has more than $1 million in assets, enabling him to pay a high fine.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEnfield: A group of prisoners is learning to cope with issues such as post-traumatic stress by interacting with horses. The equine-assisted psychotherapy program is offered in a special Department of Correction unit for military veterans at the Willard-Cybulski Correctional Institution in Enfield. Daniel Elliot, who suffered a brain injury while in the Navy, is serving time for an arson he committed while trying to kill himself inside his Norwich apartment. Elliot says the program, run at no charge to the state by the group Healing Hoofbeats, calms him, has helped him open up about his problems and gives him something to look forward to each week. Elliot is one of six inmates participating in the pilot program, which Correction Commissioner Rollin Cook says he hopes to expand to other prisons.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A controversial “blight bill” has suffered another setback in the City Council despite a twist designed to appease critics. With the measure beset for three years by opposition from homeowner, landlord and tenant advocates, council members on Thursday again planned to compromise on the legislation intended to crack down on the owners of vacant and blighted properties. Again, the attempt appeared to fail. The bill passed a committee this week but was pulled from the City Council agenda Wednesday morning. Bill sponsor Bud Freel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After making concessions to homeowners but still facing pushback from other property owners, Freel had planned to push for a vote Thursday – this time with a provision that the changes would be temporary.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Most of the D.C. Council is asking Councilman Jack Evans to resign after a third party released its investigation into allegations of ethics violations. News outlets report the council-hired law firm O’Melveny & Myers publicly released its investigation into Evans this week, saying he violated the council’s ethics rules 11 times since 2014. It says he repeatedly used his office to benefit private clients who paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars, payments that he failed to disclose or recognize as conflicts of interest. Such allegations also are under investigation by federal authorities and have already cost Evans his role as chair of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board. Evans’ attorneys released a 67-page rebuttal Tuesday saying the law firm’s report is flawed and misunderstands council ethics rules.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Tourist haven Key West wants to protect coral reefs that attract divers, so it’s banning sunscreens that contain chemicals that could harm them. But state lawmakers who think it’s more important to protect humans are moving toward outlawing the island’s sunscreen ban and making sure no other local governments impose similar ordinances. The battle pits local governments against state government and environmentalists against dermatologists in an argument about coral bleaching and skin cancer. A bill sponsored by Sen. Rob Bradley has been approved in two committees and has one more stop before reaching the full state Senate. An identical House bill was set to make the first of three committee stops Wednesday. The sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate in Key West will be illegal starting in 2021.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp released a plan Monday to expand Medicaid to the state’s poorest able-bodied adults, on the condition that they work, volunteer, receive job training or attend school. Under Kemp’s proposal, which is more limited than efforts in other states, uninsured adults in Georgia who make no more than the federal poverty level would qualify for Medicaid assistance if they spent at least 80 hours a month working, volunteering, training or studying. They would also have to pay monthly premiums. The federal poverty level is just under $12,500 for an individual. The governor’s office called the approach a “conservative reform” that reflects the state’s values as a place that “honors work” and “champions individual responsibility.” It would require approval from the Trump administration.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: The U.S. Air Force has approved a naval facility and airport as the preferred alternative site for a technical squadron tasked with monitoring satellites in support of the national security space mission. The Garden Island reports the Space Control Squadron would operate out of the Barking Sands Pacific Missile Range Facility in western Kauai. Officials say the squadron would ensure that military and other national security agencies have access to satellite communication, intelligence and key information. Officials say the unit is also expected to bring more federal funds and jobs to the state supporting 88 new Hawaii Air National Guard positions. Federal officials say the basing process is expected to be completed by 2020, with the unit becoming partially operational by 2021 and fully operational by 2022.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A giant forest project in the state that was rejected by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is on again, and an environmental group says it violates the court’s orders and vows it will stop it with another lawsuit. The U.S. Forest Service on Friday approved the 125-square-mile project on the Payette National Forest, with work expected to start this week. The Forest Service and the Alliance for the Wild Rockies agree the project is precisely the same as the one halted by the 9th Circuit Court’s ruling against the Forest Service in August 2018. But the Forest Service says changes in wording in an environmental review remove problems that caused the court to stop the project, and the Forest Service’s new approval decision Friday allows work to begin immediately.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state is receiving federal money to help build infrastructure for alternative-fuel vehicles along Interstate 80. The Illinois Department of Transportation says the grant is part of an effort to create an alternative-fuel corridor that supports electric vehicles and vehicles that run on natural gas. It will span six states, from New Jersey to the Iowa-Nebraska border. The $70,000 in federal funds will be combined with $10,000 each from Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The money will be used to identify gaps along Interstate 80 where fueling and charging facilities aren’t available and to provide those options. Omer Osman, acting secretary of IDOT, says that “these improvements will help make interstate travel on alternative fuel a reality” and make travel more environmentally friendly.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state will be home to the nation’s newest National Guard cyber battalion. State officials say the 127th Cyber Battalion will be composed of about 100 soldiers who will be trained in cybersecurity and cyber warfare at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center, about 75 miles southeast of Indianapolis. Army National Guard officials say they chose Indiana’s force for its existing cyber capabilities, partnerships with industry and academia, and the ability to recruit and retain soldiers. Gov. Eric Holcomb says the state is a “natural fit” for the first cyber battalion in the Midwest. The battalion is expected to be fully operational by 2022. There are four other cyber battalions in the country: two in Virginia, one in South Carolina and another in Massachusetts.\n\nIowa\n\nNewton: Joy, the American Mini Spokes-Pig for the Capitol II Theatre, has been recognized for her talents by Guinness World Records. In the 2020 edition of the famous record book, Joy was officially named the fastest trick porker in the universe. Her feat, overseen by two judges – Newton’s mayor and the city’s chief of police – was successfully completing 13 tricks, each initiated by a different command, in under a minute. A ham in more ways than one, Joy is a local celebrity and performer with her own dressing room at the theater – a peek-a-boo window lets visitors steal a gander of her from the street. And Joy is always red-carpet ready, of course, complete with painted toenails and her favorite dress, a resplendent taffeta number emblazoned with cartoon popcorn buckets (her favorite food).\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The acting secretary of the state Department of Corrections said during his confirmation hearing that a mass commutation of offenders was worth considering. The Wichita Eagle reports Jeff Zmuda was asked to comment Tuesday on what happened one day earlier, when more than 450 inmates walked out the doors of prisons across Oklahoma as part of a massive commutation. Zmuda said Kansas officials are looking at several ways to make reforms and ease overcrowding, and “that’s certainly one that could be considered.” Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning said releasing nonviolent inmates “sounds like a fantastic idea” but cautioned that if someone who has been released early commits a violent act, “there’s hell to pay.” The hearing ended with a Senate committee recommending that Zmuda be confirmed. The full Senate will vote early next year.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State Senate President Robert Stivers threw another wrench into a razor-thin gubernatorial outcome late Tuesday night, saying the Legislature could decide the race. Stivers’ comments came shortly after Gov. Matt Bevin refused to concede to Attorney General Andy Beshear, who led by roughly 5,100 votes when all the precincts were counted. Stivers, R-Manchester, said based on his staff’s research, the decision could come before the GOP-controlled Legislature. Under state law, Bevin has 30 days to formally contest the outcome once it is certified by the State Board of Elections. Candidates typically ask for a recanvass of voting machines and a recount first. The last contested governor’s race was the 1899 election of Democrat William Goebel. Stivers said he believes most of the votes that went to Libertarian John Hicks, who received about 2% of the total vote, would have gone to Bevin and made him the clear winner.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Three months after medical marijuana became available in the state, doctors and clinics say some patients are finding the cost for therapeutic cannabis too high for treatment, pricing them out of a medication they waited years to obtain. Nine pharmacies dispense medicinal-grade pot and set their individual prices. Dispensary owners say their charges reflect an industry with startup charges, small patient numbers and lengthy regulatory hurdles to meet. In August, Louisiana became the first Deep South state to dispense medical marijuana, four years after state lawmakers agreed to give patients access. Kathryn Thomas, CEO of The Healing Clinics, says a third of the medical marijuana patients across its five clinics in Shreveport, Monroe, Baton Rouge, Houma and Lafayette can’t foot the bill for the product.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: It’s almost safe to be a turkey in Maine again. The Pine Tree State’s fall wild turkey season ends for the year Thursday. The fall turkey hunt is the longer of the state’s two turkey hunts, with a more restricted season taking place every spring. Wild turkeys are popular game birds, and the state uses the hunt to control their population. The animals were once rare in Maine but are now so common that they sometimes cause traffic accidents and other hazards. Hunters are allowed to take up to five wild turkeys of either sex in some parts of the state. However, parts of far northern Maine are closed to turkey hunting.\n\nMaryland\n\nRockville: Departments and agencies in Montgomery County are embarking on a campaign to make residents aware of the added challenges of the switch to standard time. The approximately 20 planned “Be Safe, Be Seen” events, the first of which was held Wednesday at the Shady Grove Metro Station, are aimed at both adults and children. The campaign will distribute safety literature, reflective stickers, and items that will remind people to avoid distractions and maximize safe behaviors and visibility, especially in darkness. A 2016 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that 26% of all pedestrian deaths occurred between 6 p.m. and 8:59 p.m. Because peak evening commuting times in fall and winter occur during periods of increased darkness, danger is increased.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: First lady Melania Trump on Wednesday visited a hospital that uses cuddling to help infants born dependent on drugs or alcohol. She met with caregivers and administrators at Boston Medical Center and told them she’s “very focused” on their pioneering work with babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome. “I hope today’s visit helps shine a light on programs like yours,” she said, joined by Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services. Outside, as many as 200 workers at the hospital gathered to protest the visit, condemning the tough immigration policies of President Donald Trump’s administration that they say discourage immigrants from getting health care. Some wore white hospital jackets with the slogan “We really do care, do you?” on the backs. Others carried signs that read, “BMC cares for all patients.”\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: A new forecast says Great Lakes levels are likely to remain unusually high and may set additional records. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers office in Detroit on Monday released its outlook for the next six months. Hydrologist Keith Kompoltowicz says a wet October interrupted the usual fall drop-off of water levels. Storms over Lakes Michigan, Huron and Superior caused beach erosion, flooding, and damage to seawalls and roads. Kompoltowicz says all five Great Lakes are expected to resume their seasonal decline. But they’ll remain well above normal and will be higher in January than they were at the beginning of this record-setting year. He says Huron and Michigan are likely to set monthly records in February, while Superior will come close. Kompoltowicz says a lengthy dry spell would be required to reverse the trend.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Winter anglers on Mille Lacs Lake will be allowed to keep one walleye this winter for the fourth season in a row. The Department of Natural Resources announced winter regulations for Mille Lacs on Monday. Similar to last winter, anglers can keep one walleye starting Dec. 1 if it’s between 21 and 23 inches, or over 28. DNR Commissioner Sarah Strommen says there’s evidence the state’s conservative approach to managing the popular lake is paying off. A fall assessment found the Mille Lacs walleye population has remained relatively stable over the past three years, having rebounded from lows seen from 2012 through 2016. Fisheries chief Brad Parsons says they expect the walleye bite on Mille Lacs to be quite good this winter, which will likely result in a high harvest.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A new historical marker is honoring the oldest continuously operating African American church in the state. Members of St. Peter Baptist Church in Pascagoula gathered Saturday to celebrate the unveiling of a marker that was placed by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. The coastal church was founded in 1819 by a freed slave named Dudley Brooks. It originally was called First Free Mission Baptist Church. Pastor William H. Marshall tells WLOX-TV that he’s pleased the congregation is being recognized by the state. Congregants buried a time capsule with church programs and other items. The plan is to dig it up in 20 years.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved removing Dr. Martin Luther King’s name from one of the city’s most historic boulevards, less than a year after the City Council decided to rename the Paseo for the civil rights icon. Unofficial results showed the proposal to remove King’s name received nearly 70% of the vote, with just over 30% voting to retain King’s name. The city had been one of the largest in the country without a street named for him. But a group of residents intent on keeping the Paseo name began collecting petitions to put the name change on the ballot and achieved that goal in April. The campaign has been divisive. Emotions reached a peak Sunday, when members of the “Save the Paseo” group staged a silent protest at a get-out-the-vote rally at a black church.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The speed limit on a deadly stretch of U.S. 212 in southeast Montana has been reduced to 65 mph. The Billings Gazette reports the Montana Department of Transportation lowered the speed limit Oct. 1 on the highway’s corridor that passes through both the Crow and Northern Cheyenne Reservations and four counties: Big Horn, Rosebud, Powder River and Carter. The stretch merges with Interstate 90 at the Bighorn Battlefield interchange and travels 167 miles east to the Montana-Wyoming state line. MDOT Traffic and Safety Bureau chief Gabe Priebe says statistics show the stretch is the deadliest highway in Montana.\n\nNebraska\n\nBellevue: Speakers at a public hearing have criticized a proposal that could lead to the firing of elected officials in this Omaha suburb for leaking information from closed meetings. The first proposal says dissemination of information from closed sessions by an elected official could result in an “allegation of misconduct.” The second proposal says a finding of misconduct could result in that official’s removal from office. Former Bellevue Councilman Jim Moudry said at Tuesday night’s hearing that he was troubled by the notion the city would be able to decide what behaviors constitute misconduct. Councilman Chuck Fredrick and other said such decisions belong to voters. Councilwoman Kathy Welch backed the proposals, saying the city holds employees to high standards when conducting city business, so it should be no different for elected officials.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Despite protests about a “war on the poor,” city officials passed a law Wednesday making it illegal for the homeless to sleep on streets when beds are available at established shelters. The issue spurred emotion and drama, including the ejection by city marshals of several audience members whom Mayor Carolyn Goodman deemed disruptive during a daylong City Council meeting that drew dozens of time-limited comments. Most people spoke against the law before the 5-2 council vote. The measure will apply to the city’s downtown urban core, not the tourist-heavy Las Vegas Strip, which is overseen by a different jurisdiction. Goodman, the sponsor of the measure, called it imperfect but necessary to deal with what officials and downtown business owners characterize as a homeless crisis.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The Division of Historical Resources has added eight properties to its historic register, including five from Litchfield’s town center. The buildings along Route 3A include the Gothic Revival Litchfield Presbyterian Church; the Greek Revival Town Hall; the Tudor Revival Aaron Cutler Memorial Library; the Colonial Revival Griffin Memorial School; and the Litchfield Fire Station. The church and town hall go back to the mid-1800s. Other properties include the George Burrell residence in Keene, an 1853 predominantly brick Italianate-style house; the Willing Workers Hall in Warren, a social hall built in 1815; and Westmoreland’s Federal-style Brick Church, built in 1838.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The mayor is denying he engaged in prohibited campaigning during voting on hotly contested measures restricting Airbnb and other short-term rental companies. A short video posted online Tuesday shows Mayor Steven Fulop speaking to someone inside a polling place near a voting booth. The conversation isn’t entirely intelligible, but Fulop can be heard saying, ‘So vote ‘yes.’ ” At a news conference Wednesday, Fulop said he was thanking poll workers and didn’t approach anyone or hand out literature. State law bans soliciting support or distributing literature within 100 feet of a polling place. A spokesman for Keep Our Homes, an organization opposed to the measures, said in an email that Fulop’s actions showed “a shocking disregard for the law.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Presbyterian Healthcare Services and the University of New Mexico are teaming to lure nurses into some of the state’s most rural areas. The Albuquerque Journal reports the two health care organizations recently collaborated to land a $3.2 million grant to develop a residency program for nurse practitioners in 10 New Mexico cities and towns. The four-year grant from the national Health Resources and Services Administration will help nurses and midwives relocate and stay in remote areas. Officials say the program also will focus on mental health. Presbyterian Director of Clinical Education and Professional Development Johanna Stiesmeyer says New Mexico’s rural counties have a wide nurse-to-resident ratio. The first group of nurses and midwives will be selected in the first half of 2020.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: President Donald Trump isn’t a fan of the state’s new bail reform law, which will curtail the number of people jailed while awaiting trial. The president tweeted Tuesday that New York’s Democratic governor and mayor “are letting out 900 Criminals, some hardened & bad onto the sidewalks of our rapidly declining” city. That was a reference to estimates from New York City’s corrections officials on the number of prisoners who might be eligible for release under the new law. Gov. Andrew Cuomo punched back, saying Trump gave up his right to call New York home when he recently claimed Florida residency. The state’s law was passed to address complaints that poor people accused of minor crimes were often jailed for long periods because they couldn’t afford to post bail.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nKnightdale: An assistant high school football coach has resigned after making racist comments on Instagram. News outlets report John Hoskins resigned over the weekend from his post at Knightdale High School. WTVD-TV reports Hoskins, who is white, posted a now-deleted video to Instagram in which he said “white power” and the n-word. Hoskins told the station Tuesday that “just to set the record, I’m not a racist.” He says his black friends have given him the OK to use the word, as have players on the majority-black team that he coached. He says he posted the video and used the slur while caught up in celebrating the team’s win against Corinth Holders High last week. The video was shared with administrators before Hoskins deleted it.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum is urging U.S. Customs and Border Protection not to cut hours of operation at three entry ports on the North Dakota-Canadian border. Border Protection has proposed moving back the closing time at the Maida and Carbury crossings from 10 p.m. to 7 p.m. and the Antler crossing from 10 p.m. to 5 p.m. In a letter to the CBP, Burgum noted all three ports experienced an increase in automobile and truck crossings in fiscal year 2018. Burgum says he’s concerned reducing the hours of operation will have a negative impact on tourism, movement of goods and local economies. The agency says that it wants to use its resources at the busiest locations and that there are low numbers of crossings during the times it plans to cut.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Voters have approved nearly three-quarters of the public school district tax issues that were on ballots across the state for Tuesday’s election. The Ohio School Boards Association says unofficial results show voters passed 113 of the 154 school tax issues on the ballot, or 73%. The association says just over half of the proposals were renewals, and all but a few of those 82 renewal measures were approved. There was less support for new school tax issues, as only 35 of those 72 issues were passed. The votes come as state lawmakers are considering a possible overhaul of how Ohio schools are funded with a mix of state and local dollars. Ohio’s school-funding system has become a complicated patchwork since the system was found unconstitutional in 1997.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a ban on a second-trimester abortion procedure. The high court acted Monday after an abortion clinic appealed a lower court judge’s decision to uphold a ban on a second-trimester abortion procedure. The Tulsa Women’s Reproductive Clinic requested the temporary injunction to put the law on hold, telling justices the law would be detrimental for women. The 2015 law would restrict the use of instruments in dilation and evacuation abortions after 14 weeks of pregnancy, except when needed to save the woman’s life or prevent a serious risk to her health. It had been on hold while the legal challenge was pending. State numbers show nearly 7% of about 5,000 abortions performed in Oklahoma in 2018 were performed using this method.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: A year ago a California group rejected more than 2,000 tons of wine grapes grown in Southern Oregon for supposed smoke taint from wildfire impact in the region, representing a $4 million dollar collective loss for more than 15 grape growers in the Rogue Valley. This year, a collective of Willamette Valley winemakers is being recognized with a national award for what they did next. The wineries quickly made arrangements to bring some of the fruit north. Based on lab results from each lot, they believed the grapes had been rejected without cause. They labeled their collaborative wines Oregon Solidarity Wines and pledged proceeds from their sale back to the grape growers. Wine Enthusiast Magazine has awarded Oregon Solidarity with a 2019 Wine Star Award for Innovator of the Year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Democrats completed an electoral sweep of the metro area’s four suburban counties, long a bastion of Republican control and a crucial bellwether for statewide candidates. Democrats won control in Delaware and Chester counties in Tuesday’s election for the first time going back to the Civil War and won control in Bucks County for the first time since the 1980s. Democrats took control of Montgomery County several years ago. The fast-growing counties now account for more than 1 in 5 of all registered voters, and they tend to vote in higher proportions than the rest of the state. The Democratic victories in Delaware and Chester counties were particularly strong, winning every countywide race. For three decades, the counties had been growing increasingly liberal, but the trend seems to have accelerated since Donald Trump’s election as president.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: An analysis of the city’s electronic bike and scooter share shows users took nearly 170,000 scooter rides and more than 280,000 bike rides in the first year of the programs. The city report also contains information on average trips and areas where the devices were most popular. City councilmember Jo-Ann Ryan requested the analysis about three months ago and tells the Providence Journal the six-page report downplays public safety concerns and is missing information on routes, accident data and public input. Ryan says a comprehensive report is needed to inform future policies and prevent some of the issues that have cropped up. Providence announced in August that it was temporarily pulling the electronic bikes operated by the company JUMP over concerns of their misuse.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: After two decades of decline, the state’s infant mortality rate has inched up, largely due to an increase in birth defects and premature births, state health officials said Wednesday. The state’s infant mortality rate declined 30% since 1999 but increased from 6.5 deaths to 7.2 per 1,000 births between 2017 to 2018, a 10.8% increase, said Kimberly Seals, director of the Department of Health and Environmental Control’s Bureau of Maternal and Child Health. During that time, infant deaths related to birth defects increased from 64 to 82, or 28%, she said. And the number of deaths related to prematurity or low birthweight increased from 52 to 58, or 11%, she said. In addition, Seals said, the infant mortality rate was 2.2 times higher among minorities.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem has reiterated her opposition to legalizing industrial hemp production, even in the face of new federal rules allowing the cash crop. Hemp is seen as a possible boon by many farmers, but Noem said in a statement Tuesday that legalizing it would hamper enforcement of marijuana laws. But the governor also says South Dakota will allow the crop to be transported across the state. Last month, police arrested a Colorado man for carrying large bags of what he claims was hemp in his SUV. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released a new regulatory framework for hemp production last week, saying it will provide new economic opportunities for farmers and pave the way for new products and markets.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: To help alleviate issues with driver’s license facilities, the state Department of Safety and Homeland Security is looking to hire 80 employees, expand hours of operation, consider outsourcing some operations and implement recommendations from a more than decade-old study. That’s what the agency’s top official, Commissioner Jeff Long, told Gov. Bill Lee and his administration Wednesday while outlining the department’s budgetary needs for the upcoming fiscal year. Although it oversees the Tennessee Highway Patrol, homeland security and the safety of residents in the Volunteer State, the agency has received a considerable amount of attention for continued issues regarding the issuance of driver’s licenses. With 44 official driver’s license facilities throughout the state, the agency has faced frustration over long wait times and technology crashes.\n\nTexas\n\nKilleen: Family members of the 13 people killed in a mass shooting at the Fort Hood military base have marked the 10th anniversary of the attack. A ceremony was held Tuesday at Fort Hood in Killeen to remember the victims of the Nov. 5, 2009, attack. Thirteen people were killed and more than 30 others injured when then-U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan opened fire at the base. Hasan was sentenced to death for the killings. But the Killeen Daily Herald reports many of the victims’ families expressed frustration that no execution date has been set for Hasan, who is among four soldiers on military death row.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The University of Utah says a new mental health institute funded by a $150 million donation from the influential Huntsman family will focus on researching the genetic causes of mental illnesses and provide more treatment to college students and rural residents. The university said in a news release Monday that the Huntsman Mental Health Institute will aim to provided research-based treatment. The donation will also help fund the University of Utah Health’s psychiatry department. The Huntsmans already have a major cancer research center in Utah that bears the family name. The late Jon Huntsman Sr. was the founder of a company that refines raw materials that go into thousands of products. One of his sons, Peter Huntsman, says he hopes the institute help change the stigma and misperceptions about mental health.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Johnsbury: A church will begin hosting a morning “warming center” for the winter season. The United Community Church in St. Johnsbury announced its “warming center” will be open seven days a week beginning Nov. 15, the same day the overnight warming shelter opens. The church’s effort to house an overnight shelter was met with opposition from St. Johnsbury Select Board members in 2015. The board had added language to the town’s bylaws forbidding shelters outside the health services zone. The Caledonian Record reports the decision to host the warming program follows a five-month pilot program last year. The community organizers say the morning center is open to anyone in the community. The center will operate from 7:30 a.m. to noon Monday through Sunday.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: A Democratic candidate who lost a random drawing that determined control of the state House of Delegates nearly two years ago easily won a rematch against her Republican opponent. Shelly Simonds defeated four-term Del. David Yancey handily Tuesday in a race for the 94th District in Newport News. The close 2017 race between the two went to a recount, then to court. Eventually, officials used the luck of the draw, placing the name of each candidate on a piece of paper and each piece of paper in a separate film canister. The canisters were put into a cobalt blue-and-white ceramic bowl made by a local artist and stirred around. The canister containing Yancey’s name was drawn, giving him the win. On Tuesday, Simonds won nearly 58% of the vote. Yancey won about 40%.\n\nWashington\n\nKennewick: The City Council has repealed its decade-old rules governing dangerous dogs after a new state law weakened breed-specific regulations. The Tri-City Herald reports the Legislature passed a state law requiring cities with breed-specific legislation to exempt dogs that can be certified as good canine citizens by the American Kennel Club or other organizations. Kennewick City Council voted Tuesday to get rid of its former regulations instead of adopting rules exempting well-mannered dogs. Officials say Kennewick first adopted breed-specific regulations after increased reports about injuries inflicted by dangerous dogs like pit bulls. Advocates and pit bull owners say regulations included having special licenses and muzzling dogs in public. Officials say the rules do not exempt owners from liability if their pets attack.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia American Water has awarded grants to provide bottle-filling stations to 10 groups throughout the utility’s service area. The company says in a statement that the program is aimed at reducing plastic waste from single-use bottles and providing filling stations to nonprofit groups, schools and local government facilities. Among the groups that were selected from more than 90 applications are the AD Lewis Community Center in Huntington and Salt Rock Elementary School in Cabell County; the Fayette County Public Library in Oak Hill; the Putnam County Public Library in Hurricane; and Lewis County High School and the Lewis County Park in Weston. Other groups involved include Mercer Elementary School in Princeton and CAMC Women and Children’s Hospital, the West Virginia Capitol Complex and Flinn Elementary School, all in Charleston.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State legislators struggled Wednesday with a bill that would force schools to teach cursive writing, questioning whether they should make teachers spend time and money preserving the centuries-old style in today’s computerized world. Republican Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt, a former teacher, introduced the bill in September that would require schools receiving state dollars to include cursive in their elementary curriculum, with the goal of having students write legibly in cursive by the end of fifth grade. Thiesfeldt’s bill wouldn’t come cheap, at least according to state education officials, but he tried to make a case for the measure during a public hearing in front of the Assembly’s state affairs committee Wednesday afternoon. He said studies have shown writing in cursive fosters neurological connections in students’ brains, improves retention and can help dyslexic children read because cursive letters are more distinctive than printed letters.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Wyoming Association of Broadcasters says it will push state lawmakers to pass a media shield law. Wyoming is the only state in the nation without legal protections for journalists who refuse to provide the names of confidential sources to law enforcement officers. Such laws can encourage whistleblowers to report wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. Wyoming Association of Broadcasters lobbyist Laura Grott says the state lacks a shield law not because of opposition but because of a lack of effort by Wyoming media. The broadcast journalist group unveiled the proposal at a recent meeting of the Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the Wyoming Press Association has largely resisted a media shield law. The newspaper organization argues existing First Amendment protections are enough for the press and their sources.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/07"}]}

No one will be laid off, he says.\n\nThe property tax increase would add $140 per year to a $100,000 Brandywine Hills home tax bill.\n\nThe average Wilmington resident could pay an additional $1.81 on a quarterly water bill.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the frequency of water bills in Wilmington.\n\nCiting a “looming fiscal crisis,” Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki is proposing a 7.5-percent property tax increase; a 4-percent water/sewer rate hike; and $2.5 million in cuts, including to public safety staff.\n\nThe $154.1 million budget proposal is a 0.1 percent increase over the previous year. To balance the budget and reduce spending, the mayor wants to cut 29 city positions, all of them vacant. The proposed budget would produce a $3.4 million surplus for the following year, the mayor said.\n\nHardest hit could be the Fire Department, where Purzycki wants to cut 16 vacant positions, nearly 10 percent of its authorized strength. Doing this would require the return of rolling bypass, a controversial cost-cutting measure that puts an engine out of service during staffing shortages, which is most days, firefighters say.\n\n\n\nThe mayor announced his proposal at his first budget address in City Council chambers Thursday night.\n\n\"This is a fairly lean budget with no room for salary increases, new programs, new community centers and economic development incentives,\" he said. \"If we are to thrive, we must invest.\"\n\nPurzycki said he is taking a multiyear approach to budgeting the city, cutting now to eliminate projected deficits in future years. When he walked in the door in January, the mayor said the city was already $14 million “in the hole.\"\n\nContributing to that was:\n\n$6.7 million in city employee raises approved by then-Mayor Dennis P. Williams.\n\nAt least $6.5 million for workers compensation claims related to firefighters injured in the Canby Park blaze, a circumstance for which the city lacked insurance.\n\n$2 million over budget for police and fire overtime.\n\nSTORY: The 62 agencies and programs Trump wants to eliminate\n\nSTORY: Trump budget kills Chesapeake funds\n\nTo pay for this, the city had dipped into its \"unassigned fund balance,\" essentially its reserve. The city's current bond ratings are steady, but bond rating agencies have warned officials that if \"undisciplined and unregulated\" spending continues, the bond rating will drop, city officials said.\n\nIn addition, financial burdens that are expected to carry into fiscal year 2018 include:\n\nA projected $1.2 million increase in employee and retiree health care benefits for the next year.\n\nThe loss of $1.4 million from the city's right-turn-on-red camera program because the General Assembly passed legislation last year that limits red-light camera usage (plus $800,000 in refunds for drivers who were wrongly ticketed).\n\nA decrease of $3 million in city wage tax revenue as projected by the Wilmington Economic and Financial Advisory Council.\n\n“We can get by in 2018 with no increase at all, but you will see that the consequences in the out years would be fiscally devastating without the moderating effect of an early decrease,” he said.\n\nCosts and cuts\n\nThe proposed property tax increase, when applied to a home in the Brandywine Hills community assessed at $100,000, would increase the annual property tax by $140, or $11.67 a month. City properties have not been assessed since 1983.\n\nProperty tax was last raised in fiscal year 2015 by 5 percent. Before that, it was raised 10 percent in fiscal year 2011 and 15 percent in fiscal year 2010. This year, fiscal year 2017, property owners pay $1.86 per $100 of assessed value.\n\nUnder Purzycki’s plan, the average Wilmington resident would pay an additional $1.81 on a monthly water bill. The increase was strongly recommended by the city’s independent Water/Sewer Citizens Advisory Council, the mayor said. Stormwater rates will remain the same.\n\nThe water and sewer rates haven't changed since fiscal year 2015, when they were both raised 5 percent. They went two years without increases under Williams' administration.\n\nThe following 29 positions would be eliminated:\n\nTwo in the Mayor's Office (economic development researcher and administrative assistant), plus salary reductions, saving $272,000.\n\nTwo staff attorneys in the Law Department, plus salary reductions, saving $335,000.\n\nOne parking regulations enforcement officer in the Finance Department, saving $52,375.\n\nTwo public works employees, saving $127,382.\n\nOne project manager in the Parks and Recreation Department, saving $103,513.\n\n16 firefighter positions in the Fire Department, saving $1.2 million.\n\nFive patrol officers in the Police Department, saving $454,551.\n\nPublic safety cuts\n\nPurzycki suggested eliminating positions in the Fire Department at a time when firefighters say they are understaffed. The department is 22 positions down from its authorized strength of 172, Fire Chief Michael Donohue said at a public safety committee meeting this week.\n\nStaffing under Purzycki's proposal would be reduced to 156 firefighters. The mayor said most of the positions on the chopping block should already have been removed. In 2012, the city accepted a federal grant that increased firefighting positions by 13, but when the grant ended in 2014, the positions remained.\n\nPurzycki's move to return to rolling bypass isn't popular with fire personnel.\n\n\"I'm shocked,\" said Kevin Turner, president of the IAFF 1590 union. \"[Rolling bypass] is a public safety hazard, and being understaffed is a safety hazard. ... We were budgeted for 172 firefighters. That's what we need.\"\n\nFor months, firefighters and their loved ones have protested rolling bypasses. It's a sore subject. The nearest fire truck was out of service the day of the Sept. 24 Canby Park fire that took the lives of three firefighters. No evidence has shown that rolling bypass was to blame for their deaths, but advocates say the practice is a safety hazard for residents and fire personnel.\n\nThe city claims rolling bypass does not significantly impact response time. The mayor said the practice is necessary and equitable: The closed engine would rotate throughout the city instead of permanently closing one particular engine, a practice that was adopted last year.\n\nPurzycki also told The News Journal that the firefighter union agreement’s scheduling requirements are inefficient and cause the conditions that lead to overtime. Firefighters work 24-hour shifts followed by 72 hours off. If a firefighter calls in sick for a workday, that person ends up taking a week off, officials said.\n\n“It seems to encourage excessive sick time use,” Purzycki said.\n\nPurzycki said if the department changed its shift setup, he would be able to have all engines running all the time. The firefighter union contract has been expired since last summer. Purzycki said he wants to renegotiate it.\n\nSince January, the city has been using $200,000 in state funding to keep all engines open on a temporary basis.\n\nCity Councilman Bob Williams, a former volunteer firefighter, said cuts to the fire department give him \"serious anxiety.\" The District 7 rep, who requested state funds last year to keep all engines open, said he is concerned for the students at the Charter School of Wilmington which is \"the furthest point away from Station #6,\" he said.\n\n\"Eliminating that engine and reducing another engine puts kids' lives in danger should a fire break out,\" he said. \"A ladder would get there, but a ladder doesn't bring water... You can't put lives in danger to save a dollar.\"\n\nThe Police Department would lose five officer positions, leaving them with 314 officers.\n\nLike the Fire Department, the Police Department accepted consecutive federal grants that increased its numbers from 289. But when the grants expired, the grant-funded positions were not eliminated, city officials said. The reduction will not affect public safety, the Mayor's Office said.\n\nCouncilwoman Loretta Walsh, chair of the public safety committee, said elimination of positions that originated through grants is reasonable.\n\n\"Each chief promised that hard money wouldn't need to be used to fund these positions, and they haven't been,\" she said.\n\nRenegotiating union agreements for city employees could save the city money, Purzycki said.\n\nPolice officers get 20 “shooting days” when they are unavailable for duty, the mayor said. In the Public Works Department, trash collectors work on a “task system,” so they are paid for eight hours of work even if they completed their assignments in less than that.\n\nThe mayor said he believes the current schedules were agreed upon “in good faith,” but it’s not working.\n\n“In the interest of more efficiency and economically run city departments, we must fairly and vigorously negotiate more equitable work schedules,” he said. “Frankly, no one can seriously defend the status quo.”\n\nCity Council President Hanifa Shabazz said she will keep an open mind as City Council holds hearings on the budget proposal. Council will vote on the final budget on May 18.\n\n\"I'm looking forward working collectively with the mayor's administration to come up with solutions that will continue to allow Wilmington to thrive,\" she said.\n\nThe city’s health care plan offers city employees three options, with co-pays as low as $5 and prescription costs as low as $10, officials said.\n\nPurzycki said the plan, in which 82 percent of city employees are enrolled, is “too generous and too expensive.”\n\nThe mayor suggested making the city plan more like that of the state. State employees pay 13 percent of costs whereas city employees currently pay as little as 4 percent, Purzycki said. State co-pays are two to six times higher than in the city, and emergency rooms visit co-pays are $150 through the state, versus $50 in the city.\n\nRemoving the disparities would save the city about $1.5 million, Purzycki said. The mayor added that the majority of employees don’t take advantage of preventative health screenings like colonoscopies and mammograms, which he said leads to higher costs down the road.\n\n“We will ask our employee unions to help us curb these escalating costs to avoid future layoffs, which will be unavoidable unless we do something about this now,” he said.\n\nPurzycki's vision\n\nThe mayor is introducing a series of initiatives to be launched soon.\n\nThe administration will announce an area of the city that will become a neighborhood stabilization zone. The pilot program will fulfill a campaign promise, with a coordinated effort from officials in the police, licenses and inspections, public works, law and other departments. Officials will partner with state agencies and nonprofit groups to build up housing stock.\n\nThe city's search for a new police chief is winding down, officials said. New leadership and data-driven strategies will get more officers on the street, the mayor said. Data-driven analytics will benefit other departments too, by holding managers accountable and informing future budgeting, the administration said.\n\nOther efforts will improve quality of life in the city, the mayor said. A 311 call center will start coordinating citizen requests for service. Workers will target city gateways to clean up trash and debris and create a better first impression for visitors. Officials will work to refurbish struggling city parks, including Eden Park; Father Tucker Park; and Rodney Square, which the mayor hopes to infuse with green space.\n\n\"I did not run for mayor to maintain the status quo,\" Purzycki said. \"Our first obligation is to the health of the city – its financial health, its operational health and its spiritual health. I invite you to join me to do bold, permanent things.\"\n\nContact Christina Jedra at (302) 324-2837 or cjedra@delawareonline.com.\n\nPurzycki's cost-saving measures", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/04/26/purzycki-fire-cuts-work-proposed-scheduling-changes/100935884/", "title": "Purzycki: Fire cuts work with proposed scheduling changes", "text": "Christina Jedra\n\nThe News Journal\n\nPurzycki's proposal would have 47 firefighters working any given shift instead of 34.\n\nThe mayor hopes to enact his plan through a contract with the firefighter union.\n\nEliminating a platoon, or 16 positions, will not affect public safety, the mayor's office said.\n\nThe department is currently 22 people down from its authorized strength of 172.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to a platoon. Sixteen firefighters makes up an engine company.\n\nWilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki said on Monday that his proposal to cut 16 vacant firefighter positions is part of a larger vision to reorganize an \"inefficient\" firefighter work schedule. He said his plan will save money and increase the number of firefighters available at any given time.\n\n\"The Fire Department can operate efficiently and with plenty of firefighters on each shift with those cuts in place,\" said John Rago, deputy chief of staff for policy and communications.\n\nFacing what it calls a \"looming debt crisis,\" the administration proposed last month eliminating 16 positions, which represents an engine company. Under the current union agreement, which requires firefighters to work 24-hour shifts and take the subsequent three days off, the cuts would necessitate the return of rolling bypass, the unpopular practice of closing engines during staffing shortages.\n\nWith 136 firefighters split into four groups, only 34 firefighters are working at any given time. When firefighters take off for sick and vacation days, staffing shortages happen, which causes overtime spending, officials said.\n\n\"When we’re down that low, just about anything can trigger overtime,\" said Fire Chief Michael Donohue at a budget hearing on Wednesday. Four firefighters are needed to operate an engine. With the loss of 16 positions, the city would experience rolling bypass \"more often than not,\" Donohue said.\n\nPurzycki suggests the department return to a \"3-3-3\" schedule used years ago wherein there are three platoons that rotate: three days on, three nights on and then three days off. That plan would allow 47 firefighters to be working on any given shift, he said, and the city would save $1.17 million on the salaries and benefits.\n\nThat staffing level would meet standards by the National Fire Protection Association, which recommends that at least 43 firefighters respond to high-rise blazes.\n\nTo change the schedule would require an agreement with the union, IAFF Local 1590. The group is expected to meet with the administration next month, the mayor's staff said.\n\n\"This isn't an edict,\" Purzycki said. \"This is a position the city feels very strongly about, and we want to negotiate in good faith hopefully to find the result that is best for the city.\"\n\nPurzycki said he is expecting pushback from firefighters who like the current shift. It allows them to hold other jobs and to call out of work to have an additional three days off, he said.\n\n\"A lot of people have built their lives around it, but looking long term, we can’t sustain that shift,\" he said. \"Do you know how much time you can get off with a couple of sick days and a vacation day? You may not work for a month.\"\n\nUnion President Kevin Turner called Purzycki's proposal \"garbage,\" and he wants an independent cost-benefit analysis of shift options. He said the current shift allows firefighters ample time with their families, time to recover after physically taxing fires and the opportunity to make more money on the side.\n\n\"Maybe if the city paid us enough, we wouldn't have to have a second job,\" said Turner, who works as a part-time firefighter outside the city. As of March, Wilmington firefighters, not counting senior firefighters, make between $46,553 and $59,920, according to salary data from the city. A job posting seeking certified firefighters released this week advertised a salary of $37,312.\n\nSTORY: Purzycki proposes tax hike, staffing cuts in Wilmington\n\nSTORY: Censured Wilmington councilman alleges conspiracy\n\nThe mayor said he doesn't want union negotiations to get \"confrontational,\" but he rejects the notion from some firefighters that cuts will cause a public safety hazard. Thirteen positions on the chopping block are somewhat new. In 2012, the city accepted a federal grant that increased firefighting positions by 13, but when the grant ended in 2014, the positions remained. The city says that the department's average response time – the time from the sound of the alarm to the arrival of the first piece of equipment – was three minutes and 57 seconds in the last two years, even with rolling bypass. The industry average is four minutes, the city said.\n\n\"Firefighters will talk about safety and engine closures and that it delays response time, and they go on and on about public safety,\" Purzycki said. \"But when it comes to, 'OK, we can solve this, just change the shift' … they want the shift.\"\n\nCity Councilman Bob Williams, a former firefighter, said he opposes the staffing cuts.\n\n\"Rolling the dice to try to save a buck is not going to work,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Williams agrees that the current work schedule isn't working.\n\n\"The firemen cannot argue a safety perspective, that they don't have enough bodies on a working fire to safely mitigate the fire, and at the same time run the (chance) of having three working fires on a 24-hour shift where they’re completely exhausted and have zero downtime,\" he said. \"I don’t think that’s someone you want to hang your life on, knowing that they haven’t slept for an entire day.\"\n\nTo save money, Williams said it might be worth exploring incentives for early retirement.\n\n\"If you’ve got a guy who’s making $80,000 to $90,000 a year, you can hire three people for that – well, two with medical benefits,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, Williams said he feels the city is targeting \"low hanging fruit\" when there are vacancies in other departments that could be targeted.\n\n\"It doesn’t seem like everyone is going to feel the pain at the same time,\" he said. \"The Fire Department at one time was almost 300 strong. …They’re at the bare bones minimum right now. I don’t think you can go any lower without upsetting the thermal balance – meaning hot air is up there, cold air is down there, and if you mix it up, everybody chokes.\"\n\nWilliams said is concerned about the potential for rolling bypass and its implications for response time. If the engine in his district is closed, he said the first piece of equipment on the scene of a fire at an area school could be a ladder company, which lacks water. (The city's computer system does not track response times for water-containing apparatus, the chief said.) He is also concerned about putting pressure on neighboring fire departments, which have a mutual aid agreement with the city.\n\n\"If our resources are stretched so thin, it’s no longer mutual,\" he said.\n\nCouncilman Samuel L. Guy repeatedly spoke at the budget hearing, expressing concern that the cuts could put safety at risk.\n\n\"This is not the department to be playing games with,\" he said to applause to firefighters in the back of the room.\n\nContact Christina Jedra at (302) 324-2837, cjedra@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/03/24/next-wilmington-police-chief-could-get-43000-more/99545450/", "title": "Wilmington council to vote on $43K bump for police chief", "text": "Christina Jedra\n\nThe News Journal\n\nWilmington City Council will vote Thursday night on a potential $43,000 salary bump to the police chief position. Officials hope the increase help attract the most competitive candidates for a job they're trying to fill.\n\nA City Council ordinance, if passed, would raise the chief's salary limit from $117,073 to $160,000. Outgoing Police Chief Bobby Cummings makes $111,197.\n\n\"To address the qualifications and demands of this chief... we have to be able to pay them adequately,\" said City Council President Hanifa Shabazz, a co-sponsor of the ordinance.\n\nMayor Mike Purzycki requested the raise from City Council, which authorizes pay raises for department heads, after a recommendation from Police Executive Research Forum, the contractor facilitating his national search for a new chief. The group informed the mayor that potential applicants were already being compensated at a much higher rate than what Wilmington could offer.\n\n\"Many of the candidates who have applied for the position are earning well in excess of $160,000 including candidates from Delaware,\" said John Rago, Purzycki's deputy chief for policy and communications.\n\nChiefs elsewhere in the state make more than they would in Wilmington. Newark Police Chief Paul Tiernan makes $117,299 a year in a city with half of Wilmington's population and far less crime, according to the city's communications manager. Starting next month, the New Castle County police chief can make up to $154,960, the county's director of communications said.\n\nSTORY: Police respond to school fights often, official says\n\nSTORY: Your guide to the Wilmington budget process\n\nCummings makes less than some of his subordinates, Shabazz pointed out. Because of overtime costs, some police officers nearly doubled their base salary and earned around $130,000 in 2015, according to a city audit obtained by The News Journal.\n\nThe salary increase for Wilmington's top officer comes during what Purzycki's office called a \"looming fiscal crisis.\" Last week, the mayor proposed a budget that raises taxes and cuts 29 vacant positions, 16 of them for firefighters.\n\nPurzycki feels a salary increase will promote public safety by enabling the hiring of a candidate who can reduce crime and violence and strengthen community relations, Rago said.\n\n\"The mayor’s position is that Wilmington needs a highly experienced person with an extensive background in crime strategies and solutions, who can place as many officers on the street as possible, and do the job with the support and respect of department personnel as well as the public,\" Rago said. \"The mayor feels the city can afford to pay the best person possible. In fact, he feels Wilmington and its citizens deserve the most highly qualified candidate available.\"\n\nThe raise would alter the fiscal year 2017 budget of former Mayor Dennis P. Williams.\n\nHarold Bozeman, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 1, declined to take a stance on a raise for the chief but said salary and residency requirements have been obstacles to hiring at all levels of the Wilmington Police Department.\n\n\"Our agency struggles with attracting and retaining adequate numbers of recruits and patrol officers to police the city,\" Bozeman said. \"In the opinion of Lodge #1, the efforts to increase the pay for the chief of police should be the beginning of a broader discussion to address salaries, residency, recruitment and retention for all of Wilmington PD's sworn personnel.\"\n\nJeffrey Horvath, executive director of the Delaware Police Chiefs' Council Inc., said the city will have to pay up for a chief that knows how to solve the city's crime problems.\n\n\"The current salary of $117,000 is low for the chief of the third largest police department in the state of Delaware and the jurisdiction with some of the bigger issues in terms of shootings, homicides and drug-related incidents,\" he said. \"The person who’s going to take on that job and accept all that responsibility should be paid a good, fair amount.\"\n\nContact Christina Jedra at (302) 324-2837, cjedra@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/11/09/growing-number-wilmington-employees-have-100-k-salaries/836501001/", "title": "Growing number of Wilmington employees have $100k+ salaries", "text": "When Wilmington City Auditor Terence J. Williams began work this week, he started earning a $112,000 annual salary – a $14,500 increase over his predecessor.\n\nThe new hire is part of a growing number of city workers making six-figure salaries.\n\nA review of city salary data by The News Journal shows that:\n\nLast October, 18 employees made $100,000 or more. As of this week, that number is 31.\n\nA year ago, the employee with the highest annual base salary was Mayor Dennis P. Williams, who earned $115,276. Now there are 14 people who make more than that, most of them union police officers\n\nSome high-level city employees are making 10 percent or more than they or their predecessors were earning a year ago.\n\nThe News Journal compared salary data from October 2016 to up-to-date salary information obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests. The October data does not account for across-the-board raises most city workers received last year.\n\nPolice Chief Robert Tracy received the biggest percentage increase over his predecessor, former Chief Bobby Cummings. With an annual salary of $160,000, Tracy makes 31 percent more than the $110,096 Cummings made a year ago, data show.\n\nCity Council had to vote in April to increase the chief position's salary limit from $117,073 to $161,600. The administration argued it needed to offer a competitive salary to attract talent. The proposal drew criticism at a meeting where council members questioned whether the city could afford it and why they should grant a raise without first seeing results.\n\nSearch:Wilmington department head salaries\n\n\"There’s got to be a carrot and stick approach,\" said Councilman Bob Williams. \"Right now we’re throwing carrots at people.\"\n\nMayor Mike Purzycki appointed Finance Director Patrick Carter in January. Carter earns $130,000, an almost $20,000 raise over his predecessor, which makes him the second highest paid city employee after the police chief, according to city records.\n\nCarter, the former director of the state division of revenue, outearns Purzycki, who makes $117,676, data show. Carter’s salary with the state was $126,980, according to Section 10 of the Fiscal Year 2017 state budget.\n\nBACKGROUND: Purzycki appoints new department heads\n\nThe mayor offered Carter the maximum possible salary for a finance director when he walked in the door, $117,073, and then increased the limit in May to $130,000 with City Council's approval. Carter now makes over 15 percent more than former finance head Sheila Winfrey-Brown, who made $109,943 a year ago.\n\nPurzycki said in a statement that the city pays management personnel \"well below the market, even when compared to other public entities.\"\n\n\"The directors I have hired or recommended for their positions are being paid what is appropriate based on the demands of the job and the skills and leadership they bring to their positions,\" he said. \"This will continue to be the practice of this administration as we commit to assemble the strongest management team possible.\"\n\nCouncilman Williams thinks Carter's salary is excessive.\n\n\"It used to be you took a government job because you felt compelled to make a difference, not to get rich,\" he said. \"That mantra has been turned upside down.\"\n\nThe planning director position hit six figures with a $104,000 salary. Herb Inden makes $13,220 more than former director Leonard Sophrin made a year ago. Sophrin now heads the real estate and housing department and makes $93,896.\n\nLicenses and Inspections Commissioner Ray Rhodes was making $91,800 in October of last year, data show. Jeff Starkey, who used to make $109,391 heading public works, now makes $112,695 as the L&I commissioner.\n\nParks and Recreation Director Kevin Kelley gets $99,100 annually, a 12.5 percent increase over former parks director James Lane, who made $86,700 last October, records show.\n\nCummings got a raise too -- during his last week of work.\n\nAs of March 20, Cummings was making $111,197, city data shows. City council voted to increase the salary ceiling on the chief position on April 6 for Tracy. On April 10, three days before Cummings' \"walkout\" ceremony, Purzycki gave him a retroactive raise to $117,000, covering time from Jan. 4 to that day, then bumped him up to $130,000, the mayor's office said.\n\nTanya Washington, Purzycki's chief of staff, said the mayor approved the raise because he felt Cummings \"should be making more than employees that report to him.\"\n\nTo Councilman Williams, it looks like a trade-off to have Cummings retire quietly.\n\n\"Was it an incentive to get him to retire? Most likely.\"\n\nThe raise enables Cummings to get an extra $13,400 a year in pension payments, according to the mayor's office. He will get $97,500 a year instead of $84,000.\n\nIn his March budget address, Purzycki said the city was facing a \"looming debt crisis\" that required raising the property tax by 7.5 percent and cutting open jobs, including 16 firefighter positions.\n\nWilliams said the raises contradict the mayor's claims.\n\n\"They got rid of core services to pad the pockets of the upper echelon,\" he said. \"You sell the council on the fact that you’ve got to eliminate these positions or we’ll go bankrupt only to find out you made backdoor deals that you're cutting checks to people. That's a trust issue.\"\n\nCouncilman Ciro Adams said by allowing these kinds of raises, the mayor is contributing to a situation that will eventually require staffing cuts.\n\n\"Obviously the mayor still thinks he’s at the Riverfront where the city gives him any amount of money he needs,\" the Republican said, referring to Purzycki's former role as head of the Riverfront Development Corporation.\n\nAdams, a certified public accountant, voted against the auditor's appointment because he said he was \"underwhelmed\" with Williams' lack of professional certifications. Unlike his predecessor Earl Jeter, Williams is not a certified public accountant. But he's making $15,468 more than Jeter was a year ago.\n\nThe mayor's office said the raise was a matter of supply and demand.\n\n\"Of the three people interviewed for the auditor position, all of them requested a salary of $110,000 or higher,\" said John Rago, the mayor's chief of staff for policy and communications.\n\nJust because a candidate requests a higher salary doesn't mean the city has to provide it, Councilman Williams said.\n\n\"I think there are qualified people to take these jobs at current salaries,\" he said.\n\nARCHIVES: Wilmington settles police contract, approves raises\n\nJonathan B. Justice, a professor of public policy and administration at the University of Delaware, said the increased salaries are not necessarily unusual.\n\n\"Those low six-figure numbers don’t seem out of line to me if you’re getting people who really have the ability and the experience,\" he said.\n\nJustice said finding talent can be difficult in a small state.\n\n\"In New York or Philadelphia, you have a huge labor market to draw on,\" he said. \"If there's only a few dozen (in Delaware) and they’re happy working at the university or Chase or Bank of America, it becomes more challenging to peel one of those away and say: Take a 50 percent pay cut because this work is more fun.\"\n\nOne major hiring challenge is the city's residency rule, according to Purzycki, because it requires all new hires to move to the city within six months and maintain a residence for five years.\n\n\"This is usually a disqualifier as there is no job security and employees can be terminated at will,\" he said.\n\nPolice department leaders represent the majority of those surpassing $100,000 for the first time, the data show. Police salaries are determined through collective bargaining agreements between the city and unions.\n\nThe annual salary data do not account for overtime or other pay.\n\nCecilia Ashe was promoted from lieutenant to inspector and got a 33 percent raise, from $81,965 to $122,575, data show.\n\nSix captains made $98,983 in base salary a year ago. This year, two of them will make $111,160 and four of them will make $115,480.\n\nLast October, the highest paid police personnel were Inspectors Elmer Harris and Clayton Smith, who each made $113,606. This year, their salary is $127,583. Harris is now retired.\n\nThe 10 to 15 percent raises for police leadership, agreed upon with the captains and inspectors union last year, sent \"the wrong message\" to the rank and file, Councilman Williams said. Rank and file officers this week agreed to a union contract with 2 percent raises this year and the next two fiscal years.\n\n\"The senior management is greatly outpacing the worker bees,\" he said. \"The cost of living rises, inflation is what it is, but it’s not the same across the board.\"\n\nThe police union president did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRepresenting roughly 40 percent of the annual budget, salaries are projected to have cost $59,609,898 in Fiscal Year 2017 and will cost $61,339,237 this fiscal year, according to the city budget. Actual numbers for the fiscal year 2017 are not yet available, the city said.\n\nSalaries rise as the \"declared rates\" for each position increase with every budget cycle. The mayor, his chief of staff and each department head have this maximum salary, which is determined in the budget process.\n\nRecords show that for at least the past four years, those maximums have increased for almost every position every single year.\n\nThe mayor decided earlier this year to conduct an independent compensation review, the city said. It is slated to begin in January and should be completed by the summer.\n\nPurzycki said he has \"little doubt that this review will confirm that Wilmington is at a distinct disadvantage when assembling an effective management team to operate the city.\"\n\nContact Christina Jedra at (302) 324-2837, cjedra@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.\n\nSalaries vs. what they were a year ago:\n\nThe News Journal compared salaries as of November 2017 to what workers or their predecessors earned in that position a year ago, in October 2016.

The mayor hoped to have it passed by the end of December and implemented by April after an education campaign, but that timeline is no longer possible. It will be subject to another committee meeting before it goes for a full vote of the council.\n\nIt's a setback for the mayor, who called the legislation \"the most important thing we’ve done since hiring a new police chief.\"\n\n\"It's critical that we get it passed,\" Purzycki said.\n\nCommunity development and urban planning committee members Zanthia Oliver and Nnamdi Chukwuocha voted to advance the legislation to a full council vote, but they were overshadowed by Yolanda McCoy, Trippi Congo, Vash Turner and Chairwoman Rysheema Dixon, who hesitated to vote at all.\n\nThe legislation would convert housing code enforcement from a criminal to a civil matter. Cases that are currently argued in court for months could be resolved more quickly if the city had more control, officials said.\n\nAs is, tenants end up living in substandard apartments owned by disinterested landlords, Purzycki said.\n\n\"The investment strategy is you can buy these properties cheaply, patch them and paint them and get a renter in there,\" he said.\n\nAllowing properties to remain in the hands of irresponsible owners hurts the city, said Jeffrey Starkey, commissioner of Wilmington's Department of Licenses and Inspections.\n\n\"(Blight) attracts loitering, drug activity, prostitution, you name it,\" he said.\n\nThe proposal would allow the city to eventually sell a property at sheriff's sale if the owner fails to pay fines for violations ranging from maintaining inadequate garbage containers to neglecting to fix damage to an exterior wall, the legislation states.\n\nThe rewritten code creates three classes of violations:\n\nClass 1 violations would incur a fine of $100 and include failing to fix a broken window or repair a leaking toilet.\n\nClass 2 violations would incur a fine of $250 and include failing to install smoke detectors, provide hot water or pay the vacant property fee.\n\nClass 3 violations would incur a fine of $1,000 and include failing to fix bulging foundational walls.\n\nEach week the problem isn't fixed would be a separate violation and additional fine. An unpaid fine automatically becomes a lien, which could form the basis of a sheriff's sale, the city said.\n\nThe legislation does not describe a timeline, a number of violations or a threshold of fines that would trigger a sheriff sale.\n\nAt Monday's meeting, Congo repeatedly asked Starkey about the circumstances in which a property would be taken to sheriff sale.\n\nStarkey did not provide a clear answer.\n\n\"The goal is not to take people’s property,\" Starkey said.\n\nFrank Robinson, a longtime Hilltop resident and homeowner, said his neighborhood has many abandoned properties that he is tired of looking at. But with this legislation, he worries the city will punish homeowners who are not able, physically or financially, to fix violations.\n\n\"When we pass bills like this it’s usually the disabled, poor and elderly who get caught up in this,\" he said.\n\nThe city's intentions may be good now, but what matters is what the legislation allows, Robinson said.\n\n\"Mr. Starkey is a wonderful guy, but if he leaves tomorrow, this law is still in place.\"\n\nThe court system currently provides an objective third party for adjudicating housing cases, said Robinson, president of the West Side Community Action Committee. Cutting the courts out of the process puts homeowners at a disadvantage, he said.\n\n\"If you have no recourse, it’s just like eminent domain, just using code violations,\" he said.\n\nPurzycki said the \"political pressure\" that would come with pushing homeowners out would be unbearable, and it's simply \"not going to happen.\" If the public wants his commitment not to pursue lawfully occupied homes, he said he will put it in writing.\n\n\"We have no intention of throwing a homeowner out of the street because they can’t take care of their house,\" he said. \"I'm open to legislative steps to formalize that view.\"\n\nThe code changes were recommended in a 2014 report by the Center for Community Progress, a national nonprofit focused on eliminating vacant, abandoned and deteriorated properties.\n\nIt endorses a “Fix it Up, Pay it Up or Give it Up” approach: urge owners to comply with housing regulations, force persistent violators to pay outstanding taxes and code liens, and use liens to take the property away from the owner and transfer it to \"a responsible party.\"\n\nOne suggested \"responsible party\" is a land bank, a quasi-government entity that acquires problem properties and packages them for sale. Prospective owners and developers get a clean slate -- meaning they can buy without taking on the years of debt the property accumulated.\n\nThe Wilmington Neighborhood Conservancy Land Bank was established in 2015, and the city began transferring properties to it in October, according to its website.\n\nThe criminal-to-civil bill is part of a package of legislation that has changed since its introduction in October.\n\nIt reinstates pre-rental inspections, which the mayor said stopped about a decade ago. Starkey said he will need additional manpower in the licenses and inspections department to do this, which the mayor said will need to be approved in the next budget cycle.\n\nInitially, the law mandated that every seven days a violation goes uncorrected will warrant another fine which would double after 180 days and triple after a year. The city removed the doubling and tripling provision.\n\nThe city also proposed adjustments to the nuisance property program, which assigns points to properties based on evidence of nuisance behavior. To \"better capture nuisance activity,\" enforcement action would be taken against properties accumulating 18 or more points within an 18-month period, instead of a 12-month period, according to a substitute ordinance.\n\nPoints can be given for a variety of reasons including violent acts on the property, noise violations, police calls for service and health code violations.\n\nFor properties that hit the point threshold, the city can close the building, revoke a business license and issue a criminal summons, the city code states.\n\nSTORY: Vacant houses continue to blight Wilmington\n\nThe city had initially suggested repealing mandatory landlord training that was passed by the previous city council. A substitute ordinance brings back the training, but only for first-time owners of rental dwellings.\n\nPaul Calistro, president of the Cornerstone West Community Development Corporation, called the legislative package \"a mixed bag.\"\n\nHe applauded the increased time in which a vacant property must be registered (from 45 days to six months) and said the city needs a housing code with \"some teeth\" to deal with unengaged, out-of-state landlords.\n\n\"For vacant, blighted properties that are unoccupied, it’s fine… It's helping people who live next door,\" he said. \"But for those properties who are owner-occupied, I think we have to treat them differently.\"\n\nContact Christina Jedra at (302) 324-2837, cjedra@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/11/09/purzycki-targetting-problem-homeowners-reduce-blight/836423001/", "title": "Wilmington efforts to reduce blight raise concerns", "text": "Owners of vacant and blighted properties in Wilmington would face increased fees and could lose their property to sheriff's sale if new regulations are approved by the City Council.\n\nMayor Mike Purzycki says these rules – contained in four pieces of legislation – will strengthen neighborhoods.\n\n\"I believe strongly that property owners who do not live up to their responsibilities should not be permitted to continue hindering Wilmington’s efforts to create better neighborhoods,\" he said this week.\n\nSeveral community members expressed concern at a public meeting on Thursday. They worry the legislation would enable the city to use increased fines and liens to push poor people and minorities out of the city.\n\n\"I hope that you all will try to humanize some of these laws,\" said Harmon Carey, founder of the Afro-American Historical Society.\n\nThe biggest adjustment in the proposal would be changing housing code enforcement from a criminal to a civil matter. This would give the city power to eventually sell a person's home at sheriff's sale if the person fails to pay fines for violations ranging from maintaining inadequate garbage containers to neglecting to repair smoke damage after a fire, the legislation states.\n\nThe rewritten code creates three classes of violations:\n\nClass 1 violations would incur a fine of $100 and include failing to fix a broken window or repair a leaking toilet.\n\nClass 2 violations would incur a fine of $250 and include failing to install smoke detectors, provide hot water or pay the vacant property fee.\n\nClass 3 violations would incur a fine of $1,000 and include failing to repair fire damage or fix bulging walls.\n\nSTORY: Vacant houses continue to blight Wilmington\n\nEvery seven days the violation goes uncorrected will warrant another fine. If a violation remains for 180 days, the fine will double, the legislation states. If a violation is still not fixed within a year, the fine will triple. An unpaid fine automatically becomes a lien, which could form the basis of a sheriff's sale, the city said.\n\nThe city said the new system would avoid the usual \"labor-intensive, time-consuming\" process in court.\n\n\"It could be six months or more before you get in the court, and then we have to worry about extensions,\" said Councilman Bud Freel, the legislation's sponsor. \"We’re on a decline, and we cannot let that continue. We have to build these neighborhoods back up.\"\n\nThe District 8 representative introduced a bill to change the housing code from criminal to civil enforcement last year, but it never advanced, records show. It was inspired by a 2014 report on Wilmington from the Center for Community Progress.\n\nThe legislation would substantially increase fees for properties that have been vacant for several years. Currently, homes that are vacant for 10 years face a $5,000 fine plus an additional $500 for every year thereafter.\n\nThe rules would stay the same for homes that have been vacant for less than two years (there is no fee for less than one year), a $500 fee for between one and two years, and a $1,000 fee for between two and three years.\n\nFor homes that are vacant between three and four years, the fee would jump to $5,000. For properties vacant four to five years, the proposed fee is $10,000; for five to six years, $12,000; for six to seven years, $14,000; for seven to eight years, $16,000; and for eight years or more, $18,000 plus $2,000 for each additional year.\n\nFailure to register a vacant property under the new legislation would cost the homeowner $2,500. The city now requires registration after a property is vacant for 45 consecutive days, but officials are proposing an extension to six months to allow owners a longer period to remedy a vacancy.\n\nThe city does not yet have a fiscal impact statement for this legislation, the Mayor's Office said.\n\nThere are approximately 1,650 vacant properties in Wilmington, and roughly 200 are owned by the city, the Mayor's Office said. The city-owned properties will be transferred to the Wilmington Neighborhood Conservancy Land Bank, through which buyers can purchase them without taking on the debt incurred before the land bank acquired them.\n\n\"(The land bank) will maintain those properties and hold them together for future projects whether it's to fix a single-family or redo a whole block,\" Freel said.\n\nAt the meeting, resident Alethea Smith-Tucker questioned the reasoning of fining homeowners — and potentially seizing their property only because it's vacant.\n\n\"You can have a vacant property and have it be well-maintained. Why is there a fee?\" she said. \"It's not a land bank. It's a land grab.\"\n\nFormer Councilwoman Maria Cabrera said existing and proposed laws are \"predatory.\"\n\n\"I know it's not your intention to take homes away from these folks, but that's what's going to happen,\" she said. \"I'm all about transformation, but not on the backs of people who can't afford to fix their property. I hope that's not true because that, to me, does sound like gentrification.\"\n\nPastor Lottie Lee Davis, who lives in Southbridge, said she is concerned about the impact the legislation will have on the black population, for whom she said the government has historically created obstacles to homeownership.\n\n\"It is an asset that builds wealth in our community and should not be lost,\" she said.\n\nThe city also proposed doubling the residential rental license fees, from $50 to $100 per unit, with a cap at $2,500. The increase would go into the general fund, Freel said, and would be used to support city code enforcement. The city currently charges $50 to individuals with one or two units and $120, plus $10 per unit, to those owning three or more units.\n\nSomeone with five units now pays $170. The new legislation would increase that to $500.\n\nThe $2,500 cap would not account for property owners who operate 25 units under different business entity names, L&I Commissioner Jeff Starkey confirmed at the meeting.\n\nPer-unit fees would not change for banks, which currently pay $723; building and loan associations, which pay $361; condominiums, which pay $60; and several other business types. The increase is for \"rental dwelling units\" only.\n\nBrian O'Neill of Greater Wilmington Housing Providers criticized the \"inequitable distribution\" and asked if landlords would be getting an additional service for their increased fee.\n\n\"In essence, this is another tax,\" he said.\n\nWilmington raised property taxes by 7.5 percent this year and increased water/sewer rates by 4 percent. Councilman Vash Turner said Wilmington is putting a \"foot on the necks of constituents in this city.\"\n\n\"My colleagues need to pay attention, and my constituents need to pay attention to my colleagues who don’t pay attention,\" he said.\n\nScott Foster, a longtime resident and homeowner, said the increased fee will hamper investment in the city.\n\n\"Well, heck, why not invest in the county?\" he said. \"You’re gonna take that money to invest it in L&I to issue more tickets at $50 a crack?\"\n\nDavis, a city landlord, said the increase could mean rising rents.\n\n\"Any cost that is given to me, I'm going to have to transfer it to them,\" she said.\n\nThe city also proposed adjustments to the nuisance property program, which assigns points to properties based on evidence of nuisance behavior. The mayor proposed extending the time period wherein points can accumulate to \"better capture nuisance activity affecting the public interest.\"\n\nEnforcement action would be taken against properties accumulating 20 or more points within an 18-month period instead of the current standard of 18 or more points within a 12-month period. Points can be given for a variety of reasons including violent acts on the property, noise violations, police calls for service and health code violations.\n\nFor properties that hit the point threshold, the city can close the building, revoke a business license and issue a criminal summons, the city code states.\n\nCarey, who owns a property in south Wilmington, said he has received instant tickets he feels were excessive and unfair. He wonders if businesses on Shipley Street downtown are treated the same.\n\n\"Are they getting tickets the way we are getting tickets in the black community? I don't think so,\" he said. \"That’s how if someone wanted to close me down, they could easily do it.\"\n\nThe mayor's proposal includes repealing mandatory landlord training passed last year.\n\nSponsored by Cabrera, the law requires the city's roughly 2,700 landlords to complete a free, city-approved training course before obtaining or renewing a business license. Training was supposed to start last month, but the Purzycki administration did not budget for it.\n\nThe new legislation would eliminate the requirement for all landlords. Instead, the licenses and inspections commissioner could require training at the landlord's expense as a condition for the issuance of a provisional business license.\n\nO'Neill thanked the council for the proposed change.\n\n\"It seems the pendulum swung back to something very reasonable,\" he said.\n\nCabrera defended her landlord training requirement, arguing that a bartender cannot serve a glass of wine without a certification, but nothing is required of landlords.\n\n\"You can come into the city of Wilmington, buy a property, rent it out, without any knowledge of how to be a good property owner and a good landlord,\" she said.\n\nThe Mayor's Office said it hopes the legislation passes in December. The city hopes to implement the plan by April 1, followed by an education campaign.\n\nPurzycki said in a statement that the legislation and policy reforms will prevent properties from \"destabilizing\" neighborhoods.\n\n“Blighted and vacant properties weaken neighborhoods, encourage criminal activity, inhibit economic development, undermine otherwise stable real estate markets and encourage irresponsible property owners to continue their detrimental behavior,\" he said.\n\nThe City Council will hold another public meeting to discuss the measures in December.\n\nContact Christina Jedra at (302) 324-2837, cjedra@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.\n\nA timeline of the proposed process\n\nLicenses & Inspections inspects the property and identifies any violations.\n\nA written notice is mailed to the property owner advising the owner of the violations.\n\nThe property owner has 30 calendar days (generally) to correct the violations. (The commissioner may shorten the time for repairs if he determines that a shorter period is essential to protect health and safety.) The property owner may request additional time to make the repairs if needed.\n\nThe time period to correct violation begins when the notice is received by the property owner or posted on the property in violation.\n\nIf the property owner wishes to dispute the violation notice, the owner may appeal the notice to the commissioner of L&I within the time period stated on the notice. (This first level of appeal is new and provides an opportunity to resolve issues without a full hearing before the L&I Review Board. Currently, the property owner would directly appeal to the L&I Review Board.)\n\nThe commissioner has 30 calendar days to issue a written decision.\n\nEnforcement action is stopped until the commissioner issues a decision on the appeal.\n\nA property owner who is not satisfied with the commissioner’s decision may appeal to the city’s Board of License & Inspection Review.\n\nThis appeal must be made within five business days of the commissioner’s decision.\n\nThe property owner receives a hearing before the board.\n\nEnforcement action is stopped until the board issues a decision on the appeal.\n\nA property owner who is not satisfied with the board’s decision may appeal the matter to the court.\n\nIf the property owner is successful in his/her appeal, the matter is generally concluded. If the property owner is not successful with the appeal, the owner is required to correct the violation within the time period listed on the notice (or obtain an extension from L&I).\n\nAfter the time expires to complete the repairs (including any requested extensions of time), L&I will re-inspect the property.\n\nIf the violations are corrected, no fine is assessed. The matter is concluded.\n\nIf the violations are not corrected within the time period given, the fine is assessed to the property owner. (Under the current code, a criminal summons would be issued at this point and the matter proceeds to court.)\n\nA fine may be issued for every seven-day time period that the violation(s) remain uncorrected. (Under the current code, a fine may be assessed for each day the violation remains uncorrected.)\n\nIf a fine is not paid, it is an automatic lien on the property. If the fine is paid, there is no lien.\n\nA lien for unpaid fines under this chapter (along with other unpaid fees/charges/taxes) may form the basis for a future sheriff sale of the property.\n\nSource: Wilmington Mayor's Office", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/05/25/purzycki-unveils-plan-stabilize-wilmingtons-west-center-city/343649001/", "title": "Purzycki unveils plan to 'stabilize' Wilmington's West Center City", "text": "One of Wilmington's roughest neighborhoods will see a greater police presence, increased trash pickup and a crackdown on liquor stores and nuisance properties under a new \"neighborhood stabilization program\" announced by Mayor Mike Purzycki on Thursday.\n\nThe plan, one of Purzycki's campaign promises, aims to \"improve the lives of citizens\" and strengthen a defined area, the zone from Adams to Tatnall streets and Fourth to 10th streets.\n\n\"Too many of our neighborhoods have been plagued by poverty, joblessness, blight and crime,\" Purzycki said, but improvements need to start in one place. \"If we spread ourselves thin and try to achieve everything, we achieve nothing.\"\n\nWest Center City is a bold choice, and an easier location could have been chosen, the mayor said. More than 1 in 10 parcels in the neighborhood is a registered vacant property, and dozens have been identified for sheriff sale, the city said. Property owners in the area owe the city $1.8 million in debt, the Mayor's Office said, and there are 885 unresolved code violations since 2015. The area is also one of the most violent in the city.\n\nBut revitalizing the area could have a major impact. The area is adjacent to Wilmington's downtown business district and sits against I-95 through which drivers enter the city. As part of the program, Purzycki will assign additional resources to the neighborhood including police officers, licenses and inspections personnel, sanitation workers, and parks and recreation staff.\n\nThe mayor did not say how many individuals would be assigned to the neighborhood stabilization zone or how much money is being invested in the effort.\n\nAccording to the mayor, elements of the initiative include:\n\nReducing crime, the flow of drugs, gang activity, prostitution and other criminal behaviors.\n\nEnsuring that liquor and convenience stores are not \"contributing to neighborhood instability.\"\n\nReinstituting \"pre-rental inspections\" to make sure residences meet city code requirements.\n\nHolding property owners accountable for the interior and exterior of their buildings and use the sheriff sale process if those who neglect their property or are in debt to the city.\n\nSupporting property owners in good standing with the city's property facade program.\n\nImplementing traffic flow changes to interrupt \"those who travel too freely in the neighborhood to conduct illicit activities.\"\n\nAssisting the West Center City Neighborhood Association.\n\nReducing trash on streets and enforcing related laws.\n\nIncreasing mental and physical health resources and other social services as needed.\n\nPartnering with the Christina School District on education programs.\n\nMark Williams, a gym supervisor at the William \"Hicks\" Anderson Center who grew up in West Center City, said he's optimistic about the stabilization program and Purzycki.\n\n\"By making it look good, it makes people feel better,\" he said. \"It makes you want to take care of it. Kids will be kids, be destructive, but someone will say, 'You can't tear this up,' and maybe they won't do it again. When it looks good, more people want to be here.\"\n\nThe mayor also announced the city will spend $1.3 million on upgrades to the Hicks Anderson Community Center, the only city-owned community center. Improvements include reroofing and repainting the facility; repairing leaking pipes; installing a new water treatment system in the swimming pool; installing new lockers; putting in a new gym floor; and replacing several heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.\n\nPurzycki acknowledged on Thursday there have been many previous attempts to improve West Center City.\n\nThe area, which used to feature manicured lawns and clean streets, declined decades ago after I-95 sliced the city in half and provided a pipeline for drugs and the 1968 riots caused lasting destruction.\n\nIn 2015, West Center City was Wilmington's most violent neighborhood, and a review by The News Journal showed that decades of revitalization plans hadn't stopped the area's decline.\n\nIn 1963, city and federal officials began planning for the West Center City Urban Renewal project. The more than $20 million project called for better code enforcement and consequences for absentee landlords, according to News Journal archives. It also sought to rehabilitate 800 homes and build 400 new ones in, attracting interest from private developers.\n\nUltimately, the program was defunded under President Richard Nixon’s administration, but not before the Wilmington Housing Authority had helped to dismantle and demolish West Center City. Hundreds of residents were relocated out of the area, but there weren’t enough affordable houses for them to return.\n\nIn April 1988, officials introduced the West Center City Initiative, which again set out to renovate vacant homes and step up code enforcement. Mayor Daniel Frawley announced the program on the 700 block of Madison St.\n\nAlmost 30 years later in the same location, Purzycki echoed his predecessors' plans.\n\nBut this time, he said, it will be different.\n\n\"These concentrated deployments have been tried before with little success and certainly almost nothing in the long term,\" he said. \"I believe it's because we lost our resolve, our concentration, and we chase the next shiny object. The failing was not necessarily strategy but the execution and relentless follow-up. This is a mistake we're not going to repeat.\"\n\nThe mayor said the state of West Center City is driving businesses away and putting people in danger. He cited the case of a day care that fled the neighborhood after its fence was hit by bullets.\n\n\"We're not going to see that kind of thing happen again,\" he said.\n\nSTORY: Decades of revitalization plans haven't diminished violence\n\nSTORY: New Wilmington police chief prioritizing community policing\n\nCity Councilman Vash Turner said in past efforts, \"money wasn’t going where it needed to go.\"\n\n\"History does not have to repeat itself,\" he said.\n\nCity Councilman Nnamdi Chukwuocha, whose father is the namesake of the Hicks Anderson Community Center, said the neighborhood he grew up in has a plan, and it just needs help reaching its goals.\n\n\"West Center City is a great place,\" Chukwuocha said in an impassioned speech. \"It's a place I want to stay, not a place I move to because I have to. ... I encourage everybody, let's do our part. We can make a difference, I promise you.\"\n\nSome city residents are skeptical.\n\n\"We tried all that before,\" said Raymond Buker, a 42-year-old city resident.\n\nBuker said he would have liked the mayor to talk directly with people in the city's neighborhoods \"who have no title,\" who are not community leaders. If he had, Buker said Purzycki would see Wilmington's problems stem from the home.\n\n\"The trash is inside, not outside,\" he said.\n\nFor the Rev. Derrick Johnson, Purzycki's plan sounds like gentrification.\n\n\"The very dilemma of violence in these communities is not directly dealt with,\" he said. \"I believe his view is: Take the bad element out, refurbish the property and bring 'good citizens' in.\"\n\nThe neighborhood stabilization program has the support of several nonprofit and private entities that will serve on a working group to help implement the goals. Members include residents and representatives of local nonprofits, Wilmington City Council, the Delaware Office of Alcohol and Tobacco Enforcement, the state Department of Health and Social Services, the Delaware Contractors Association and almost every department in the city of Wilmington.\n\n\"We’re not just going to be doing enforcement and tearing things down,\" Purzycki said. \"We want to build up our communities.\"\n\nContact Christina Jedra at cjedra@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2837 or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.\n\nMost common unresolved violations in West Center City since 2015", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/09/13/wilmington-wants-your-help-creating-its-vision-2028/661644001/", "title": "Wilmington seeks public help developing 10-year plan", "text": "Note: This story has been updated to include the estimated cost of the city's consultant, Interface Studio LLC.\n\nWilmington is beginning a year-long effort to come up with a comprehensive plan that will guide development across the city for the next 10 years.\n\nOfficials are seeking public input for the plan, called Wilmington 2028, the city said in a news release.\n\nMayor Mike Purzycki said the plan will address current challenges and develop \"a new vision for tomorrow.\"\n\n\"This will be a community-driven effort which I would like to see reflect the hopes and priorities of our citizens,\" he said in a statement. \"This plan will guide future development, and shape where and why public and private investment dollars are spent to make Wilmington a stronger and more prosperous city over the next decade.”\n\nThe plan, managed by City Planning Director Herb Inden, is required by a Delaware law that states all municipalities must have a comprehensive plan in place that is reviewed and updated every 10 years.\n\nThe most recent plan on the city's website was adopted in 2003, updated in August 2009 and was certified by the state in 2010, the mayor's office said.

The company's contract and exhibits, obtained by The News Journal, show they will be paid an estimated $350,000.\n\nThe company began conducting initial interviews with \"stakeholders\" in mid-August, the city said.\n\nThe city is asking citizens to participate in an online survey that will \"translate the vision, hopes, dreams, and priorities of our residents\" into the city's guide: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Wilmington2028.\n\nThe survey asks residents to rate their overall satisfaction and quality of life issues like safety, sense of community, affordability, commuting time, parks and recreation and housing.\n\nThe survey process will be followed by five public meetings to begin in late October and run through the end of November, the city said. In early 2018, focus groups will address specific issues and make recommendations. Preliminary recommendations will be submitted to the public for feedback in the spring of next year, the city said, and a draft of the new comprehensive plan will be shared with citizens in the summer of 2018.\n\nThe mayor and planning department selected a 21-member steering committee to review the initial findings of the projects' research phase and help guide public engagement and plan development phases.

A site at Delaware Avenue and Washington Street experienced five such crashes in that time period.\n\nThe city will verify DelDOT's data in the coming weeks and will choose 17 sites.

(AP) — New Mexico voters have a chance this year to send a historic all-female U.S. House delegation to Congress, no matter which party wins races.\n\nAnd the state’s three congresswomen may be all women of color — another national milestone.\n\nWomen are seeking the Democratic and Republican nominations in all six of the state’s primary races for three congressional seats. In each of those races, at least one Latina or one Native American woman is running in her respective party’s primary contests in what has turned out to be some of the most diverse political battles in the county. The women candidates have been among the largest fundraisers in races and could be their party’s nominees.\n\nNew Hampshire in 2013 became the first state to have an all-female Congressional delegation (Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte, and Reps. Ann McLane Kuster and Carol Shea-Porter), according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Delaware’s lone member of the U.S. House, Democratic Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, who is black, helped give the state the nation’s first all-female of color U.S. House delegation in 2017.\n\nBut New Mexico could wind up with the largest U.S. House delegation of women or women of color in the nation’s history. The state's population of about 2 million is 49 percent Hispanic and 9 percent Native American.\n\nMore:Joe Biden vowed to pick a woman VP. Some Democrats say she must be a woman of color\n\n“This is unusual,” Jean Sinzdak, associate director of the Center for American Women and Politics, said. “A record number of women are running for House seats, so this is interesting.”\n\nIn New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional Democratic primary, for example, Yale University graduate and Stanford University-trained lawyer Teresa Leger Fernandez and former CIA operative Valerie Plame are among those running in a crowded field to represent the state’s northern region. Both are indicative of the area’s traditional Hispanic past (Leger Fernandez is Latina) and recent coastal liberal transplants (the Anchorage, Alaska-born Plame is white).\n\nOn the Republican side, Navajo Nation member and businesswomen Karen Bedonie is waging her campaign for the GOP nomination in isolation and amid a strict curfew aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19. Her campaign literature features her in traditional Navajo clothing, and she often mentions to voters that she’s a mother of eight.\n\nThe seat is open because Democratic U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan is running for U.S. Senate.\n\nThe state’s 1st Congressional District is currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland, who was one of the nation’s first Native American congresswomen.\n\nRetired police officer Michelle Garcia Holmes, who is Hispanic, is among three Republicans seeking the GOP nomination to challenge Haaland for the Democratic-leaning seat representing Albuquerque.\n\nIn the state’s southern 2nd Congressional District, oil executive Claire Chase and former state lawmaker Yvette Herrell are locked in a nasty, three-person contest for the GOP nomination. Chase is the first female chair of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, and Herrell is an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation.\n\nThey are seeking to unseat Democratic Rep. Xochitl Torres Small, the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants and who grew up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nMore:Republican slugfest for U.S. House seat in New Mexico's 2nd district\n\nRetired University of New Mexico political science professor Christine Marie Sierra, who has followed women in politics for years, said this moment has been building for decades in New Mexico.\n\n“Women are now seen as viable candidates, and both parties in New Mexico are doing their part to recruit women to run for office,” Sierra said. “And what you see here is a reflection of the state’s diversity.”\n\nAccording to the Center for American Women and Politics, 490 women have filed as candidates for U.S. House seats nationwide in 2020, a new record high.\n\nThat surpasses even the record-breaking 2018 midterm election, in which 476 women filed to run for House seats, the center found.\n\nThe numbers could grow because filing deadlines have yet to pass in around a dozen or so states.\n\nMuch of the surge in candidate filings is in Republican primaries across the country, the center said.\n\nWomen also are making gains in local elections. Last year, for example, Tucson, Arizona, voters elected Regina Romero, the daughter of farm workers, as the first Latina mayor in the city’s history.\n\nLeger Fernandez said whatever happens in her election, she’s proud to be part of a chance to make history. As a two-year-old, she was in a coma with spinal meningitis. Doctors didn’t believe she would survive.\n\nHer grandmother, Abelina Romero Lucero, prayed to La Virgen de Guadalupe and later made a pilgrimage to Mexico to ask the heavens to heal her granddaughter.\n\nLeger Fernandez has pictured herself having a conservation with her late grandmother after winning her race.\n\n“I know exactly what she’d say,” Leger Fernandez said. “She’d tell me, ‘I knew there was a reason La Virgen let you live.’ ”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/firststatepolitics/2016/05/21/running-congress-rochester-draws-strength-experience/84491194/", "title": "Running for Congress, Lisa Blunt Rochester draws on experience", "text": "Adam Duvernay\n\nThe News Journal\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This is the second in a series of profiles on candidates running for Delaware's at-large congressional seat.\n\nIn China, Lisa Blunt Rochester told stories. On the campaign trail for Delaware's at-large congressional seat, she listens to them.\n\nFlung far from her Wilmington upbringing, she was in a foreign land where customs were unusual and her reasons for being there revolved around the love of a man. But the words she put down on papers – stories written with and about other expatriates in Shanghai – matter to her as much today as then.\n\n\"I waited until my daughter was ready to go to college. Then I sold the house, sold the car and moved to China for love. While there, I had a chance to do something I always wanted to do, which was to write full time. I ended up writing a book about women who reinvented themselves. It's called 'Thrive,'\" Blunt Rochester said.\n\n\"What I loved about that project, and it's kind of symbolic where I am now, is for many of us, whether it's people who lost their jobs or homes during the downturn or people who lost their children to gun violence and me losing my husband, we have to reinvent ourselves constantly,\" she said.\n\nIn 2014, her 10-year romance with her second husband, Charles Rochester, ended with his death. It left Blunt Rochester without her best friend at a time when she was becoming a new woman. When she came home, her next calling became clear.\n\n\"I came back and just looked around at our city. I looked at our state and our country and I kept hearing all these extremes. At that moment, I was all into my own grief and had to step out of that and say, 'You know what, I'm still here. I can still serve, and there's much to be done,\" Blunt Rochester said. \"I had to actually start thinking about what the trajectory of my career has been.\"\n\nBlunt Rochester is running for Delaware's at-large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. She's a Democrat in a packed field, contending against State Sen. Bryan Townsend, U.S. Marine Corps veteran Sean Barney and accountant Mike Miller in the Sept. 13 primary. Hans Reigle is the Delaware Republican State Committee's pick for the seat. Rose Izzo is also running as a Republican.\n\nThe former state secretary of labor – the first black woman in Delaware to hold that position – is part of a political legacy in Wilmington. She was the third to join the congressional race, following Townsend and state Rep. Bryon Short, who left the contest in April, and she hopes a victory will hand her the first elected seat of her career.\n\nBlunt Rochester has the support of current state Labor Secretary Patrice Gilliam-Johnson. The pair worked together as leaders in the Wilmington Urban League during what Gilliam-Johnson labeled a transitional period where Blunt Rochester made her presence an asset.\n\n\"When she came on board, we knew she had a strong work ethic,\" Gilliam-Johnson said. \"She was the kind of person that when she put her mind to something she could really move an agenda forward.\"\n\nSTORY: US House candidates struggle to differentiate positions\n\nSTORY: Short drops out of congressional race, cites money\n\nGoing to Washington\n\nBlunt Rochester brings index cards with her to campaign gatherings. She hands them out to those she meets and asks they write down on the cards the issues that matter most. The answers, she said, show some striking similarities.\n\n\"We did it with students. We've done it with young professionals. We did it with a group of residents in Middletown,\" Blunt Rochester said. \"There are some things that are common themes.\"\n\nShe said she learned the value of hearing all sides of an argument as the state's personnel director when tough cuts and state employees' livelihoods often were at odds. Whether it was union leaders, department heads or elected officials, she said she found every side shared something in the human need to be understood.\n\n\"One of the hallmarks of leadership, for me, is listening. It's pivotal. Even in this campaign, what we're doing is listening, going out to different parts of the state and listening,\" Blunt Rochester said. \"People in this country are ready for that. They want to be heard. We all want to be heard.\"\n\nImproving educational attainment, criminal justice reform, the perception of cities like Wilmington where fears of gun violence may dissuade new residents and business from joining the community, how to get and keep employment – for Blunt Rochester the concerns in the community boil down to issues of wealth.\n\n\"When people have a good job, maybe they don't need mental health counseling because they have a purpose. When people have a good job, they can have a home that their kids can live in and that kid can go to school and learn, and then maybe there's not the connection to the criminal justice system,\" Blunt Rochester said. \"So if nothing else, if you don't hear anything else I say, I want people to know when they elect me they're going to elect somebody who relates to them.\"\n\nBlunt Rochester, 54, supports tax credits designed to help small businesses get off the ground. She wants a higher federal minimum wage and is behind a recent expansion of overtime rules. She wants inmates, veterans, young people and women to have better access to job readiness training.\n\nHer campaign website calls for ending loopholes for purchasing firearms and rails against the National Rifle Association as complicit in \"families attending funerals instead of graduations.\" Defunding Planned Parenthood, her website claims, is part of a Republican effort to \"try and drag us back to the last century.\"\n\nThe Blunt-Bradley Report was a 2001 document, bearing Blunt Rochester's old name, which found \"substantial issues to be addressed\" concerning perceptions among minority troopers and employees of their place in the ranks of the Delaware State Police. The document was prepared while she served as secretary of labor for Gov. Ruth Ann Minner, who issued an executive order establishing new equal opportunity hiring standards in state government.\n\nThe report found DSP in \"technical compliance\" with the law but recommended evaluating the methodology for promotion within DSP, establishing better written disciplinary practices, expanding recruitment efforts, strengthening avenues of appeal for filing racial and sexual discrimination complaints and giving the state office of personnel a larger role in monitoring DSP.\n\n\"We're kind of like a microcosm of the rest of the country, which gives people hope if you can do things here maybe we can do things across the country,\" Blunt Rochester said. \"On the issue of jobs, on the issue of education, on the issue of women's health and the wage gap, people want real solutions and I have a history of doing that collaboratively with other people in the state.\"\n\nThough she's held government positions in the past, she's never needed voters before her bid to be Delaware's first congresswoman. According to Delaware State University political science professor Samuel Hoff, that kind of service isn't as important for winning elections as it once was.\n\n\"The old route to Congress has changed,\" Hoff said. \"That gives those candidates hope over and above what it use to be.\"\n\nVoters are generally depressed with the state of Congress and distrustful of those who've served in it, Hoff said, and the current cycle of politics favors those who successfully present themselves as outsiders. Even the influence of party has waned, he said, but he believes raising at least $500,000 is a threshold amount to taking a U.S. House seat.\n\nBlunt Rochester put together contributions totaling $234,770 in the first quarter of the year, bringing her to a total of $385,193 since she started her run. But that total includes a $100,000 loan from her own pocket.\n\n\"That loan is money left to me, and that is me saying to people I'm committed to this, I've got skin in the game,\" Blunt Rochester said. \"We have done a very good job of being good stewards of the money other people have given us. While others may have raised a little bit more – because we've stayed competitive – we also were good stewards and ended up with the most cash on hand the first quarter out and the second quarter out.\"\n\nThat's not an insignificant loan, Hoff said, and she'll be a long time paying herself back. As for the message she said she hoped to send, Hoff believes it'll be up to the voters to decide whether it's \"a gimmick\" or \"a hail Mary desperation pass.\"\n\nSTORY: Former state labor secretary enters congressional race\n\nSTORY: Congressional candidates stake ground on gun rights\n\nBig shoes\n\nTed Blunt, Blunt Rochester's father, brought his family in 1969 from Philadelphia to Wilmington to work for Peoples Settlement Association, a social services organization more than a century old.\n\n\"That was one of the inspirations for me doing this. Many of the major institutions that help support families are struggling, and that was the one that brought us to Delaware,\" Blunt Rochester said.\n\nHe started working at the community center there and eventually rose to lead the City Council as president, though he'd aimed higher with bids to be a state representative and lieutenant governor. Hoff followed Delaware politics even then and said the man had a \"party boss reputation,\" meaning an active and potent career in a time when politics was tough.\n\nTed Blunt's legacy is rooted in education and the changes the state was going through during desegregation, Hoff said. Hoff identified him as a man of civic service and said he has no doubts that long career made an impact on his daughter.\n\n\"That's something Lisa has followed,\" Hoff said. \"That certainly rubbed off, that commitment to service.\"\n\nAnother of Blunt Rochester's role models was Jim Gilliam, a leader at the Wilmington Urban League. Gilliam considered Blunt Rochester a person he could trust during tough conversations and was one of her advocates for leadership, according to his daughter, Patrice Gilliam-Johnson.\n\n\"She has the state and the community in Delaware at the forefront of her interests,\" Gilliam-Johnson said. \"I have seen her in numerous capacities be clear about what her goals and objectives are.\"\n\nFor Blunt Rochester, Gilliam's influence was foundational. She said she strives to live the inspiration he gave her.\n\n\"He used to say, 'Get off your duff.' That was one of his sayings. Don't just talk about the problems, do something. To have strong mentors like that really was important,\" Blunt Rochester said. \"When I came on at the Urban League, it really was a time of transition because he was transitioning out of the organization and we were trying to figure out, in an environment where it's difficult to raise money for non-profits, at a time where you have to be relevant, how do we do that? Part of that was research and understanding what's happening in our neighborhoods.\"\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 324-2785 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com.\n\nAn earlier version of this article should have identified Lisa Blunt Rochester as the first black woman in Delaware to serve as state secretary of labor. It has been corrected.\n\nU.S. House race\n\nName: Lisa Blunt Rochester\n\nAffiliation: Democrat\n\nBorn: Philadelphia\n\nAge: 54\n\nEducation: Fairleigh Dickinson University (international relations); University of Delaware (master's degree in urban affairs and public policy)\n\nPrior service: Delaware deputy secretary of health and social services (1993-1998); Delaware secretary of labor (1998-2001); Delaware personnel director (2001-2004); CEO of Wilmington Urban League (2004-2007)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/14/carney-charts-familiar-course-governor-run/75541174/", "title": "John Carney charts familiar course in Delaware governor run", "text": "Jonathan Starkey\n\nThe News Journal\n\nCongressman John Carney is back in a familiar position – next in line to win Delaware's top political office.\n\nIt was eight years ago when Carney, 59, first staked a claim on the governorship, only to end up on the wrong side of a bruising Democratic primary battle.\n\nThis time around, Carney's path to power could not be clearer. He has cornered Democratic support in a deeply blue state, quickly raising more than $200,000 and capitalizing on three decades of government experience to secure the backing of virtually all of Delaware's top Democratic officeholders.\n\nAmong his most vocal supporters is Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, the same politician who in 2008 rejected pleas from Democratic Party leaders hoping to avoid a primary contest and went on to beat Carney that September and Republican Bill Lee in the general election.\n\nNow, a year from Election Day, no other Democratic candidates seem interested in challenging Carney, a tested candidate who has won five statewide elections as lieutenant governor and congressman.\n\n\"The experience, the number of times he's been on the ballot statewide, there is a comfort level that Democratic primary voters in Delaware have with Carney,\" said Erik Raser-Schramm, a longtime Delaware Democratic operative.\n\nEven Republicans are wary of launching a challenge.\n\nCarney's front-runner status is so cemented that Delaware Sen. Colin Bonini, the favorite to earn the Republican nomination, may walk away from his earlier expressed intentions to seek the Republican nomination for governor. Two Republican sources close to Bonini said he is instead eyeing a campaign for lieutenant governor, where he might have a greater chance against lesser-known statewide politicians.\n\nBonini's own internal polling shows him down more than 20 points against Carney, hardly surprising in a state where registration figures show there are 125,000 more Democratic voters than Republicans. Democrats control registration in all but a few conservative districts in Harrington, Selbyville, Greenville and Pike Creek.\n\nIn some areas of Kent and New Castle counties, Republicans are outnumbered by voters who do not identify with either of the major parties.\n\n“My message is going to be, if you like things the way they are, vote for John. If you think things need to move in a different direction, I’m asking for your vote,\" Bonini said recently, discussing his campaign strategy.\n\nDelaware's open 2016 governor race is the most significant, but will likely not be the most competitive, on next year's ballots. Three Democrats and two Republicans already are seeking Carney's congressional seat in Washington. Primary elections are scheduled for Sept. 13, with the general election nearly two months later on Nov. 8.\n\nThe Carper connection\n\nCarney's Delaware's political pedigree is unmatched among 2016 candidates – even if his executive branch experience says little about how he would address the political challenges of 2015, including a slow-growing economy and financial uncertainty in Legislative Hall.\n\nHe was deputy chief of staff and finance secretary to then Gov. Tom Carper in the 1990s, brokering tax deals and leading the administration's efforts in 1995 to secure the purchase of the Port of Wilmington from the city.\n\nCarney still draws on support from his time in Carper's office, when he worked alongside a tight-knit group of Democrats who have played significant roles in Delaware government and politics over the past three decades.\n\nCarney was hired into state government by Carper's chief of staff, Jeff Bullock, who was later tapped as Markell's secretary of state, a key Cabinet position that protects Delaware's billion-dollar brand as a leading legal home for U.S. corporations.\n\n\"I always admired his work ethic and his dedication to the job,\" Bullock said recently. \"When you're in a governor's office, you're asked to do a variety of different roles ... running the government day-to-day and carrying out the governor's agenda. So you need somebody who can take complex problems, figure them out and then implement whatever the solution is. That's John's greatest strength.\"\n\nDelaware Chief Justice Leo Strine, a lawyer in Carper's governor office, remains close to Carney, too, though he would not be interviewed for this story. He could be a key ally on criminal justice and other issues if Carney wins the governor's office. Two Democrats running to replace Carney in Congress also worked in the Carper administration. Delaware Rep. Bryon Short, a state lawmaker since 2007, was a young constituent relations aide and later a transportation official. Lisa Blunt Rochester served in Carper's Cabinet as labor secretary.\n\nAfter his tenure as a key Carper aide, Carney won two terms as Delaware's lieutenant governor, presiding over the state Senate and forging deeper bonds in the Delaware General Assembly. Since his defeat in the 2008 governor race, he has won three terms to Congress.\n\nThere are critical questions about how Carney would govern in 2016, a time of waning tax collections and exploding costs in health care and public education that are forcing difficult budget discussions in Dover.\n\nHis tenure in the Carper administration was vastly different, marked by a wealth of resources and a booming economy.\n\nThe DuPont Co. employed more than 20,000 people in Delaware. Gambling taxes poured into state coffers, increasing 371 percent during Carney's time in the Carper administration with the introduction of slot machines to Delaware's racetracks. And a roaring stock market meant millions more in revenue from new Delaware corporations.\n\nDuring his first year with Carper, in 1994, Delaware state spending rose 11.5 percent. \"I've told members of my Cabinet that we're not going to have this kind of spending growth in the future,\" Carper told reporters after midnight on July 1, 1994, after lawmakers passed the budget in Dover.\n\nEarly look: Delaware's 2016 political races\n\nBig challenges await next governor\n\nDelaware financial records show spending grew on average 8.9 percent through the second half of the 1990s under Carper, with Carney helping lead the charge. As finance secretary, Carney gained favor in the General Assembly by brokering budget deals that included dramatic tax cuts paired with increases in spending.\n\nIn 1999, lawmakers and the Carper administration enacted sweeping personal income tax cuts, gave tax breaks to seniors and raised spending 18 percent over two years, directing millions more to public education, Delaware's colleges and universities, prisons and the state bureaucracy.\n\nPredictably, the largesse won Carney friends on both sides of the political aisle in Dover. \"He was a good negotiating partner and certainly a man who comes ready to work,\" said Wayne Smith, the former Republican majority leader of the Delaware House of Representatives who negotiated budget deals with Carney. \"He tends to be moderate in his views, which I think makes him more of a centrist. That's what you want in a governor.\"\n\nSmith noted that, financially, the times have changed. Lawmakers negotiated past 4 a.m. on July 1 to balance this year's budget, tapping more than $30 million in one-time financial settlement money to cover just 2.6 percent higher operational spending.\n\n\"The tenor of the times could not be more different,\" Smith said. \"Back then we had more money than we knew what to do with.\"\n\nCarney would not agree to an interview, saying he remains focused on his work in Washington and is not ready to discuss his plans for the governor's office or his approach to problems in Dover. \"The congressman is focused on his work in Washington on behalf of the people who elected him,\" said Jessica Borcky, a spokeswoman for the Carney campaign. \"There will be plenty of time in the future to talk about the governor's race.\"\n\nCarney had not lost his bug for big spending by his second term in the lieutenant governor's office. During his last bid for governor, Carney proposed a universal health care program, funded with extensive Delaware taxpayer subsidies, but failed to identify a detailed price tag.\n\nHis plan included a \"major expansion\" of Medicaid, additional state insurance assistance for low-to-moderate-income families, and, to help foot the bill, higher taxes on cigarettes and businesses that failed to offer insurance to their employees. Delaware families of four making up to $103,250 might have qualified for new assistance.\n\nWith the passage of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, in 2010, the federal government made similar changes, including a Medicaid expansion paid for primarily at the federal level. \"I would hope that after a few years, we would be closer if not fully transitioned to universal health care for everyone,\" Carney said in rolling out his plan in October 2007.\n\nElecting Democrats they know\n\nKey Carney allies insist he is ready for the job and is uniquely qualified to negotiate deals in Legislative Hall.\n\n\"The hardest job in the government is being governor. He's coming back to accept that responsibility. He could have taken that train for the next 20 years,\" said Robert Gillian, the former Democratic House speaker who worked with Carney in the Legislature. \"He understands finances. He knows how to put a budget together, and he knows how to work with people. All those things are going to help him.\"\n\nCarper said Carney was an important member of his administration in the 1990s. He said Carney built relationships in Dover and was critical in negotiating a 1995 deal that secured the purchase of the Port of Wilmington, a move that had been panned by labor leaders in the city.\n\n“People in Delaware are fortunate that a person with his abilities and his integrity is willing to make this run. I respect him greatly,” Carper said in an interview.\n\nOn balance, Carney's political experience looks like an advantage. Delawareans already have a propensity to not only elect Democrats, but Democrats they know.\n\nFormer Delaware Gov. Ruth Ann Minner, who served in Delaware’s top office from 2001 to 2009, had been lieutenant governor during Carper’s eight years as governor in the 1990s. Delaware Attorney General Matt Denn was a lawyer for Minner, before winning two terms as lieutenant governor and securing the attorney general's post last November.\n\nIt is telling that Markell was considered an insurgent, outsider candidate in 2008, even after he served for a decade as Delaware's elected state treasurer.\n\n“It’s a little bit depressing for folks who might be on the outside and what we would call first-generation candidates,” Hoff said. “How do you get to the threshold of name recognition? Or come up with donors who can put you in the big leagues for funding of a serious campaign?”\n\nIt's a question that could play out in the 2016 race to replace Carney in Congress. Delaware Sen. Bryan Townsend, a Newark Democrat and corporate lawyer in Wilmington, has rallied the support of younger Democrats, but has less institutional backing than Short and Rochester, both of whom worked for Carper's gubernatorial administration.\n\nTownsend wears his independence as a badge of honor.\n\n\"People have reached out to me and said I'm very glad I'm not the next man up on someone's bench. People do want a fresh and independent approach to things,\" Townsend said.\n\nOn the Republican side, the situation is even more difficult for first-time candidates without deep political roots here like those propelling Carney's campaign. When Ken Simpler won the 2014 state treasurer's race, he became the first non-incumbent to win statewide office in two decades.\n\n“It has always struck me that it’s not necessarily beneficial to have a group of people who have not ever worked outside of government, running government,” Simpler said recently. “I think I bring some ideas different to the table because I didn’t grow up around the same water cooler.”\n\nContact Jonathan Starkey at (302) 983-6756, on Twitter @jwstarkey or at jstarkey@delawareonline.com.\n\nJohn Carney rakes in $200K at Hotel du Pont fundraiser\n\nFrom staff assistant to gubernatorial candidate\n\nCongressman John Carney, 59, of Wilmington, has risen through the ranks of political positions and is now running for Delaware governor.\n\n1986-1989: Staff assistant, Office of U.S. Sen.

His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were injured in the crash but survived. In 2015, Biden lost Beau to brain cancer and has made it a major political goal to champion cancer research.\n\nHe remarried in 1977, tying the knot with now-First Lady Jill Biden. The two share a daughter, Ashley, and a large clan of grandchildren.\n\nBiden's son Hunter has been the subject of scandal in recent years and has written about his struggles with drug addiction. The GOP-led House has seized on Hunter's business dealings, hosting hearings to investigate his finances and the potential influence he has on his father.\n\nPrevious political experience: Joe Biden is a veteran of the Senate. First elected in 1972, he served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before being elected as vice president on the Obama ticket in 2008.\n\nAfter serving two terms as vice president, Biden took a brief hiatus from government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020.\n\nHis views: Biden's campaign is focused on the \"battle for the soul of America,\" doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago.

His national profile grew during the pandemic when he spoke out publicly against mask mandates and pushed to keep many Florida businesses and schools open. Since then, he has captured national attention with controversial legislative measures on education and immigration.\n\nWhile in law school, DeSantis joined the U.S. Navy as a JAG officer, later deploying to Iraq for active duty. Prior to his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018.\n\nHe is widely viewed as Trump’s biggest threat in the Republican primary. Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to the former president.\n\nHis views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida. He is in favor of \"defending parental rights and eliminating CRT,\" and is anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment.\n\nMore on DeSantis' 2024 Presidential Candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: Elder has no children and has been married once. The couple divorced after two years and Elder was engaged again to Alexandra Datig from 2013 to 2015.

Though he lost, Elder received the highest number of votes of any candidate besides Newsom.\n\nElder announced his candidacy on Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" tweeting afterward \"America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable. We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there. That’s why I’m running for President.\"\n\nHis views: Elder backs school choice, including vouchers and charter schools.

She won reelection in 2014 and has bragged that she has \"never lost a race.\"\n\nIn 2016, former President Trump nominated Haley to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a position she held for a year before unexpectedly stepping down in 2018. Haley has played up her role as a female candidate in what is expected to be a largely male primary field. \"May the best woman win,” she quipped in an interview with Fox News.\n\nHer views: Haley is anti-abortion and pro-Israel. She supports cracking down on illegal immigration and \"getting tough\" on China and Russia.

He was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to serve Arkansas' 3rd district in 1997; he served until 2001 when he was appointed DEA administrator and later undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security for the George W. Bush administration.\n\nWhile in the House, Hutchinson served as impeachment manager in the trial of former president (and fellow Arkansas native) Bill Clinton. After leaving Washington he was elected 46th Governor of Arkansas. He served for two terms, from 2015 to 2023.\n\nHis views: He supports lower taxes, a strong national defense, and opposes abortion.

In 2022, he threw his hat in the ring for the GOP nomination for Michigan governor before being disqualified because of invalid signatures.\n\nHis views: Johnson told a group of Iowa voters in July that he was \"pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, anti-woke and anti-China,\" − and \"if you don't like it, well, tough.\" His campaign's signature \"2 cents\" proposes cutting 2 cents off every dollar of federal discretionary spending.\n\nMore on Johnson's 2024 Presidential Candidacy\n\nLatest Perry Johnson news: Explore\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 63\n\nFamily: Pence wed wife Karen in 1985 and the two share three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.\n\nPrevious political experience: Pence entered politics in 2000 when he won his local congressional seat. He went on to serve six terms in the House of Representatives before being sworn in as governor of Indiana in 2013.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump chose Pence as his running mate, and he served one term as Vice President. The role thrust him into a precarious situation in 2021 when Trump sought to pressure him to throw out some of Biden's electoral votes to overturn the election.\n\nPence ultimately defied Trump and certified the results, infuriating MAGA voters and Trump himself. His candidacy will likely involve a difficult tightrope walk as he attempts to distance himself from the former president without alienating the base.\n\nHis views: Pence is a vocal opponent of abortion, and of what he sees as the nation's long-term debt problem. He favors cuts in government spending and lower taxes, and while he often touts his time as vice president and speaks well of the policies that came out of the Trump White House, he has begun to distance himself from his former running mate in terms of tone. He has also criticized Trump's actions during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore on Pence's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 37\n\nFamily: Ramaswamy married Apoorva Tewari, a throat surgeon and assistant professor at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in 2015. The pair have two sons together.\n\nPrevious political experience: Ramaswamy is framing himself as an outsider, an entrepreneur-turned-political-hopeful who will give the establishment a run for its money.\n\nHe is a former biotech investor who founded pharmaceutical research company Roivant Sciences in 2014. Ramaswamy left the company in 2020 amid clashes with colleagues over how to respond to the murder of George Floyd and the public outcry that followed. He now heads up Strive Asset Management.\n\nHe is the author of three books, including \"Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam,\" which explores how American politics and capitalism have become increasingly intertwined.\n\nHis views: He has peddled ideas such as ending affirmative action and eliminating the Department of Education.

He was raised by a single mother in North Charleston and has one brother.\n\nPrevious political experience: Scott first entered politics in 1995 during a special election for City Council in Charleston. His profile grew nationally when he suggested posting the 10 Commandments outside the council building, a proposal that was denied.\n\nScott served for two years in the state legislature before being elected in 2010 to the House of Representatives for South Carolina's 1st district. He served one term before being appointed to the Senate by then-governor Nikki Haley and becoming the first Black U.S. senator from the state.\n\nScott is pitching himself as a more hopeful alternative to Trump, drawing on Reagan-era ideals and centering a tone of optimism.\n\nHis views: Scott joined the Senate in 2013. He’s anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment. He says on his website that his “signature legislation,” Opportunity Zones, put $75 billion into “distressed communities” across the country.\n\nMore on Scott's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 76\n\nFamily: Trump is the son of real estate magnate Fred Trump. Born and bred in New York, he first made his name developing skyscrapers and casinos.\n\nTrump first married in 1977, wedding Czech-born model Ivana. The two were married for 13 years and share three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric. In 1993 Trump married actress and model Marla Maples. The two had one daughter: Tiffany. Following his divorce from Maples, Trump tied the knot for a final time with model Melania, who is mother to his youngest child, Barron.\n\nTrump's family was uncharacteristically involved in his presidency. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner played prominent roles in the administration, and both Don Jr. and Eric were often cited as close advisors.\n\nPrevious political experience: When Trump entered the race in 2016, he branded himself as a political outsider, a businessman separate from the establishment, ready to \"drain the swamp.\"\n\nPrior to 2016, he dabbled in politics, often sounding off on controversial issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on Barack Obama's citizenship and the guiltiness of the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump shocked pollsters by securing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. He served a full four-year term and was defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.\n\nHis views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported “political persecution” by Democrats. He supports securing America’s borders, “reclaiming free speech,” and “dismantling the Deep State,” according to his campaign website. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.\n\nMore on Trump's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThird-party 2024 presidential candidates\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nAge: 69\n\nFamily: Kennedy bears a powerful last name in Democratic politics.

He wed current wife Cheryl Hines in 2014. Hines is a television star best known for her role on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"\n\nPrevious political experience: Kennedy is an environmental lawyer known for trumpeting a debunked theory that vaccines can be linked to autism.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy opposed vaccine mandates, calling them an infringement on individual liberty and at times used the Holocaust as a historical comparison. In 2017, former President Trump invited Kennedy to head up a presidential commission on vaccine safety.\n\nHis views: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the \"liberties guaranteed by the Constitution,\" according to his campaign website.\n\nMore on Kennedy's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical Party: Green Party\n\nThough West originally announced his candidacy under the People's Party, he later officially filed as a Green Party candidate.\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: West has been married five times and has two children.

His bid with the People's Party represents the first independent ticket to enter the race thus far.\n\nHis views: West is a proponent of Medicare for All, and removing oil and gas subsidies as well as drilling on public lands. Long a vocal opponent of militarism, West's campaign website lists \"end the wars\" as a key priority which would include disbanding NATO and banning nuclear weapons across the globe.\n\nMore on West's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThese presidential candidates have ended their 2024 campaigns\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 45\n\nFamily: Suarez is the son of another prominent Florida politician: Xavier L.

Prior to that he was Miami City commissioner and served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors from 2022 to 2023.\n\nViews: Suarez has said he did not support Trump in either 2016 or 2020, instead using his ballot to write in the names of Florida Sen.

Ten are Republicans, three are Independents, and 20 are Democrats.\n\nThe upper chamber, which is now controlled narrowly by Democrats, could flip red if the GOP performs well next November. The map is considered to favor Republicans slightly this election cycle, though electoral predictions will continue to evolve, and surprises on the campaign trail are always possible.\n\nCome decision day 2024, these are the states that will see contests for senator, and who currently represents them.\n\nWhich senators are up for reelection in 2024?\n\nArizona\n\nKyrsten Sinema\n\nParty: Independent\n\nSinema, once a Democrat, is known for her eccentric fashion choices and her centrist views, which have regularly held up the Democratic policy agenda. Sinema, who left the Democratic Party in December 2022, citing concerns over \"rigid partisanship,\" will be challenged from the left by current Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDianne Feinstein\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nFeinstein is a veteran of the Senate whose age has come into play as a prominent political concern. Earlier this year she was absent from the chamber for over two months, recovering from a case of shingles. Her absence brought important committee votes to a standstill and led some to call for her resignation.\n\nShe will not seek another term, and the race for her seat is expected to be highly competitive with heavy hitters from the Democratic Party, such as Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee, Adam Schiff and Katie Porter vying for her spot.\n\nConnecticut\n\nChris Murphy\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nMurphy has served as the senator from Connecticut since 2013 and is expected to cruise to re-election in 2024 in predominantly blue Connecticut. During his time in the chamber, he has made gun control a major issue, often referencing the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in his home state.\n\nDelaware\n\nTom Carper\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCarper, who originally won his seat in 2000, will not seek another term. In his retirement announcement, Carper endorsed Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester to be his successor. Blunt Rochester formally announced her candidacy in June.\n\nFlorida\n\nRick Scott\n\nParty: Republican\n\nScott has been a senator since 2019, and he served as state governor before his time in the upper chamber. Scott is a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and was tasked as chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee with securing a victory for the party in the midterms.\n\nHawaii\n\nMazie Hirono\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nHirono was the first Asian American woman to be elected a U.S. senator. She first won her seat in 2012 and has spent much of her tenure in the chamber working on legislation addressing immigration, the environment and veterans affairs.\n\nIndiana\n\nMike Braun\n\nParty: Republican\n\nBraun, who won his Senate seat in 2018, is opting to run for governor in his state rather than seek a second term. Braun is not the only Republican seeking the governorship. Among others, he will have to run against Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch. The race to replace Braun is expected to become crowded, with plenty of rising GOP stars hoping to toss their hat in the ring.\n\nMaine\n\nAngus King\n\nParty: Independent\n\nKing has not yet announced his 2024 reelection bid but appears to be gearing up for another run. One of just three independents in the Senate, he has held the seat since 2013.\n\nMaryland\n\nBen Cardin\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCardin, who has been in office since 2007, announced in May he would not seek re-election. Since the announcement, a slew of candidates have indicated they plan to run in the Democratic primary in Maryland, including Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, U.S. Rep. David Trone and Montgomery County Councilmember Will Jawando.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nOne-time presidential hopeful and Senate veteran Elizabeth Warren is running to keep her seat in 2024. She has served as senator for ten years and is unlikely to face a strong primary challenger.\n\nMichigan\n\nDebbie Stabenow\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nStabenow, who has been in the Senate since 2001, announced plans to retire in early January, opening up a seat in a critical battleground state. In the Democratic primary to replace her, Rep. Elissa Slotkin is widely considered the frontrunner, though former state Rep. Leslie Love and businessman Nasser Beydoun have also declared candidacies. On the Republican side, businessman Michael Hoover and State Board of Education member Nikki Snyder have announced plans to run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nKlobuchar, who rose to national fame during her 2020 bid for the presidency, has been a Minnesota senator since 2007 and is the first woman to be elected by the state to the Senate.\n\nMississippi\n\nRoger Wicker\n\nParty: Republican\n\nWicker has been the state's senator since 2007 and will run again in 2024. He serves as the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nMissouri\n\nJosh Hawley\n\nParty: Republican\n\nFamous in part for holding up a fist in support of rioters outside the capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Hawley forms part of a growing conservative flank of the GOP. He will run for re-election in 2024 and be challenged on the left by both St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell and Maine Corps veteran Lucas Kunce.\n\nMontana\n\nJon Tester\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nA Democrat in a deeply red state, Tester has held his Senate seat since 2007. He is expected to face a tough challenge from the right in 2024 as Republicans battle to regain a majority in the U.S. Senate. Among the names being floated as potential challengers are U.S. Rep. Matthew M. Rosendale, who lost to Tester in 2018, and Tim Sheehy, a businessman and veteran.\n\nNebraska\n\nDeb Fischer\n\nParty: Republican\n\nFischer has represented Nebraska in the Senate since the 2012 midterms and has already announced her plans to seek reelection. The move makes it less likely for another Republican to throw their hat in the ring, though some speculated Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts was weighing a run.\n\nNevada\n\nJacky Rosen\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nRosen, who has already announced her reelection bid for 2024, has held her seat since 2019. Nevada is a fiercely divided state and forms part of a challenging electoral map for Democrats. Though no Republicans have yet announced their candidacy, Rosen is expected to have to defend her seat from a strong challenger.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRobert Menendez\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nMenendez has held his Senate seat since 2006 and intends to run again but is facing, along with his wife, a broad federal investigation centered in part on undisclosed gifts the senator received, the Washington Post reported.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMartin Heinrich\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nHeinrich, who has held his seat since 2013, will run again in 2024. He launched his campaign for a third term with a video touching on gun safety and the importance of a transition to clean energy. Republicans have not yet announced a challenger.\n\nNew York\n\nKirsten Gillibrand\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nGillibrand has become a mainstay of New York politics, holding her Senate seat since 2009. This primary season she will face a challenge from Army veteran William Schweitzer, who once worked in Sen. Chuck Schumer’s Rochester district office and served as deputy press secretary during ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s 2018 reelection campaign. Though speculation swirled over whether Gillibrand would face more challenges from up-and-coming New York lawmakers, no other candidates have yet been announced.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nKevin Cramer\n\nParty: Republican\n\nCramer, who won his seat in 2018, has not yet announced plans to seek reelection. Cramer was a close ally of Trump during the former president's term in office, but has since voiced support for a possible replacement on the 2024 GOP ticket.\n\nOhio\n\nSherrod Brown\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nBrown is a prominent target for Republicans in 2024. He occupies a swing state seat they see as a possible pick-up in their quest to regain control of the chamber. An ad blitz has already begun in the state as GOP challengers attempt to oust Brown, who first won the election in 2006. Republican state Sen. Matt Dolan has already announced a run along with businessman Bernie Moreno, and GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose is also rumored to be considering a run.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBob Casey\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCasey was first elected in 2006. Though he represents a swing state identified by Republicans as an ideal win in 2024, he is considered a tough candidate to beat. The son of former Gov. Robert Casey, Sr. he is widely popular in the state, especially with swaths of voters other Democrats have begun to struggle with attracting. The GOP is expected to run former business executive David McCormick, though he has not yet announced.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSheldon Whitehouse\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nWhitehouse, who has been in the Senate for a little under a decade, is running for a fourth term. He will face a challenge on the right from Raymond McKay, a veteran and former president of the Rhode Island Republican Assembly.\n\nTennessee\n\nMarsha Blackburn\n\nParty: Republican\n\nElected in 2018, Blackburn has become a prominent voice among conservatives, particularly on culture war issues. She has announced plans to seek reelection, but will face a prominent challenge on the left.\n\nState Rep. Gloria Johnson, who entered the national spotlight when she was nearly expelled from the state legislature for holding a protest on the House floor against gun violence, will run. Two of her colleagues, Democratic Reps. Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin Pearson of Memphis were briefly expelled for the same action. Joining her in the primary is Marquita Bradshaw, an activist for environmental justice who mounted an unsuccessful bid for Senate in 2020.\n\nNashville attorney Joanne Sowell, another Democrat, has already filed her candidacy with the FEC.\n\nTexas\n\nTed Cruz\n\nParty: Republican\n\nCruz, a political firebrand for his party and a two-time presidential candidate, successfully battled off a challenge from Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke in 2018. For 2024, he may have to do the same. Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, and state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, are both running for the with hopes of unseating Cruz.\n\nUtah\n\nMitt Romney\n\nParty: Republican\n\nOne-time presidential nominee for the GOP, Romney has come to occupy a minority in recent years, treading a more centrist, anti-Trump line. He has held his Senate seat since 2019, serving before that as Governor of Massachusetts.\n\nVermont\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nParty: Independent\n\nSanders, a famously outspoken member of the Senate's left flank, has been in office since 2007. He is one of the chamber's few independents but often votes on a party line with Democrats. Sanders, who famously energized a grass-roots movement during his 2016 and 2020 presidential runs, has ruled out a 2024 bid, saying instead he would endorse Biden.\n\nVirginia\n\nTim Kaine\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nKaine, who was the vice presidential candidate on Hillary Clinton's ticket in 2016, has represented Virginia in the Senate since 2013. For Democrats who face a tough electoral map in 2024, his race is a must-win. Though Kaine is a veteran of Virginia politics, and the state tends to lean blue, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's win in 2021 proved a red tilt is not far off.\n\nEddie Garcia, a military veteran, has already announced he will seek the GOP nomination in the Senate race.\n\nWashington\n\nMaria Cantwell\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCantwell has been in the Senate for over two decades, first winning election in 2000. Cantwell has yet to announce plans to seek re-election but is expected to. No GOP candidates have thrown their hats in the ring so far.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nJoe Manchin\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nManchin, a notoriously centrist vote on the Democratic side, has not yet announced a 2024 re-election bid. Rumors have swirled that the West Virginia political titan is weighing a possible third-party run for president. Potential presidential bid aside, Manchin is one of his party's most vulnerable incumbents.\n\nThe GOP primary in West Virginia is already shaping up with Gov. Jim Justice, a former Democrat who swapped parties in 2017, jumping in the race on the establishment side, and Rep. Alex Mooney, who belongs to the hyper-conservative House Freedom Caucus running, to his right.\n\nWisconsin\n\nTammy Baldwin\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nBaldwin, who announced plans for re-election in April, is a prime target for the GOP this election cycle. Though no Republican has yet formally announced their candidacy, behind the scenes plenty of names are being floated.\n\n\"I don’t think anybody’s fairly concerned about the timing yet,\" Mark Jefferson, executive director of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, part of the USA TODAY network \"And we have some strong candidates looking at it.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJohn Barrasso\n\nParty: Republican\n\nBarrasso has represented Wyoming in the Senate since 2007.

Scott Walker did not respond to The News Journal in time to have his photos taken or participate in a video interview.\n\nScott Walker believes his primary role in the U.S. House of Representatives would be to further prosecution of discrimination cases in the First State.\n\nWalker in March joined a crowded field of Democrats seeking to replace exiting Rep. John Carney, marking his first bid for public office. Local experts and politicians do not consider him serious contender for Washington, D.C., but Walker says he's going to win once the race gets going in earnest and Delawareans produce \"a burst of energy\" that will overcome his late start, meager spending, absent donations and limited name recognition.\n\n\"I'm not going to Congress to do what the last guy did, just vote along party lines and there's no change. I'm not going to do that. I'm not like my opponents. I'm going to make changes. I'm going to use the power of the seat to make changes,\" Walker said. \"I would just like to see the inequality erased in this country. We've got a very serious problem. This is what's wrong with our economy: We don't have a full participation rate in our economy.\"\n\nThe primary race will be held in September and the general election in November.\n\nWalker, 65, is a Milford-born businessman. For 30 years he owned and operated a horticultural company that installed and maintained plants for commercial clients. But over the past 10 years he's gotten into the rental property game, and through his renters he said he's discovered institutionalized and secretly-protected discrimination that affects Delaware's minority and disabled communities.\n\n\"It's against African Americans, it's against women, it's against the disabled, it's against gays, it's against Muslims and ex-offenders,\" he said.\n\nWalker, who is not a lawyer, said he's spent the last decade teaching himself discrimination law to help fight injustice — \"I don't know of anybody else in Delaware who knows as much as I do about discrimination law.\" He says he's being financially damaged by discriminatory practices of city and county housing officials which enact \"de facto segregation.\"\n\nHe's won no cases \"yet,\" but recently settled one with the city of New Castle. The cases concern code violations which Walker said are targeted at his properties simply because of who lives in them.\n\nWalker owns nine properties in Wilmington and New Castle County, which he rents almost exclusively to the disabled. He packs those homes to the brim, something he claims he has the right to do but which has caused him trouble in dealing with local governments. Tenant Mike Roberts supports his landlord's bid for Congress.\n\n\"I believe there is discrimination against the lower class,\" Roberts said. \"Whether he wins or not, he's bringing that attention to the media. What I believe, and what I've seen so far, is he does want to get into Congress and change northern Delaware.\"\n\nWalker claims Delaware's \"very pervasive\" discrimination problem can be laid at the feet of a \"loose cadre\" of political insiders spanning the state legislature, the criminal justice system and judges. Pressed to point to individuals, elected or otherwise, Walker demurred except to finger his political rivals.\n\n\"I would consider naming them at some time, but now,\" Walker said. \"They're silent, and my opponents are silent.\"\n\nThose opponents for the Democratic nomination for the House seat — State Sen. Bryan Townsend, former state Secretary of Labor Lisa Blunt Rochester, U.S. Marine Corps veteran Sean Barney and accountant Mike Miller — all have spoken out, voted against or otherwise challenged discrimination in Delaware.\n\nMORE ON THE CONGRESSIONAL RACE –\n\nSTORY: Running for congress, Rochester draws on experience\n\nSTORY: Sean Barney hangs congressional run on military service\n\nSTORY: Rose Izzo is one of few taking her House bid seriously\n\nSTORY: Mike Miller: It's time for a change in leadership\n\nSTORY: Hans Reigle hopes to best Democrats for Congress\n\nSTORY:Bryan Townsend has claim to frontrunner status in congressional race\n\nThe Republicans in the race — former Wyoming mayor Hans Reigle and perennial candidate Rose Izzo — similarly have spoken against exclusions or discrimination in party, state and federal politics.\n\nWalker said he's self-funding his campaign, and he has no record of campaign contributions with the U.S. Federal Election Commission. He said he's spent about $5,000 so far — the $3,500 filing fee to get on the Democratic ticket and money for scattered roadside signage baring his name.\n\n\"I like to go to the most busy intersections in the state and hold my signs and wave at people. I like to talk with people. I like to ride through the most distressed areas of the state and talk to those people,\" Walker said. \"It's not how much money you've got. It's your message.\"\n\nDelaware State University professor of political science Sam Hoff gave Walker some credit for mounting a campaign, but said the unfunded effort isn't likely to take the former florist anywhere near Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I hope that his favorite flowers are daisies, because I think his campaign will be pushing them up,\" Hoff said. \"He's looking for the populist momentum we saw Donald Trump get, but without any of the infrastructure or name recognition.\"\n\nGoing to Washington\n\nAnything beyond fighting discrimination is secondary to Walker.\n\n\"Constituent services is going to be my strong point. Now, I'm very familiar with all the issues out there, choice versus abortion, climate change and all the other issues that are being touted out there. My main goal is to use my position to enable me to run a very powerful constituent services operation. When somebody calls me from Delaware and complains about discrimination, I want them to know somebody on the other end of the line — which is me — knows what to do,\" Walker said.\n\nWalker said there's nothing more important a Delaware member of the U.S. House could do.\n\nInequality is the root cause of economic disparity, Walker said, and it leaves people on the sidelines and out of the workforce. As an example of incentivizing people to work, Walker said Congress should write a law that \"enables disability recipients to make more money.\"\n\n\"Delaware gets a lot of money from the U.S. government, and we're going to take a look at that money coming in from the U.S. government to make sure it's wisely spent. Grants, if there are jurisdictions and governments and agencies who are using that money to discriminate and harm protected minorities, I'm going to see that it ends,\" Walker said. \"I'll trade my vote in Congress. I'll do whatever I've got to do to end it.\"\n\nBeyond facilitating claimants of discrimination in Delaware, Walker didn't have much else to say about what his role in Congress would be: \"That would mainly cover it.\"\n\nEven some of a congressman's most important obligations — such as making declarations of war — Walker couched in terms of how discrimination affects the economy.\n\n\"In order for us to win a war against an enemy that's trying to destroy us, for example North Korea, who are working day and night to build a missile they can guarantee will come in here and wipe out one of our cities, in order for us to fight that war and win, we've got to be strong economically. We've got to have the money and resources available for defense,\" Walker said.\n\nWhen asked about specific policies, Walker said he supports the country's current immigration system, \"correctly\" resettling Syrian refugees, an \"outright ban\" on the sale of guns, more environmental regulations, federal education standards and including transgender individuals in federal discrimination law.\n\nWalker the landlord\n\nIn 2010, Walker created the Disabled Disadvantaged Delawareans Foundation to provide affordable housing for Wilmington's disabled residents. The nonprofit corporation does not solicit or accept donations, Walker said, because he doesn't want to be controlled by donors.\n\nThe homes are the subject of his regular lawsuits against local government – one of which was dismissed with prejudice, one against the city of New Castle which recently was settled and another four he lost but which he's appealing.\n\nIn his 2014 lawsuit against the city of New Castle, Walker alleges an inspector violated his 14th Amendment rights to equal protection because he was cited for numerous code violations and prosecutions when other similar homes nearby weren't.\n\nWalked claimed the home was \"targeted in a campaign of aggressive code enforcement and prosecutions because he housed unrelated disabled persons and other minorities together,\" according to the lawsuit, and that the property code gave New Castle \"leeway with which to discriminate against minorities’ housing rights\" and served as a de facto way to seize the house.\n\nAll of those accusations, the defendants noted in the suit, post-date Walker's loss of the property in a sheriff's sale and therefore give him no standing, but also argues his constitutional claims would fail independently. That case was dismissed in Superior Court, remanded back by the Delaware Supreme Court and then settled.\n\nWalker says Delaware law concerning the way he does business is archaic and other states have ruled in favor of his kind of tenancy. He claims to know more about this \"narrow type\" of case than the judges who oversaw them.\n\nThey're group homes, Walker said, though he calls them \"family-style housing,\" and often have more unrelated people living in them than there are bedrooms. He said the homes \"quality is commensurate with the price,\" and he claims they're safe for the residents, many of whom are mentally disabled.\n\nHe said he's often been called a slum lord, but \"that's a personal slur, and it comes with the territory.\" He dismisses that claim.\n\nA tenant of \"probably the nicest house he rents,\" Roberts said he appreciates his landlord's efforts to house people with just a shoestring budget. He admits many of the homes are substandard, but says the rent is appropriately cheap.\n\n\"He's OK. I'm not going to say he's the best guy I've ever rented from, but you definitely could do worse,\" Roberts said. \"There's a tendency to put a lot of people in the houses. Basically what he does is he rents rooms. Sometimes I think he overfills them a little bit. But he keeps the lights on.\"\n\nBut Roberts can't work because of a cancer which took away the ability to live a normal life, and he said his disability payments are just enough to keep him eating. His friend Walker, Roberts said, cares about people like him when others do not.\n\nU.S. House race\n\nName: Russell \"Scott\" Walker\n\nAffiliation: switched to Democrat after years as an Independant to run for Congress\n\nBorn: Milford\n\nAge: 65\n\nEducation: Brandywine High School (1969); University of Delaware (1975)\n\nPrior service: Walker never before has served in or run for public office.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/politics/key-dates-2022-midterm-election/index.html", "title": "Key dates for the 2022 midterm election | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nVoting ends in the first primaries for the 2022 midterm elections in a matter of days.\n\nTexas will kick things off on March 1, and the primary process will wrap up more than six months later on September 13 in Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Those contests will tee up Election Day on November 8, when control of the House and Senate will be up for grabs as well as several high-profile gubernatorial races in key battleground states.\n\nThe outcome of November’s elections will serve as a referendum on President Joe Biden’s first two years in office and set the table for the 2024 presidential campaign. Biden and congressional Democrats have scored some legislative victories and are poised to confirm a history-making pick to the Supreme Court in Ketanji Brown Jackson. Yet economic anxiety punctuated by inflation concerns combined with exhaustion over the coronavirus pandemic has tilted the political environment in favor of Republicans, who also have electoral history on their side. There is also a unique dynamic to these midterms, with former President Donald Trump eyeing a potential return to the White House and looking to lay the groundwork by endorsing candidates in GOP primaries who have embraced his lies about the 2020 election results.\n\nThe majority in the Senate, currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tiebreaker, is expected to come down to a handful of competitive races. There are four Democratic incumbents running in battleground states Biden won in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire. Republicans have incumbents seeking reelection in Wisconsin and Florida, and they’re defending three open seats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio. In total, 34 Senate seats will be decided in November.\n\nIn the House, Republicans need a net gain of five seats to win control of the chamber. More than 40 members, mostly Democrats, have announced they are leaving Congress. Some of those decisions were driven by redistricting, the once-a-decade process of redrawing congressional and state legislative boundaries. In states with partisan control of the process, both parties have tried to draw new maps to their advantage: to pick up more seats, shore up incumbents or reduce the number of competitive districts.\n\nThere are currently 27 Republican governors and 23 Democratic governors – with 36 seats up for grabs this November – including several in battleground states that could play a significant role in deciding the outcome of the 2024 election. Beyond elections for governor, state races for secretary of state and attorney general will receive unprecedented attention, as the battle over how elections are handled intensifies in the aftermath of the 2020 campaign.\n\nHere are the key dates and contests to watch as the 2022 primary process plays out:\n\nMarch 1: Texas primaries\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott Lynda M. Gonzalez/Pool//Getty Images\n\nThe Lone Star State is home to a few intriguing GOP statewide primaries and a House Democratic primary that highlights the ideological divide within the party.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott is seeking reelection to a third term, which could set the stage for a potential 2024 bid. First, he must get through a GOP primary that includes challenges from former (Florida) Rep. Allen West and businessman and ex-state Sen. Don Huffines.\n\nThere is also a contested Republican primary in the race for state attorney general, with incumbent Ken Paxton being challenged by state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, US Rep. Louie Gohmert and former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman. Paxton’s rivals have taken aim at his legal problems, but Trump has thrown his support behind the incumbent, who led a failed effort to challenge the 2020 election results in four battleground states at the US Supreme Court.\n\nIn south Texas, there is a rematch of a 2020 Democratic primary in the 28th Congressional District between centrist Rep. Henry Cuellar and immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, who has received the endorsement of progressive leaders, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The FBI searched Cuellar’s home and campaign office in January, but the nine-term congressman released a video a week later vowing to seek reelection despite the “ongoing investigation.”\n\nThe Dallas-area 3rd Congressional District is the site of a battle over how the GOP should handle the 2020 election and the events of January 6, 2021. Rep. Van Taylor is a conservative Republican, but he voted to accept the 2020 presidential election results and supported an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. (He opposed the select committee that was eventually created.) He’s now facing several primary challengers who question the results of the election, criticize Taylor’s vote on the commission and downplay the Capitol insurrection. The district also became much more Republican in redistricting, so while the seat shouldn’t be competitive in November, it could be easier for a more right-wing candidate to defeat Taylor in the primary.\n\nApril 5: Special election primary in California’s 22nd Congressional District\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Devin Nunes JIm Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Devin Nunes set off this special primary contest with his resignation from Congress in January to join Trump’s new social media venture. Assuming no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the all-party primary, the top two finishers will face off in June, when California holds its general election primaries, giving the eventual winner about six months to represent this Central Valley seat in Congress. The district will have new boundaries for the election held in November.\n\nMay 3: Indiana and Ohio primaries\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine Paul Vernon/AP\n\nThe Buckeye State has a pair of Republican primary battles that could offer early clues about the GOP electorate heading into the heart of the nominating calendar.\n\nRepublican Gov. Mike DeWine is seeking a second term. His management of the coronavirus pandemic has become the target of fierce criticism from opponent Jim Renacci, a former GOP congressman who has accused DeWine of governing Ohio “like a blue-state liberal.” On the Democratic side, it’s a battle between two former mayors, with Dayton’s Nan Whaley and Cincinnati’s John Cranley squaring off for the nomination.\n\nIn the GOP Senate primary, the crowded contest has at times veered toward political theater as several top contenders – most notably former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance – have sought to burnish their conservative pro-Trump credentials with incendiary rhetoric and inflammatory displays of opposition to public health precautions. Former state GOP chair Jane Timken and businessman Mike Gibbons are also making plays for the Trump base, while state Sen. Matt Dolan is testing the theory that there is still room in the party for a candidate who doesn’t fully embrace the former President.\n\nAfter a history of teasing potential statewide bids only to pass, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan decided to take the plunge (with a helpful shove from redistricting) and launched a bid for US Senate. He faces a primary challenge from consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. While Ohio has been trending red in recent years, Ryan is hoping to follow a similar blue-collar blueprint that has helped Sen. Sherrod Brown win statewide three times, most recently against Renacci in 2018.\n\nMay 10: Nebraska and West Virginia primaries\n\nWest Virginia Rep. David McKinley Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nWest Virginia is poised to hold the country’s first incumbent vs. incumbent primary of the 2022 cycle, featuring GOP Reps. David McKinley and Alex Mooney. The Republicans were drawn into the new 2nd Congressional District after the state lost a House seat following the 2020 census. The matchup will be an early test of Trump’s sway in GOP primaries, with the former President backing Mooney over McKinley, who did not object to counting the Electoral College vote and supported the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Mooney objected to the Pennsylvania electoral count, but not Arizona, and voted against the infrastructure package.\n\nIn Nebraska, outgoing Gov. Pete Ricketts urged Trump to stay out of the GOP primary to replace him, but the former President spurned the request and threw his support behind businessman Charles Herbster last October. Ricketts later endorsed Nebraska University Regent Jim Pillen, setting up a proxy battle between the two GOP leaders who both carried the Cornhusker State by wide margins.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, embattled GOP Rep. Jeff Fortenberry is facing a primary challenge from state Sen. Mike Flood, who has been endorsed by Ricketts and former Gov. Dave Heineman. Fortenberry was indicted last fall for allegedly concealing information and lying to federal authorities investigating illegal campaign contributions. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nMay 17: Idaho, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania primaries\n\nCelebrity doctor Mehmet Oz Brad Barket/Getty Images\n\nThe fight for the GOP Senate nomination in Pennsylvania could be one of the nastiest and most expensive primary contests of the entire 2022 cycle, with hedge fund executive David McCormick and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz trading pointed attacks over their personal ties to foreign countries. Both contenders are pumping massive amounts of their personal wealth into TV ads. The crowded field also includes former US ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands, who, like the top contenders, is relying on her personal wealth, and Jeff Bartos, the party’s 2018 nominee for lieutenant governor. The race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey was upended last November when Trump-backed candidate Sean Parnell ended his campaign amid scrutiny of his turbulent personal life. So far, the former President has held off on throwing his support behind another candidate, a move that could shake up the trajectory of the primary.\n\nDemocrats see the Keystone State as perhaps the party’s best opportunity to flip a Republican-held Senate seat. The competition on the Democratic side features candidates with distinct backgrounds who represent divergent ideological factions within the party. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, an outspoken progressive and strong fundraiser, and Rep. Conor Lamb, a Marine Corps veteran and former federal prosecutor, are seen as the top contenders. Rounding out the field is state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who has won the backing of some progressive groups.\n\nThere is also a wide-open race for governor in Pennsylvania, with Democrat Tom Wolf term-limited. The lone Democratic candidate is state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who was one of the leading officials rebutting false claims about the commonwealth’s 2020 election results. The GOP field includes state Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, former US Rep. Lou Barletta, former US Attorney Bill McSwain, state Sen. Doug Mastriano and businessman Dave White. Trump, and his lies about the election, are expected to be a driving factor in the primary.\n\nIn North Carolina, Trump’s early surprise endorsement of US Rep. Ted Budd failed to clear the GOP Senate primary field, with former Gov. Pat McCrory, former US Rep. Mark Walker and Army veteran Marjorie K. Eastman also in the running to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Walker announced in January he would stay in the Senate race, defying Trump’s effort to get the former congressman to drop his bid and run for a House seat. On the Democratic side, the party has largely cleared the field for former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley.\n\nIdaho is another state home to a GOP civil war, with Gov. Brad Little getting a primary challenge from Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. The two have engaged in a political tug-of-war, with McGeachin on multiple occasions using her powers as acting governor to issue executive orders while Little was out of state, only to have the governor rescind them upon his return. Trump endorsed McGeachin last November, calling her a “a true supporter of MAGA from the very beginning.”\n\nMay 24: Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia primaries; Texas runoffs (if necessary)\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp Megan Varner/Getty Images\n\nThere is perhaps no state on the 2022 map where Trump is seeking to exert his influence on the Republican Party more than Georgia, where he rolled out a “Trump ticket” of candidates, including two who are challenging GOP incumbents the former President attacked after they rejected his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe top target for Trump is Gov. Brian Kemp, whose decision to certify Biden’s narrow win in Georgia unleashed fierce and frequent attacks by the former President. The attacks culminated with Trump’s endorsement of former US Sen. David Perdue after he launched a primary challenge against Kemp. Perdue lost his Senate runoff to Democrat Jon Ossoff in January 2021, which some Republicans blamed, in part, on Trump’s efforts to undermine the state’s election results. Now Perdue is making Trump’s lies about the 2020 election a cornerstone of his bid to defeat Kemp. The winner of the GOP primary will likely face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Kemp by less than 2 percentage points.\n\nWhile the GOP primary for governor is unsettled, Republican Herschel Walker has plenty of running room in the Senate race. The former football star has Trump’s support as he seeks to defeat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who scored a 2-point victory in a Senate special election runoff against Republican Kelly Loeffler last year. Warnock has been a prolific fundraiser, beginning 2022 with nearly $23 million in the bank.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger stood up to Trump’s demands that he “find” the votes to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. Now the question is whether the state’s top election official can withstand a primary challenge from Trump-backed US Rep. Jody Hice, who embraced the former President’s false claims about the election. Among the Democratic contenders are state Rep. Bee Nguyen, who succeeded Abrams in the state legislature, and former Fulton County Commission chair John Eaves.\n\nThe Atlanta area will host the year’s first Democratic member vs. member primary, with Reps. Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bourdeaux running in the newly redrawn 7th Congressional District after the GOP-controlled state legislature turned McBath’s current seat safely red. Both Democrats flipped suburban districts previously held by Republicans – McBath in 2018 and Bourdeaux in 2020.\n\nGeorgia won’t be the only state testing the power of Trump’s endorsement on this primary day. In Alabama, US Rep. Mo Brooks is hoping the former President’s support will help deliver him the GOP Senate nomination. But the conservative firebrand is running against two well-funded opponents: Katie Britt, a former top aide to retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, and Mike Durant, an aerospace executive and former Blackhawk helicopter pilot. Brooks has struggled to take command of the field, prompting frustration from the former President.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey is running for a second full term but is being challenged by several candidates in the GOP primary, including Lindy Blanchard, who served as ambassador to Slovenia in the Trump administration. Blanchard initially launched a bid for the open Senate seat but switched gears to run for governor last December.\n\nIn Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders – a former White House press secretary under Trump and daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee – has a clear path to the Republican nomination as she seeks to succeed GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson. With Trump having carried the Natural State by more than 20 points in 2020, Sanders is poised to follow in her father’s footsteps and become Arkansas’ first female governor.\n\nJune 7: California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota primaries; special election in California’s 22nd Congressional District (if necessary)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nLast September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom became the second governor in US history to defeat a recall. Now the Democrat appears to be coasting toward a second term in office – which could serve as a platform for a national run down the road. There are already signs of a brewing feud between Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a top GOP 2024 prospect.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla, appointed by Newsom to the seat vacated by Harris ahead of her becoming vice president, is running for a full six-year term. At the same time, Padilla must run in a special election for the remaining weeks of the original Harris term.\n\nCalifornia is losing a US House seat for the first time in the state’s history because of slower population growth. The new congressional maps, drawn by an independent commission, have scrambled the Golden State’s political landscape. With the potential for as many as 10 competitive House races this fall, the state’s top-two primary system could be a major factor in shaping the battleground map.\n\nGOP Rep. David Valadao is running in the newly drawn 22nd District in the Central Valley, which became more favorable to Democrats under redistricting. Valadao is the only House Republican running for reelection who voted for to impeach Trump in 2021 for inciting the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and doesn’t have a challenger endorsed by the former President (yet). Among his Democratic challengers is Rudy Salas, a California assemblyman and former member of the Bakersfield City Council.\n\nAnother race to keep an eye on is the new 27th District around Los Angeles, where GOP Rep. Mike Garcia is a top target of Democrats. His challengers include former state assemblywoman Christy Smith, who is running for a third time against Garcia. She lost a special election and general election to him in 2020, with the latter race decided by a margin of just 333 votes. Democrat Quaye Quartey, a retired Navy intelligence officer, is also running.\n\nPrior to serving as Trump’s interior secretary, Ryan Zinke spent about two years representing Montana in the US House. Zinke is now eyeing a return to Capitol Hill after Montana gained a House seat following the 2020 census, though he’s facing scrutiny about his current ties to the state.\n\nJune 14: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina primaries\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one of the most endangered Senate Democrats running this year, looking to carry a state Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020. The top contender in the GOP field is former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the party’s 2018 nominee for governor, who has managed to unite the Trump and Mitch McConnell wings. Still, he is facing a primary challenge from Army veteran Sam Brown, who has demonstrated some fundraising strength.\n\nIn the Silver State’s race for governor, incumbent Democrat Steve Sisolak is seeking a second term, with several Republicans lining up to run against him, including former US Sen. Dean Heller and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo.\n\nThe fate of two Trump targets could be decided this day in South Carolina, where the former President has endorsed primary challengers to GOP Reps. Tom Rice and Nancy Mace. In the 7th Congressional District, Trump has backed state Rep. Russell Fry against Rice, who was one of the 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of Trump’s impeachment last January. Mace, who represents the 1st District, voted to certify the election results (but not for impeachment) and has tried to walk the Trump tightrope, criticizing his actions at times and embracing the former President at others. Trump has thrown his support behind former state Rep. Katie Arrington, who defeated former Rep. Mark Sanford in the 2018 GOP primary for the 1st District, only to lose to Democrat Joe Cunningham in the general election.\n\nIn Maine, a pair of Republicans are attempting political comebacks – with former Gov. Paul LePage and former US Rep. Bruce Poliquin both running for their old jobs. LePage is looking to challenge Democrat Janet Mills, who won the 2018 race to succeed him. Poliquin is eyeing a rematch in the 2nd Congressional District with Jared Golden, the Democrat who defeated him four years ago.\n\nJune 21: DC and Virginia primaries; runoffs in Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia (if necessary)\n\nVirginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nLast November’s victory by Republican Glenn Youngkin in the race for Virginia governor boosted the GOP’s hopes that 2022 would be a strong year for the party in the commonwealth and beyond. This year, the battleground in the Old Dominion will center on two competitive House races featuring a pair of Democrats first elected in the 2018 blue wave – Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria. A handful Republicans have lined up to challenge Spanberger in the new 7th Congressional District, which was redrawn to include more of the Democratic-leaning exurbs in Northern Virginia but no longer includes the congresswoman’s home near Richmond. Luria’s 2nd District, meanwhile, became more favorable to Republicans under redistricting, with state Sen. Jen Kiggans seen as a top contender in the GOP primary.\n\nJune 28: Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma and Utah primaries; runoffs in Mississippi and South Carolina (if necessary)\n\nIllinois Rep. Mary Miller Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nThe Land of Lincoln is the scene of not one but two dual incumbent House primaries after Illinois lost a seat based on the 2020 census.\n\nThe GOP contest in the 15th District will provide another test of Trump’s endorsement strength, with Reps. Mary Miller and Rodney Davis facing off. The former President rebuffed the advice of GOP leaders to remain neutral and threw his support behind Miller, a freshman member who has stirred controversy since arriving in Congress. Davis, now in his fifth term, is an ally of House Republican leadership and poised to become a committee chairman if the GOP wins control of the chamber.\n\nDemocrats have their own incumbent vs. incumbent primary in the 6th District, where Reps. Sean Casten and Marie Newman will compete for the party’s nomination. Casten flipped a GOP-held seat in 2018 while Newman narrowly defeated conservative Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski in a 2020 primary before winning her general election race by double digits.\n\nOn the same day, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul will face off against US Rep. Tom Suozzi and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams in the Democratic primary as Hochul seeks a full term in office. Hochul became the first female governor of the Empire State last August after Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment. Among the candidates on the Republican side are Rep. Lee Zeldin, 2014 GOP gubernatorial nominee Rob Astorino, businessman Harry Wilson and Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWith popular Republican Gov. Larry Hogan unable to run for a third term in Maryland, Democrats are hopeful about their prospects of retaking the governor’s mansion after eight years of Republican rule. That optimism has produced a crowded Democratic field, which includes former US Labor Secretary Tom Perez, state Comptroller Peter Franchot, author and former nonprofit chief Wes Moore and former US Education Secretary John King. Trump has endorsed state Del. Daniel Cox, who is running in the GOP primary against Hogan’s preferred candidate, state Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz.\n\nJuly 26: North Carolina runoffs (if necessary)\n\nThe calendar in July is rather bare, unless any of the North Carolina primary contests in May require a runoff to decide the winner. Candidates only need to top 30% of the vote to avoid that scenario.\n\nAugust 2: Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington primaries\n\nArizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs Ross D. Franklin/AP\n\nTwo states at the center of Trump’s lies about the 2020 election will vote on this day – Arizona and Michigan.\n\nSparked by the former President’s falsehoods, GOP lawmakers in Arizona launched a months-long partisan review of the results in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, which ultimately confirmed Biden’s victory there. That fact has failed to dissuade Republican candidates from embracing Trump’s baseless claims. The former President has endorsed former TV anchor Kari Lake, who is running for governor, and state Rep. Mark Finchem, a candidate for secretary of state, both of whom have cast doubts about the 2020 election results.\n\nCurrent Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is running for governor, putting her defense of the state’s elections at the center of her candidacy. In addition to Lake, the other Republican contenders include former US Rep. Matt Salmon, developer and former Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson and businessman Steve Gaynor.\n\nFinchem is joined in the GOP secretary of state primary by state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who has advocated for so-called election integrity legislation. The Democratic candidates hoping to succeed Hobbs include Adrian Fontes, the former Maricopa County recorder, and Arizona House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding.\n\nTrump has yet to endorse in the Arizona GOP Senate primary, but his impact on the field has been felt in how the leading candidates are positioning themselves to align with the former President’s policies and politics. That list of hopefuls includes state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, businessman Jim Lamon and venture capitalist Blake Masters, who has the backing of tech billionaire Peter Thiel and the anti-tax Club for Growth.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly and his massive campaign war chest await whichever candidate emerges victorious on the Republican side. The former astronaut is running for a full six-year term after defeating appointed Republican Sen. Martha McSally in a 2020 special election.\n\nIn Michigan, Trump has endorsed two statewide candidates who’ve spread election falsehoods – Kristina Karamo for secretary of state and Matthew DePerno for state attorney general. They are seeking to challenge incumbent Democrats Jocelyn Benson and Dana Nessel, who have pushed back on Trump’s efforts to undermine the state’s 2020 election results.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was on Biden’s short list for vice president, is also seeking a second term. Businessman Kevin Rinke and former Detroit police chief James Craig are among a packed field of GOP candidates looking to challenge Whitmer.\n\nThe new congressional map in Michigan has set up an all-incumbent primary battle in the 11th district featuring Democratic Reps. Haley Stevens and Andy Levin. The district’s new lines make it a safer seat for Democrats than the one Stevens flipped in 2018. Levin has deep political roots in the state, with his father, Sander, serving in the US House for more than 30 years and his uncle Carl Levin serving six terms as a US senator.\n\nGOP Rep. Peter Meijer is running for reelection in Michigan’s 3rd Congressional District after voting for impeachment and faces a primary challenge in John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who has the backing of the former President.\n\nTrump has also endorsed state Rep. Steve Carra, who had launched a bid against Rep. Fred Upton, another GOP member who voted to impeach. But Upton has not yet officially announced if he’s running for another term, which would mean having to face off against fellow GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga in the newly drawn 4th District.\n\nTwo House Republicans from Washington who voted for Trump’s impeachment – Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse – will also face GOP primary voters on this day. Both have Trump-backed opponents in their all-party primaries. Retired Army Special Forces officer Joe Kent is challenging Beutler, while failed 2020 gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp is seeking to oust Newhouse. Like in California, the top two finishers in the primary advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nIn Missouri, there is a crowded GOP primary to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Roy Blunt in a state that should favor the party. Some Republicans are concerned that if former Gov. Eric Greitens emerges as the nominee, it could put the seat in play for Democrats, given his scandal-plagued past. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley has endorsed US Rep. Vicky Hartzler in the primary, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, US Rep. Billy Long, state Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Schatz and St. Louis attorney Mark McCloskey also in the mix. On the Democratic side, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce appears to be the leading contender.\n\nAugust 4: Tennessee primaries\n\nFormer State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus Gabriel Aponte/Getty Images South America/Getty Images for Concordia Ameri\n\nTennessee Republicans cracked Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper’s Nashville-based seat in redistricting, diluting the power of the vote in Davidson County, spreading it across three GOP-leaning districts. The move prompted Cooper to announce his retirement. It has also sparked a GOP showdown for the new 5th Congressional District. Trump is backing Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokesperson, while two top allies of the former President – US Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn – are supporting social media influencer Robby Starbuck. Former state House Speaker Beth Harwell is running for the redrawn seat as well.\n\nAugust 9: Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin primaries\n\nWisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican senator seeking reelection in a state Biden carried in 2020. A dozen Democrats have lined up to take on the two-term incumbent, who has evolved from a tea party insurgent during his first run in 2010 to a promoter of Covid-19 and January 6 conspiracies. The leading Democratic challengers appear to be Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski.\n\nThe GOP field to take on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is less crowded, with former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, state Rep. Timothy Ramthun and Kevin Nicholson, who lost in the 2018 Senate Republican primary, among the contenders.\n\nThe last time a Republican candidate won a statewide office in Minnesota was 2006, when former Gov. Tim Pawlenty was narrowly reelected. Several Republicans are running to prevent Democratic Gov. Tim Walz from winning a second term. Misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 election have been key issues in the GOP primary. One leading candidate is Scott Jensen, a former state senator and family doctor, who has voiced vaccine skepticism and opposition to mandates. Another physician, Neil Shah, has suggested he took an unproven drug to treat coronavirus. At a forum last December, none of the five candidates who participated were willing to answer a plain “yes” when asked whether they thought Biden won a “constitutional majority in the Electoral College.”\n\nUltimately, whether Republicans lean toward a candidate like Jensen or Shah or a more mainstream pick like state Sens. Paul Gazelka or Michelle Benson, the primary may well be decided long before August. The state GOP will endorse a candidate at its convention in May and most, if not all, of the other candidates could drop their bids if they don’t earn that nod.\n\nVermont is the only state in the union that’s never sent a woman to Congress. But Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy’s decision to call it quits after almost 50 years in the Senate started a domino effect that could change that. Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, the state’s lone House member, is trying to move across the Capitol to succeed Leahy. That’s set up a Democratic primary in which two of the leading candidates are women. Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Sen. Becca Balint both declared for the seat shortly after Welch made his announcement.\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who leads one of the most Democratic states in the nation, will also be up for reelection (Vermont governors serve two-year terms) but he’s yet to announce his plans.\n\nConnecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, also face voters this year.\n\nAugust 13: Hawaii primaries\n\nHawaii Lt. Gov. Josh Green State of Hawaii\n\nTerm limits prevent Hawaii Gov. David Ige from seeking a third term, and several Democrats have lined up to succeed him. The primary field includes Lt. Gov. Josh Green, a doctor who has been one of the main faces of the state’s pandemic response, former Hawaii first lady Vicky Cayetano and former Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell. US Rep. Kai Kahele has also been mentioned as a potential candidate.\n\nHawaii is one of the most Democratic states in the country, so the winner of the Democratic primary will be heavily favored in November.\n\nAugust 16: Alaska and Wyoming primaries; South Dakota runoffs (if necessary)\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney Oliver Contreras/Pool/Getty Images\n\nTwo of Trump’s top GOP targets in 2022 are Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. The coincidence of both states holding primaries on the same day sets up an epic test of the former President’s sway in the GOP.\n\nThere is arguably no Republican who has drawn Trump’s ire more than Cheney, who voted in favor of impeachment last year and is the vice chair on the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Trump has endorsed Harriet Hageman, a onetime critic, as the candidate to fulfill his goal of ousting Cheney. So has House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And the Republican National Committee took the unprecedented step of censuring the congreswoman. Working in Cheney’s favor are her family’s deep roots in the state and her massive campaign war chest. She also might benefit from the fact that she could win the primary without receiving a majority of the vote, as Hageman has not cleared the field of Cheney challengers despite Trump’s support.\n\nMurkowski is the lone Republican running for reelection this year who voted to convict Trump at his impeachment trial in the Senate. The former President has backed Kelly Tshibaka, who formerly led Alaska’s Department of Administration. But the race in Alaska will be complicated by the state’s new election system, with all the Senate candidates running on a single ballot and the top four finishers, regardless of party, advancing to the general election, which will be decided by ranked-choice voting. Given that, Murkowski is almost certain to advance to the November vote, where she could benefit from the reallocation process. The senator has faced tough reelection campaigns before – winning as a write-in candidate in 2010 after losing the GOP primary to a tea party challenger. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies are firmly behind Murkowski’s bid.\n\nAugust 23: Florida primaries; Oklahoma runoffs (if necessary)\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who has made himself a national figure with a laissez-faire approach to the Covid-19 pandemic and willingness to embrace hot-button conservative causes, might be eyeing another office in a few years. But first, he needs to win a second term, with the possibility of a decisive victory likely to only spark further speculation about his ambitions beyond the Sunshine State.\n\nThree Democrats are hoping to derail DeSantis’ rise, with US Rep. Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor, trying to reclaim his seat as Florida’s chief executive. Crist leads the Democratic field in fundraising. The other contenders to take on DeSantis are state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried and state Sen. Annette Taddeo.\n\nBefore DeSantis, Sen. Marco Rubio was seen as the GOP’s rising star in Florida. His failed 2016 presidential bid upended that trajectory and led Rubio to reverse course and seek reelection to the Senate. Now he’s seeking a third term, with the onetime tea party darling turned Trump critic having fully embraced the former President amid Florida’s shift to the right. US Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief, is the prohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary and has been a strong fundraiser.\n\nThe outcome of these two races could dictate heading into 2024 how much attention and resources Democrats will deploy to Florida, which has been one of the premier battleground states in presidential races for many cycles.\n\nSeptember 6: Massachusetts primaries\n\nFormer state Rep. Geoff Diehl Matt Stone/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald/Getty Images\n\nThe decision by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker to not seek a third term in deep-blue Massachusetts sets up another test of Trump’s power inside the GOP. Former state Rep. Geoff Diehl originally launched his campaign as a challenge to Baker and picked up Trump’s endorsement. But while Diehl won’t have the popular incumbent as an opponent, he also doesn’t have a clear lane to November. Chris Doughty, a businessman and self-described moderate, joined the race in late January. While he doesn’t have electoral experience like Diehl, Doughty was able to open his campaign with half a million dollars of his own money.\n\nOn the Democratic side, state Attorney General Maura Healey, who entered the race after Baker declined to run again, leads the entire field in fundraising. State Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz is also running. Despite favoring Democrats at the federal level, Massachusetts has a habit of electing moderate Republican governors. Without Baker on the ballot, Democrats are hopeful they’ll avoid such a fate this November.\n\nSeptember 13: Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island primaries\n\nNew Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan Erin Scott/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire is one of the GOP’s top targets in 2022, but the party’s hopes of flipping the seat took a hit last November when popular Granite State Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a Senate bid. Sununu’s decision sets up what could be a long and crowded GOP primary, given New Hampshire’s late primary date. Candidates include former Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith, retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc and state Senate President Chuck Morse, who’s received praise from McConnell.\n\nRedistricting is poised to make New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, currently held by Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, more favorable for Republicans. That shift has attracted a wide field of GOP challengers, including Matt Mowers, who lost to Pappas in 2020, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt and Gail Huff Brown, a former TV anchor and the wife of former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown.\n\nThere will likely be another crowded primary on this day on the Democratic side in the Rhode Island governor’s race. Then-Lt. Gov. Dan McKee was elevated to the top job when Gina Raimondo was appointed as Biden’s commerce secretary last year, and he’s now seeking a full term. But Rhode Island Democrats aren’t just letting McKee have it. The packed field currently includes Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown and Helena Foulkes, a former executive at Rhode Island-based CVS.\n\nNovember 8: Election Day; Open primaries in Louisiana", "authors": ["Terence Burlij Melissa Holzberg Depalo Ethan Cohen", "Terence Burlij", "Melissa Holzberg Depalo", "Ethan Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/08/2022-midterm-election-live-updates/8257821001/", "title": "Election 2022 recap: Fetterman flips Pennsylvania Senate seat for ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Election Day 2022.

Ron DeSantis and Rubio comfortably won reelection as voter concerns about the economy appeared to prevail over a message emphasized by Democrats focusing on abortion rights. Republicans flexed their muscle in gubernatorial races with Chris Sununu (New Hampshire), Ron DeSantis (Florida), Henry McMaster (South Carolina), Mike DeWine (Ohio) and Kay Ivey (Alabama) all winning reelection. In addition, former Trump White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders won the governor’s race in Arkansas.\n\nThe latest updates:\n\nGeorgia secretary of state: Raffensperger wins\n\nRepublican incumbent Brad Raffensperger emerged victorious in the race for Georgia secretary of state, beating out Democratic nominee and former state senator Bee Nguyen.\n\nRaffensperger held a solid lead over Nguyen in the polls throughout the race. The contest to be the state’s chief election officer, a down-ballot race that has previously garnered little attention, has gained increased importance in the wake of the 2020 election and unfounded voter fraud claims.\n\n-- Anna Kaufman\n\n3 takeaways from Georgia governor's race:Brian Kemp defeats Stacey Abrams for second term\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin wins in Michigan\n\nRep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich, won reelection over Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett and Libertarian candidate Leah Dailey in Michigan’s new 7th Congressional District, ending one of the nation’s most expensive and closely watched House races.\n\nSlotkin was first elected from the 8th District in 2018, when she flipped a Republican seat that President Donald Trump won in 2016, and she was one of the few Democrats to win reelection in a district that voted for Trump in 2020. A former National Security Council and CIA staffer, she opted to run this year in the newly redrawn 7th District, which is centered on Lansing and would have voted narrowly for President Joe Biden had it existed in 2020.\n\nWhile Slotkin was endorsed by Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., a harsh Trump critic, Barrett was endorsed by former Vice President Mike Pence. Barrett, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, has focused his campaign on less spending, more energy production and criticism of Slotkin's voting record. Slotkin has struck back at Barrett's refusal to say if he would have accepted the results of the 2020 election, which he has called an \"unknowable thing.\"\n\n– Yoori Han, Cronkite News\n\nDemocrat Greg Landsman unseats Ohio Rep.

This was his first defeat since he lost to Democrat Steve Driehaus in 2008. He regained his seat two years later.\n\n-- Rachel Looker\n\nSenate flip:Democrat John Fetterman flips U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania, beating Republican Mehmet Oz\n\nWisconsin governor: Evers wins reelection\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers won a heated re-election battle against Trump-backed Republican Tim Michels.\n\nA Marquette University Law School poll last week had them tied at 48%.\n\nEvers won the governor’s office by a thin margin in 2018 when he defeated Republican Scott Walker, a 2016 presidential candidate. Evers had been a school district superintendent and served as the statewide superintendent of public instruction in Wisconsin for nearly a decade.\n\nAs governor, Evers’s job approval has been slightly underwater in recent Marquette polls, with 46% approving of the job he’s been doing as governor and 48% disapproving.\n\nMichels is backed by former President Donald Trump, who has traveled to Wisconsin to campaign for him. The once low-key owner of Wisconsin’s largest construction company, the eponymous Michels Corp, Michels launched his bid for governor in April -- about 15 months after Biden revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, a project for which Michels’ company had a contract to build pump stations. It’s Michels’ third run for office.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nLive updates:Wisconsin Election Results 2022\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wins reelection\n\nDemocratic incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer claimed victory in her bid for reelection as Michigan governor, successfully fending off a challenge by Republican nominee Tudor Dixon.\n\nThe contest, once seen as an easy win for Democrats in a major battleground state, tightened in the final weeks with a last minute push by the Dixon campaign helping her to inch closer in the polls.\n\nWhitmer is a veteran of Michigan politics, serving six years in the state House and eight in the senate before being elected governor in 2018.\n\nDixon spent years as a conservative TV commentator and producer of conservative news for students.\n\nDixon, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, denies the results of the 2020 election and has criticized Whitmer for her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whitmer, like many other Democrats, emphasized abortion rights throughout the campaign and criticized Dixon for her no-exceptions stance on the procedure.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nPreviously:Michigan Gov.

Fetterman and Oz have been vying for the open seat created by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey's retirement.\n\n\"It's official. I will be the next U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman tweeted early Wednesday morning.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nTexas Democrat Vicente Gonzalez reelected to House\n\nRep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, won his reelection campaign against GOP challenger Mayra Flores to represent Texas' 34th Congressional District, a setback for Republicans hoping to mobilize Hispanic voters.\n\nWith more than 88% of ballots counted, Gonzales led Flores by more than 8 points when the race was called.\n\nRepublicans have made inroads with Latino voters in states like Texas and Nevada, where Democrats are locked in tight congressional and statewide elections. But Gonzalez’ win is a blow to those efforts.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nNo victory or concession speeches tonight from Nevada Democrats\n\nJust as the crowd doubled in size at the Democratic ticket's election party on the Las Vegas Strip, Nevada's top candidates took the stage to thank their supporters – and encourage them to \"go home.\"\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Gov.

Henry Cuellar reelected in Texas\n\nDemocratic Rep. Henry Cuellar won reelection Tuesday, fending off an aggressive play by Republicans to remake the U.S.-Mexico border into a midterm battleground.\n\nCuellar’s victory over Republican Cassy Garcia holds the line for Democrats in an important stronghold for the party. Garcia was one of three Republican Latina candidates who ran competitive House races along the border after the GOP made inroads with Hispanic voters in 2020.\n\nCuellar is one of the most conservative Democrats in the House and narrowly survived a primary challenge this spring from a progressive challenger.\n\n– Paul J.

Michelle Lujan Grisham wins reelection in New Mexico\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, won reelection Tuesday over Republican Mark Ronchetti, a local TV weatherman turned politician who built his campaign on criticism of the first-term governor's performance, according NBC and ABC News\n\nGrisham, who served three terms in the U.S. House, was the first Democratic Latina to hold a governor’s seat at the time of her election in 2018. She ran then on a campaign focused on crime, education and immigration policy, but her reelection was centered on economic issues.\n\nAfter a failed bid for U.S. Senate in 2020, Ronchetti framed his gubernatorial campaign around Grisham's track record, blaming Democrats for a faltering economy and specifically blaming the incumbent's policies for New Mexico’s rank as second in the nation for violent crime. Ronchetti also got a last-minute endorsement this month from former President Donald Trump.\n\nA third candidate, Libertarian Karen Bedonie, a mother of eight and citizen of the Navajo Nation, polled in the single digits throughout the race. She initially hoped to run on the Republican ticket, and is among those that have questioned the validity of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n– Laura Bargfeld, Cronkite News\n\nDemocrats win in Hawaii Senate, governor’s races\n\nDemocrats easily won their races for the U.S. Senate and governorship in Hawaii.\n\nJosh Green overcame Republican challenger Duke Aiona for governor, while Sen.

Tim Ryan, whose campaign had a fundraising edge but lacked national party support, according to NBC and ABC News.\n\nThe race has been one of the tightest in the country in recent polling and is a key test of the influence former President Donald Trump still wields. Trump endorsed Vance and went to Ohio to support him, telling rally goers in September that \"The entire MAGA movement is for J.D.

Hoyer Early Childhood Center \"radically\" different from what he was used to. But the Prince George's County polling place also offered two digital machines, so he chose to vote on one of those.\n\nHe said he feel it’s his duty to vote, and that he found the House and Senate races to be the most important. Outside of that there were some questions about bonds and borrowing money that drew his attention.\n\n“I’m fine with schools borrowing money,\" Aylin said. “I’m not fine with it for the government.”\n\n- Haley Smilow, Cronkite News\n\nRepublican Brian Kemp reelected as Georgia governor\n\nRepublican incumbent Brian Kemp won the race for Georgia governor, defeating Democratic candidate and now two-time opponent Stacey Abrams, according to NBC and ABC News.\n\nThe two faced off once before back in 2018, with Kemp narrowly claiming victory after a runoff election. This gubernatorial contest has been one of the most closely watched this midterm cycle as both candidates are major players in their parties.\n\nThe tightly fought race, along with Sen. Raphael Warnock’s bid to keep his seat in Congress, was expected to serve as a litmus test of just how strong the Democratic coalition in Georgia is and whether it can withstand an election largely viewed as a referendum on President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings have suffered throughout his second year.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBrian Kemp's win: 3 takeaways from the Georgia governor's race\n\nVirginia Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria unseated by Jennifer Kiggans\n\nRepublican state Sen. Jennifer Kiggans unseated incumbent Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., Tuesday in Virginia's 2nd District, which gained a more Republican tilt in redistricting but was still considered a toss-up.\n\nBoth Luria and Kiggans are Navy veterans who campaigned on promises to fight for defense and veterans issues.\n\nKiggans, who currently represents Legislative District 7 in the Tidewater region of the state, positioned herself as the candidate to restore American strength that she said has been injured by the policies of the Biden administration - policies she said Luria continually backed.\n\nLuria, a two-term House member, is also a member of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. A main thrust of her campaign was what she called Kiggans' failure to discuss her stance on results of the 2020 election.\n\n– Emilee Miranda, Cronkite News\n\nDoes early good news for Dems mean a red tsunami isn't materializing?\n\nTwo vulnerable House Democrats in Virginia swing districts appeared to be on their way to victories, perhaps signaling that a red tsunami many predicted isn’t materializing.\n\nCNN and NBC projected that U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., defeated Republican challenger Yesli Vega in the state’s 7th congressional district, a fiercely fought battleground, while Jennifer Wexton, D-Va., was the projected winner over Republican Hung Cha in the 10th congressional district.\n\n“I’m still waiting for the Red Wave to arrive,” veteran political handicapper Stuart Rothenberger said on Twitter. “It may still come, but I have not seen it yet. That does not mean the Rs won’t win the House and Senate.”\n\nRepublicans picked up a third battleground seat in Virginia, however, with CNN projecting Jen Kiggans defeated Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va.\n\nIn a fourth battleground House race in Rhode Island, Democrat Seth Magaziner is the projected winner over Republican Allan Fung, mayor of Cranston, R.I.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nRepublican Mike Crapo wins reelection to Idaho Senate seat\n\nRepublican Sen.

But Spanberger, a two-term congresswoman and the first Democrat elected to represent the 7th district since 1971, highlighted her bipartisan record throughout the campaign.\n\nVega, a first-generation Salvadoran-American and a one-term Prince William County supervisor, positioned herself as a check on the Biden administration. She got a last-minute endorsement from former President Donald Trump last week, but did not actively embrace it.\n\n– Emilee Miranda, Cronkite News\n\nRepublican Chuck Grassley reelected to Senate seat\n\nRepublican Chuck Grassley has defended his Iowa Senate seat against Democratic challenger Michael Franken, according to ABC and NBC.\n\nGrassley has served in office since 1959.

He is a former state representative who cast himself as someone willing to take the fight to the status quo. Shapiro defended the state’s presidential election results in 2020 against an onslaught of legal challenges.\n\nMastriano, a state senator and retired Army colonel, marched on the U.S. Capitol in the Jan. 6 attack and was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, who visited the state to rally for him.\n\nMastriano supported unfounded claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election and held a hearing featuring Rudy Giuliani and Trump, via call-in, hyping voting irregularities.\n\n- Donovan Slack\n\nDemocrat Maggie Hassan wins reelection to U.S. Senate\n\nSen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., beat back Trump-endorsed Republican challenger Don Bolduc in a race that narrowed sharply in the final days despite the state being carried by President Joe Biden in 2020, according to ABC and NBC News\n\nHassan, who served as governor from 2013 until she entered the Senate in 2017, tried to distance herself from the president throughout her campaign. She criticized the administration for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan last year and for its handling of rising inflation.\n\nBolduc, a retired Army general, repeated false claims during the primary that the 2020 election was stolen, but he walked those back after securing the GOP nomination in September. In October, the National Republican Senatorial Committee stopped funding Bolduc’s campaign to prioritize other battleground states.\n\n– Ryan Knappenberger\n\nProgressive activist becomes first Gen Z-er to be elected to Congress\n\nA former March for Our Lives and ACLU activist, Maxwell Alejandro Frost, 25, won his election bid against Republican Army veteran Calvin Wimbish to represent Florida's 10th Congressional District, which includes the Orlando area.

Ted Cruz in 2018 and made a brief presidential run in 2020. O'Rourke's name recognition and charisma fueled Democratic hopes that he could win the governor's race.\n\nBut as of last week, Abbott was favored to win by nearly 10 points, according to FiveThirtyEight polling averages. And voter registration numbers from the Texas secretary of state’s office showed an increase in voter registrations - but not the massive wave state Democrats had hoped would follow the state’s abortion ban and the Uvalde school massacre.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nRepublican Kristi Noem reelected as South Dakota governor\n\nSouth Dakota Gov.

The second, which accused Noem of misusing her position as governor to help her daughter through the state real estate appraiser program, was partially dismissed by the Government Accountability Board, because \"appropriate action\" had been determined.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nMother shares the experience of voting with her daughter\n\nPHOENIX - Vanessa Figueroa brought her 9-year-old daughter, Victoria Medina, with her to the Maryvale Bridge United Methodist Church in Phoenix to drop off her ballot.\n\nFigueroa, 39, said she thought it would be a good chance to teach her daughter the importance of voting.\n\n“(I want her to know that) you get to vote and give your opinion and decide for your own education, too,” she said.\n\nFigueroa said voting is one way she can express support for public education.

Williams, a 30-year-old singer, said that as someone thinking about starting a family, “I’m focused on making sure a woman’s right over her own body is protected.”\n\nWilliams said she is glad to live in Maryland, where abortions are legal up to fetal viability – around 24 weeks – or later if the mother’s life is as at risk.

And the GOP overwhelmingly outspent Democrats to hammer this message across.\n\nDemocrat Charlie Crist centered his campaign on a pledge to protect abortion rights in his fight with Gov.

But they sought to reassure voters by stressing that such DDoS attacks, which flood websites with computer messages, can only slow down voting or counting processes as opposed to actually meddling with the actual vote count.\n\nThey also said that while it is inherently difficult to find out who is behind such attacks, CISA has seen no evidence suggesting that the DDoS attacks were part of any widespread or coordinated campaign.CISA hasn't seen any DDoS attacks on election night results reporting websites, the senior official says.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nDemocrat Maura Healey wins Massachusetts’ governor’s race\n\nDemocrat Maura Healey won Massachusetts’ gubernatorial race against Donald Trump-backed Republican nominee Geoff Diehl.

And she hopes to keep it that way.\n\n“I want to make sure the people who represent me represent the issues I care about,” Williams said.\n\n- Ryan Knappenberger, Cronkite News\n\nGov.

Greg Abbott, held an Election Day meet-and-greet outside a public library in North Dallas this morning. While O’Rourke talked with a ring of supporters, far-right agitators jostled with onlookers and tried to disrupt the candidate’s speech, with little success.\n\nThe handful of anti-O’Rourke onlookers shouted statements about pedophilia and transgender rights that have become a refrain of the extremist right in Texas in recent months. Despite some high-spirited discussions with the candidate’s supporters, the hecklers were unable to push past them and get close to O’Rourke, who spoke to the crowd for about an hour.\n\nTransgender rights have become a political lightning rod in Texas, which has also seen a surge in protests and attacks on LGBTQ-friendly events such as family friendly drag shows. O’Rourke has been endorsed by several LGBTQ organizations, and has criticized Abbott for his support of policies that he says discriminate against LGBTQ people.\n\n– Will Carless\n\nBiden: 'MAGA Republicans' don’t care about Black communities\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden warned in an Election Day radio interview targeted at Black Americans that far-right “MAGA Republicans” don’t care about African-American communities.\n\n“This is not your father’s Republican Party,” Biden said on the “D.L.

Maggie Hassan over Republican Don Bolduc.\n\n“I believe in democracy. Don Bolduc denies the election results from 2020,” French simply put. But at the same time, French isn’t sure if he wants to see Biden run again in 2024. “We’ll wait and see,” said French.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMailed ballots drive higher turnout in Philadelphia\n\nPHILADELPHIA – There is a higher turnout today and the bulk of the counting will be done tonight, according to Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Nick Custodio.\n\nAbout 101,000 mailed ballots will be processed tonight, he told USA TODAY, with the first tally showing five minutes after the polls close at 8 p.m. in Pennsylvania. The counting will take “the normal amount of time,” meaning most of the results will be in tomorrow or Thursday, he said.\n\nCustodio is expecting a higher turnout in this election compared to 2018 because of mail-in voting, he said.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nWhy one voter in Philadelphia is staying home\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Standing outside a Save A Lot grocery store, Lori Dornan explains why she’s shopping after work instead of voting.\n\n“My vote will just give a politician more money and power.

Voting rights groups worry the tactic called “overvoting” could lower voter confidence and slow down counting.\n\n“We have seen a few loosely organized groups pushing for folks to purposely overvote their ballot to make sure their ballot is hand counted this cycle,” said Liz Wester, director of the New Hampshire Voter Empowerment Task Force, a voting rights group.\n\nNew Hampshire Secretary of State, David Scanlan, told USA TODAY that the state is already prepared for hand counting; his office has sent more election workers to polling places to assist in counting ballots.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCommon Cause: Election glitches routine, with some 'weird' anecdotes in Ohio\n\nCatherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause of Ohio, said most questions about voting have been routine, with a couple of “weird” examples.\n\nA priest in Toledo was checking the identification of voters, Turcer said. In Summit County, around Akron, a man was visiting polling places and just watching before being asked to move along, she said.\n\nBut most voting problems reported nationwide were routine, such as problems with voting machines forcing longer lines, not systemic, said Sylvia Albert, Common Cause director of voting and elections.\n\n“What we’re seeing is really what we see in every election, isolated incidents of some problems,” Albert said. “No election is perfect. Election officials are doing their job.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nFor some, Walker’s candidacy is about ‘grace and forgiveness’\n\nKENNESAW, Ga. – Former football player Herschel Walker’s personal controversies have made his Senate campaign a target for Democrats, but many Georgia voters think differently.\n\n“Herschel is real, he’s one of us,” voter Tricia Choi, 55, told USA TODAY. Choi said for many Walker's story is about the redemptive power of Jesus Christ, which she said appeals to faith-based voters.\n\nWalker, who is running to unseat Democratic Sen.

Mark Kelly, a Democrat and former astronaut whose wife was shot in the head by an angry constituent. On the other is Blake Masters, a tech investor and first-time candidate backed by a billionaire patron and endorsed by Trump.\n\nThe two are locked in what’s become an increasingly tight race, with Kelly’s initial advantage in the polls narrowing to a dead heat.\n\nWith hours to go until polling places close, Kelly planned to hit get-out-the-vote events in west Phoenix and Tucson. Masters planned to spend election night at the Arizona Republican Party’s watch event in Scottsdale.\n\nMaricopa County, where problems have been reported at one out of five polling sites, is home to Phoenix and is Arizona’s most populous county. It's also one of the largest in the nation – and while it has tended to vote for Republican candidates in recent years, Biden carried it in 2020.\n\nThe vote there will likely be critical to deciding the tossup Senate race.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, The Arizona Republic, Donovan Slack, and John Fritze\n\nSnowstorm greets voters in crucial swing county\n\nIt was a snowy Election Day in Washoe County, Nevada.\n\nThe county is crucial territory for Nevada – and the nation – as Democrat Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is fending off a challenge from Trump-backed Republican Adam Laxalt. The contest is among a handful that could determine who controls the Senate – and the fate of Biden's agenda for the next two years.\n\nMarc Picker, poll manager at Damonte Ranch High School, said turnout so far is among the highest he has seen despite the weather. One Democratic voter, Reno resident Margaret Smith, said few flakes wouldn't have kept her away.\n\n“I’m like the U.S. Postal Service – neither rain, sleet or snow will stop me from going out like Santa,” Smith said. “(Voting) is that important.”\n\nAnother Reno voter, Jim Lewis, agreed, despite being on the opposite end of the political spectrum. “If they like their freedom and liberty, they should go out there and not be afraid,” he said.\n\n— Jason Hidalgo, Reno Gazette Journal, and Donovan Slack\n\nStocks rally on expectations of GOP inroads\n\nStocks rallied Tuesday on expectations that Republicans will retake at least one chamber of Congress, likely the House of Representatives.

The closest place we can get to the truth and how candidates really think is through a debate,\" he said.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nIllinois county reports election-related cyberattack, but voting not compromised, officials say\n\nChampaign County, Ill., is fighting off an election-related cyberattack that is unrelated to actual voting operations, according to officials there, who say connectivity issues and computer server performance are making it harder – but not impossible – for people to vote.\n\n“The Clerk’s Office believes these are due to cyber-attacks on the network and servers,” Champaign County Clerk Aaron Ammons said in a news release.\n\nChief Deputy Clerk Angie Patton told USA TODAY that the clerk’s office has been the target of repeated DDOS, or Distributed Denial of Service, attacks and that she believes other counties may have been targeted as well.\n\nBut she said IT specialists have secured the Clerk's website – and election operations – and that no data or information has been compromised and the election is secure. She urged voters waiting in long lines to either wait or go to another polling place within the county since voters can cast their ballots there as well.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nAt the top of the Texas ticket: Gov.

On Oct. 30, a poll by the University of Texas at Tyler showed Abbott leading by 6 percentage points among likely voters. Another October poll by the University of Texas Politics Project showed Abbott leading by 11 points.\n\nO’Rourke seeks to galvanize voters around abortion access and gun legislation.

There are also hotlines in other languages:\n\nSpanish/English: 888-VE-Y-VOTA (888-839-8682)\n\nAsian languages/English: 888-API-VOTE (888-274-8683)\n\nArabic/English: 844-YALLA-US (844-925-5287)\n\n— Donovan Slack\n\nMeanwhile, in Pennsylvania...\n\nPHILADELPHIA – There’s a guy dancing in a cardboard, drop-box costume outside City Hall.\n\n— Candy Woodall\n\nFlorida rejects federal election monitors; feds say no biggie since monitors are outside anyway\n\nFlorida’s top election official said Tuesday that the state won’t allow federal monitors at polling locations in South Florida because it’s against state law and federal authorities failed to present any evidence for such an action.\n\nSecretary of State Cord Byrd told reporters in Tallahassee that state officials “wanted to make it clear that (polling locations) are places for election workers and for voters, not for anyone else.”\n\nThe Justice Department said Monday that it was deploying election monitors to 64 jurisdictions across the country, including three counties in South Florida: Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach.\n\nBrad McVay, an attorney with Florida’s Department of State, sent the Justice Department a letter Monday. “None of the counties are currently subject to any election-related federal consent decrees,” he wrote. “None of the counties have been accused of violating the rights of language or racial minorities or of the elderly or disabled.”\n\nThe Justice Department confirmed receipt of the Florida letter but declined to comment except to indicate that federal monitors would be outside the polling places.\n\n— Doug Soule, USA Today Network-Florida, and Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY\n\nIs Miami-Dade turning red? Voting numbers tell the story\n\nMiami-Dade County is one of the biggest and most coveted prizes for any statewide candidate in Florida, and Democrats have owned it for years.\n\nConsider the fact that Miami-Dade hasn’t voted for a Republican since 1988 and hasn’t backed a Republican governor since 2002. That may be changing this year. Early voting numbers as of Tuesday morning show Republicans holding a slight edge of almost 4,000 votes over Democrats.\n\nIf the numbers hold up, it would represent one of the most dramatic electoral turnarounds in Florida history and may solidify the Sunshine State as a red, Republican state moving forward.\n\n— Sergio Bustos, USA Today Network-Florida Enterprise/Politics Editor\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO MIDTERMS:Voting rights, ballot access and key issues: A guide to midterm elections in your state\n\nDon Bolduc says he will accept Election 2022 results if he loses to Maggie Hassan\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Don Bolduc said Tuesday that his opponent, Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan, is out of touch in accusing him of being “extreme” and an “election-denier,” saying he will concede the election Tuesday if he loses.\n\nBolduc, a retired Army brigadier general, made those remarks after voting at the Stratham Memorial School in the town where he lives.\n\n— Max Sullivan\n\nVoting begins smoothly in contested Nevada Senate race\n\nAt the Desert Breeze Community Center outside Las Vegas, approximately 100 people waited in line as the polls opened at 7 a.m. Robert Streat, 73, was among the first to cast a ballot, a personal in-person voting tradition he said dates back decades.\n\nStreat said he opposes Biden's agenda and worries the country is changing too fast from the values he helped defend in Vietnam. He said he supported Republican candidates in the election.\n\n“This country is going to hell if we don’t change it. We’ve got too many people who hate it,\" he said. “We should control the government but we’ve lost it.”\n\nBut Jonathan Copeland, 55, said he worries that Republican control of the House and Senate would mean further erosion of abortion rights, which he supports. Copeland said he voted to help defend the seat of U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat in danger of losing to Republican challenger Adam Laxalt. A Laxalt victory would help flip the Senate to Republican control.\n\n\"What politician has the right to tell a woman what to do?\" Copeland said.\n\n— Trevor Hughes\n\nElection watchdog Common Cause reports routine polling problems in battleground states\n\nCommon Cause officials reported during a 10 a.m. news conference routine problems with voting in battleground states, but urged voters who cast ballots by mail to track them and make sure they were counted.\n\nAmy Keith, program director for Common Cause in Florida, said more than 15,000 absentee ballots were flagged by Thursday for problems such as a missing signature. Voters have until Thursday at 5 p.m. to fix the problems, but with a tropical storm hurtling toward the state, Keith urged voters to vote move briskly.\n\nShe said 2.2 million voters voted early in person and another 2.5 million voted early by mail.\n\n“Floridians are coming out to have their voices heard,” Keith said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nU.S. cybersecurity officials see no attacks on election infrastructure yet\n\nU.S. cybersecurity officials so far have seen no indications of direct attacks on election infrastructure across the United States in the early hours of mid-term voting Tuesday. But they remain on high alert to disinformation operations and efforts to sway voters’ opinions by nation-states such as Russia, China and Iran, a senior official with the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told reporters.\n\nThe senior CISA official said those three nations continue to use the election disinformation playbook they have in past elections, and that CISA will continue to support election officials nationwide to any risks that may arise because of them.\n\nIn the first of three election security media briefings scheduled for Tuesday, the official would not say whether such foreign disinformation efforts are worse than in past election cycles, but confirmed that CISA is especially on guard against Russian malign influence campaigns following yesterday’s claim by sanctioned Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin that the Kremlin has meddled in U.S. elections and will continue to do so.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nNew Hampshire governor: Trump announcing 2024 run soon comes at 'worst time'\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican running for reelection, was one of the first in line to cast his ballot, and when asked about reports former President Donald Trump is expected to announce a 2024 presidential run, he said it seemed like poor timing.\n\n“Anyone who thinks it’s a smart idea to announce an election, a potential presidential bid, after (Tuesday’s) election but before Christmas, is just the worst time you could possibly do it,” Sununu said. “My sense is the former president needs better advisers if that’s really what his strategy’s going to be.”\n\nAs he has crisscrossed the country to campaign for Republican midterm candidates, Trump has increasingly hinted that he may launch a 2024 White House bid soon after the midterms. At a Monday night rally in Dayton, Ohio, he told supporters he was planning a \"very big announcement\" on Nov. 15 from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\n— Max Sullivan\n\nThere's a reason for all those negative campaign ads...\n\nOn Election Day 2022, Americans are unhappy with the present, pessimistic about the future and not fully enamored with either political party. Their anxious, angry mood helps explain why campaign appeals have mostly turned not on aspirational promises – on exploring space or ending poverty, say – but on ominous warnings about the dangers of supporting the other side.\n\n\"Probably not since even the Civil War (has there been) such a dire situation for our democracy as we are in the current day,\" said John Mark Hansen, a political scientist at the University of Chicago.\n\nLessons learned in the midterms include those on the importance of the economy and the emergence of the extremes, among others. Also, the next campaign has already begun, so if you wanted to take a breath before 2024, you’re out of luck.\n\n— Susan Page\n\nIn Ohio, voters to weigh rules for future elections along with Ryan vs. Vance contest\n\nAfter months of campaigns, debates, primaries, absentee and early voting, polls in Ohio opened at 6:30 a.m. EST and will remain open until 7:30 EST.\n\nOne key issue is a ballot measure on rules for future elections. Issue 2 would prohibit noncitizens from voting, proposing that only adult U.S. citizens who legally reside and are registered to vote in Ohio for at least 30 days can cast a ballot in future state and local elections.\n\nThe most high-profile race in the state is the contest between Republican J.D. Vance and Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan that will help decide which party controls the U.S. Senate. Voters will also choose between incumbent Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and his Democratic challenger Nan Whaley. While polls show a tight race for the Senate seat, DeWine has had a wide lead over Whaley in many polls.\n\n— Micah Walker and Caren Bohan\n\nElection officials: Disrupt ‘at your peril’\n\nTop election officials in key states with tight contests are ready for potential disruptions as voters head to the polls – and the ballots are counted afterward.\n\nIn Michigan, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said her office is coordinating closely with law enforcement, deploying dozens of monitors to polling paces, and is prepared to eject poll workers who violate rules.\n\nIn Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said his office set up a texting system for poll workers in 85 counties to report problems and has state patrol officers and the National Guard ready to provide security.\n\nIn Arizona, Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates said officials throughout the county are ready to respond and are closely coordinating with law enforcement to ensure balloting goes smoothly.\n\n“Our message has been very clear to those who would try and disrupt this election: They do it at their peril,” Gates told reporters at a recent briefing hosted by The Center for Election Innovation & Research. “We're going to respond very strongly to that.”\n\nOne of his biggest worries ar", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}]}
