The storm came ashore southeast of Tallahassee as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. Nearly half of Florida's 67 counties issued at least partial evacuation orders Wednesday morning, urging residents who live in mobile homes and low-lying, flood-prone areas to seek shelter and higher ground as NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft prowled the skies near the storm, collecting important meteorological data.\n\nHere's a look at the storm's impact and strength:\n\nHurricane Idalia made landfall as a Category 3 storm in Taylor County, Florida, before crossing into Georgia.\n\nVideos show widespread flooding and damage across Idalia's path.\n\nHundreds of thousands are experiencing power outages in Florida and Georgia.\n\nIdalia briefly reached Category 4 status overnight before weakening to a tropical storm by late Wednesday afternoon. The storm's destructive winds and heavy rains ⁠knocked out power for more than 450,000 customers in Florida and Georgia. By Thursday afternoon, the total number of outages reported in both states shrunk by more than half as power was gradually restored.\n\nIn Georgia, more than 260,000 customers were without power Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. Flooding, high winds and downed trees caused the outages. Duke Energy, one of the major energy companies servicing Florida, reported that more than 60,000 customers in the state were without power and more than 700 active outages Wednesday afternoon, most concentrated just west of Tampa.\n\nIdalia's landfall caused tide levels to surge in Cedar Key and surrounding areas. The Steinhatchee River showed levels well above flood stage.\n\nMapped NOAA data shows rivers flooding across Florida and Georgia.\n\nAs the storm moves away from the shore, it could cause an additional life-threatening hazard: inland flooding. Even after hurricanes lose strength while moving across land, they can bring heavy rain that can overwhelm drainage systems. Portions of Georgia and the Carolinas are at risk of freshwater flooding.\n\nHow does storm surge work?\n\nWhile wind speeds grab our attention as a hurricane approaches, one of the more deadly and destructive results of these systems is storm surge, the surge of water that moves over the shore and up into rivers and bays at landfall. The sudden rise of water topped by already high and powerful waves can sweep homes off their foundations and flood low-lying areas miles inland.\n\nHow big was Hurricane Idalia at landfall?\n\nThough the storm was not a perfect circle, it spanned nearly 350 miles across, an area about the size of Colorado, which measures 380 miles across.\n\nSatellite imagery captured Aug. 30-31, by NASA GOES East satellites, shows Idalia breaking up as it moved into the Atlantic. Hurricane Franklin can also be seen in the same imagery as the storms draw closer together.\n\nWhen did Idalia make landfall? Aug. 30. Most major U.S. hurricanes reach shore in September.\n\nMore than half of major hurricanes dating back to 1851 made landfall in September, according to research by Philip Klotzbach at Colorado State University.\n\nHow much damage did Idalia cause? $18 billion to $20 billion\n\nWhile the extent of Idalia's destruction remains to be seen, an AccuWeather report estimates the storm is already responsible for $18 billion to $20 billion in damage. Hurricane Ian, one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the U.S., ranks as the third-costliest hurricane in the country's history. The storm last year resulted in more than $115 billion in damage related to flooding, structural damage and electrical outages. It was the costliest hurricane in Florida's history.\n\nWhere is Idalia now?

Prepare a hurricane kit or go-bag.\n\nA go-bag is usually a small, lightweight backpack you can grab in a moment's notice on your way out the door. It should include personal items, toiletries, food and water.\n\nAs the storm weakened after landfall, several Florida counties began lifting evacuation orders.

For the latest news on Hurricane Idalia landfall, please read our live updates page for Wednesday, Aug. 30.\n\nCEDAR KEY, Fla. − Hurricane Idalia, a Category 4 storm with sustained winds at 130 mph, was on a collision course with Florida's Big Bend and only 90 miles from the state's capital, Tallahassee early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of a \"life-threatening, dangerous situation,\" saying the storm could make landfall as a major hurricane. The treacherous tropical cyclone is driving a potentially deadly storm surge toward the Big Bend area of Florida's west coast.\n\n\"To put this system into the historical context, there are no major hurricanes in the historical dataset going back to 1851 that have tracked into Apalachee Bay. None,\" the advisory said. \"Don't mess around with this.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in place along hundreds of miles of Florida coastline as the storm headed toward an apparent landfall along Florida's Big Bend.\n\nNearly all of Florida's western coastline is under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The watch is in effect for over seven million people in 22 counties until 6 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a news briefing that highway tolls were being waived, shelters were opening and hotels were prepared to take evacuees. More than 30,000 utility workers were getting ready to repair outages when the storm passes.\n\nDeSantis said landfall appeared to be headed toward Taylor County, southeast of Tallahassee and one of the most rural and economically challenged areas of the state. But he said it was too early to know exactly where the storm would hit.\n\n\"Everybody on the Gulf Coast from Tampa Bay to northwest Florida must be vigilant,\" he said. \"You're going to see some nasty weather.\"\n\nAt a self-serve sandbag site in Spring Hill, well within Hernando County's mandatory evacuation zone, Jeff Manor and Judy Hodder were preparing bags to place along the doors and garage of their coastal home. They already brought in their outdoor furniture, towed their pontoon boat out of a nearby canal and tied it down on the side of their home.\n\n\"We're staying here,\" Hodder, 67, said as she wiped sweat from her forehead. \"But if it starts coming at us, we're gone.\"\n\nWhat is rapid intensification?How Idalia could quickly become a major hurricane before landfall\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ DeSantis said 5,000 National Guard members were activated, 580 search and rescue workers in eight teams were mobilized, 1,100 generators were prepped for deployment, and 200 ambulances were ready to sweep into the area.\n\n∎ Idalia was expected to remain a hurricane as it crosses into Georgia before moving over the Carolina coastline on Thursday, then out into the Atlantic, where its path remained uncertain.\n\nFlorida is on storm surge watch:Here's what that means\n\nFollow the path of Idalia as storm heads for Florida\n\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm but does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nParts of Tampa Bay Area under flood warning as heavy rain batters region\n\nTAMPA —The National Weather Service is warning that the Alafia River will likely breach its banks in the Hillsborough County community of Riverview on Wednesday, as Idalia batters Florida's west coast.\n\nA flood warning is in effect from Wednesday morning through the late evening near the bridge where U.S. 301 crosses the river. The Alafia is forecast to exceed its flood stage by 1.5 feet, according to the weather service.\n\n\"Major flooding is forecast,\" the agency said in a weather advisory. \"This approaches the flood of record.\"\n\nThe previous record water level for the Alafia in Riverview was 6.2 feet following Hurricane Frances in 2004, according to weather service data. Wednesday's forecast calls for a peak of 5.7 feet in the early afternoon.\n\nRiverview is an unincorporated community in Hillsborough County of about 100,000 people that lies ten miles southeast of downtown Tampa.\n\nIdalia's impacts were felt across the region as waves along the coast rose and crashed ashore. The city of Tampa was experiencing heavy rain as numerous showers and thunderstorms moved over the area. Wind gusts up to 65 mph are expected overnight.\n\n— Dan Glaun, Florida Today\n\nIdalia expected to 'become a major hurricane'\n\nDeSantis announced that 30 of Florida’s 67 counties had some kind of evacuation order in place. Schools have also closed in many counties as residents prepare for high winds and potential flash flooding.\n\n\"Now's the time to do it,\" DeSantis said during a Tuesday night news conference. \"If you wait much longer . . . the weather's going to start getting nastier and nastier.\"\n\nThe governor warned that first responders will not be able to provide aid or respond to emergency calls until after the storm has passed. He noted the state has also set aside resources to help restore power and interruption to fuel supplies, including 30,000 to 40,000 electricity workers on standby and 1.1 million gallons of fuel.\n\n'We're solid here': Business owners prepare for impact\n\nCEDAR KEY, Fla. − In the mid-afternoon, Cedar Key's quaint downtown and Dock Street area, its streets lined with restaurants and local shops on stilts firm in the Gulf of Mexico, were deserted. Metal and wood boards were nailed over windows and doors of beloved eateries, clashing with the pastel signage of restaurants bearing the names Tipsy Cow, Steamers and Duncan's on the Gulf.\n\nIt's one of a cluster of islands in the Gulf Coast known for its wildlife with about 800 residents and only one road going in or out.\n\nJordan Keeton, 39, owns 83 West, the largest restaurant on the island. It juts out over the Gulf of Mexico and both floors are surrounded by windows. He and his family and friends were moving out the last of the most valuable items, including a wooden bench shaped like a boat, which has been with the restaurant for over 50 years, he said.\n\nKeeton, who is also the chef, has owned the restaurant since 2015. Soon after purchasing it, he renovated the place. The next year, however, Hurricane Hermine's storm surge caused about $750,000 in damages. He and his brother James were upstairs when the storm hit. The downstairs was destroyed, and he found pieces of the deck at a fire station miles away.\n\nAfterward, he made sure the new floors and walls could withstand flooding.\n\nOn Monday and Tuesday morning, they cleared the downstairs and lugged most of the furniture, kitchen supplies and alcohol upstairs.\n\n\"The plan is for the stuff to stay dry up here as the surge pushes through the downstairs and onto the island,\" he said.\n\nKeeton is going to stay through the storm at his nearby home, 16 feet above sea level.\n\n\"We should be fine at a Cat 3. Our house is rated at a 5. I'm not worried about it there,\" he said, placing his hand on the second-floor dock of his restaurant, overlooking the overcast sky over the Gulf. \"This one, not so much. So we'll see what happens.\"\n\nOn a country road, a few miles short of downtown, Lee Bryan and some of his friends were strapping down a large walk-in cooler he uses for his clam farming business, Bryan Farms.\n\n\"He's worried the water will bring it off its pilings,\" said Lee's wife Leanna Bryan, a co-owner of the business.\n\nThe couple's operation delivers clams to restaurants on three separate routes up and down the Nature Coast and Big Bend. They live off the Suwannee river and plan to stay there through the hurricane.\n\n\"When you live here, you know they're going to come so you have to work with mother nature as much as you can,\" she said. \"Can't control it so you got to just try and help yourself.\"\n\nLeanna Bryan said no matter the damage, Cedar Key and its residents will persevere.\n\n\"It's a resilient community, we all come together and help each other,\" she said. \"We're solid here.\"\n\nHurricane Center chief: Be ready to survive several days on your own\n\nNational Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan warned there are \"likely going to be some devastated areas\" in counties from the Florida coast into southern Georgia. The storm surge will be “difficult to survive” along a long stretch of the coast, including Citrus, Levy, Taylor and Franklin counties, Brennan said. Residents should have several days' worth of food, medicine and emergency supplies on hand, he said.\n\n“There may not be water, power and other amenities you’re used to having,” Brennan said. “You’re going to want to be prepared to survive several days on your own, without any support from anybody else.”\n\n'Gloom and doom ... (or) everything is going to be fine'\n\nDozens of Hernando Beach and Weeki Wachee locals looking to fortify their homes on Tuesday took shovels to large sand mounds, packed bags full and lugged them to their cars and trucks within eyeshot of the Gulf of Mexico where several feet of storm surge is expected.\n\nAt a self-service sandbag site at Linda Pedersen Park in Spring Hill, Alan Covington, 63, and Vreli Covington, 63, stuffed the truck bed of their Ford F-150 with sandbags. For the past seven years, they have lived in a single-story home within 100 yards of the Gulf.\n\n\"They're for us but mostly for our neighbor, who has been in New Hampshire the last few days,\" Alan Covington said, pointing to the bags. \"I told him: 'We're gonna put sandbags up for you' − not that it's gonna do any good.\"\n\nThe couple took in all the furniture, packed their important papers and stored their boat at a nearby marina. Once they set up the sandbags, they planned to take refuge at a friend's two-story inland home.\n\n\"We're going to push away with positivity,\" Vreli Cunningham said. \"We're the two ends of the spectrum. Mister Doom and Gloom and me, Miss 'Everything Is Going to be Fine.'\"\n\nIdalia in context: Previous storms have devastated Apalachee Bay\n\nOther storms have set a precedent for devastating storm surge in communities along Apalachee Bay. In 2005, Hurricane Dennis, passing 120 miles to the west, produced a surprising storm surge of 6-9 feet higher than normal tide levels, inundating the community of St. Marks just south of Tallahassee.\n\nDennis obliterated Posey's Oyster Grill and Bar, a highly popular restaurant known for its local seafood.\n\nIn an after-storm report by the hurricane center, hurricane specialist Jack Beven wrote the surge was “likely triggered by an oceanic trapped shelf wave that propagated northward along the Florida west coast.”\n\nDennis approached at the right angle to trap a bulge of water between itself and the shore, Mark Wool, a meteorologist with the weather service, once told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nIdalia could thrive on warm waters of Gulf\n\nHurricane Idalia's path toward Florida's coast takes it through a steamy hot tub otherwise known as the Gulf of Mexico. That's worrisome because hurricanes thrive on warm water. It fuels the heat and water vapor that make them stronger and capable of dumping more extreme rainfall. And unseasonably warm water temperatures have lingered in the Gulf for weeks, making it even hotter than normal.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario Tuesday, the tropical cyclone will be moving along the coast in water temperatures among the hottest on record in the Gulf as it spins toward a landfall overnight or Wednesday morning.\n\nEvacuation urged ahead of potential wall of water\n\nCatastrophic impacts from a storm surge of up to 15 feet above ground level topped by large, destructive waves are possible along a stretch of more than 100 miles of coastline from the Aucilla River to Yankeetown in the Big Bend region, the hurricane center said. A storm surge of 3 feet or more is possible, depending on the timing of high tides, to the north and the south from west of Apalachicola to Everglades City. Residents were urged to heed evacuation orders.\n\nFor context, the maximum water level measured after Hurricane Ian in Fort Myers Beach last fall was 15 feet. The hurricane center concluded in its post-Ian report that storm surge killed 41 people, more than any other single cause. The U.S. Geological Survey, university researchers and professional storm chasers were out placing specialty equipment along the coast Tuesday to measure the expected surge.The geological survey said Idalia’s surge could cause changes all along the state’s west coast, washing over sandy beaches and cutting into dunes.\n\nOld nuclear power plant braces for Idalia\n\nAbout 85 miles north of Tampa along the Gulf of Mexico, the retired Crystal River Nuclear Plant sits near Idalia’s forecasted path. Part of Duke Energy’s 5,100-acre complex that also includes active fossil fuel-powered plants in Citrus County, the old nuclear plant began decontamination and dismantling in 2020. In an email, federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesperson Neil Sheehan said there is no operating reactor that would cause concern. Officials remain in contact with plant personnel who must complete storm preparation, including ensuring radioactive materials are secured, he said.\n\nHurricane preparations for the site were completed Monday, Duke Energy spokesperson Mary Kathryn Green said in an email. Radioactive materials are permanently placed in shielded containers that withstand the effects of extreme weather, she said. Used nuclear fuel also remains sealed in on-site storage.\n\nKeith Richardson, a spokesperson for Duke Energy, said the company was securing anything that could become airborne, storing equipment and ensuring generators are supplied should power be lost. Afterward, staff plan to do walkthroughs and inspections, he said.\n\n“In terms of the process, that’s all accounted for,” Richardson said.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nBig Bend is mostly rural, thinly populated\n\nThe Big Bend, the region where the Florida Panhandle transitions into the peninsula, is tree-packed and rural. Taylor County, the southernmost county in the Big Bend, is home to only about 22,000 people, ranking it 54th in population out of the state's 67 counties. To the western side, Franklin county ranks 64th, with a population of about 12,500. In 2021, about 19% of the residents in Franklin County lived below the poverty line, one of the poorest counties in the state.\n\nMost of the population lives along the Apalachee Bay, a swampy swath of Florida where parts o the coastline remain undeveloped. Inland, three state forests connect the panhandle to the peninsula, and the tall pines that line the Big Bend Scenic Byway are very sensitive to wind damage and pose a threat to homes in high-speed winds.\n\n− Ana Goni-Lessan, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nSmall wobble could drastically alter storm's impact\n\nFloridians were anxiously waiting to see whether Idalia follows the forecast track or makes any kind of last-minute wobble to the east that could bring worse-than-expected damage from wind and water. Hurricane Ian last year and Hurricane Charley in 2004 curved toward a landfall a little earlier than expected. Any movement closer to land could increase the effects of storm surge, rain and higher winds closer to the center of the hurricane.\n\nOne neighborhood near Tampa Bay on Tuesday morning illustrated the gamut of emotions among residents on the west coast, but outside the forecast cone. One was putting up shutters while another was laying sod. Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, stressed that everyone should prepare for the worst.\n\n“The storm is going to be here soon,” Guthrie said. “I implore you to finalize your disaster preparedness actions right now.”\n\nStorm surge as high as 15 feet\n\nIdalia is forecast to make landfall overnight Tuesday or early Wednesday as a major hurricane with sustained winds near 120 mph. Storm surge − a sudden rise in water levels along beaches and into inland waterways − as high as 15 feet could slam the coast south of Florida’s Big Bend near the eventual point of landfall. Storm surge of at least 2 to 3 feet was possible along the state's entire west coast, depending on how Idalia's landfall coincides with full moon high tides. A storm surge of 4 to 7 feet could occur in Tampa Bay, the hurricane center warned.\n\nRyan Truchelut, chief meteorologist at Florida-based WeatherTiger, said Idalia will likely bring \"catastrophic surge\" to much of the west-central Florida and Big Bend coastline and a core of destructive winds to parts of North Florida. Idalia could become just the second Category 3 or higher hurricane − winds exceeding 110 mph − to make landfall there in the past 170 years, he said.\n\nWhat is storm surge?:Explaining a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\nEvacuation orders:Hurricane Idalia rapidly intensifying; 22 Florida counties under evacuation orders\n\nA foot of rain, tornadoes possible\n\nRainfall of 4 to 8 inches is forecast along portions of the state's west coast and Panhandle, as well as along the path of the storm through Southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas, with isolated amounts up to 12 inches near where Idalia makes landfall, the National Weather Service said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted along all of Georgia's coast and much of the Florida and South Carolina coasts. Cities such as Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina, are likely to see a few inches of rain as Idalia moves along the Carolina coasts before curving northeastward over the Atlantic Ocean, AccuWeather said.\n\n\"Tornadoes can also occur to the east of the center of the circulation as it moves across Florida,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said.\n\nWeather Channel meteorologist Jim Cantore seen on Cedar Key\n\nSunday posts on X, formerly Twitter, that indicated The Weather Channel meteorologist Jim Cantore would show up in Florida were confirmed Monday. Cantore is long known for being in the middle of major storm events. An X user whose handle is Lt. Col. William Reid tweeted a photo from a Cedar Key restaurant, presumably Steamers: \"Ran into the Jim Cantore while having dinner.\"\n\nPhotos of the restaurant's page on Facebook show a \"dollar bill wall,\" similar to the dollar bill wall in Reid's tweet. Cantore has quite a history in Florida storms.

For the latest news on Hurricane Idalia's path, please check our live updates file for Tuesday, Aug. 29.\n\nFORT MYERS, Fla. − Idalia strengthened into a hurricane early Tuesday on its treacherous trek toward Florida's Gulf Coast, where it is expected to make landfall with potent storm surge and powerful winds.\n\nThe Category 1 storm was expected to \"rapidly intensify into an extremely dangerous major hurricane\" before striking Florida on Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. Extremely warm waters in the Gulf were fueling Idalia, which now has maximum sustained winds of 75 mph.\n\nResidents along the Gulf Coast loaded up on sandbags and evacuated from homes in low-lying areas along the coast Monday as Idalia intensified.\n\nIdalia on Monday had been struggling with wind shear to its west but Cuban radar images show a partial eyewall forming, and the latest information from reconnaissance flights show Idalia is \"very near hurricane strength,\" according to senior hurricane specialist Richard Pasch. Tropical storm force winds were extending up to 150 miles from the center of the storm.\n\nRyan Truchelut, chief meteorologist at Florida-based WeatherTiger, said conditions remained ripe for rapid intensification starting Tuesday morning. He projected landfall in Florida to take place by midday Wednesday somewhere along the Big Bend and Nature Coast.\n\nIdalia could become just the second Category 3 or higher hurricane to make landfall there in the past 170 years, he said.\n\n\"Idalia will likely bring catastrophic surge to a broad swath of the west-central Florida and Big Bend coastline and a core of destructive winds to an unlucky but still unknown swath of North Florida,\" said Truchelut, who provides forecasts for the USA TODAY Network.\n\nHurricane watches were in effect along more than 300 miles of the Florida Coast − from Longboat Key, 60 miles south of Tampa, to the Ochlockonee River near Tallahassee. A major hurricane is a Category 3, 4 or 5 storm or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind speed scale; a storm becomes a Category 3 hurricane when maximum wind speeds reach at least 111 mph.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 46 counties, a broad swath that stretches across the northern half of the state from the Gulf Coast to the Atlantic Coast. Pasco County, north of Tampa, issued a mandatory evacuation order for some areas − and throughout the county of almost 600,000 people for those living in manufactured or mobile homes or RVs.\n\nThe county will open shelters Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Please consider riding out the storm with family or friends,\" county officials said in a statement. \"If that’s not an option, you can evacuate directly to a Pasco County shelter.\"\n\nSpaghetti models:See latest satellite images, spaghetti models for Idalia\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Up to 12 feet of ocean water could surge over the Florida shoreline and along inland rivers and creeks as the storm rolls in, raising concerns for flooding that could be extensive.\n\n∎ The storm was 85 miles north of the western tip of Cuba and 370 miles south-southwest of Tampa early Tuesday. It was moving north at 14 mph.\n\nIdalia has 'infernal potential':Storm takes aim at Florida, forecaster warns\n\n'Dangerous situation' for Florida with 21 counties under evacuation orders\n\nWhile some parts of the state — such as Tampa Bay — will not see landfall, Truchelut warned that the key and \"number one\" threat from Idalia is going to be the storm surge. Life-threatening conditions are expected along portions of the Florida coast.\n\n\"It's a dangerous situation developing for north central and west central Florida,\" Truchelut said during a Monday night forecast.\n\nIdalia, according to Truchelut, was \"just shy\" of Category 1 hurricane intensity and is expected to strengthen into a major hurricane by the end of Tuesday before making landfall in Florida on Wednesday.\n\nIn addition to hurricane conditions, there is the potential for flash and urban flooding across Florida and portions of Georgia and the Carolinas. Truchelut also warned the possibility of storm and localized surges going higher than the predicted eight to 12 feet.\n\n\"If you're in a low lying area that floods anywhere in the Apalachee Bay and Nature Coast, you got to get out of there,\" Truchelut said.\n\nState expects power outages, preps for water rescues\n\nBy Monday, DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 46 of the state's 67 counties. The governor warned that trees will come down and power outages are \"just going to happen.\"\n\nThe state has mobilized more than 2,500 National Guard members and airmen with another 3,000 in pre-staged deployment, DeSantis said. They will be equipped with 2,400 high-water vehicles and 12 aircraft to prepare for rescues.\n\nSeven urban search and rescue teams are also ready for deployment once the storm passes. The state's emergency operations center in Tallahassee shifted into around-the-clock operations Monday morning.\n\n\"These things can wobble, so Floridians along our Gulf Coast should be vigilant, even if you are currently outside\" the likely track of the storm, he said.\n\nResidents prepare for Idalia: 'Better safe than sorry'\n\nThe Home True Value Hardware store in Holmes Beach has been humming with people stopping in and preparing for the storm, head cashier Gloria Creighton said Monday. The store’s sales have doubled, selling more than usual.\n\nSo far, the hardware store has run out of sandbags, bungee cords, and tarps. And many customers have bought flashlights, batteries, and all different sizes of propane canisters — which the store had a delivery on Monday.\n\nCreighton said the store will probably be closed on Tuesday. This comes as other stores throughout Holmes Beach began closing Monday, some with sandbags before the doors and others boarded up.\n\n\"Everybody’s getting ready, is what it is,\" Creighton added. “Better safe than sorry.”\n\nFor Destiney Lejander, 29, a Sarasota renter, the impending Idalia is her first hurricane. But Lejander, who previously lived in Tennessee, said she feels prepared for the hurricane.\n\n\"I have sliding glass doors in my bedroom, so I'm going to take these and pack that down to try to keep everything together,\" she said. \"I made sure I had flashlights, batteries, and I got groceries today, pet supplies, and even bug spray in case there is standing water. I thought about heading out, but I think I'm just going to hunker down.\"\n\n— Gabriela Szymanowska and Samantha J. Gholar, Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nPine Island, still recovering from Ian, braces for Idalia\n\nMatlacha-Pine Island Fire District chief Ben Mickuleit said that although the island's entire electrical grid was taken down less than a year ago by the wind and storm surge of Hurricane Ian, he wasn't as concerned about the potential for electrical grid damage as he was for homes hit by Ian that had not yet been fully repaired. Mickuleit advised residents prepare their homes by moving outdoor furniture inside. Sand and sandbags were available at the firehouse, he said.\n\nJulia Simpson, secretary of nonprofit charitable organization Matlacha Hookers, said people in Pine Island's St. James City who saw significant flooding during Ian have begun moving vehicles and themselves to higher ground and filling bathtubs.\n\n\"I think everyone's a little more hypervigilant about doing those things this time,\" she said. \"Since it's so uncertain and it is in the Gulf, people are trying to get the basics taken care of.\"\n\nHow do hurricanes form?An inside look at the birth and power of ferocious storms\n\nTampa airport, port announce closures ahead of Idalia\n\nTampa International Airport will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday and expects to reopen Thursday morning after assessments of the damage, authorities said. Port Tampa Bay already has closed for inbound ships because of the coming storm, although \"landside\" operations such as fueling remain open, authorities said. The Coast Guard has set the port conditions to YANKEE, meaning gale force winds are possible within 24 hours.\n\n\"The port has been in contact with our partner fuel terminal operators and have been assured they are prepared to deliver fuel and support consumers,\" the port said in a statement.\n\nCabbage Key 'battening down the hatches'\n\nOn Lee County's Cabbage Key, they are taking preparations seriously at the popular island spot Cabbage Key Inn & Restaurant, where Jimmy Buffett is rumored to have written the song \"Cheeseburger in Paradise.\" The popular post-fishing trip stop is closing down ahead of the storm, and employees who left the island were given Tuesday and Wednesday off.\n\n\"We are battening down the hatches,\" said restaurant manager Thomas James, explaining that the restaurant was doing its typical hurricane prep in case the storm turned or intensified.\n\nBecause of Cabbage Key's remote location, a number of employees live in dorm-style housing. James said the restaurant had not yet decided to evacuate its employees yet, but there was room at its Bokeelia-based sister restaurant Tarpon Lodge and \"plenty of boats to take employees off-island.\"\n\nMessage to Pine Island residents: Don't panic\n\nSome barrier islands along Southwest Florida, such as Pine Island, Matlacha, Sanibel and Fort Myers Beach saw widespread devastation from Hurricane Ian's heavy winds and 14-foot-high storm surge less than one year ago. Now, faced with Hurricane Idalia, local leaders are urging people to stay calm but prepare.\n\nJen and Kevin Russell, who run the popular Facebook page Things to do on Pine Island, are considered the unofficial mayors of the unincorporated island. The Russells' message to Pine Islanders was simple: Don't panic.\n\n\"We don't want to create any anxiety for people,\" said Jen, adding that fear might keep people from smart decisions. Kevin said they planned to keep Pine Islanders informed through their Facebook page, as they did during Ian.\n\nSanibel, blasted by Ian, awaits Idalia\n\nSanibel City Council member Holly Smith, who was mayor when Hurricane Ian devastated the island in September, said that as a hotelier she’s busy preparing while navigating a flurry of meetings Monday. On the schedule so far: the fire district, Lee County Electric Cooperative, a likely City Council meeting and a roundtable with Sen. Rick Scott about lessons learned from Hurricane Ian. She said she has asked Lee County officials for a state of emergency to prepare for evacuations and other responses as the storm grows stronger.\n\nShe estimated there are about 1,000 residents on the island and fewer than 100 visitors because of limited room availability.\n\nAfter Ian, “I would rather have a citizen upset with me for a couple of days if nothing comes to pass, then have to handle the mess we did post-Ian,\" she said.\n\nSchools closed as Idalia approaches\n\nAll public schools in Hernando County, which includes the Spring Hill and Weeki Wachee areas, about 50 miles north of Tampa, were closed Monday and will remain so until at least Wednesday. Multiple schools are being used as shelters for those living on the coast or in low-lying areas.\n\nPasco-Hernando State College canceled all in-person and remote classes scheduled after 5 p.m. Monday. The school's facilities, including its three campuses, are expected to reopen Thursday.\n\nSchool districts in Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, as well as Citrus and Pinellas counties, canceled classes Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nMultiple Central Florida school districts announced closures, too. No classes will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Marion County public schools. Lake County Schools announced classes would be canceled Wednesday. Other districts, including Orange County, which includes Orlando, said they were monitoring the movements of Idalia.\n\n– Christopher Cann\n\nState parks closed and famed mermaid show shut down\n\nOn Monday, voluntary evacuations were issued for all areas west of U.S. 19, including Hernando Beach, Pine Island and Weeki Wachee State Park.\n\nWeeki Wachee State Park, known for its mermaid shows and the head spring of the Weeki Wachee River, was closed on Monday and will reopen \"as soon as conditions allow,\" according to the Florida state parks website.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, a total of 80 state parks expected to be potentially impacted by the Idalia were closed.\n\nManatee and Pinellas counties each issued mandatory level A evacuations, which applies to vulnerable coastal areas as well as all mobile homes and RVs. A voluntary evacuation was also issued for others in areas at risk of being impacted by potentially deadly storm surge.\n\n\"We’re expecting significant storm surge along the barrier islands and coastal communities for Idalia, with the earliest arrival predicted for Tuesday,” said Jodie Fiske, the Manatee County public safety director, in a public statement. “This is a very dangerous track that we all need to be aware of.”\n\n– Christopher Cann\n\nIdalia could make landfall near Cedar Key\n\nIdalia could be headed for a landfall near Cedar Key, based on Monday’s forecast.\n\n“We’re not on the coast, we’re three miles into the Gulf,” Sue Colson, a Cedar Key city commissioner told USA TODAY on Monday. “It looks bad.”\n\nEverybody in the small island community was doing storm prep Monday, in advance of an expected evacuation, Colson said. She said the city and Levy County have a well-honed emergency plan. The town’s residents were trailering boats out of town, and moving things to higher ground.\n\n“We’re used to it,” Colson said. The small archipelago has been hit repeatedly by storms. The last major damage came with Hurricane Hermione’s 8-foot storm surge in 2016.\n\nThis time the community is forecast to have a 7- to 11-foot storm surge, with a potential for 115 mph winds, Colson said. Wednesday was already forecast to be one of the highest tides of the calendar year, coinciding with the full moon.\n\n“This is not a good scene,” she said. \"We don’t like it but that’s the price we pay. We’re sitting in the Gulf. We know how to clean up and rebuild.”\n\nThe island’s residents were removing propane tanks, securing garbage cans and loose items that could wind up in the Gulf. Colson said the community’s residents have to be aware the electric, sewage and water will all be turned off, and there may not be a road if Idalia moves through at full-strength.\n\n– Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nFollow the path of Idalia as it heads toward Florida\n\nCoastal areas brace for flooding from storm surge\n\nStorm surge – a rapid increase in water levels that push inland up rivers and streams – was expected to create a serious flooding threat along Florida’s west coast. The National Hurricane Center increased and extended its surge forecast Monday with the expectation that Idalia will become a major hurricane, with winds in excess of 110 mph, as it nears the coast. Idalia will be making landfall during a full moon, the time of the month when tides are at their highest.\n\nThe center warned the surge could be as high as 7 to 11 feet from the Big Bend south to Homosassa Springs, and a storm surge warning is in place from St. Marks, Florida, south to Port Charlotte. The surge could be on the higher end of the forecast if Idalia makes landfall at high tide.\n\nThe peak surge forecast decreases by degrees further south along the coast, but could be anywhere from 3 feet to 9 feet, depending on the proximity to landfall, the hurricane center said.\n\n− Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nNeighbor helping neighbor in Manatee County\n\nDave Clement, 66, lives on the second level of a condo building in Bradenton Beach south of Tampa. He drove a couple of miles south to Coquina Beach, where Manatee County workers dumped sand and bags for locals preparing for the storm. Clement said he was shoveling sandbags for his downstairs neighbor, who was traveling.\n\nClement said that while it remained unclear where the storm will hit, it was best to prepared for whatever might come.\n\n\"When you live in a condo association, you know, you’re all connected,” Clement said. “That’s how I look at it. You want to make sure your neighbor’s going to be OK.”\n\n− Sarasota Herald-Tribune staff\n\nDamaging winds, up to 18 inches of rain\n\n\"Major, life-threatening flooding\" was possible, with 4 to 8 inches of rain possible from northern Florida through the Southeast − and some areas could see up to 18 inches of rain, AccuWeather said. AccuWeather meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said damaging winds of 40 to 60 mph can be expected across Florida and parts of the Southeast in coming days.\n\n\"Closest to where the tropical system makes landfall, however, wind gusts of up to 120 to 140 mph can occur,\" he said.\n\nWhat is storm surge?Explaining a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\nContaminated gas complicates storm preparations\n\nDrivers along Florida's Gulf Coast were told they could have purchased gas contaminated with diesel fuel over the weekend as residents in the area prepared for Idalia. Florida officials warned Sunday that any fuel purchased after 10 a.m. on Saturday at stations supplied by Citgo from the Port of Tampa has a strong likelihood of being contaminated with diesel fuel.\n\nThe Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said contaminated gasoline and diesel could damage the engine or affect its operation.\n\n− Sarasota Herald-Tribune staff\n\nIdalia will also target Georgia, Carolinas, Virginia\n\nGeorgia, South and North Carolina and Virginia will be the next targets as Idalia sweeps over Florida, forecasters say. Up to 8 inches and wind gusts of more than 40 mph are likely through eastern Georgia and the Carolinas and possibly Virginia later in the week and approaching Labor Day weekend.\n\n\"By late week, the storm can turn toward the east and reemerge over the Atlantic Ocean,\" Buckingham said. \"At this point, little reintensification can be expected, and the system will be moving away from the East Coast toward Bermuda.\"\n\nHurricane Franklin is season's first 'major' hurricane\n\nHurricane Franklin was rapidly intensifying early Monday and reached Category 4 strength with maximum sustained winds estimated at 145 mph. The first \"major\" hurricane of the season, the storm was centered more than 400 miles north of Grand Turk Island and moving north-northwest at 8 mph. Later this week, Franklin will hit Bermuda, AccuWeather said. Franklin also is expected to be felt along the U.S. East Coast, where \"rough surf and rip currents could imperil swimmers as summer winds down,\" AccuWeather warned.\n\nWhat is the Saffir-Simpson scale?Breaking down the hurricane category scale\n\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/30/hurricane-idalia-florida-photos/70717210007/", "title": "Hurricane Idalia photos show Category 3 storm hitting Florida", "text": "Wednesday morning, Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Florida's Big Bend, the area around Tallahassee where the northern part of the state meets the panhandle.\n\nThe Category 3 tropical cyclone, which has weakened from a Category 4, brought a storm surge, flooding and power outages for hundreds of thousands as it moves through Florida and heads toward Georgia.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tallahassee described Idalia as an \"unprecedented event,\" saying no major hurricane had ever hit the Big Bend's Apalachee Bay.

Florida's Nature Coast offers visitors a chance to enjoy the state's natural beauty, far removed from big cities and other popular tourist attractions, according to FloridaNatureCoast.org.\n\n“The counties of Florida’s Nature Coast believe that many people − our residents, and those who travel here from far away − think having a good time involves more than expensive restaurants, theme parks and crowded beaches,” the website said.\n\nFlorida's Nature Coast is home to dense forests, prairies and blackwater rivers\n\nThe Nature Coast is an area of more than 1 million acres where visitors can hike, kayak, bike, fish, bird watch and star gaze not far from local restaurants, hotels and \"quaint historic towns,\" according to FloridaNatureCoast.org.\n\nMost of the population in the Big Bend lives along the Apalachee Bay, a swampy swath of the state where parts of the coastline remain undeveloped. Inland, three state forests connect the panhandle to the peninsula, and the tall pines that line the Big Bend Scenic Byway are very sensitive to wind damage and pose a threat to homes in high-speed winds.\n\n“When you want to get away, we have what you’re looking for,\" the website says. \"Forests to explore, blackwater rivers and crystal clear spring-fed streams to paddle, secluded spots to camp and trails to ride and hike.\"\n\nBig Bend is mostly rural, thinly populated\n\nEight counties make up the Nature Coast, which stretches along the Big Bend area from Apalachee Bay to Anclote Key, according to FloridaNatureCoast.org. The National Hurricane Center said Wednesday that radar imagery indicated the eye of Idalia made landfall along the coast near Keaton Beach in Taylor County, one of the most rural and economically challenged areas of the state.\n\nTaylor County, the southernmost county in the Big Bend, has a population of about 22,000, ranking it 54th in population out of the state's 67 counties. In 2021, about 18% of the residents lived below the poverty line.\n\nStorm is 'unprecedented' in the region\n\nThe National Weather Service in Tallahassee described the storm as unprecedented because no major hurricane − Category 3 or higher − has hit Apalachee Bay. A storm of this magnitude has not slammed into the area since the late 1800s, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday during a news conference at the state's Emergency Operations Center.\n\nUniversity at Albany atmospheric scientist Kristen Corbosiero told The Associated Press that Idalia “is going to bring some pretty massive storm surge,” because of the Big Bend's unique shape.\n\n“The water can get piled up in that bay. And then the winds of the storm come around, they go around counter-clockwise, that’s going the same direction, the same shape of the bay so that water can just get pushed in there,\" she said.\n\nFranklin, Wakulla and Taylor counties, coastal areas on Apalachee Bay, did not have shelters available for evacuees. So some Floridians who live on the Gulf were forced to travel hours to Tallahassee to take shelter.\n\nForrest Allen and his wife Sheila sought shelter in Rickards High School on Tuesday from Taylor County after officials enforced a mandatory evacuation order and closed shelters. While settling in for the night in the Rickards' gym, Allen told the Tallahassee Democrat, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, their house is old and not in the best condition and the couple is worried it will be destroyed in the storm.\n\n\"We don't have insurance on the house, but of course we're hoping if there is some damage that FEMA can help us,\" he said.\n\nContributing: John Bacon and Christopher Cann, USA TODAY; Ana Goni-Lessan andAlaijah Brown, Tallahassee Democrat; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/severe/2023/08/28/tropical-storm-idalia-path-project-to-include-savannah-ga/70697580007/", "title": "Hurricane Idalia path projected to include Savannah, Ga.", "text": "Hurricane Idalia is likely bringing rain and winds to the Savannah area on Wednesday.\n\nThe latest model from the National Weather Service shows the storm making landfall along the western coast of Florida and then moving northeast across the state and the southeastern part of Georgia.\n\nThe storm, which officially became a hurricane early Tuesday, is strengthening while in the warm gulf waters and expected to be at least a Category 3 hurricane before landfall.\n\nGov.

The flight suits of the new crew were designed to match the colors of the emblem of Bauman Moscow State Technical University, from where all three cosmonauts graduated. The design of the uniforms was coordinated long before the current events. Seeing the Ukrainian flag everywhere and in everything is just a clinic [in propaganda],” another Roscosmos official wrote in his Telegram channel “Closed Space.”\n\nCosmonauts typically pick their flight suits months in advance, which would predate Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But it’s unclear when the cosmonauts selected this yellow and blue color scheme.\n\n“For Soyuz flights, typically the crew meets with the company that makes the suits months before flight and they are allowed two custom suits,” a NASA astronaut who has flown on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS told CNN. “Typically, one suit is the same across the crew, and the second suit is something personal.”\n\n“I think it would be a real challenge to make and launch these (flight suits) last minute. Not impossible though,” a former NASA astronaut who has also flown on a Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS said.\n\nWhen the three cosmonauts arrived at the space station Friday, they spoke to callers on the phone, one of whom asked about the yellow color. Commander Oleg Artemyev responded jokingly, “We actually had a lot of yellow material, so we had to use it. So that’s why we had to wear yellow.”\n\nVeteran former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who has been a staunch critic of Russia’s invasion, noted the uniforms in a tweet, written in Russian and English: “Three Russian cosmonauts who have just docked at the International Space Station have arrived in Ukrainian yellow!”\n\nCosmonauts Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov will spend the next six and a half months aboard the space station.\n\nWhen the hatch opened at 5:48 p.m. ET Friday, the three were welcomed aboard the ISS by two other Russian cosmonauts, four NASA astronauts, and one European Space Agency astronaut.

The toy was left to float around the cabin, signaling that the crew had entered weightlessness.\n\nEinstein, who first conceptualized the Theory of Relativity, had the “happiest thought of his entire life” when he realized that a “person in freefall can feel their own weight,” Cassada explained in a dispatch from the Crew Dragon spacecraft.\n\n“We live in the same world, we live in the same universe.

We can all keep that in mind … and continue to do amazing things,” Cassada said, and Kikina could be seen pumping her fist as he spoke. “And do it together.”\n\nThe SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft lifts off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday, October 5.

Terry Renna/AP In pictures: SpaceX's historic Crew-5 launch Prev Next\n\nDubbed Crew-5, the mission is the sixth astronaut flight launched as a joint endeavor between NASA and SpaceX, a privately held aerospace company, to the space station.\n\nThe spaceflight marks a historic moment, as Mann not only became the first Native American woman ever to travel to space. She’s also serving as mission commander, making her the first woman ever to take on such a role for a SpaceX mission.\n\nWhat’s more, Kikina is the first Russian to join a SpaceX mission as part of a ride-sharing deal NASA and Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, inked in July. Her participation in the flight is the latest clear signal that, despite mounting tensions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the decades-long US-Russia partnership in space will persist — at least for now.\n\nThe Crew Dragon spacecraft is now on a slow, precise trek to the ISS, which orbits about 200 miles (322 kilometers) above the Earth’s surface. The spacecraft is aiming to dock with the space station on Thursday around 5 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat’s notable about this flight?\n\nLaunching NASA astronauts to the space station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft is nothing new. The space agency collaborated with SpaceX for years to transition the task of shuttling people to and from the space station after NASA retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011.\n\nWith the return of astronaut launches from US soil, SpaceX has offered a stage for several historic firsts. The Crew-4 Dragon mission, for example, carried NASA astronaut Jessica Watkins, the first Black woman ever to join the ISS crew.\n\nOn this flight, Mann, a registered member of the Wailacki tribe of the Round Valley Reservation, became the first Native American woman ever to travel to orbit.\n\n“I am very proud to represent Native Americans and my heritage,” Mann told reporters before launch. “I think it’s important to celebrate our diversity and also realize how important it is when we collaborate and unite, the incredible accomplishments that we can have.”\n\nIn her role as commander, Mann will be responsible for ensuring the spacecraft is on track from the time it launches until it docks with the ISS and again when it returns home with the four Crew-5 astronauts next year. Never before has a woman taken on the commander role on a SpaceX mission, though a couple of women served in that position during the Space Shuttle Program.\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with Crew Dragon spacecraft sat at launch pad 39A on October 3 as preparations continued for the Crew-5 mission. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nKikina, the Roscosmos cosmonaut, became the first Russian ever to launch on a SpaceX vehicle at a time when US-Russian relations are hitting near fever pitch over the Ukraine war.\n\nOfficials at NASA have said repeatedly that joint operations with Russia on the ISS, where the two countries are the primary operators, will remain isolated from the fray. Kikina’s flight comes just weeks after NASA’s Dr. Frank Rubio launched to the ISS aboard a Roscosmos Soyuz capsule.\n\n“I really love my crewmates,” Kikina told reporters after she arrived at the Florida launch site on Saturday. “I really feel good, comfortable. … We will do our job the best way: happy.”\n\nDuring a post-launch news conference, Sergei Krikalev, the executive director of Human Space Flight Programs at Roscosmos, commented on the significance of the US-Russian partnership.\n\n“We just continue what was started many years ago, in 1975 when the Apollo-Soyuz crew worked together,” Krikalev said, referring to an in-space meet up in 1975 that became a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation between the United States and Russia. “Now we continue that.”\n\nREAD MORE: Meet the space trailblazers of color who empowered others to dream\n\nWho are the other astronauts on board?\n\nMann and her fellow NASA astronaut Josh Cassada, who grew up in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, both joined NASA in 2013. Cassada has described Mann as one of his “closest friends on the planet.”\n\nAs with Mann, this mission is the first trip to space for Cassada and Kikina.\n\nFor veteran astronaut Wakata, who has previously flown on both NASA’s space shuttle and Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft, this trip marks his fifth spaceflight mission.\n\n“I still remember when I first flew and saw our beautiful home planet,” he recalled during an August press conference. “It was so wonderful, such a beautiful planet, then I felt very lucky to be able to call this planet our home.”\n\nWhat will they do in space?\n\nAfter reaching the ISS, the crew will join the seven astronauts already aboard the ISS — including four NASA astronauts, a European Space Agency astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts.\n\nThere will be a handover period, where the current ISS crew will help the newly arrived astronauts settle in before a separate Crew Dragon spacecraft brings the four astronauts who were part of SpaceX’s Crew-4 mission back home.\n\nThen the Crew-5 astronauts will set to work conducting spacewalks, during which astronauts exit the ISS, to maintain the space station’s exterior, as well as performing more than 200 science experiments.\n\n“Experiments will include studies on printing human organs in space, understanding fuel systems operating on the Moon, and better understanding heart disease,” according to NASA.\n\nCrew-5 is slated to return from space in about five months.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/world/spacex-nasa-astronaut-docking-iss-scn/index.html", "title": "SpaceX capsule to dock with ISS carrying international astronauts ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA SpaceX capsule carrying a multinational crew of astronauts linked up with the International Space Station on Thursday after a 29-hour trek.\n\nThe mission, called Crew-5, is a joint operation by NASA, SpaceX and their government partners around the world, including — for the first time — Russia, despite mounting tensions on the ground surrounding the invasion of Ukraine. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 12 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\nThe Crew Dragon capsule spent a day making a slow, methodical climb toward the space station. And as it approached the ISS, the spacecraft, which is fully autonomous, used its small onboard thrusters to stay oriented as it eased into its docking port. It first made physical contact with the ISS at 5:01 p.m. ET.\n\nAfter ensuring a vacuum-tight seal between the SpaceX spacecraft and the ISS, the hatch that separated the capsule and the space station was opened, officially joining the spacecraft.\n\nAs is routine for astronauts arriving at the ISS, the crew was able to send a video message to the ground that was aired on NASA’s livestream.\n\nThe SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule (center), carrying three astronauts and one cosmonaut, is seen birthed with the International Space Station on October 6.

And this is a very special crew because it’s the first time that we have a Russian cosmonaut flying on a Crew Dragon, so very special welcome to Anna (Kikina),” Cristoforetti said.\n\nThe spaceflight marks a historic moment, as Mann has become the first Native American woman ever to travel to space.\n\n“Look, Mom, I’m finally in space!” she said on the livestream dispatch from the ISS. Mann is also serving as Crew-5 mission commander, making her the first woman ever to take on such a role for a SpaceX mission.\n\nKikina, who is also experiencing her first-ever spaceflight, shared in the celebratory moment.\n\n“We overflow with emotions,” Kikina added.\n\nA Russian translator took over shortly after from her dispatch, relaying, “I’m extremely happy that I am here.”\n\nKikina then added through the translator: “A lot of people are working hard and will keep working hard to make sure … that our common (crewed) space exploration will continue to exist to develop further. We’re here and we’re living proof of it,” she said.\n\nKikina’s participation in this flight is part of a ride-sharing agreement inked by NASA and Roscosmos in July. Despite geopolitical tensions between the United States and Russia reaching a near fever pitch as the war in Ukraine has escalated, NASA has repeatedly said that its partnership with Roscosmos on the ISS is vital to continuing the space station’s operations and the valuable scientific research that is carried out on board.\n\nDuring a news conference on Wednesday, Sergei Krikalev, the executive director of Human Space Flight Programs at Roscosmos, also had commented on the significance of the US-Russian partnership.\n\n“We just continue what was started many years ago, in 1975 when the Apollo-Soyuz crew worked together,” Krikalev said, referring to an in-space meetup in 1975 that became a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation between the US and Russia. “Now we continue that.”\n\nThe Crew-5 astronauts will spend about five months in space. During their stay, they’re expected to conduct spacewalks to maintain the space station’s exterior, as well as perform more than 200 science experiments.\n\n“Experiments will include studies on printing human organs in space, understanding fuel systems operating on the Moon, and better understanding heart disease,” according to a NASA statement.\n\nThis is the sixth crewed mission that SpaceX, a privately owned company headed by controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk, has carried out on NASA’s behalf. The program stems from a $2.6 billion deal that NASA and SpaceX signed nearly a decade ago as part of the space agency’s efforts to hand over all transportation to and from the ISS to the private sector so that NASA could focus on exploring deeper into the solar system.\n\nAerospace giant Boeing also signed a similar contract, though it’s still working to get its commercial spacecraft, the Starliner, up and running. Its first crewed flight could happen in early 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, NASA has continued to extend its partnership with SpaceX, growing the value of their overall deal to encompass 15 total crewed missions at a value of more than $4.9 billion.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/08/world/spacex-crew-5-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html", "title": "Meet the history-making crew who just landed at the space station", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

They touched down after a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan at 7:28 a.m. ET.\n\nThe spacecraft experienced its deorbit burn at 6:34 a.m. ET Wednesday, which lasted over four minutes and helped slow the Soyuz down. Each step of the crew’s return was streamed live on NASA’s TV channel and website.\n\nThe Soyuz landed upright but ended up on its side due to winds pulling the parachute. Recovery teams assisted the crew in leaving the capsule. After landing, the Russian mission control center’s main screen shared the message, “Welcome back, Mark!” in English and “Touchdown!” in Russian.\n\nRussian mission control displayed a welcome message for Mark Vande Hei. NASA\n\nIt was a highly anticipated return that has only drawn more attention due to mounting geopolitical tensions over the past month, and NASA has repeatedly reaffirmed that it continues to work closely with Russian space agency Roscosmos.\n\nFrom left to right: Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei and Russian cosmonaut Pyotr Dubrov. NASA\n\nAfter a health check and a two-hour helicopter ride to the recovery staging city of Karaganda, Kazakhstan, Vande Hei will travel back to Houston aboard a Gulfstream jet, as other NASA astronauts have done before, and the cosmonauts will return to their training base in Star City, Russia. Vande Hei’s NASA plane will make a stop in Colonge, Germany, for refueling before heading home.\n\nJoint operations between NASA and Roscosmos at the Russian facilities at Baikonur, Kazakhstan, “continue to go well,” said Joel Montalbano, the manager of NASA’s International Space Station program, during a press conference on March 14.\n\nMontalbano’s remarks came as Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin made several fiery social media posts directed at the United States, including a heavily edited, partially animated video that appeared to threaten that Russian astronauts would abandon Vande Hei in space. Rogozin has long been known to share outlandish statements on social media. Former astronaut Scott Kelly just recently backed off of a Twitter war with Rogozin.\n\nVande Hei and Dubrov launched to the space station in April 2021, and together they have completed 5,680 orbits of Earth and traveled more than 150 million miles around our planet. Vande Hei has now broken the record for the longest single spaceflight by an American astronaut, which previously was set by Kelly at 340 days.\n\nNASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei (background) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Pyotr Dubrov launched to the space station in April 2021. NASA\n\nThe extended mission will allow researchers to study the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human body, like the Twins Study that Kelly and his twin, Mark, participated in during Scott’s long duration. The insights gathered from extended missions can better prepare NASA to send astronauts to the moon and on to Mars, according to the agency.\n\nThe Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft is seen as it lands in Kazakhstan. Bill Ingalls/NASA\n\n“Mark’s mission is not only record-breaking, but also paving the way for future human explorers on the Moon, Mars, and beyond,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a statement. “Our astronauts make incredible sacrifices in the name of science, exploration, and cutting-edge technology development, not least among them time away from loved ones. NASA and the nation are proud to welcome Mark home and grateful for his incredible contributions throughout his year-long stay on the International Space Station.”\n\nMark Vande Hei sits outside of the Soyuz spacecraft after landing. Bill Ingalls/NASA\n\nThis was Vande Hei’s second spaceflight, so he has logged a total of 523 days in space. It was Dubrov’s first flight.\n\nMeanwhile, Shkaplerov arrived on the space station in October along with a Russian director and actress who filmed the first movie in space. While they returned to Earth just weeks after their arrival, Shkaplerov remained on the space station and ends his fourth space mission with 708 total days spent in space.\n\nChange of command\n\nShkaplerov handed over command of the International Space Station to NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn Tuesday morning. Before handing Marshburn a ceremonial “key” to the space station, signifying the change in command, Shkaplerov reflected on his time in space, including some of the situations the crew have faced.\n\nRussian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov and NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei embraced during the change of command ceremony. NASA\n\n“It’s like some satellites tried to kill us,” he said, causing the assembled crew of 10 astronauts and cosmonauts to laugh. His comment was in reference to a Russian anti-satellite test that created debris in November.\n\nHe also reinforced the close-knit and familial nature of the space station crew, especially given current geopolitical tensions.\n\n“People have problems on Earth,” he said. “On orbit, we are one crew, and I think ISS is like a symbol of the friendship, cooperation (and) our flexible future of exploration of space. Thank you very much, my crew members. You are like my space brothers and space sister.”\n\nRussian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov poses with a ruler and color chart for a space archaeology experiment. NASA\n\nMarshburn said it was an honor and privilege to accept command of the space station, “continuing the international partnership and that legacy in spaceflight.” Marshburn thanked Shkaplerov for being a “wonderful commander.”\n\n“I can’t thank you enough for your dedication to the safety of the station, the safety of your crew, your humor, your friendship and your dedication to the flight control teams around the world,” Marshburn said.\n\nComings and goings\n\nAfter the departure of Vande Hei, Dubrov and Shkaplerov, the remaining space station crew includes Marshburn, along with NASA astronauts Raja Chari and Kayla Barron, European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer and the recently arrived Russian cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov.\n\nWhen the Russian trio docked with the space station on March 15, they sparked speculation by donning bright yellow spacesuits trimmed with blue. It raised questions about whether the three were showing solidarity with Ukraine by wearing its national colors and rebuking their own government’s invasion. So far, no definitive answer has been given.\n\nThe space station won’t be home to a crew of seven for long. The private Axiom Space-1 mission, carrying former NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria and US crew members Larry Connor, Eytan Stibbe and Mark Pathy, is launching to the space station no earlier than April 6. The Axiom crew will return after 10 days.\n\nThen, NASA’s SpaceX Crew-4 mission will bring NASA astronauts Kjell Lindgren, Bob Hines and Jessica Watkins, as well as ESA astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, to the space station later in April.\n\nNo spacewalks are currently on the schedule during this time of heavy crew rotation. NASA continues to investigate a “more than normal” amount of water discovered inside Maurer’s helmet after his first spacewalk on March 23. A thin layer of water was found inside his helmet once he returned to the airlock nearly seven hours after beginning the spacewalk. The crew are trying to understand what caused this and determine how to fix it.\n\n“The agency and our international partners are constantly identifying and mitigating risks of human spaceflight,” according to a NASA statement.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/18/world/russian-soyuz-space-station-launch-scn/index.html", "title": "All-Russian cosmonaut crew launches to International Space Station ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA trio of Russian cosmonauts launched to the International Space Station on Friday.\n\nCosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov lifted off aboard a Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad in Kazakhstan at 11:55 a.m. ET. The crew’s launch and trip to the space station, which should take just over three hours, will be streamed live on NASA’s website.\n\nIt’s the first spaceflight for Matveev and Korsakov, and the trio will spend the next six and a half months aboard the space station.\n\nThe cosmonauts manually guided the Soyuz through docking with the space station and successfully docked at 3:12 p.m. ET. The hatch opened at 5:48 p.m. ET and they were welcomed aboard the ISS by two Russian cosmonauts, four NASA astronauts and one European Space Agency astronaut. The crew were all smiles and embraced one another after floating through the hatch.\n\nThis brings the station’s crew count to 10.\n\nTypically, Russian Soyuz launches include two cosmonauts and at least one NASA astronaut or another international partner due to a crew swap agreement between Russian space agency Roscosmos and other agencies.\n\nIt’s not the first time an all-Russian mission has occurred – a Russian crew flew to the station in October to film the first movie in space.\n\nAlthough this cosmonaut launch occurs at a time when geopolitical tensions are mounting, the absence of other nations’ involvement is coincidental and based on a prior agreement between NASA and Roscosmos to a delayed crew swap for future missions in 2022.\n\n“We still plan to work the crew swap,” said Joel Montalbano, the manager of NASA’s International Space Station program, during a press conference Monday. “And so we still have scheduled training for Rocosmos to come to Houston, Hawthorne and our team to go over to Star City and train for the Soyuz.\n\n“As far as interactions with the White House – they are aware that we’re continuing these operations. We get questions from time to time, and we answered them, but today we’re continuing to work those agreements.”\n\nCosmonauts lift off aboard a Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome launchpad in Kazakhstan. NASA\n\nMontalbano did not respond to a question about extending the ISS partnership with Russia to 2030.\n\nWhen asked whether the current tensions on Earth have translated to the crew aboard the space station, Montalbano said, “When you’re in space, there’s no borders. You don’t see you don’t see country lines or state lines.”\n\n“The teams continue to work together. Are they aware of what’s going on Earth? Absolutely. Astronauts and cosmonauts are some of the most professional groups you’ll ever see. They continue to operate well, and there’s really no tension with the team. This is what they’ve been trained to do and they’re up there doing that job.”\n\nReturning to Earth\n\nOn March 30, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei is set to return to Earth alongside Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov.\n\nVande Hei – who launched to the ISS in April 2021 – surpassed NASA astronaut Scott Kelly’s record of 340 days in space on March 15, and when he lands in Kazakhstan, he will have set a new record for the amount of time a human has spent in space: 355 days.\n\nThe space agency sought to reaffirm Monday that it’s still working closely with Russian space agency Rocosmos on the International Space Station, despite mounting geopolitical tensions.\n\nJoint operations between NASA and Roscosmos at the Russian facilities at Baikonur, Kazakhstan, “continue to go well,” according to Montalbano. “I can tell you for sure Mark [Vande Hei] is coming home” on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, Montalbano said Monday. “We are in communication with our Russian colleagues, there’s no fuzz on that.”\n\nNASA officials did not say there would be any significant changes to plans to get Vande Hei back to the United States after he lands. He’ll travel home via a Gulfstream jet, as other US astronauts have before him.\n\nFor nearly a decade, Russia’s Soyuz vehicles had been the only means of getting astronauts to and from the space station. But that reliance ended after SpaceX debuted its Crew Dragon capsule in 2020, and the US regained human spaceflight capabilities.\n\nWhen Montalbano was asked by CNN’s Kristin Fisher about whether NASA has contingency plans in place if the US-Russia relationship further deteriorates, he said: “The International Space Station, I’ll tell you, it’s been the flagship model for international cooperation. We talked earlier (about) the interdependency that we have between the US and the Russian segment. That is why we are able to operate and how we’re operating…At this time there’s no indication from our Russian partners that they want to do anything different.

NASA TV/YouTube\n\nThis mission, called Crew-4, marks a return to the crewed launches that SpaceX conducts in partnership with NASA after the company concluded the first all-private mission to the space station for wealthy paying customers on Monday.\n\nOn board are NASA astronauts Kjell Lindgren, Robert Hines, and Jessica Watkins, and Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti, who is flying on behalf of the European Space Agency.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Crew-4.\n\nWhat makes this flight historic?\n\nJessica Watkins is the first Black woman to join the space station crew for an extended stay.\n\nThough more than a dozen Black Americans — including four Black women — have traveled to space since Guion Bluford became the first to do so in 1983, no Black woman has had the opportunity to live and work in space for an extended period, as the ISS has enabled more than 200 astronauts to do since 2000.\n\n“This is certainly an important milestone I think both for our [space] agency and for the country,” Watkins said during a press conference last month. “I think it really is just a tribute to the legacy of the black women astronauts that have come before me as well as to the exciting future ahead.”\n\nShe has a long history with NASA, having begun her career there as an intern, and she previously held roles at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, where she worked with the Curiosity Mars rover. A trained geologist, she’s studied the surface of the red planet.\n\nWatkins’ crew mates refer to her by the nickname “Watty.”\n\nWho else is on this mission?\n\nThis mission’s crew is one of the first to include just as many women as men.\n\nCristoforetti, who was on one previous mission to the ISS in 2014-2015, is the sole woman in ESA’s astronaut corps. But Cristoforetti told reporters last month that the situation was “bound to end very soon.”\n\n“We definitely expect to to have some some great female [ESA] colleagues by the end of the year,” she added.\n\nCristoforetti, a veteran of the Italian Air Force who’s earned her fighter pilot wings, joined ESA in 2009.\n\nThe SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Falcon 9 rocket used to launch the Crew-4 mission as seen on the launch pad Saturday, April 23 at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Joel Kowsky/NASA\n\nHines is a 22-year veteran of the US Air Force, and this marks his first time to travel to space since he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2017.\n\nLindgren, the commander for this mission, is certified in emergency medicine, and prior to being selected to take to the skies himself, he used to work as a flight surgeon on the ground at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, supporting other astronaut missions. Lindgren was born in Taiwan and spent much of his childhood in England before moving to the United States and attending the US Air Force Academy.\n\nThis group of four astronauts has spent months training together, and they even took some time to do some extracurricular bonding. Watkins noted they went on a kayaking trip in Eastern Washington “just to get to spend some time getting to know each other and understanding how we all function…and what makes each of us tick, and I think that’s going to be really crucial.”\n\n“We get along great. It is just such a joy to have these folks on this team,” Lindgren added.\n\nHow did they get to space?\n\nThe crew traveled aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, which, since entering service in 2020, has now launched seven crewed missions.\n\nThough SpaceX designed the Crew Dragon to be reusable and three capsules are already in service, Crew-4 is flying aboard a brand new spacecraft, which they named “Freedom.”\n\nThe Crew Dragon was developed by SpaceX under a $2.6 billion contract with NASA as part of the “Commercial Crew Program.” The idea behind the program was to move NASA into a customer role — allowing private companies to design, build and test a new spacecraft to serve NASA astronauts while still giving the company ownership over the vehicle.\n\nSince SpaceX controls the vehicle, it has the ability to sell seats to whomever it wishes, hence the all-private mission that the company just concluded and one previous space tourism mission that took off in September last year.\n\nAt NASA, the program has been deemed a success, and the space agency is adopting the same contracting method for several vehicles involved in its efforts to explore the moon.\n\nWhat will they do in space?\n\nNow that they’ve arrived on the ISS, the crew will get caught up with the seven astronauts already aboard the ISS — including three NASA astronauts and an ESA astronaut that were part of SpaceX’s Crew-3 mission, and three Russian cosmonauts.\n\nThere’ll be about a five-day handover period, during which the Crew-3 astronauts will help the Crew-4 astronauts settle in, before Crew-3 returns home aboard their own SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule.\n\nThen the Crew-4 astronauts will set to work on all the science experiments and space station maintenance duties they have on their to-do list.\n\n“Experiments will include studies on the aging of immune systems, organic material concrete alternatives, and cardiorespiratory effects during and after long-duration exposure to microgravity,” according to NASA. “These are just some of the more than 200 science experiments and technology demonstrations that will take place during their mission.”\n\nCrew-4 is slated to return from space in September, shortly after SpaceX launches its Crew-5 mission.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2022/03/19/spacex-launches-starlink-russian-cosmonauts-hint-support-ukraine/7049154001/", "title": "SpaceX launches Starlink; Russian cosmonauts hint support for ...", "text": "Space is important to us and that’s why we're working to bring you top coverage of the industry and Florida launches.

Saturday's launch was the booster's 12th mission to date, making it the new leader of SpaceX's Falcon 9 fleet.\n\nAn hour after liftoff, all 53 Starlink internet satellites packed into the payload fairing were successfully deployed. SpaceX founder Elon Musk, confirming mission success on Twitter, said it also marked the company's heaviest payload to date at nearly 36,000 pounds.\n\nSpaceX has launched 42 dedicated missions for the Starlink internet constellation serving more than 250,000 users around the world. That includes the government of Ukraine, which so far has received two shipments of terminals – essentially small satellite dishes with built-in WiFi routers – directly from SpaceX to help in the fight against Russia.\n\nCosmonauts hint support for Ukraine\n\nLess than a day earlier on Friday, Russian cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Sergey Korsakov, and Denis Matveyev launched from Kazakhstan in a Soyuz spacecraft and arrived at the ISS.\n\nWhen they exited Soyuz and joined the crew, their yellow-and-blue flight suits – the same colors as the Ukrainian flag – quickly stole the show. No other cosmonauts or astronauts have worn such a bright color scheme; blue is usually preferred.\n\nAfter friendly hugs with their American, European, and Russian colleagues already on the ISS, the trio made time for a Russian-language news conference. Soyuz commander Artemyev took a question on the suits and essentially said to read between the lines.\n\n\"Each crew chooses their own suits and overalls so that everyone is not the same,\" he said. \"There are a lot of fabrics accumulated in yellow and it was necessary to start using them.\"\n\nWith the new Russian arrivals, the ISS' crew now stands at 10. NASA's Mark Vande Hei will use Friday's capsule to return to Earth on March 30 with cosmonauts Pyotr Dubrov and Anton Shkaplerov.\n\nThe Space Coast, meanwhile, is expected to take a break from launches until early next month. Barring last-minute schedule changes, SpaceX is set to fly from Kennedy Space Center's pad 39A no earlier than Sunday, April 3, with four private astronauts. The mission known as Axiom-1 will take the crew to the International Space Station for a roughly 10-day stay.\n\nFor the latest, visit floridatoday.com/launchschedule.\n\nContact Emre Kelly at aekelly@floridatoday.com or 321-242-3715.

Here's ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAstra, a startup building small rockets that launch out of rural Alaska, notched its first successful test flight on Friday night, putting a dummy satellite into orbit. The flight sent the company’s stock price on a tear — soaring more than 30% at one point after trading hours opened Monday morning.\n\nThe SpaceX Ax-1 Dragon capsule approaches the International Space Station, with the moon in the background. SpaceX/Axiom Space\n\nThe mission launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Friday morning. And the spacecraft, which separated from the rocket after reaching orbit, spent about 20 hours free flying through orbit as it maneuvered closer to the ISS.\n\nThe trip was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space, which seeks to book rocket rides, provide all the necessary training, and coordinate flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it. It’s all in line with the US government’s and the private sector’s goal to boost commercial activity on the ISS and beyond.\n\nOn board this mission, called AX-1, are Michael Lopez-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut turned Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor.\n\n#Ax1 crew welcomed by the @space_station crews as they leave Dragon and enter into their home for the next 8 days pic.twitter.com/ewgYizC2Kv — Axiom Space (@Axiom_Space) April 9, 2022\n\nAfter reaching the ISS aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, they joined seven professional astronauts already on board the space station — including three NASA astronauts, a German astronaut, and three Russian cosmonauts.\n\nIt’s not the first time paying customers or otherwise non-astronauts have visited the ISS, as Russia has sold seats on its Soyuz spacecraft to various wealthy thrill seekers in years past. Last year, for example, a Russian actress and film crew visited the ISS to film part of a movie in an historic first.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know.\n\nHow much did this all cost?\n\nIt’s not clear how much this mission cost. Axiom previously disclosed a price of $55 million per seat for a 10-day trip to the ISS, but the company declined to comment on the financial terms for this specific mission beyond saying in a press conference last year that the price is in the “tens of millions.”\n\nThe mission is made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated.\n\nThe space agency has revealed some details on how much it’ll charge for use of its 20-year-old orbiting laboratory.\n\nFood alone costs $2,000 per day, per person, in space. Getting provisions to and from the space station for a commercial crew is another $88,000 to $164,000 per person, per day. For each mission, bringing on the necessary support from NASA astronauts will cost commercial customers another $5.2 million, and all the mission support and planning that NASA lends is another $4.8 million.\n\nWho is flying?\n\nLopez-Alegría, a veteran of four trips to space between 1995 and 2007 during his time with NASA, is commanding this mission as an Axiom employee.\n\nAx-1 Crew (left to right) Larry Connor, Mark Pathy, Michael López-Alegría, and Eytan Stibbe. Chris Gunn for Axiom Space\n\nFor more about the three paying customers he’s flying alongside, check out our coverage here.\n\nIs it safe to go to the ISS, given the Russia conflict?\n\nRussia is the United States’ primary partner on the ISS, and the space station has long been hailed as a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation.\n\nUS-Russian relations on the ground, however, have hit a fever pitch amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The United States and its allies have slapped hefty sanctions on Russia, and the country has retaliated in numerous ways, including by refusing to sell Russian rocket engines to US companies. The head of Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, has even taken to social media to threaten to pull out of the ISS agreement.\n\nDespite all the bluster, NASA has repeatedly sought to reassure that, behind the scenes, NASA and its Russian counterparts are working together seamlessly.\n\n“NASA is aware of recent comments regarding the International Space Station. US sanctions and export control measures continue to allow US-Russia civil space cooperation on the space station,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a recent statement. “The professional relationship between our international partners, astronauts and cosmonauts continues for the safety and mission of all on board the ISS.”\n\nAre they astronauts or tourists?\n\nThis is a question stewing in the spaceflight community right now.\n\nThe US government has traditionally awarded astronaut wings to anyone who travels more than 50 miles above the Earth’s surface. But commercial astronaut wings — a relatively new designation handed out by the Federal Aviation Administration — might not be handed out quite so liberally.\n\nLast year, the FAA decided to end the entire Commercial Space Astronaut Wings program on January 1, 2022. Now, the FAA plans to simply list the names of everyone who flies above the 50-mile threshold on a website.\n\nWhether it’s fair to still refer to people who pay their way to space as “astronauts” is an open question, and countless observers — including NASA astronauts — have weighed in.\n\nNot everyone is too concerned about mincing words.\n\n“If you’re strapping your butt to a rocket, I think that’s worth something,” former NASA astronaut Terry Virts told National Geographic when asked about the issue. “When I was an F-16 pilot, I didn’t feel jealous about Cessna pilots being called pilots. I think everybody’s going to know if you paid to be a passenger on a five-minute suborbital flight or if you’re the commander of an interplanetary space vehicle. Those are two different things.”\n\nSpaceX/Axiom Space\n\nIf you ask the AX-1 crew, they don’t love being referred to as “tourists.”\n\n“This mission is very different from what you may have heard of in some of the recent — especially suborbital — missions. We are not space tourists,” Lopez-Alegría told reporters earlier this month, referring to the brief supersonic flights put on by Jeff Bezos’ company Blue Origin. “I think there’s an important role for space tourism, but it is not what Axiom is about.”\n\nThe crew did undergo extensive training for this mission, taking on much of the same tasks as professional astronauts-in-training. But the fact is that the three paying customers on this flight — Stibbe, Pathy, and Connor — weren’t selected from a pool of thousands of applicants and aren’t dedicating much of their lives to the endeavor.\n\nAxiom itself has been more flippant about word usage in the past.\n\n“Commercial human spaceflight. Space Tourism. Whatever you call it — it’s happening. And soon,” the company wrote on its website.\n\nWhat will they do while they’re in space?\n\nEach of the crew members has a list of research projects they plan to work on.\n\nConnor will be doing some research on how spaceflight affects senescent cells, which are cells that have ceased the normal replication process and are “linked to multiple age-related diseases,” according to Axiom. That research will be done in partnership with the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Elon Musk wants to get to Mars with this behemoth rocket 05:05 - Source: CNN Business\n\nAmong the items on Pathy’s to-do list is some additional medical research, focused more on children’s health, that he’ll conduct in partnership with several Canadian hospitals, and some conservation-awareness initiatives.\n\nStibbe will also do some research and focus on “educational and artistic activities to connect the younger generation in Israel and around the globe,” according to Axiom. Stibbe is flying on behalf of the Ramon Foundation — a space education non-profit named for Israel’s first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. ​Stibbe’s Axiom bio says he and Ramon shared a “close” friendship.\n\nDuring downtime, the crew will also get a chance to enjoy sweeping views of Earth. And, at some point, they’ll share a meal with the other astronauts on board. Their food was prepared in partnership with celebrity chef and philanthropist Jose Andrés. Their meals “lean on flavors and traditional dishes of Commander López-Alegría’s native Spain,” according to Axiom.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/04/09"}]}

She placed third in the uneven bars.\n\nHere is more about her amazing performance at nationals:\n\nWhat's at stake at Tokyo Olympics?\n\nWhen Biles represented the United States in Rio de Janeiro, her mission was winning gold.

With the 2020 Games a year away, we catch up with two of the famous Final Five and two alternates:\n\nSimone Biles: After making history in Rio, Biles took two years off from competition to experience life outside the gym. In the 712 days between the 2016 Olympics and the 2018 U.S. Classic, the most decorated American gymnast of all time stayed plenty busy. Biles wrote a memoir, finished fourth on the 24th season of Dancing with the Stars, performed with the Houston Texans cheerleaders, adopted a French bulldog puppy and traveled to picture-perfect beaches around the world.\n\nWhen she returned to the gym in August 2017, Biles began with conditioning and basics, but a video USA Gymnastics posted to Youtube eight months later teased never-before-seen upgrades that topped what the 22-year-old performed in Rio.\n\nAt the U.S. Classic last July, she won the all-around, vault, floor and beam titles. A month later, she became the first American woman to win five national all-around titles and the first to sweep every event title since Dominique Dawes did the same in 1994. She rewrote the record books once again at the 2018 world championships by winning her fourth world all-around crown, golds in the team, floor and vault competitions, silver on the uneven bars and bronze on the beam. Biles’ grand total 14 world championship gold medals is the most in gymnastics history.\n\nIt’s safe to say that, barring serious injury, Biles is a lock for 2020. Now training under Laurent Landi, the coach who guided Madison Kocian to a silver on the uneven bars in 2016, Biles is a serious medal contender on all events. She continues to upgrade her skills ahead of Tokyo, as shown in videos posted on Instagram and her domination of the 2019 U.S. Classic this past weekend in Louisville. She seemingly has no ceiling.\n\nAs she said herself, comeback Biles is better than the 2016 Olympic champ.\n\nMyKayla Skinner: Skinner wasn’t a member of the Final Five who stood atop the podium in Rio, but she served as an alternate and continued her gymnastics career at the collegiate level. Competing for the University of Utah, Skinner won two individual NCAA titles and completed 161 consecutive routines without a fall. On April 25, she announced she would return to training at the elite level with a goal of making the 2020 Olympic team.\n\nShe recently attended national team camp and started her comeback in the U.S. Classic last weekend. She will compete next month in the U.S. Championships in Kansas City.\n\nLaurie Hernandez: The human emoji is back in the gym and eyeing 2020 after enjoying the whirlwind of opportunities that arise from winning Olympic medals. Hernandez is the latest of the 2016 squad to return to training, but she picked up some extra hardware in her time off. A few months after winning silver on the balance beam and a team gold medal, Hernandez conquered ballroom dancing on the 23rd season of Dancing With the Stars and added a mirror ball trophy to her collection. She also co-hosted American Ninja Warrior Junior and published a memoir.\n\nHernandez has moved to training at Gym-Max, the former home of Olympic, world and NCAA champion Kyla Ross, in Costa Mesa, California. It is unclear how serious the return plans are.\n\nRagan Smith: The youngest gymnast on the 2016 Olympic team and an alternate, Smith seemed poised to emerge as Team USA's leading all-arounder. Going into the 2017 world championships, she was a favorite to win medals in multiple events given her all-around titles at the American Cup and the nationals. But torn ligaments in her left ankle forced Smith to withdraw from worlds before the all-around final, and she struggled to bounce back from the injury. In 2018, she traveled to the world championships as an alternate.\n\nOn July 7, Smith announced on Instagram that she would be attending the University of Oklahoma this upcoming fall.

She was also an all-state selection in both volleyball and soccer — leading those teams in kills and goals, respectively — and closed her amazing 2022-23 run by winning a gold medal with Team USA at the FIBA Women's U19 World Cup.\n\nKienholz, a graduate of the Class of 2023, was a human highlight reel for the Governors in football, basketball and baseball. The quarterback amassed 70 total touchdowns — 46 as a passer and 24 more as a rusher — while leading Riggs to a sixth consecutive state title.

Elkhorn North senior Drew Harper fielded the ball cleanly and fired a laser to catcher Maverick Christiansen, who applied the tag for the state-title-clinching out at the plate. The play kicked off a wild celebration for Elkhorn North, which held on for the 2-1 win for a state title.\n\nSee the full clip of this wild play here:\n\nBASEBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Walker Martin, Eaton High School (Eaton, Colorado)\n\nWhy he won: Showcasing his sweet swing from the left side of the plate, Martin led the nation with 20 home runs and tied a national record with a nine-game homer streak. There were other mind-boggling numbers — like a .633 batting average — for the senior shortstop, who led Eaton to 41 consecutive victories and a three-peat Class 3A state title. Martin became the 10th highest-position player from Colorado ever selected in the MLB Draft when the San Francisco Giants selected him No. 52 overall.\n\nSOFTBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Sage Mardjetko, Lemont High School (Lemont, Illinois)\n\nWhy she won: Lemont’s ace was about as close to perfect as it gets, posting a 22-0 record with a 0.00 ERA; the senior didn't allow an earned run in 137 innings pitched. Her incredible stat line for the season included 326 strikeouts, 11 no-hitters and two perfect games. For a Lemont team that finished 34-1, Mardjetko struck out 24 batters in the team’s 1-0 win over Antioch in the state final. To top it off at the plate this season, she batted .386 with five home runs and a .754 slugging percentage.\n\nBOYS TRACK & FIELD ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Simeon Birnbaum, Stevens High School (Rapid City, South Dakota)\n\nWhy he won: It was quite a run for this spring for Birnbaum, who closed the 2022-23 academic year ranked at the top of every major distance event in the country. He earned three gold medals at the South Dakota Class 2A championships, taking first in the 800 meters, 1,600 meters and 3,200 meters. The University of Oregon-bound track and cross country runner didn't stop there, adding three wins at both the HOKA Festival of Miles and Brooks Invitational, along with one more at the Nike Outdoor Nationals.\n\nGIRLS TRACK & FIELD ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Shawnti Jackson, South Granville High School (Creedmoor, North Carolina)\n\nWhy she won: Jackson’s superb senior track season has her in the conversation for best overall high school athlete in the country. At the NCHSAA 2A state championships, she earned the sprint trifecta and moved up to No. 2 in the U.S. at the 200-meter distance with a time of 22.70 seconds. At the Music City Track Carnival, she became the third girl in high school history to run the 100 dash in under 11 seconds. At the Aggie Classic, she clocked a U.S. No. 2 time at the 400-meter distance (52.13, PR). The University of Arkansas will be adding a budding star to their women’s track and field team.\n\nGIRLS FLAG FOOTBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Mieke Rowe, Alonso High School (Tampa, Florida)\n\nWhy she won: The quarterback for the top-ranked high school team in the country, Rowe finished her senior year with 5,016 passing yards, 95 passing touchdowns and just 11 interceptions. Florida’s Miss Flag Football added 205 yards and four scores as a rusher. Also the state’s Class 2A Player of the Year, Rowe led the Ravens to a 23-0 record and the school’s first flag football state title since 2019.\n\nDEFENSIVE FOOTBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Caleb Downs, Mill Creek High School (Hoschton, Georgia)\n\nWhy he won: USA TODAY’s No. 13 overall recruit in the Class of 2023, Downs took home some major honors, including Georgia Gatorade Player of the Year and MaxPreps First-Team All-America. The cerebral and hard-hitting safety, now playing for Nick Saban at the University of Alabama, anchored the Hawks’ run to the Class 7A championship. He recorded 76 tackles on the season and made five interceptions, returning two of them for touchdowns.\n\nOFFENSIVE FOOTBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Lamar Sperling, Archbishop Hoban High School (Akron, Ohio)\n\nWhy he won: It was a special senior season for Sperling, who was named Ohio Mr. Football after rushing for 3,867 yards and 58 touchdowns — the latter a single-season state record. He’s the first athlete from Summit County to win Ohio's Mr. Football since 2013. Sperling led Hoban to a runner-up finish in the Division II state game. He then helped the Knights win a state title in basketball, earning him Boys Athlete of the Year honors at the Greater Akron-Canton High School Sports Awards in June.\n\nSPECIAL OLYMPICS ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Kali Ohlemacher, Sandusky High School (Sandusky, Ohio)\n\nWhy she won: What Ohlemacher accomplished this season transcends sports. She was an advocate who lobbied on Capitol Hill for continued and increased funding for Special Olympics, and has been striving to help build more Unified Champion programs in high schools across the country. On top of playing every Unified sport her school offered, Ohlemacher served as a youth leader who traveled to the USA Games as part of the Ohio delegation; a mentor to fellow students as part of her Unified club; a social media content creator and Special Olympics health messenger; and a USA delegate for the 2023 Global Youth Leadership Summit that was held this past June in Berlin.\n\nBOYS LACROSSE PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Matt Jeffery, Cheshire High School (Cheshire, Connecticut)\n\nWhy he won: The top-ranked player in the Class of 2024 by the National Lacrosse Federation led Cheshire to a 20-3 record and the CIAC Class M state title. Now a two-time All-American, and already committed to defending national champion Notre Dame, Jeffery poured in 55 goals and added 42 assists this season. He was dynamite in the playoffs, netting four goals in the quarterfinals before going off for six goals and two helpers in the state game. He also netted the game-winning goal in the Southern Connecticut Conference final.\n\nGIRLS LACROSSE PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Chloe Humphrey, Darien High School (Darien, Connecticut)\n\nWhy she won: Perennial lacrosse power Darien captured its first undefeated season in program history, and Humphrey was in the driver’s seat. Named the top recruit in the Class of 2023 and a First-Team All-American by Inside Lacrosse, the University of North Carolina-bound attacker scored on a staggering 72 percent of her shots this spring. That high level of execution helped Humphrey finish with 103 goals and 38 assists, earning her national player of the year honors by USA Lacrosse. For good measure, the Blue Wave finished No. 1 in the final Nike/USA Lacrosse National Top 25 poll.\n\nBOYS BASKETBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Isaiah Collier, Wheeler High School (Marietta, Georgia)\n\nWhy he won: The Naismith Boys High School Player of the Year, Collier was the perfect floor general for Wheeler, which ran away with Georgia’s 7A state title. He dropped a game-high 22 points in the state game, shooing 9 for 13 from the floor while dishing out seven assists. That stat line was not far off his season averages of 19.5 points, 6.6 assists, 5.5 rebounds and 2.3 steals per game. USC fans are champing at the bit to see Collier play at the next level. As ESPN’s top-ranked recruit in the Class of 2023, he’s arguably the Trojans’ top high school recruit since Evan Mobley.\n\nGIRLS BASKETBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Juju Watkins, Sierra Canyon High School (Los Angeles, California)\n\nWhy she won: Rarely is there a consensus player of the year pick among platforms, but Watkins was just that spectacular for Sierra Canyon. The tone was set over the summer of 2022, when she was named FIBA World Cup tournament MVP for USA Basketball’s U17 women’s national team. Watkins’ season averages for the Trailblazers during the high school season included 28 points and 14 rebounds per game. The USC-signee poured in a career-high 60 points during Sierra Canyon’s senior night game and earned just about every major postseason accolade, including Naismith Girls High School Player of the Year.\n\nBOYS CROSS COUNTRY RUNNER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Kole Mathison, Carmel High School (Carmel, Indiana)\n\nWhy he won: Although there was incredible talent across the board in high school cross country this season, only one runner claimed both state and national championships. That runner was Mathison, who in December dusted an elite field of runners at the Champs Nationals, held in San Diego. He also repped team USA at the World Cross Country Championships, placing 25th overall to help the U20 national team take home bronze medals. At the state meet, Mathison, bound for the University of Colorado, finished 1-2 with Carmel teammate Tony Provenzano, helping the Greyhounds win the IHSAA team state title.\n\nGIRLS CROSS COUNTRY RUNNER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Irene Riggs, Morgantown High School (Morgantown, West Virginia)\n\nWhy she won: What Riggs accomplished — winning gold at the Nike Southwest Regionals, Nike Cross Nationals and West Virginia state meet — is even more impressive considering how her senior season started. In a freak accident, according to an article published by Runner’s World, the rear tire of a friend’s car rolled over Riggs’ foot, leaving her in a walking boot and out of action for the month of September. She returned even stronger. On top of her national title, Riggs ran the second-fastest high school girls 5K race in history with her time of 16 minutes, 2.1 seconds at the Nike regionals. She closed her high school career with three individual state titles and will next compete at Stanford.\n\nBOYS GOLFER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Kihei Akina, Lone Peak High School (Highland, Utah)\n\nWhy he won: Akina defended his title as Utah state 6A golf champion in dominant fashion, posting matching rounds of 64 to finish 16-under par. The star sophomore’s total score of 128 tied the individual state tournament record. To get there, Akina carded birdies on two of his final three holes. His effort helped Lone Peak break the state record for team score by eight strokes — ending with a 43-under score of 533. As the No. 28 overall boys Junior golfer in the country, according to USA TODAY’s GolfWeek, Akina will be a player to follow this summer and beyond.\n\nGIRLS GOLFER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Sophie Linder, Gordonsville High School (Gordonsville, Tennessee)\n\nWhy she won: Linder closed her brilliant career as the fourth-ever Tennessee high school golfer to win four state individual titles. No. 4 came with its fair share of drama. Trailing as she stepped to the 18th tee box, Linder birdied to force a playoff — and then birdied again on the first playoff hole to win state. The senior, bound for Ole Miss, shot a sparkling 63 on Day 1 of the tournament and finished with an 8-under 132. That overall score was just one stroke off breaking her own record for the lowest two-round state tournament score in TSSAA girls golf history.\n\nHUMANKIND COURAGE AWARD\n\nWinner: Lucy Art, University School of Milwaukee (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)\n\nWhy she won: Less than two years after surviving a shark attack, Art returned to competitive high school swimming and captured the Wisconsin Division II state title in the 50 freestyle. The recent University School graduate was in neck deep water, swimming off the coast of Florida while on vacation with her family, when she felt something aggressively and repeatedly bumping into her legs. The shark grabbed a hold of Art’s right arm before she was able to punch herself free and head for shore. The attack left her with puncture wounds to her legs and a bite to her right wrist that required surgery to repair four cut tendons and a main artery. Her long road to recovery included six months of physical therapy and a renewed motivation to swim collegiately. She’ll do just that as a member of the Colgate University women’s team.\n\nBOYS TEAM COACH OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Ken Leonard, Sacred Heart-Griffin High School football (Springfield, Illinois)\n\nWhy he won: The stars aligned in a miraculous way for Leonard and the Cyclones, who completed a 14-0 season by winning the IHSA Class 4A state title in Leonard’s 500th and final game as a high school football coach. In those 500 games, the winningest coach in Illinois state history piled up 419 total wins and six state championships over 43 seasons. The cherry on top? Leonard’s son, Derek, coaches at crosstown rival Rochester High School and has already won eight state titles of his own.\n\nGIRLS TEAM COACH OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Krystle Johnson, Hoover High School (Hoover, Alabama)\n\nWhy she won: Hoover’s powerhouse program is celebrating its most dominant stretch in school history under Johnson, who led her alma mater to a Class 7A three-peat and top-10 national ranking this past season. Johnson surpassed 300 career coaching victories in December and the Bucs finished with a 35-1 record overall. One of the most decorated girls basketball players in Hoover’s history, Johnson returned to the program as the head varsity coach in 2016 and has found nothing but success.\n\nBOYS BOWLER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Kendric Siders, Eagle River High School (Eagle River, Alaska)\n\nWhy he won: It was a record-setting year on the lanes for Siders, who earned Alaska Bowler of the Year honors behind a state-record scoring average of 238 per game. He also owned the state’s high game (296) and top two-game series (547). Eagle River was dominant on the lanes, losing just one individual game and no matches as a team. After the state tournament, Siders carried the momentum into the Storm Youth Championships in Las Vegas, where he finished first in the U18 boys division and rolled his first sanctioned 300 game.\n\nGIRLS BOWLER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Eliana Occhino, Christian Brothers Academy (Syracuse, New York)\n\nWhy she won: The sophomore finished as New York’s composite state champion, taking home the individual title by 38 pins while bowling 200 or better in all six sets. At state, Occhino averaged 227.63, including high games of 239, 247 and 245. In March, she won a national competition at the U18 Storm Youth Championship in Louisiana. Most recently, she competed in the U.S. Women’s Open, pitting her up against some of the best bowlers in the world.\n\nBOYS SOCCER PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Vitor Geromel, Maize South High School (Wichita, Kansas)\n\nWhy he won: The All-American midfielder and Clemson commit was masterful all over the field for the Mavericks, who finished 21-0 and captured the first boys soccer state title in school history. Geromel tallied 42 goals and 18 assists, earning him state Class 5A midfielder of the year honors. At the conclusion of the high school season, Geromel signed an amateur contract and starred for the Sporting Wichita First Team of the United Premier Soccer League.\n\nGIRLS SOCCER PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Brinley Murphy, Bearden High School (Knoxville, Tennessee)\n\nWhy she won: The United Soccer Coaches National Player of the Year put on a show as both a goal scorer and playmaker. She scored 41 goals and added 23 assists during a senior season that ended with Bearden (24-0) repeating as state champions. A four-time first team all-state selection, Murphy closed her career with 110 goals. She’ll be a player to watch with the Gamecocks at South Carolina.\n\nBOYS VOLLEYBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Luca Curci, Newport Harbor High School (Newport Beach, California)\n\nWhy he won: With Curci leading the charge from the outside, the Sailors posted a 36-2 record and repeated as California Interscholastic Federation Southern Section Division I champions. Curci, a UCLA signee, was an all-around force, racking up 495 kills, 59 blocks, 131 digs and 48 service aces. He recorded a match-high 23 kills to help send Newport Harbor to the Division I final, and had 17 more in the team’s three-set sweep over rival Corona del Mar. Curci was named the league’s co-player of the year and was honored as a top-five recruit in the Class of 2023 in the Volleyballmag.com Fab 50.\n\nGIRLS VOLLEYBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Harper Murray, Skyline High School (Ann Arbor, Michigan)\n\nWhy she won: Accolades have poured in for Murray, an All-American outside hitter who was named Gatorade National Player of the Year. She was also honored as the girls volleyball winner at the Detroit High School Sports Awards in June. Bound for the University of Nebraska, Murray averaged six kills per set and finished the season with 663 kills, 372 digs, 73 service aces and 38 blocks. She completed her career at Skyline High with over 2,400 kills and 1,400 digs.\n\nBOYS HOCKEY PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Jayson Shaugabay, Warroad High School (Warroad, Minnesota)\n\nWhy he won: After the brilliant playmaker led the state of Minnesota in assists with 63 during the high school season, Shaugabay was drafted by the Tampa Bay Lightning with the 115th overall pick in the 2023 NHL Draft. He added 33 goals — including eight game-winners — to help Warroad go undefeated in the regular season and make a run to the state championship game. Shaugabay was honored as Minnesota Mr. Hockey and was also named the 2023 Minnesota Associated Press Player of the Year.\n\nGIRLS HOCKEY PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Rylee Bartz, Warroad High School (Warroad, Minnesota)\n\nWhy she won: Score another one for Warroad. In fact, few can score like Bartz, who after leading the state of North Dakota in points during the 2022 season, moved to Minnesota (the state where she’ll be attending college) and did the exact same thing. Bartz posted 59 goals and 48 assists for Warroad, which finished 26-3-1 and won the Class A state title. And how about this for a triple-double? Bartz finished the year with 10 hat tricks, 10 game-winning goals and and 10 points in Warroad’s three state playoff games. She’s continuing her career at the University of Saint Thomas in nearby St. Paul.\n\nFIELD HOCKEY PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Olivia Bent-Cole, Camden Catholic High School (Cherry Hill, New Jersey)\n\nWhy she won: Entering the 2022-23 academic year, Bent-Cole was named the No. 1 recruit in the Class of 2023 by MAX Field Hockey. She more than lived up to the hype. After being named state player of the year by NJ.com and national player of the year by MAX Field Hockey, Bent-Cole was elevated to the U.S. Women’s National Team. On the way, she led Camden Catholic to the program’s first state championship since 1985, piling up 38 goals and 16 assists. She’ll be continuing her field hockey career at Northwestern University.\n\nGYMNAST OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Marissa Ashton, Buford High School (Buford, Georgia)\n\nWhy she won: Ashton put on a show in repeating as Georgia’s Class 6A/7A all-around state champion. Behind a perfect-10 floor routine and other top finishes on bears and beam, the senior posted an all-around score of 39.575. That effort also led Buford to a repeat team title, giving the program its fifth state title since 2014. Ashton, who will continue her career at San Jose State, was also named Gymnast of the Year by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nBOYS WRESTLER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Ben Kueter, Iowa City High School (Iowa City, Iowa)\n\nWhy he won: One of the greatest high school athletics careers in Iowa history came to a close this winter, as Kueter claimed his fourth individual state wrestling title and finished with a 111-0 record on the mat. He was dominant throughout his four high school wrestling seasons, as 74 of those victories came by way of pin. Kueter will be fun to watch at the University of Iowa as a dual-sport athlete. He plans to both wrestle and play football, as he comes to the Hawkeyes as a four-star linebacker and Under Armour All-American on the gridiron.\n\nGIRLS WRESTLER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Audrey Jimenez, Sunnyside High School (Tucson, Arizona)\n\nWhy she won: Jimenez’s star shined brightest at the Arizona state tournament, where she captured her third career girls individual title. She made even more noise this year wrestling against boys. In January, she became the first woman to win any weight class in the 56-year-old Peoria Tournament of Champions; she went 4-0, all matches against men, in the 106-pound weight class. She followed that up with a championship win at the U.S. Open in Las Vegas, and added her second title at the U20 Nationals in Spokane, Washington.\n\nBOYS SWIMMING & DIVING ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Will Modglin, Zionsville High School (Zionsville, Indiana)\n\nWhy he won: Modglin’s monster season included a national record swim in the 100 backstroke, besting a 12-year old mark previously held by four-time Olympic gold medalist Ryan Murphy. Modglin broke that record during a prelim race at Indiana’s state championship meet, and then went on to post three-peat individual titles in both the 100 back and 200 individual medley. He added a third gold medal with Zionsville’s 200 freestyle relay team. The University of Texas signee was also named Swimmer of the Year at the Indiana High School Sports Awards in April.\n\nGIRLS SWIMMING & DIVING ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Teagan O’Dell, Santa Margarita Catholic High School (Rancho Santa Margarita, California)\n\nWhy she won: The sophomore sensation had a banner year, putting her name on a pair of national records. Individually, she broke the girls national 200 individual medley record at the CIF championships, besting the previous record held by Olympian and 2021 USA TODAY National Swimming & Diving Athlete of the Year, Torri Huske. Earlier in the year, O’Dell helped down another national record with her team in the 200 freestyle relay. O’Dell added a second individual title in the 100 backstroke, giving her three gold medals and three state records at the CIF meet.\n\nBOYS TENNIS PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Nicholas Patrick, Alleman Catholic High School (Rock Island, Illinois)\n\nWhy he won: Ranked as a blue-chip prospect by the Tennis Recruiting Network, Patrick has looked the part through two high school seasons. The rising junior has posted a 50-0 record with back-to-back 1A singles championships. The Illinois Western Big 6 MVP rolled through sectionals without dropping a game. The first three-set match of his career came in this year’s state singles final; after dropping a tiebreaker that squared the match at 1-1, Patrick responded with a 6-3 win to extend his reign as state champ.\n\nGIRLS TENNIS PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Stephanie Yakoff, Fort Lee High School (Fort Lee, New Jersey)\n\nWhy she won: Yakoff became just the third girl in state history to claim three New Jersey high school singles championships while closing her career with a 63-0 record. In this year’s singles final, she worked her way past fellow blue-chip prospect Erin Ha, winning 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 in what was her lone three-set match of the season. The NJ.com girls tennis player of the year will continue her playing career at Harvard. Named after Grand Slam champion Steffi Graf, the only question now is how far Yakoff’s blossoming career will take her.\n\nBOYS TEAM OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: St. John Bosco High School football (Bellflower, California)\n\nWhy they won: Bosco’s collection of talent this year was unmatched, deploying Division I college commits at nearly every position. But the Braves didn’t solidify the No. 1 spot in USA TODAY’s final Super 25 poll until they beat arch-rival and third-ranked Mater Dei, 24-22, in front of a massive crowd at the Rose Bowl in the CIF Southern Section championship game. A couple of weeks later, Bosco marched its way to a blowout win in California’s open state final, putting the finishing touches on a 13-1 season against arguably the toughest schedule in the country.\n\nGIRLS TEAM OF THE YEAR\n\nWinner: Carmel High School swimming and diving (Carmel, Indiana)\n\nWhy they won: The Greyhounds, aptly named for their annual dominance in the pool, captured their 37th consecutive Indiana state title — extending the national record for most consecutive team championships in any sport. This year’s group set a pair of national relay records in the 200 freestyle and 200 medley, and added records for event wins (10) and total team points (498) at the state meet. Individually, Carmel had three of the top performers at state in sophomores Alex Shackell and Lynsey Bowen, and freshman Molly Sweeney. The three underclassmen combined for six individual wins and three state records, sending a message that this Carmel swim and dive dynasty is far from over.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2023/08/05/simone-biles-us-classic-gymnastics-tv-schedule-how-to-watch/70514368007/", "title": "Simone Biles at U.S. Classic gymnastics: TV schedule, how to watch", "text": "Simone Biles is back.\n\nRoughly two years after mental health issues prompted her to withdraw from several events at the Tokyo Olympics, the 19-time world champion will return to competition Saturday night at the 2023 U.S. Classic. The event serves as a qualifier for nationals later this month and comes less than one year from the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.\n\nBiles, 26, has been quietly training for several months and wrote on Instagram this week that she has moved past her bout of \"the twisties,\" which made her feel lost in the air and led to her withdrawal in Tokyo. She pulled out of the team competition after just one event and skipped all of the individual events except the balance beam, where a reworked routine helped her win bronze.\n\nBiles, the 2016 all-around Olympic champion, is widely considered to be among the greatest gymnasts of all-time.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Biles' return at the U.S. Classic:\n\nWhen is the 2023 U.S. Classic?\n\nCompetition runs throughout the weekend at NOW Arena in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb northwest of Chicago. But the second session of the women's competition – when Biles will compete – is Saturday, from 8 p.m.-10 p.m. ET.\n\nHow to watch Simone Biles' return at the 2023 U.S. Classic\n\nBiles' session of competition will be televised live on CNBC and Peacock, NBC's streaming service. NBC will also run a show recapping all the highlights from the U.S. Classic from 4:30 p.m.-6 p.m. ET on Sunday.\n\nWho else is competing at the 2023 U.S. Classic?\n\nBiles will not be the only star making a return this weekend. Suni Lee, the Tokyo Olympics all-around gold medalist, is coming back from a kidney issue that forced her to end her most recent collegiate season early.\n\nTokyo Olympians Jade Carey, who won gold on floor exercise , and Jordan Chiles, part of the U.S. team that won silver, and world championship medalists Leanne Wong and Kayla DiCello are among the other familiar names who are expected to compete.\n\nIs Simone Biles competing in 2024?\n\nBiles has not explicitly said she is pursuing a spot on the 2024 Olympic team, but her return to competition at this juncture surely suggests that is the case. With one more Olympic medal, she would break her current tie with Shannon Miller for the most Olympic medals by a U.S. gymnast. (Both women have seven.)\n\nBiles also would tie Vitaly Scherbo as the most-decorated gymnast of all time with another medal at either the world championships later this year or the Olympics. Scherbo, who competed for the Soviet Union, Unified Team and Belarus, won a combined 33 medals at worlds and the Olympics – though he competed in two more events.\n\nHow many gold medals does Simone Biles have?\n\nBiles won a whopping four golds at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro – in the team event, individual all-around, vault and floor exercise. She also won a bronze in the balance beam final. In 2021, she managed to win two more medals even while fighting \"the twisties\" − silver in the team event, and another bronze on balance beam.\n\nFollow Tom Schad on Twitter @Tom_Schad", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/high-school/2020/04/15/vote-north-jerseys-greatest-female-athlete-legends-second-round/2985352001/", "title": "Results for North Jersey's Greatest Female Athlete: Legends second ...", "text": "Last year, we published the North Jersey All-Decade teams, recognizing the top athletes of the 2010s. But that got us thinking: Who is North Jersey's best athlete of all-time?\n\nWe came up with the top 64 male and top 64 female athletes in North Jersey history, and seeded them March Madness-style into four regions for the men and four regions for the women.\n\nHow do these athletes advance to the next round?

She was the 2001 National Scholastic champ in the 400 hurdles and holds the Passaic County record in that event.\n\n(8) Bryeanne Ravettine: With 15 gold medals at the Bergen County championships, Ravettine is the most decorated swimmer in county history. She was part of eight winning relay teams at IHA and won seven individual gold medals. She went on to swim at Liberty University.\n\nSteph Thomas vs. Brittany Baiunco\n\n(4) Steph Thomas: She's still the gold standard for pitchers in New Jersey, setting the all-time record for victories with 113, plus 68 shutouts while at IHA. In her career, she had 951 strikeouts and a 0.54 ERA. She is one of just two pitchers ever to win three Bergen County titles in the circle.\n\n(12) Brittany Baiunco: The right-hander pitched in four county softball championship games, winning three – the first pitcher to do so. She also led Ramapo to a state title in 2006. She combined a jaw-dropping fastball with a screwball that made her practically unhittable.\n\nLexi Knief vs. Carin Cone\n\n(3) Lexi Knief: She was the only girl to make the North Jersey All-Decade team in both soccer and softball. A state champion in soccer, softball was her best sport; she finished with 195 career hits at Ramsey and went on to play at Penn State.\n\n(6) Carin Cone: Cone, now Vanderbush, was 16 years old in 1956 and a junior at Ridgewood when she won the silver medal at the Olympics in the 100-meter backstroke. She set seven world records and 24 American records in swimming.\n\nChelsea Steinberg vs. Nickolette Driesse\n\n(10) Chelsea Steinberg: The most decorated gymnast in Bergen County history, Steinberg won four county titles and three state championships for Ridgewood.

On Thursday, she picked up top honors among American female athletes.\n\nBiles was named the Team USA Female Olympic Athlete of the Year, with a record-breaking year for the 18-year-old Texan helping her beat the likes of Serena Williams and Katie Ledecky.\n\nBiles’ award was announced at the Team USA Awards on Thursday night, but she was unable to attend because she was at the U.S. National Team camp.\n\nEarlier this fall, she became the first woman to win three consecutive world championships. Her four golds there in back-to-back years is also a record.\n\nThat haul, with a bronze medal for five total at the event, made her the first woman to win 10 career worlds gold medals. Her total of 14 ties her for third all-time and ranks her first among American gymnasts, male or female.\n\nBrennan: Want to swim in this Olympic water?\n\nThe meet was only a continuation of Biles’ dominance for more than two years.\n\nShe won a third consecutive U.S. championship this year, making her the first woman to do so in 23 years. She has won the all-around title in every meet she’s competed in since August 2013, and usually in dominating fashion.\n\nThe Spring, Texas, native will be a heavy favorite to win Olympic gold in Rio next summer.\n\nTo claim the USOC’s top honors, she beat out a dominant class of U.S. women — including Williams in a year during which she became the only woman to win four consecutive Grand Slam titles twice.\n\nBiles also won the award over Ledecky, who became the first swimmer to win the 200-, 400-, 800- and 1,500-meter freestyle events in the world championships. Gwen Jorgensen, who became the first triathlete ever (man or woman) to complete an undefeated season, and Adeline Gray, a wrestler who won her third world title at 75 kg, were also finalists.\n\nThe top 10 sports disappointments of 2015: From LeBron to Serena\n\nBiles' award marks the first time a gymnast has won it since 2008, when Olympic gold medalist Nastia Liukin shared top honors with swimmer Natalie Coughlin.\n\nShe is the fourth gymnast to be named USOC’s top female athlete. Carly Patterson, whose all-around gold in 2004 in Athens was the first by a U.S. woman since Mary Lou Retton, and Kim Zmeskal, who in 1991 was the first U.S. woman to win the world title, also previously won the award.\n\nWrestler Jordan Burroughs, who went undefeated to win his third world championship in the men’s freestyle 74-kg. division, was named the Male Olympic Athlete of the Year.\n\nThe U.S. women’s soccer team was named Olympic Team of the Year after becoming the first nation to win three FIFA World Cup titles.\n\nAfter her third consecutive grand slam of world marathon majors — a streak of wins in the London, Boston, Chicago and New York City marathons — Tatyana McFadden was named the Female Paralympic Athlete of the Year.\n\nGermany deals IOC and Bach a message: No thanks, to Olympics\n\nCyclist Joe Berenyi earned honors as the Male Paralympic Athlete of the Year after winning three medals, including two golds, at the UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships.\n\nHonors for Paralympic Team of the Year went to the U.S. sled hockey team, which went undefeated in 2014-15.\n\nFollow Rachel Axon on Twitter @RachelAxon.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2020/03/24/ncaa-gymnastics-floridas-trinity-thomas-racks-up-all-american-honors/2909050001/", "title": "NCAA gymnastics: Florida's Trinity Thomas racks up All-American ...", "text": "While her sophomore season ended prematurely, Trinity Thomas has earned more accolades for her incredible campaign for the University of Florida.\n\nThe West York grad and decorated gymnast was named a regular-season NCAA All-American in all four events and the all-around by the Women’s Collegiate Gymnastics Association on Tuesday.\n\nThe WCGA determines its All-American list using the final qualifying scores in the Road to Nationals rankings. The top eight gymnasts in each event are named a first-team All-American while the ninth through 16th gymnasts are named second team.\n\nThomas earned first-team honors in the floor exercise (first), uneven bars (fourth), balance beam (second, tied) and all-around (second). She earned second-team honors in the vault (14th).\n\nMore:With no NCAA championships, York gymnast Trinity Thomas focuses on unclear Olympics\n\nMore:Watch it: York County gymnast Trinity Thomas earns another perfect 10 with Florida\n\nShe was one of three gymnasts in the country to earn the maximum of five honors.\n\nShe now has earned nine WCGA All-American honors in her first two seasons after being the only freshman in the nation to earn four distinctions last year. She also earned a postseason All-American honor in the floor exercise at the NCAA Championships a year ago.\n\nThe most distinguished gymnast to come out of York County, Thomas was striving to become a national champion this spring and seemed to have a very good chance of accomplishing that goal. She scored a perfect 10.0 four times this season and was the only gymnast in the country to accomplish the feat in three events (bars, beam and floor).\n\nThomas was also hoping to lead No. 2 ranked Florida to a team national title.\n\nBut her NCAA championship dreams are on hold for another year following the NCAA's cancellation of all winter and spring postseason events due to the ongoing crisis surrounding the new coronavirus.\n\nShe was set to prepare for the Olympic trials, which were scheduled to take place in St. Louis in June. But those preparations are also now on hold.\n\nOn Tuesday, the International Olympic Committee and Japanese government agreed to postpone the 2020 games in Tokyo \"to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021\" due to the ongoing pandemic.\n\nIt remains to be seen that how the postponement affects her training and chances for the upcoming games.

Her 25 medals are two more than Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus – who had two more events to collect his, mind you.\n\nOf Biles’ 25 medals, a whopping 19 are gold, including every one she won this year: team, all-around, vault, beam and floor. It’s the first time she’s won five golds at worlds, and is sure to spark conversation of whether she can do the same thing at next summer’s Tokyo Olympics.\n\nMore:Biles surprised by her greatness: I really don't know how I do it sometimes\n\n“Oh God, I can't pick one,” Biles said when asked what will stick with her most. “I think this is probably my best worlds performance I've ever put out, so I would say overall. All of them.”\n\nBiles had tied Scherbo on Saturday after winning the vault title. That she would pass him Sunday was a given, considering she’s the reigning world and Olympic champion on floor and has won a medal on beam at every worlds she’s done.\n\nThat she got the record on beam was extra sweet, because it gave her redemption, too.\n\nBiles had won the beam title at the 2014 and 2015 worlds, and was the favorite for the gold in Rio. But her foot slipped on the landing of a front tuck, and she had to grab the beam to keep from falling off. She still won a bronze medal, but her confidence was shaken.\n\nAnother wobbly performance last year, which also earned her a bronze, only deepened her insecurities.\n\nBut Cecile Landi, who coaches Biles with husband Laurent and is responsible for beam, reworked her routine and helped her regain her faith in herself. She has been as consistent as a metronome at this meet — no small thing, given how many falls there were, across every phase of the competition.\n\nOn Sunday, she worked the 4-inch-wide beam with swagger, with nary a wobble or bobble on any skill.\n\nWhen her score — a 15.066 — popped up, a huge grin spread across Biles’ face and she jumped out of her seat. She threw a roundhouse punch in the air, then exchanged a high-five and hug with Laurent Landi.\n\n“Cecile has really been working on bringing my confidence back up to where it used to be on beam, so to go out there and nail the routine just like I do in practice, it felt really good,” Biles said. “I'm thrilled with that performance.”\n\nShe led off her floor exercise with the best triple-twisting, double somersault that she’s done yet, getting huge height and sticking it as if she had glue on her feet. She beamed, and the crowd roared in appreciation.\n\nShe did go out of bounds on the leap that punctuates another pass, but it was a minor deduction.\n\nWhen Biles finished, she didn’t drop the mic as she did at the end of the all-around competition. Instead, she took a moment and then blew kisses while Laurent Landi clapped his hands over his head.\n\n“She’s incredible,” Landi said. “You don’t want to look at (the medals), just. We were here to do the job. The goal is to hit four out of four, every day, day after day. This is what she has shown everybody and to herself, her consistency not only in training but when it counts.\n\n“At the end of the day, if she can do this for eight more months, she’ll be very, very successful.”\n\nBiles was already in gymnastics’ G.O.A.T. conversation before the Rio Olympics, and she left there with five medals, four of them gold. When she returned, having taken a year off after the Games, she worried that she had already reached her peak, and wouldn’t be able to duplicate what she did in Rio.\n\nShe has. And then some.\n\nIt’s clear Biles has no peer in gymnastics, having won every all-around competition she’s been in since the 2013 U.S. championships. But she’s now so dominant, the fairer comparisons are with the likes of LeBron James, Serena Williams or Tom Brady.\n\nOr, in Olympic terms, Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt.\n\nTheir sports are different, yes. But their singular achievements, as well as the way they’ve changed their games, are very much the same.\n\nBiles leaves these world championships with two more skills named after her: the triple-double on floor and her double-twisting double somersault dismount off balance beam. The double-double is so difficult the International Gymnastics Federation actually gave it a lesser value than it deserves in order to deter other, less-capable gymnasts from trying it.\n\nBiles now has four skills named after her, two on floor and one each on beam and vault. She’s added all but one in the last year.\n\n“When you’ve had so much success in the sport, what brings you back in the gym is something original. Some different stuff,” Laurent Landi said. “It’s not just winning, because it’s hard to motivate yourself. It’s much better to come with a purpose, putting your name in the Code of Points, or trying a different skill that nobody else did before.\n\n“When they get older and when they have achieved as much as she did,” Landi added, “this is a great way to motivate her to come back in the gym and to train.”\n\nIt is one thing to achieve greatness, but it is quite another to sustain it over a long period of time. And that is what this medals record really means.\n\nMaybe there will be another gymnast who will be able to match Biles’ skills that defy imagination as much as gravity. Maybe there will be another athlete with her athleticism or power. Maybe someone will have her longevity.\n\nBut all of it? Together?\n\n“We never expected somebody would dominate like this,” national team coordinator Tom Forster said. “Could it happen again? She’s proven it could. Will it? I don’t know.”\n\nSimone Biles isn’t just the best gymnast. She’s one of the best athletes, period.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2019/12/19/decade-best-ranking-top-50-athletes-over-last-10-years/4399929002/", "title": "From LeBron James to Tiger Woods to Simone Biles: Who made our ...", "text": "Ten years. In the world of sports, it can seem like an eternity.\n\nAs this decade began, the Yankees were reigning World Series champions, the Saints were about to win the franchise’s first Super Bowl title, Kobe Bryant was on his way to leading the Lakers to back-to-back NBA titles and Tiger Woods – with 14 major victories by the age of 34 – was seemingly a lock to break Jack Nicklaus’ record of 18.\n\nHow things have changed. The Yankees, Saints and Lakers have yet to return to the pinnacle of their sports, and Woods went 11 years before winning his 15th major.\n\nThen again, some stars who ruled the sports world in 2010 have managed to stay on top. Which ones deserve recognition as the greatest athletes of the past decade?\n\nThirty-five members of the USA TODAY Sports staff voted to determine the top 50 athletes of the decade.

LeBron James (786 points)\n\nThe start of the decade coincided with James entering his prime, having just turned 25. He delivered, playing in eight NBA Finals and winning three titles, being voted MVP twice and winning a gold medal in 2012. Plus nobody has scored more points since the start of the 2009-10 season than James. But it's his impact off the court that elevates James beyond other athletes of the 2010s, adding to his philanthropic efforts and becoming a leading voice on social and political issues.\n\n2. Serena Williams (781 points)\n\nNarrowly beat out by James, Williams is arguably the the greatest tennis player in history with 23 Grand Slam tournament singles titles, more than any man or woman in the Open Era. Not all of those majors came in this decade, but winning 10 of them – as well as Olympic golds in singles and doubles – after turning 30 might be an even more impressive feat.\n\n3. Tom Brady (742 points)\n\nA sixth-round draft choice in 2000, Brady's career has spanned two decades, and he's still going strong at 42. In the 2010s, he won two MVP awards (2010 season and '17) and led the Patriots to five Super Bowl appearances and three Super Bowl titles (2014 season, '16 and '18).\n\n4. Simone Biles (740 points)\n\nBiles hit the elite gymnastics scene as a 14-year-old in 2011. Two years later she claimed her first world championship gold medals, winning the floor exercise and all-around competitions. She won eight more golds at worlds in 2014-15 before leading the USA to team gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Individually, Biles won gold in the floor exercise, vault and all-around competitions with a bronze in the balance beam. After taking 2017 off, she returned by winning seven more individual golds at the 2018 and 2019 world championships.\n\nTEAM OF THE DECADE:US women end 2010s where they started it, as world's best\n\nCOACH OF THE DECADE:In evaluating coaches, no one was better than Nick Saban\n\n5. Usain Bolt (654 points)\n\nBolt was already an international star and Olympic champion when the decade started. But he added to his legacy by becoming the only sprinter to win gold medals in both the 100 and 200 meters in three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012, 2016). He also won 11 gold medals at the track and field world championships from 2009 to 2015. And he currently holds the world record in both the 100 and the 200.\n\n6. Mike Trout (610 points)\n\nTrout made his major league debut in 2011 at 19 and a season later won the AL Rookie of the Year award and finished second in AL MVP voting. He hasn't slowed down since. An eight-time All-Star, Trout has won three MVP awards and finished second four times. The only blemish on his career is a lack of postseason success, but he's only 28.\n\n7. Steph Curry (571 points)\n\nThe seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft, Curry quickly established himself as one of the game’s best shooters. He led the NBA in 3-point field goals for five consecutive seasons, including a record 402 in 2015-16. An All-Star in each of the past six seasons, Curry was named the league’s MVP in 2015 as he led the Warriors to their first NBA title in 40 years. The following year, Curry repeated as MVP as the Warriors finished with an unprecedented 73-9 record but lost the NBA Finals in seven games to the Cavaliers. Entering the 2019-20 season, Curry and the Warriors have represented the Western Conference in each of the past five NBA Finals, winning three.\n\n8. Lionel Messi (570 points)\n\nIn the decade’s greatest soccer rivalry, Messi comes out slightly ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo. A prolific goal-scorer, Messi has won a record six Ballon d’Or awards (five this decade) as the world’s top player. He has spent his entire pro career with Barcelona, where he holds the record of six Golden Boot awards as the leading scorer in the top division of the five major European leagues. The native of Argentina is his country’s all-time leading scorer with 70 goals in 138 international appearances. He also led Argentina to the 2014 World Cup final.\n\n9. Michael Phelps (541 points)\n\nAlthough many of his accomplishments came in the 2000s, Phelps arguably did enough alone in this decade to be considered the greatest swimmer in history. Following his unprecedented eight gold medal-winning performance at the 2008 Olympics, Phelps cut back his schedule – winning four golds and two silvers in 2012 in London. He was chosen as the U.S. flag bearer for the 2016 Rio Games, then added another five golds and one silver. His victories in the 200-meter butterfly and 200 medley made him, at 31, the oldest individual champion in Olympic swimming history.\n\nFROM BASEBALL:Dream team, position-by-position for the decade\n\nDARKEST MOMENT:Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal rocked the world\n\n10. Novak Djokovic (479 points)\n\nMen's tennis has been ruled by three players this decade. Of the three, Djokovic holds the upper hand. Of his 16 Grand Slam tournament titles, 15 have come since 2011 – including all five Wimbledon crowns and six of his record seven Australian Open titles. His 2015 season, in which he won three majors and reached the final in a fourth, is considered one of the greatest in history.\n\n11. Katie Ledecky (443 points)\n\nLedecky is quite simply the most dominant freestyle swimmer in history. At 15, she claimed her first Olympic title in 2012, setting a record for an American and winning the 800-meter freestyle by more than four seconds. Breaking world records and going undefeated in every international final she entered between the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, Ledecky hit more milestones at the 2016 Rio Games. She won gold in the 200-, 400- and 800-meter free, posting world-record times in the 400 and 800 that still stand. All told, she’s set 14 world records.\n\n12. Kevin Durant (398 points)\n\nStarting in the 2009-10 season, Durant led the league in points five years in a row with the Thunder, went to the 2012 Finals, was league MVP in 2013-14 and won Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. But Durant didn’t become an NBA champion until he joined the Warriors in 2016. He won back-to-back titles (winning Finals MVP) and was the leading playoff scorer last season until he was hurt before the Finals.\n\n13. Rafael Nadal (396 points)\n\nThe King of Clay won the French Open eight times during the decade and three of the four Grand Slam tournaments in 2010. He’s the reigning champion at the French and U.S. Open. Nadal was ranked No. 1 for 140 weeks, including now, and No. 2 for 133 weeks.\n\n14. Cristiano Ronaldo (387 points)\n\nHe signed with Real Madrid before the turn of the decade and dominated, scoring 40 or more goals three times and winning back-to-back Ballon D’Or awards in 2013 and 2014 and 2016 and 2017. He was named the top forward as Portugal won UEFA Euro 2016. He transferred to Juventus in 2018 and led that team to a first-place finish in his first year.\n\n15. Aaron Rodgers (297 points)\n\nThe Packers' quarterback was MVP of the 2011 Super Bowl XLV win against the Steelers, throwing for 304 yards and three touchdowns. He was NFL MVP in 2012, when the Packers went 15-1, and he had a career-best 4,643 passing yards and 45 TD passes. He picked up six All-Pro nods and won 10 or more games seven times, including this season.\n\n16. Roger Federer (273 points)\n\nHe began the decade ranked No. 1 and finished No. 3. There was a lot of fluctuation in there, including a drop to 16, but he won five Grand Slam tournaments and the Federer-Nadal rivalry remains fun to watch.\n\n17. Sidney Crosby (268 points)\n\nThe hockey world wondered if the Penguins' star would be able to return from a concussion suffered in the 2011 Winter Classic. He spent parts of two seasons on the sideline but came back strong. He led the league with 104 points in 2013-14 to win MVP and was playoff MVP twice as the Penguins won back-to-back Stanley Cup titles in 2016 and 2017, the first NHL team to do that since the late 1990s.\n\nFROM HOCKEY:The people, places, things that have changed NHL\n\nFROM NASCAR:Top feuds feature familiar names, iconic moments from decade\n\n18. Clayton Kershaw (256 points)\n\nThe Dodgers' pitcher dominated in the regular season, winning the Cy Young Award in 2011, 2013 and 2014. He was voted National League MVP in 2014, when he went 21-3 with a 1.77 ERA. He hasn’t been able to repeat that dominance in the postseason, though, with a combined 5.40 ERA in World Series games.\n\n19. Alex Ovechkin (239 points)\n\nThe runaway NHL goal-scoring leader of the decade. The Capitals' star scored his 600th goal on March 12, 2018, and is closing in on 700. Ovechkin eliminated the one blemish on his career by winning the Stanley Cup in 2018.\n\n20. Carli Lloyd (217 points)\n\nA force on the U.S. Women’s National Team, she scored the winning goal in the 2012 Olympics, was captain of the 2015 World Cup team and had a hat trick in the championship game against Japan. She scored three goals in the 2019 World Cup as the USA repeated as champion.\n\n21. American Pharoah (160 points)\n\nYes, horses are athletes too. American Pharoah won the Triple Crown in 2015, the first to do so since Affirmed in 1978. He took the Kentucky Derby by 1 length, the Preakness Stakes by 7 lengths and the Belmont Stakes by 5½ lengths. Trained by Bob Baffert, American Pharoah went on to win the Breeders’ Cup Classic, the first to win all four races in one year.\n\n22. Floyd Mayweather Jr. (154 points)\n\nMayweather added to his perfect record by winning nine fights in the decade, including a 10th-round TKO of UFC fighter Conor McGregor in August 2017. That gave Mayweather a 50-0 record, surpassing Hall of Fame boxer Rocky Marciano’s 49-0 mark. Mayweather announced on Instagram in November that he was “coming out of retirement in 2020,” but no bout has been scheduled.\n\n23. Max Scherzer (123 points)\n\nScherzer started the decade as an up-and-comer who just completed his first full season in the major leagues. He finishes the 2010s with the most strikeouts and wins in the decade, three Cy Young Awards and a newly earned World Series title.\n\n24. Lindsey Vonn (119 points)\n\nVonn's decade as a skier was filled with remarkable achievements and excruciating injuries. She won Olympic gold in the downhill and a bronze in the super-G at the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. In 2013, she suffered torn knee ligaments and a broken leg and did not fully recover in time for the 2014 Olympics in Sochi. Vonn returned to the Games in 2018, taking bronze in the downhill. She announced her retirement in 2019 after claiming a record 82 World Cup victories, the most of any female skier in history. She also has seven world championship medals and was the first female skier to win medals at six world championships.\n\n25. Mikaela Shiffrin (118 points)\n\nThe world’s dominant slalom skier has won the World Cup season title six times. Shiffrin, 24, also has won three consecutive overall World Cup titles. Currently tied for second on the list of World Cup victories with 62, Shiffrin could pass Ingemar Stenmark’s record of 86 before the Beijing Olympics in 2022. At the 2014 Olympics at 18, she became the youngest to win Olympic gold in slalom. Four years later, Shiffrin won gold in the giant slalom and silver in the combined.\n\n26. Maya Moore (104 points)\n\nThe five-time, first-team All-WNBA honoree helped the Lynx win four championships since her rookie year in 2011. Moore was also named MVP in 2014. She has missed only one game in eight seasons, with career averages of 18.4 points and 5.9 rebounds per game. In February, Moore, 30, announced that she would sit out the 2019 season to focus on family and “some ministry dreams.”\n\n27. James Harden (86 points)\n\nA seven-time All-Star and two-time NBA scoring champion, Harden was the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year (2011-12) with the Thunder before he was traded to the Rockets. Since the trade, Harden, 30, has averaged 29.4 points and 7.7 assists. He’s led the NBA in scoring each of the past two seasons: 30.4 points in 2017-18 – when he was the league MVP – and 36.1 points in 2018-19.\n\n28. Justin Verlander (83 points)\n\nVerlander won two Cy Young Awards in the decade, including one in 2019 when he became the oldest pitcher to achieve the feat since 42-year-old Roger Clemens did it in 2004. Now 36, Verlander is second to Max Scherzer in wins and strikeouts in the 2010s and first in innings pitched. He also won a World Series title with the Astros in 2017.\n\n29. Elena Delle Donne (69 points)\n\nShe is the first player in WNBA history to win MVP honors with two teams: the Sky in 2015 and the Mystics in 2019. A seven-year veteran, Delle Donne, 30, led the Mystics to the team’s first league championship in 2019. She is the first player in WNBA history to shoot over 50% from the field, over 40% from 3-point territory and over 90% from the free throw line in a season (2019).\n\n30. Tiger Woods (57 points)\n\nWoods hasn’t been the same since he crashed his Escalade outside his Florida mansion on the day after Thanksgiving in 2009. He endured personal scandal and several surgical procedures on his back. But Woods had his share of moments of triumph on the golf course. He was named PGA Tour Player of the Year in 2013 and won 11 tournaments in the 2010s. His Masters victory in 2019 was one of the decade's most dramatic moments and marked his 15th career major, keeping Woods within reach of Jack Nicklaus' record of 18.\n\n31.

It used to be that such widespread cancellations would leave travelers stranded at airports, sleeping atop their bags and competing for scraps of food and drink.\n\nNow, airlines are much more likely to cancel flights ahead of time and let passengers know right away. Industry analysts attribute this pre-emptive strike to better technology plus new federal rules that punish airlines if they keep passengers waiting in planes on airport tarmacs for too long.\n\n\"Airlines are now totally proactive instead of being essentially reactive,\" says Alan Bender, professor of aeronautics at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. \"Proactive means cancel selected flights in advance, rebook passengers in advance, phone and e-mail passengers frequently, etc.\"\n\nLong tarmac delays can cost them big money. The Transportation Department can fine airlines up to $27,500 per passenger for tarmac delays of more than three hours on domestic flights. Earlier this year, the department hit JetBlue Airways with a $90,000 fine for a long tarmac delay at New York's JFK airport.\n\n\"Not stranding passengers is now priority No. 1 as the (Transportation Department) hammer means millions of dollars in fines and 'being made an example of,' \" Bender says. \"Up until the new (department) policy went into effect, priority No. 1 was moving planes and crews. Passengers were viewed as something akin to 'glorified cargo.' There were no real penalties other than meal vouchers, etc., for having people wait and be inconvenienced for hours or even days.\"\n\nAirlines won't comment on whether or not the new rule makes them more likely to cancel flights. But airline executives say it's made them plan better for bad weather.\n\n\"I don't know that it's made us cancel more flights,\" says Wayne Newton, managing director of system operation control for Alaska Airlines. \"It's just driven us to be smarter about what we do with airplanes when there is a big storm.\"\n\nExtensive cancellations can have a ripple effect on an airline's entire system. And it can take 24 to 48 hours for things to get back to normal, Newton says, because passengers have to be rebooked and crew members have to take their legal periods of rest.\n\nNewton says the carrier has a sophisticated system in place to anticipate storms and come up with contingency plans.\n\nFor instance, the airline doesn't rely only on the National Weather Service for predictions. It has contracts with other vendors to get data in four-hour windows. Analysts then compare all the information to decide if and when to cancel flights.\n\n\"I think we've gotten a lot better at being precise when the weather is going to hit, where and when,\" he says. \"Canceling prior makes it very easy. You know where your crews are and you can put them where you need them the next day.\"\n\nMichelle Mohr, a spokeswoman for US Airways, says the airline comes up with de-icing and staffing plans for winter weather emergencies months in advance of the season. \"It's in the heat of the summer that they're thinking about it,\" she says.\n\nAirlines have also gotten more flexible about letting passengers reschedule their flights in anticipation of a storm without incurring the usual change fees. That cuts down on long lines at the airports.\n\nDarryl Jenkins, an airline analyst and chairman of the American Aviation Institute, points out that airlines now have many more ways to communicate with passengers instantly, from e-mail to text messaging to social media. \"The communications modes are quicker. Everyone is following on Twitter,\" he says. \"You have a lot of options out there.\"\n\nMorgan Durrant, a Delta Air Lines spokesman, says that in addition to waiving rebooking fees, the airline offers passengers more ways to change flights, such as via apps on their smartphones.\n\n\"Delta has invested significantly in this area in recent years,\" Durrant says. \"Self-service functionality to change flights via the Fly Delta app, at Delta.com and at airport kiosks has all contributed to keeping customers out of airports during these events.\"\n\nAs problematic as a snow storm can be, Jenkins says that winter storms are actually a bit easier for airlines to deal with than summer thunderstorms.\n\n\"In the wintertime, it's easier because when a storm front comes in like this one you know about it further in advance,\" he says. \"In the summertime, a storm comes in with less warning.\"\n\nThat's not to say it doesn't create widespread headaches. Airlines are operating fuller flights during the holidays.\n\n\"Anytime you have load factors that can be 80% or 90% and you cancel any flight, it could take up to a day and a half to bring people into the system,\" Jenkins says.\n\nFor those who made their flights on Wednesday, the weather made for a less than pleasant travel experience.\n\nKevin Boucher, 29, was stranded on the tarmac and at the gate for more than three hours Wednesday at Dulles International Airport outside Washington as he tried to get home after visiting relatives. His United flight to Austin was due to take off at 8:20 a.m., the director of a consulting firm said.\n\nBut it was delayed because of de-icing and refueling. \"Now they're waiting to de-ice again,\" he said at 11:20 a.m. \"Everyone is restless,\" he e-mailed.\n\nPassengers had the option of getting off, he said, but were told if they did, they might not be let back on if the plane suddenly got the green light to depart.\n\nAt 12:20 p.m., he e-mailed better news. \"Still on runway, but about to leave.\"\n\nContributing: Kitty Bean Yancey", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2023/07/04/flight-delay-compensation-rights-policy/70379132007/", "title": "Are you entitled to compensation if your flight is delayed?", "text": "Department of Transportation rules around delays of U.S. are murky.\n\nThere's no official requirement for passengers to receive a refund or reimbursement in a result of a flight delay.\n\nHere's what each of the major carriers said they do in the event of a significant delay.\n\nThousands of passengers were stranded at airports around the country in the last few weeks as airlines, particularly United, dealt with the fallout from staffing shortfalls among air traffic controllers and summer storms in the Northeast. Confusingly for many passengers, the severe delays and cancellations didn't necessarily entitle them to compensation from the airlines, because weather and air traffic control delays are seen by the Department of Transportation as largely out of carriers' control.\n\nThat doesn't mean airlines can't voluntarily give passengers compensation in those cases, but it's essentially at the airlines' discretion.\n\nWhat are you entitled to if your flight is delayed?\n\nU.S. airlines are required by the DOT to give passengers refunds if their flights are outright canceled, but the rules around delays are a little murkier.\n\nThere's no official requirement for passengers to receive a refund or reimbursement as a result of a flight delay, though the DOT's delay and cancellation dashboard can help travelers better understand what they're entitled to.\n\nSummer travel headaches:What airlines owe you when flights are canceled, delayed\n\n\"DOT has not specifically defined 'significant delay,' \" the site says. \"Whether you are entitled to a refund depends on a lot of factors – such as the length of the delay, the length of the flight, and your particular circumstances.\"\n\nThe rules are different – and more traveler-friendly – in Europe, where laws require airlines to compensate passengers at least 250 euros for delays of three hours or more, and up to 600 euros for longer delays on long-distance flights. Domestic flights in the U.S. have few protections if something goes wrong. For the most part, it's up to individual airlines to decide how to compensate their passengers after a delay.\n\nTraveling to Europe?:Pack clean underwear in your carry-on\n\n“There’s no specific policy on compensations,\" said Shaiy Howard, president and CEO of Travel by Shaiy, a travel agency based in South Florida. \"Just keep in mind that all airlines vary. When you purchase your airline ticket, in the terms and conditions, there can be delays and normally, they say you’re not entitled to compensation for certain delays like weather.”\n\nHere's what each of the major carriers said they do in the event of a significant delay:\n\nAmerican Airlines flight delay compensation policy\n\nPassengers can receive a refund for unused portions of their ticket if they decide not to travel as a result of a delay. Customers may also receive compensation or reimbursement for delay-related hotel stays and ground transportation, depending on the cause of the delay, according to the airline's customer service plan.\n\nDelta Air Lines flight delay compensation policy\n\nAccording to the DOT, Delta commits to rebooking passengers on other Delta flights or partner airlines and will provide meal vouchers for passengers affected by delays over three hours for certain causes, as well as hotel accommodation and ground transportation for passengers affected by overnight delays for certain causes.\n\nUnited Airlines flight delay compensation policy\n\nAccording to the DOT, United commits to rebooking passengers on other United flights or partner airlines and will provide meal vouchers for passengers affected by delays over three hours for certain causes, as well as hotel accommodation and ground transportation for passengers affected by overnight delays for certain causes.\n\nSouthwest Airlines flight delay compensation policy\n\nAccording to the DOT, Southwest commits to rebooking passengers on other Southwest flights and will provide meal vouchers for passengers affected by delays over three hours for certain causes, as well as hotel accommodation and ground transportation for passengers affected by overnight delays for certain causes.\n\nJetBlue flight delay compensation policy\n\nJetBlue has an escalating compensation structure. The minimum compensation is $50 in travel credits after a three-hour departure delay, and the credit adjusts upward by $50 for every additional hour. The credit maxes out at $200 for delays of six hours or more.\n\nOnce passengers have boarded the aircraft, the compensation structure is $100 in credit for a delay between three and five hours, $175 in credit for a delay between five and six hours, or a $250 credit for a delay of six hours or more.\n\nPassengers are also entitled to compensation if they are delayed on the ground upon arrival, with a $50 credit for a delay of one to two hours, a $125 credit for a delay of two to three hours and a $200 credit for a delay of three hours or more.\n\nAs with other airlines, JetBlue will also rebook passengers on other JetBlue flights or partner airlines and will provide meal vouchers for passengers affected by delays over three hours for certain causes, as well as hotel accommodation and ground transportation for passengers affected by overnight delays for certain causes, according to the DOT.\n\nSpirit Airlines flight delay compensation policy\n\nAccording to the DOT, Spirit commits to rebooking passengers on other Spirit flights and will provide meal vouchers for passengers affected by delays over three hours for certain causes, as well as hotel accommodation and ground transportation for passengers affected by overnight delays for certain causes.\n\nFrontier Airlines flight delay compensation policy\n\nAccording to the DOT, Frontier will rebook passengers on other Frontier flights and will provide meal vouchers in the event of delays under certain causes that last for three hours or more.\n\nAlaska Airlines flight delay compensation policy\n\nAccording to the DOT, Alaska commits to rebooking passengers on other Alaska flights or partner airlines and will provide meal vouchers for passengers affected by delays over three hours for certain causes, as well as hotel accommodation and ground transportation for passengers affected by overnight delays for certain causes. The airline also offers credits, travel vouchers or frequent flyer miles for departure delays lasting three hours or more.\n\nHawaiian Airlines flight delay compensation policy\n\nAccording to the DOT, Hawaiian commits to rebooking passengers on other Hawaiian flights and will provide meal vouchers for passengers affected by delays over three hours for certain causes, as well as hotel accommodation and ground transportation for passengers affected by overnight delays for certain causes.\n\nWhat else should travelers know?\n\nThe three biggest pieces of advice experts offered were to join the airline's frequent flyer program, take the earliest flight out if possible and buy travel insurance.\n\n“I advise all my clients to purchase travel protection,\" said Howard, from Travel by Shaiy. Even if an airline doesn't compensate you following a delay, travel insurance may reimburse you for expenses like rental cars or hotel rooms that you incur as a result.\n\nShe added that it's a good idea to get the airline's app ahead of your trip and speak to the gate agent during the delay.\n\nMarc Casto, president of Flight Centre Travel Group, said it's also important to pay attention to which kind of ticket you purchase.\n\nAdvice for travelers:How to track and use your airline credits\n\n\"At the stage of buying, I would encourage travelers not to buy the cheapest fare. Those are the most likely passengers to get bumped,\" he said.\n\nCasto also said flyers should try to resolve their issue through the app or a messaging platform, which is usually faster than calling the customer service number or waiting in line at the airport.\n\nBooking through a third party like Expedia or Orbitz can also add a layer of complication if something goes wrong, Howard and Casto said, because airlines usually require passengers to make changes and file complaints through their booking agent, and the websites sometimes have different rules around compensation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/10/13/southwest-airlines-canceled-flights-travel-voucher-apology/8437403002/", "title": "Southwest Airlines canceled flights: How to get an apology voucher", "text": "Southwest has been quietly doling out goodwill vouchers in varying amounts to passengers it stranded last weekend.\n\nThe vouchers for future travel are in addition to refunds for canceled flights.

(I received one for a canceled Saturday flight.)\n\nSouthwest spokesperson Brandy King said affected passengers should automatically get the LUV voucher but notes the timetable \"might be slower than usual due to the number of customers we are processing.\"\n\nThe airline isn't saying much on how it's determining the vouchers' value, but the amounts appear to range from $100 to $250 per passenger based on USA TODAY interviews with affected travelers.\n\n\"We review each situation individually to determine the compensation based on level of inconvenience,\" King said via email. \"The level of inconvenience is a mix of length of delay, quality of reaccommodation options and flight cancellations.\"\n\nFrequent flyer status and persistence also appear to play a role.\n\nAsim Raza received an email about a $250 voucher late Tuesday. His son's Southwest flight from St. Louis to Washington, D.C., on Sunday was canceled and the family had to cash in American Airlines miles to get him back to college in time for a meeting.

She and a friend, both new mothers, were on a girls' trip that had been scratched four times because of the pandemic.\n\nSouthwest couldn't get them home for a couple of days so they cashed in a bundle of United miles for a last-minute flight out of Houston.

Nelson then received a letter from Southwest Wednesday saying you would be receiving a $250 voucher.\n\n\"This was not without what I would consider somewhat significant effort and proactive communication on my part,\" she said.\n\nNelson said she was pleased with Southwest's relatively speedy social media response but is unhappy she is out of money for the added travel costs.\n\nIn denying the expenses, Southwest told her via Twitter message that it understands you \"can't put a price tag on a customer's inconvenience.\"\n\n\"I said, right, but you can put a price on what I spent to get home Sunday,\" Nelson said.\n\nErika Ouellette is in the same situation. The North Carolina paralegal and her boyfriend paid $500 for a hotel room and rental car after Southwest canceled their flight from Orlando to Raleigh on Saturday. Southwest couldn't find a flight home for them until Tuesday.\n\n\"We couldn't stay until Tuesday because we have kids and pets and jobs,\" she said.\n\nSouthwest initially offered a refund and a $150 per person voucher. They increased the vouchers to $250 per person when she pressed her case via Twitter.\n\n\"I don't even care about the voucher,\" Ouellette she said. \"I just really want the out-of-pocket money back.

Fuel for scheduled flights cost $2.57 per gallon in November. That was down from $2.68 in October, and significantly less than the $2.98 cost per gallon in November 2013.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2016/03/07/private-jets/81335680/", "title": "Five myths about private jets", "text": "Everett Potter\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nIf you’ve ever spotted a private jet in flight or on the tarmac, you’ve probably wondered which celebrity it belonged to. The fact is that many jets are chartered, not privately owned by a fat cat or pop star, and they’re mostly used for business, not lavish vacations. It’s a world shrouded in mystery, so here are five myths about private jets.\n\n1. You need to be as rich as Donald Trump to fly in a private jet.\n\n“Yes, it helps if you want to own a Boeing 757 in executive configuration like his, but that is not a reality for 99.9% of the population,” says Mark H. Lefever, president and chief operating officer of Avjet, a broker and adviser.\n\nThe answer is “no” if you want to charter.\n\nA round-trip flight in a private jet can cost as little at $6,000, says Kevin O’Leary, president of Jet Advisors, which offers advice on private aviation options. “The typical charter costs for a light jet are $3,000 per hour with a two-hour per day minimum,” O’Leary says. “This would allow a passenger to fly from New York to Washington, D.C., and back in the same day for about $6,000. A round-trip flight between New York City and Naples, Fla., would likely cost around $30,000. So if you fill the seven seats typically found in a light jet, that is $4,300 per person. These prices are still higher than the first-class airline tickets, but you don’t need to be ‘The Donald’ to afford them.”\n\nBefore you reach for your credit card, there are even cheaper deals to be found, according to Doug Gollan, editor-in-chief of DG Amazing Experiences, a newsletter for private jet owners and passengers. Gollan points to JetSuite Suite Deals, which are posted daily and start at about $500.\n\n“Last week, for $536, you could have flown the next day from Tyler, Texas, to Dallas,” he says “They post the specials for the next day on their Facebook page.” The company recently began offering private jet flights to Cuba, with one-way prices for up to six passengers for $11,152 from Key West (JetSuite says it’s the responsibility of each passenger to secure his or her own permission to travel to Cuba, which is allowed by the U.S. government only under specific approved categories).\n\n“You can also reach out to the multitude of charter brokers who don’t typically own planes but source aircraft that are available for charter, and then get five friends and divide the costs,” Gollan says. “Under these circumstances, you might be able to do a Los Angeles-to-Aspen trip for around $2,500 a head. “\n\nStill interested in owning your own jet? O’Leary says, “The purchase cost can be a little as $500,000 with annual operating costs at an additional $500,000 or more. The major concern is with unexpected repairs. A major engine repair or scheduled overhaul on just one engine could easily cost $300,000.\"\n\nThe good life: Private jets for sale from $20 million to $35 million\n\n2. If bad weather forces commercial flights to delay or cancel, then private jets have to do so as well.\n\nLefever says this isn’t true. Private jets have the ability to land at many more airports than commercial aircraft and to change flight plans very quickly.\n\n“Private jets have the option of waiting it out or choosing an alternate airport,” he says. “The best example is LAX-SFO, a common flight that has delays due to weather in the Bay Area.”\n\nA private jet, he says, “can file a new flight plan and go to Oakland, which isn’t much farther to downtown San Francisco than the SFO airport,” with minimal delays.\n\nPrivate jets take off for business travelers\n\n3. Private jets are not as safe as airlines.\n\n“There are various ways to compare the stats, but more passenger fatalities have occurred on scheduled commercial flights than on both charter and private jets” in the past 15 years, Lefever says.\n\nComparisons of accident rates per hour operated show less of a discrepancy, but the reality is that both are extremely safe and safety is always the No. 1 concern for both, Lefever says.\n\nGollan says, “I used to fly regularly on NetJets, and my pilots were former 747-400 captains for United Airlines and chief pilots for Fortune 500 companies. Most of the major fleet operators that own and operate their aircraft have spotless records. Most of the fleet on the charter market is used by the owner and chartered when he or she is not using it, so obviously owners want maintenance and pilots at a high standard.”\n\nAsk the Captain: Is a Gulfstream smoother than a big jet?\n\n4. You might be flying private, but you still have to go through security and deal with the TSA.\n\nNo, you can forget about security lines, taking off your shoes and emptying your pockets. You won’t find metal detectors or body scanners. O’Leary says that often “there is no TSA or pre-flight checks required. The pilots may check the ID of the lead passenger; otherwise, you will be loaded and on your way within minutes of arrival at the airport. At some private airports, you can actually pull your car up to the aircraft, unload and have valet (service for) your car, so you could be in the air within minutes.”\n\n5. Commercial airlines fly faster than private jets.\n\nThat silver blip sailing by your window on a transcontinental flight? Chances are it’s a private jet.\n\n“The fastest passenger jets in the sky are private, depending on the model of jet flown,\" Lefever says. “Private jets also fly above the commercial airlines and a lot of times the weather and turbulence that they incur.“\n\nSome private jets have the ability to fly above the weather up to 51,000 feet, and “a couple private jets fly near the speed of sound,” O’Leary says. “The flexibility to fly in and out of smaller airports that are often closer to the departure point and the destination airport makes the actual speed secondary to the private jet’s access to nearly 10 times as many airports in the United States. That makes the door-to-door speed significantly faster when traveling privately.”\n\nAsk the Captain: Fastest, slowest and highest-flying jets", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2022/07/13/airline-flight-delay-compensation/10028630002/", "title": "Are you entitled to compensation if your flight is delayed?", "text": "Department of Transportation rules around delays of U.S. are murky.\n\nThere's no official requirement for passengers to receive a refund or reimbursement in a result of a flight delay.\n\nHere's what each of the major carriers said they do in the event of a significant delay.\n\nSarah Cannon was ready to start her vacation last week on Hawaii's big island.

But problems were felt at airports across the East and -- by 7 p.m. ET -- the West.\n\nAt Los Angeles, Baltimore/Washington, Charlotte and Washington Dulles, controller \"staffing\" was the dominant issue. Delays were sporadic, though grew to as long as two hours at times.\n\nIn Florida, where delays affected flights at about a half-dozen airports, thunderstorms were mostly to blame for delays at airports like Miami and Orlando. And winds slowed Philadelphia flights and added a double-whammy to operations at New York LaGuardia and Newark Liberty. At JFK, maintenance projects on runways and taxiways created backups.\n\nAnd Old Man Winter refused to relinquish his grip on late-April fliers, with snow and ice creating delays in Denver and Minneapolis/St. Paul as of 7:15 p.m. ET, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's flight-delay map.\n\nBut it was the delays from the air traffic control furloughs that grabbed headlines across the country. The furloughs took effect Sunday. FAA chief Michael Huerta previously warned they could create major flight delays at the busiest times at the country's busiest airports.\n\nThe worst-cast scenario from the \"staffing\" delays didn't materialize on Monday, but it was far from a good scenario today (April 22) as far as flight disruptions were concerned.\n\nIan Gregor, spokesman for the FAA's Pacific Division, warned the congestion and and volume delays were likely to be an ongoing concern in the days ahead.\n\n\"As a result of employee furloughs due to sequestration, the FAA is implementing traffic management initiatives at airports and facilities around the country,\" he said in a statement. \"Travelers can expect to see a wide range of delays that will change throughout the day depending on staffing and weather related issues.\"\n\n\"For example, the FAA is experiencing staffing challenges at New York Center and TRACON, Fort Worth Center, Jacksonville Center and Los Angeles Center,\" he added. \"Controllers will space planes farther apart so they can manage traffic with current staff, which will lead to delays at airports including New York's La Guardia Airport. The FAA is working with the airlines throughout the day to try and minimize delays for travelers. We encourage all travelers to check their flight status and also to visit fly.faa.gov for the latest airport delay information.\"\n\nGregor said there were about 400 delays nationwide on Sunday, the first day that controllers faced furloughs. As many predicted, today's busier weekday schedule presented a bigger challenge.\n\nMany fliers said they headed to the airport expecting the worst.\n\nRon Ferguson, 57, of Jupiter, Fla., said he gave himself \"plenty of time\" this morning at the West Palm Beach airport.\n\n\"I got in the frequent-flier line early because I understood Monday was going to be the day with sequestration,\" he said. \"But it was a lot better than I thought it was going to be.\n\nFerguson said he's still concerned about his return flight on Friday. \"I will get to the airport early, because I understand there could be delays or long lines here,\" he said.\n\nOthers were less lucky.\n\nKenneth Gross, an attorney who lives in Washington, D.C, said his US Airways Shuttle flight was scheduled to take off from New York's LaGuardia Airport for Reagan Washington National Airport at 9 a.m. Monday. The aircraft was more than an hour late arriving from D.C., he said. The gate agents told passengers it was because of air traffic control delays.\n\nWhen the aircraft arrived in New York, he and other passengers boarded. By then, there was a long line of planes waiting to take off and his plane sat on the runway for more than an hour. He arrived in D.C. after 12 p.m, nearly three hours late.\n\n\"A total delay of over three hours for a shuttle flight that should take 37 minutes in the air,\" he said. \"It was ridiculous. It's frustrating that it's the result of sequestration.\"\n\nConnecticut resident Kevin Dahl, 38, project manager for a waste water operator, flew from West Palm Beach to New York LaGuardia this morning but sat on the tarmac for about 45 minutes after landing.\n\n\"They said there was no gate available,\" he said.\n\nWas it sequestration related?\n\n\"That's what the thinking was,\" he said, raising the possibility that planes unable to depart from LaGuardia may have led to a shortage of gates for arriving aircraft.\n\nAirlines also have been sounding the alarm over the furloughs, with nearly every big airline warning fliers to brace for problems -- particularly at a few of the USA's busiest airports where the worst disruptions were expected.\n\nMany also have urged customers to contact their Congressional representatives via a website titled \"DON'T GROUND AMERICA.\"\n\nOne big carrier — Alaska Airlines — has even went as far as to waive rebooking fees at one of its busier airports, citing the threat of \"FAA Furloughs\" as the cause. The airline says customers ticketed through Los Angeles International — one of the airports predicted to see a pronounced effect of any furlough-related delays — can rebook without penalty if they were ticketed to fly through there between Sunday and Tuesday.\n\n\"In response to sequestration budget cuts, Alaska Airlines is recommending that customers check the status of their flight before leaving for the airport and allow additional time to check in when traveling to or from Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Newark, San Diego and San Francisco,\" Alaska Airlines said in a statement issued on Saturday. \"The Federal Aviation Administration plans to furlough air traffic controllers starting Sunday, which the agency predicts could cause extensive ground delays ranging from 50 minutes to two hours and a reduction in flight arrivals of 30% to 40% at certain airports.\"\n\nFederal transportation officials reiterated late last week their warnings about hours-long delays that could show up this week during the busiest times at the country's busiest airports because federal spending cuts forced furloughs for air-traffic controllers.\n\nThey said the worst delays, which they predicted would ebb and flow with daily traffic, are expected at 13 hubs: JFK, LaGuardia and Newark in the New York area; Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco; O'Hare and Midway in Chicago; Miami and Fort Lauderdale; Atlanta; Philadelphia and Charlotte.\n\nTo prevent planes from stacking up during busy times at those hubs, the Federal Aviation Administration will hold planes at their originating airports or order them to take circuitous routes, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said last week.\n\nThe worst delays could be 210 minutes for flights headed to Atlanta, 132 minutes for flights to O'Hare and 80 minutes to LaGuardia, Huerta said. A whole runway could be taken out of action at Atlanta or O'Hare for lack of staffing, he said.\n\nThe worst delays for flights to Los Angeles are projected at 67 minutes and about 50 minutes for flights to JFK and Newark, he said.\n\n\"We are not going to sacrifice safety,\" said Huerta, who said weather could cause even worse delays. \"There are about a dozen airports that will see heavy to moderate delays, which could be similar to what we would experience during a significant summer thunderstorm.\"\n\nBen Mutzabaugh, Nancy Trejos and Bart Jansen are reporting from Washington, D.C.

What circumstances would require such a tow?\n\n— Submitted by reader Irma Lopez, San Antonio\n\nAnswer: A tow-in gate usually has obstructions requiring more precise maneuvering. It is safer to have a tug maneuver the aircraft than to taxi it when in close proximity to obstructions.\n\nQ: I recently connected through O'Hare and noticed that sometimes the pushback trucks are used to move larger planes to/from the taxiway and into and out of the gate area. Is this a fuel-saving measure and, if so, why isn't it used all the time?\n\n— Dave C., Iowa\n\nA: Using ground tugs to move airplanes on the ground does save fuel. It also allows for precise parking as the tug driver can see the area around the airplane better than the pilot can from the flight deck.\n\nAsk the Captain: Do planes have backup cameras like cars?\n\nUsing tugs to tow airplanes to the runway might save some fuel, but the cost of the additional employees, tugs and communication devices have not proven economical so far. Additionally, many airports do not have a way for the tugs to return to the gate area without conflicting with aircraft.\n\nQ: Why do pilots retract the flaps after landing before exiting the runway?\n\n— Nakul Vk ,India\n\nA: After the landing rollout is complete and the aircraft turns onto the taxiway, the flaps are retracted to prevent any damage by rocks or other debris on the taxiway from jet-blast. Additionally, the flaps should be retracted when the airplane is at the gate to provide as much clearance as possible for the ground equipment.\n\nQ: While the aircraft is parked at the gate, what is the purpose of locking the rudder to the left or right?\n\n— Barrett, Dallas\n\nA: This is done to keep the wind from damaging the flight controls while on the ground. Wind can slam flight controls (ailerons, rudder and elevators), doing damage while on the ground. Flight controls are designed to work with air flowing over them. Manufacturers design control locks to deflect the wind and minimize stress on the controls.\n\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/09/business/port-los-angeles-new-york-supply-chain/index.html", "title": "The busiest port in America is no longer on the West Coast | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nFor the past 22 years, the Port of Los Angeles has been the busiest container port in North America, moving around 10 million cargo containers filled with goods for Americans and bringing in roughly half a billion dollars in revenue each year to the state of California. But for the past three months, the Port of New York and New Jersey has been No. 1.\n\nThis rerouting of the US supply chain is a bid to get goods to consumers faster and cheaper. The vast majority of foreign-made goods, from furniture and apparel to auto parts, all come to the United States on cargo vessels that unload at US Ports.\n\nLA isn’t happy about losing its title to its cross-country rival.\n\n“We’ve got to get that cargo back,” said Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, in a recent press briefing.\n\nSince August, imports into the two major West Coast ports – Los Angeles and Long Beach – have declined. Cargo volume at the Port of Los Angeles is down by 25% in the last three months compared to last year, and down by 17.3% on the five-year average. That cargo is now flowing into New Orleans, and also East Coast ports like Savannah, New York and New Jersey.\n\n“The record levels of cargo continue,” said Rick Cotton, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, at a press briefing last month.\n\n“Our goal is to keep as much of that business as possible,” said a spokesperson from the Port of New York and New Jersey.\n\nThe shift stems from fears about an unresolved labor contract between the International Longshore & Warehouse Union (ILWU) and the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA). Around 20,000 dockworkers at West Coast ports, including Los Angeles and Long Beach, have been working without a contract since July 1. Retailers are nervous that the lingering negotiations could lead to a strike, despite reassurances from both parties that this won’t happen. A US freight rail strike nearly sent the US economy into a supply chain spiral – raising the stakes for what a port strike could do. A dockworker strike, which both labor parties say they are adamant about avoiding, would cripple the West Coast and US supply chain – sending even more volume and pressure to other – smaller - East and Gulf Coast ports.\n\n“We’ve dodged a rail strike and the retail supply chain should be able to easily handle the remaining weeks of the holiday season,” said Jonathan Gold, Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy at the National Retail Federation in a statement. “The uncertainty [is what] retailers and other shippers are afraid of. They don’t want to be stuck in a situation where there could be a disruption because of the labor situation or something else,” Gold explained to CNN.\n\nFor now, the Port of New York and New Jersey says it has been able to handle the extra cargo with no delays and is not looking to give up any new business. The winter months are typically the slow season for imports, but in February cargo traffic will pick up again after the Chinese Lunar New Year as retailers will already be looking to bring back-to-school and holiday shopping items in to the United States.\n\nAdding to the shift to East Coast ports were lessons learned from a nightmare traffic scenario that played out in the Pacific Ocean during 2021’s peak holiday shopping season – resulting in empty shelves for retailers.\n\nGoods became stuck off the coast of California sitting on a record 109 container ships in January, waiting for weeks to offload at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Retailers and importers cannot afford that kind of delay – and started shifting their supply chain routes to other US ports. The jam at the West Coast ports delayed Americans getting goods and sent prices higher as demand outpaced supply.\n\n“I think there’s a real recognition of the need to have that diversification and not rely on one port versus another but have multiple ports they use,” said Gold.\n\nBut the Port of Los Angeles could still retain its title for the year, since it is on track to have its second-best year on record behind last year’s record-breaking 10.6 million containers that passed through the port. But until the labor dispute is resolved on the West Coast, it will be a challenge to lure importers back.\n\nToday there are just four cargo vessels at the Port of Los Angeles. It represents a major shift in the US supply chain and where global cargo is coming in to the country. The amount of cargo coming into the Port of New York and New Jersey is up 10.6% in November year to date from 2021 – which was a record year. The port estimates 85% of those imports were supposed to go to the West Coast.\n\n“Despite this flood of cargo – [it’s] been handled extraordinarily well. We expect that to continue,” said Cotton.\n\nIn October, there were 20 canceled vessels coming into the Port of Los Angeles, with 20 more for November and December, according to Seroka. The financial implications can be costly.\n\n“If cargo is down 25% year on year, the jobs could be down right now 20% or 22%. It may not be exactly one for one, but you’ve got a downstream [effect],” Seroka told CNN.\n\nWith less revenue coming in, Seroka said it limits investments in port infrastructure. The marine terminals pay taxes to the city, county, and state – and, if business is down, that’s less revenue coming in to municipalities.\n\n“The economic impacts are far reaching when it comes to us losing our traditional share [of cargo]. That’s a real concern,” said Seroka.", "authors": ["Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}]}

But the emergence of coordinated and organized robberies at high-value stores, even during shopping hours, has the industry on edge.\n\nIn November, a group of 14 individuals barged into a Louis Vuitton store in Oakbrook, Illinois, while customers were inside and audaciously drove away with a $100,000 worth of merchandise. The entire incident was caught on the store’s surveillance video.\n\nThat same month, a group of at least 18 people broke into a closed Nordstrom store at LA’s famous high-end The Grove shopping mall using a sledgehammer and an electric bicycle. They made off with several thousand dollars in merchandise. And on Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year, as many as 30 people robbed a Best Buy in Minneapolis.\n\nThe crime typically involves groups of people targeting stores that carry higher-value items like electronics, designer handbags and designer clothing, who resell the merchandise in secondary marketplaces, such as eBay, OfferUp and Facebook Marketplace or even back into the legitimate supply chain.\n\n“These are people who make a living stealing and reselling. This is not a one-time opportunistic or need-based robbery,” said Cory Lowe, an expert on retail crime and research scientist at the Loss Prevention Research Council, an industry coalition that researches retail crime, its impact and solutions to address it.\n\nLowe said retailers are very worried about the escalation in these organized group-led “smash-and-grab” robberies in multiple cities around the country.\n\n“The anatomy of these attacks show they are more aggressive, dangerous and happening more frequently,” said Lowe. “When I talk to retail loss prevention veterans, the best comparison they come up with is what crime was like in New York in the 1970s. But even then, it was more street robberies and not like retail theft as brazen as this.”\n\nCostly crime\n\nAs stores boost security measures to keep employees and shoppers safe, retailers have to contend with another consequence of organized theft: Its high cost to stores.\n\n“For every $330 worth of products stolen, a retailer has to sell an incremental $300,000 worth of goods to break even,” said Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. “We’ve talked to retailers across America who say shoplifting is now 2% to 3% of their total sales. That’s up from 0.7 to 1% pre-pandemic.”\n\nPower tools are so popular with professional shoplifters at Home Depot (HD) that the home improvement retailer last year launched a line of power tools that won’t work until they’re first scanned and activated at the checkout register, according to a report.\n\nHome Depot said the added security measure is meant to deter the illegal resale of the power tools.\n\nSome of most popular items targeted by professional gangs of shoplifters are designer clothing, laundry detergent, designer handbags, allergy medicine, razors, high-end liquor, pain relievers, baby formula, laptops, deodorant and high-end appliances, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nThese are products that professional thieves can resell a lot of at one time and make a lot of money, said Lowe.\n\nA security guard stands at the entrance to a Nordstrom store at The Grove mall in Los Angeles where a recent robbery took place. Jae C. Hong/AP\n\nThe surge in store-related theft is costly in other ways, too. Employee retention takes a hit when retail crimes spike.\n\n“Think about retailers that are staffed predominantly by women, like cosmetics stores and high-end fashion,” said Lowe. “Criminals target these stores because these are high-dollar items and they anticipate little pushback from the staff. But the fear makes it difficult to keep employees.”\n\nBest Bu (BBY)y’s CEO Corie Barry said in November that the retailer has seen a jump in theft at its stores by gangs of thieves. Some of these incidents have involved weapons such as a gun or crowbar, she said.\n\n“This is traumatizing for our associates and is unacceptable,” Barry said during a call with analysts in November. “We are doing everything we can to try to create [an] as safe as possible environment.”\n\nShe said Best Buy was implementing a number of tactics to minimize theft and protect staff and customers. These include locking up more products and hiring security when appropriate.\n\nElsewhere, drugstore chains have closed stores in neighborhoods where there’s persistent shoplifting. Walgreens, for example, has closed a handful of stores in San Francisco, citing rampant shoplifting.\n\nThen there’s the broader community impact. Shopping in stores generates sales tax, which in turn provides funding for essential public services such as public schools budgets, medical facilities and local police and fire departments.\n\n“Recurring store thefts spread fear. They scare away shoppers who normally would spend time browsing in stores and maybe make a few purchases,” said Flickinger.\n\nPandemic impact\n\nAlthough organized shoplifting sprees were on the rise even before the pandemic, Lowe said that post-Covid lifestyle adjustments have made it easier for offenders to get away with the crime.\n\n“Think about mask wearing. Pre-pandemic, would we have ever thought about everyone in a liquor store wearing a mask covering half of their face and allowing them to remain anonymous?” said Lowe.\n\nA confluence of other factors also have contributed to the spike in dangerous retail robberies in the last two years. These include reduced in-store staffing that leads to less surveillance and the ease with which thieves benefit from a lack of regulation on reselling stolen items online, said Lowe.\n\nSo have rising thresholds for what constitutes a felony offense, he added. “What I do worry about is as a society if more people start to imitate these crimes,” said Lowe.\n\nBut in a survey of 55 retailers, more than two-thirds said the pandemic increased the overall risk of fraud and crime for their companies, according to the National Retail Federation’s 2021 National Retail Security Survey. The report showed that 57% of retailers surveyed indicated a rise in organized retail crime during the pandemic.\n\nSome 50% of retailers surveyed reported an average dollar value loss of merchandise of at least $1,000 in 2020 compared to 29% in 2019. Overall, organized retail crime costs retailers an average of $700,000 per $1 billion in sales, according to the NRF.", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/business/drug-stores-locked-products/index.html", "title": "Why drug stores lock up their products behind plastic cases | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThese days, it feels like many stores are fortresses.\n\nMost of the products on the drug store shelf are behind lock and key, even everyday items such as deodorant, toothpaste, candy, dish detergent, soap and aluminum foil. Manufacturers that supply lock cases and devices to chain stores have seen their businesses boom.\n\nWalgreens and Rite Aid have said that the problem of organized retail crime – rings of criminals that steal products from stores and then often resell them on online marketplaces – is causing them to lock more products up and close some stores.\n\nEven toothpaste is locked up these days. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nLocking up their shelves is a last resort for stores, but it has never been more widely practiced. It’s also become a growing irritation for shoppers and a source of frustration for some employees who must walk around the store with keys at the ready.\n\n“It’s extremely discouraging to customers,” said Paco Underhill, the founder of behavioral research and consulting firm Envirosell. “It is a brutal experience for the merchant, too.”\n\nThe reason why stores resort to locking up these products is simple: to prevent shoplifting. But these decisions are far more nuanced and fraught for stores than you may think. Companies must walk a delicate line between protecting their inventory and creating stores that customers don’t dread visiting.\n\nShoplifting in America\n\nUntil the early 20th century, locking up products was the norm. When customers visited a store, clerks would provide them with the items they wanted from behind a counter.\n\nThis changed as the first self-service stores like Piggly Wiggly in the early 20th century discovered they could sell more goods and reduce their costs by spreading out merchandise on an open sales floor.\n\nWhile having fewer workers in the store increased profits for chains in recent decades, it has left stores in some cases without as many visible personnel to deter shoplifting, crime prevention experts say.\n\nShoppers have become all too familiar with ringing a store worker to open a locked product. Lindsey Nicholson/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nShoplifting has been around for centuries, but it “came of age in America in 1965,” author Rachel Shteir writes in “The Steal: A Cultural History of Shoplifting.” The FBI in 1965 reported that it had jumped 93% in the prior five years and “was the nation’s fastest-growing form of larceny.”\n\nThree years later, officials around the country said there had been an additional surge in young teenagers shoplifting. The trend became part of the counterculture, as exemplified by Abbie Hoffman’s 1971 “Steal This Book.”\n\nIn response, an anti-shoplifting industry and corporate “loss prevention” (LP) and “asset protection” (AP) teams sprang up. Technologies also emerged such as closed-circuit TV cameras, electronic article surveillance and anti-theft tags.\n\n‘Hot products’\n\nStores look to protect “the vital few” products that are most profitable for them to sell, said Adrian Beck, who studies retail losses at the University of Leicester. And they’re willing to accept higher theft on the lower-margin “trivial many,” he added.\n\nShoplifters target smaller items with higher price tags, often called “hot products,” which typically are what retailers most frequently lock up. One criminologist created an apt acronym, CRAVED, to predict the stuff at highest risk: “concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable.”\n\nThe dreaded lock and key. Richard B. Levine/Levine Roberts/Newscom/ZUMA Press\n\nThe most commonly stolen items at US stores include cigarettes, health and beauty products, over-the-counter medications, contraceptives, liquor, teeth-whitening strips and other products.\n\nDrug stores have a higher proportion of the items that are “hot products,” so they have more stuff under lock and key than other retail formats, Beck said.\n\nOrganized retail crime\n\nThere is only so much that can be done to to stop shoplifting. Companies prohibit retail staff from physically trying to stop a shoplifter for their own safety and must find other ways to protect the merchandise.\n\nThese include measures such as security tags on items that set off alarms when someone walks out without paying. But this is less valuable than it used to be because alarms have become part of the general cacophony of store noise and often go ignored.\n\nStores also use strategies such as shelves that allow a customer to take only one item at a time. This helps prevent shoppers emptying an entire shelf of products.\n\nLocking up a product is the final step a retailer will take before removing it altogether, and stores say they are resorting to this measure more frequently as theft continues to increase.\n\nThere is no national database on shoplifting, which often goes under-reported, and stores and prosecutors rarely press charges.\n\nOver-the-counter medications like eye drops are a hot target for shoplifters. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nRetailers say organized retail crime has made their theft problems only worse. Crime gangs often look to steal products from stores that can easily and quickly be resold on online marketplaces such as Amazon and through illicit markets.\n\n“More products today are locked up because the problem has gotten so much bigger,” said Lisa LaBruno, the senior executive vice president of retail operations at the Retail Industry Leaders Association. “Criminal actors can steal high volumes of products and sell them with anonymity.”\n\nRetailers have supported a bipartisan bill that would require online marketplaces to verify state-issued IDs for millions of high-volume third-party sellers. President Joe Biden supports such a measure and this week also called on Congress to impose liability on online marketplaces that sell stolen goods on their platforms.\n\nAmazon said it does not allow third-party sellers to list stolen goods and works closely with law enforcement, retailers and other partners to stop bad actors.\n\n“We regularly request invoices, purchase orders, or other proofs of sourcing when we have concerns about how a seller may have obtained particular products,” a spokesperson said.\n\nIrritated customers and lost sales\n\nUnfortunately, many of these time-consuming anti-theft measures wind up irritating customers and cut into sales. One anti-theft device company’s CEO told Forbes that locked up stuff can result in sales reductions of 15% to 25%.\n\nShoppers today are more impatient. Some will walk out and buy the product on Amazon instead of hanging around for a worker.\n\n“You’re trying to be as frictionless for the customer but still prevent the loss,” said Mark Stinde, a former vice president of asset protection for Kroger and other large retailers. “You get a lot of pushback from operations and merchandising teams for locking stuff up.”\n\nStores are working on new ways to lock up products while reducing customer frustration, such as a new type of case that any employee can open with a smartphone. Other cases require shoppers to enter their phone number to open or scan a QR code.\n\n“Consumers understand why you have to lock up a fur coat or jewelry. But they say ‘why are we locking up deodorant?’” said Jack Trlica, co-founder of trade publication LP Magazine.\n\nTrlica expects companies will develop new technologies that protect products but don’t require flagging down an employee to unlock a shelf.\n\n“There’s going to be an evolution of security products,” he said.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Paco Underhill as the current CEO of Envirosell.

The brand won over everyone from moms to office workers to celebrities like Sharon Stone, who wore a black Valentino skirt and a $26 mock Gap turtleneck to the Academy Awards in 1996.\n\nAt the time it was a symbol of cool and casual style. “As ubiquitous as McDonald’s, as centrally managed as the former Soviet Union and as American as Mickey Mouse, the Gap Inc. has you covered, from the cradle to the grave,” the New York Times said in 1992.\n\nBut sales at the flagship Gap brand have slumped for years and it has become an afterthought for many American shoppers. The company’s other brands, including Old Navy and Banana Republic, have also struggled.\n\nOn Monday, the company announced CEO Sonia Syngal would step down after less than three years. She will be replaced by an interim CEO while the company searches for a permanent leader.\n\nHere’s what the next CEO will fall into at Gap (GPS).\n\nOver-expansion and competition\n\nThe Gap rode the expansion of suburban malls in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming one of the largest mall stores in the United States. So its fortunes have largely been tied to those of malls — great news in the ’90s, but awful news now. Malls have been rapidly losing customers to online shopping and big-box stores.\n\nGap said in 2020 that it would close 30% of its Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America by 2024 — mostly in malls.\n\nOver the decades since the mall-store heyday, Gap fell out of touch with Baby Boomers who grew up on the brand and failed to attract Gen Z and Millennials who drive fashion trends today, analysts say.\n\nAt the same time, brands and retailers such as Levi, Target (TGT) and fast-fashion sellers H&M and Zara lured away the Gap’s denim shoppers. Direct-to-consumer brands online have also chipped away at the Gap’s audience.\n\nThe Gap is a long way from its heyday. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\n“When they were great, there just wasn’t the ecosystem of smaller, niche players,” said Ken Pilot, a former president of Gap and a longtime executive at the company. “Gap was competing against department stores and killing them.”\n\nGap also cannibalized its own brand with similar styles at Old Navy and Banana Republic, he added: “It was smart the way they built out their portfolio, but even those created its own form of competition to the Gap brand.”\n\nGap has tried several strategies to revitalize its flagship brand, including a partnership with Kanye West for a line of Yeezy-branded clothing. But the partnership hasn’t meaningfully lifted sales.\n\nIts initiatives “have been piecemeal rather than part of a coherent grand plan of reinvigoration,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Monday.\n\nWhat’s more, the flagship brand is increasingly less significant to the company. Old Navy and Athleta are its future: Combined, they will represent about 70% of Gap’s total sales by 2023, the company says.\n\nLeadership missteps\n\nWhoever becomes Gap’s new leader won’t be the first of its CEOs to face challenges.\n\nMickey Drexler, known as the “merchant prince,” was the person who built Gap into a powerhouse during the 1990s. First the president of the Gap division and later CEO of the company beginning in 1995, Drexler pushed Gap to expand beyond jeans into khakis and oversaw the creation of budget-chain Old Navy in 1994.\n\nBut it was also during Drexler’s tenure Gap lost its connection to its core customers. It suffered 24 straight quarters of same-store sales declines toward the end of his reign, and he stepped down in 2002.\n\nThe company then rotated through several CEOs, including former Disney (DIS) executive Paul Pressler, drugstore executive Glenn Murphy and Gap veteran Art Peck. Sonia Syngal took over from Peck in 2020.\n\n“The Gap’s failure is all about its lack of leadership,” said Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia University’s business school. “They had a brilliant period of growth and popularity, which they frittered away.”\n\nMore recently, Gap attempted to spin off Old Navy, which is now the company’s largest brand. But it reversed course in 2020 after sales dropped off.\n\nSince then, Old Navy has continued to struggle, including with a failed attempt to revamp sizing to make it more inclusive. The move initially won praise, but the brand ended up carrying too many extra-small and extra-large items and not enough of its more popular middle sizes. In May, Old Navy said it would dial back this strategy.\n\nOld Navy’s “challenges are taking much longer than expected to fix,” said Susan Anderson, an analyst at B. Riley Financial, in a note to clients Tuesday. “A new set of eyes on the entire company could be good for the brand.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2014/07/26/odd-news-toddler-drivers/13203467/", "title": "Odd news: Toddler crashes Jeep, watches cartoons", "text": "Odd news of the week\n\nMYRTLE CREEK, Ore. – A toddler crashed a Jeep into an Oregon home, then ran back to his home to watch cartoons, police said.\n\nAuthorities say the 3-year-old boy who was wearing only a diaper climbed into the Jeep on the evening of July 22 and knocked it out of gear.

Former WWE champ catches suspected burglar\n\nPHOENIX – A former WWE champion known as Daniel Bryan chased two burglary suspects he saw exiting his Phoenix home and subdued one until officers arrived, investigators said.\n\nAccording to police, Bryan Danielson and his wife, Brianna, drove into the carport of their Arcadia home and saw a door to the house start to open.\n\nThat's when Danielson and his wife, a fellow former WWE star known as Brie Bella, ran inside to check on their dog, Josie.\n\n\"I saw the guys running out the back,\" Danielson said. \"I chased them. I caught one of them. I kept him until police got there.\"\n\nDanielson and Cesar Sosa, 22, got into a struggle, but the former champ subdued him until officers arrived, Phoenix police Sgt.

That emblem of roadside Americana could be yours if you fork over enough money.\n\nA \"For Sale\" sign is in front of what's billed as the \"World's Largest Bottle of Catsup,\" the landmark that once served as a water tower in the city of Collinsville, east of St. Louis, the Belleville News-Democrat reported July 22.\n\nThe asking price for the 65-year-old, 170-foot-tall landmark is $200,000, with the warehouse adjacent to it listed at $300,000.\n\nThe landmark replicates a bottle of Brooks Old Original Rich and Tangy Catsup, which was produced in the buildings beneath the tower. The 100,000-gallon tower held water — never ketchup — and it hasn't been used since Brooks moved out in the early 1960s.\n\nThe plant later became a warehouse used for shipping and trucking operations of Bethel-Eckert, which for four decades serviced military commissaries before losing its contracts. Larry Eckert, the owner, initially considered selling the ketchup bottle and warehouse separately, then decided one can't go without the other.\n\n\"Whoever would be interested, you'd need the additional land anyway,\" he said.\n\nEckert said because the ketchup bottle is on the National Register of Historic Places, he expects the eventual buyer to preserve it.\n\n200 panties stolen at east Georgia mall\n\nAUGUSTA, Ga. – Authorities are investigating after a thief at an east Georgia shopping mall made off with a bagful of women's underwear.\n\nA thief stole 200 pairs of panties from Victoria's Secret in Augusta Mall shortly before noon July 19, Richmond County sheriff's officials say.\n\nThe Augusta Chronicle reports that security video shows a male entering the store and stuffing the underwear into a large shopping bag.

Not just pastry, but yogurt, cakes and eggs. She alerted police July 11.\n\nThe next day, another woman told police her vehicle had been hit six times — twice with a maple bar, once with a cinnamon doughnut, once with pink yogurt, once with \"bread soaked in a white slimy liquid\" and once with red potato salad.\n\nThe crime wave in a northeast Hillsboro neighborhood has been going on for six weeks, The Oregonian reported July 21.\n\nPolice think the victims of the night-time vandalism are chosen at random and kids are likely behind it.\n\nLt.

The sheriff says the jumpsuits, which last for about two to three years, cost $11.73 apiece.\n\nPolice, Pennsylvania farmer seeking missing bull\n\nMERCER, Pa. – It's no bull.\n\nState police and a western Pennsylvania cattle owner are looking for a two-year-old bull that has been missing for more than a week.\n\nKevin Minor says the Watusi bull should be easy to spot: He's about 400 pounds, with a solid red hide, and 3-foot-long horns.\n\nMinor took the bull to a friend's farm near Mercer, about 60 miles north of Pittsburgh, hoping it would mate with a buffalo there.\n\nThe man who owns that farm, Joe Gaburri, says the animal was running with three buffalo for about two weeks before it turned up missing July 14. Gaburri says the bull is docile and wouldn't have jumped a fence, so he mowed his fields thinking he might find the bull's body, but didn't.\n\nMinor league general manager gets prostate exam at game\n\nMYRTLE BEACH, S.C. – A minor league baseball manager has done his part to spread prostate cancer awareness — he had a prostate cancer exam before a field packed with baseball fans.\n\nMyrtle Beach Pelicans' general manager Andy Milovich stuck his head out of the press box to sing \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" during the seventh-inning stretch while a doctor below and out-of-sight performed the screening.\n\nMilovich agreed to have the exam in support of a 10-year-old girl suffering from brain cancer if her Facebook page got 10,000 \"likes.\" That number was reached July 21.\n\nThe team has held several events to help raise funds for the girl.\n\nPolice: Woman posted Facebook selfies in stolen dress\n\nWEST FRANKFORT, Ill. – Police investigating the theft of clothing and jewelry from a southern Illinois boutique say they arrested a woman after she posted Facebook photos of herself wearing one of the stolen items.\n\nWSIL-TV reports that police arrested Danielle Saxton, 27, of West Frankfort, earlier this month on misdemeanor retail theft charges. She's free on her own recognizance.\n\nAuthorities say a distinctive leopard-print dress was among the items stolen July 11 from Mortie's Boutique in West Frankfort.\n\nThe store's co-owner, Kert Williams, says he posted about the stolen items on Facebook and that people who saw Williams' posting and those of Saxton made the connection and helped police.\n\nHunt on for possible anaconda in New Jersey lake\n\nJEFFERSON, N.J. – Reports of a 16-foot-long exotic snake — possibly an anaconda — slithering through New Jersey's largest lake have stoked fears among residents and led to searches and questions about what exactly is in the water.\n\nTraps have been set in Lake Hopatcong, while animal control officers and a private reptile expert have been hunting for the snake, first spotted earlier this month.\n\nA spokesman for the state's Department of Environmental Protection said there have been no confirmed sightings of the snake and no evidence that it's acutally there.\n\n\"We've been trying to take this seriously, because if there is a dangerous creature we want to help capture it,\" spokesman Larry Ragonese said. \"At this point, we've gone a couple weeks now with a growing story of an exotic creature roaming the lake, and there's hundreds of eyes now trained on it. If there was to be something, you would think that that someone would have seen it.\"\n\nGerald Andrejcak said that he has.\n\nAndrejcak, assistant director of New Jersey's Common Sense for Animals, says that he spotted the head and part of a body of what he estimated as a 16-foot-long anaconda last week. He said he cornered it before it escaped by slithering between his legs.\n\n\"You can't miss an anaconda head. If you've ever dealt with any kind of snakes, any type of anaconda, you can never forget that head,\" Andrejcak said. \"I know the color and the patterns and everything else. Right off the bat, I knew exactly what it was right when I saw it.\"\n\nAndrejcak said that commotion from boats in the area by onlookers coming to try to spot the snake may have led the snake to go elsewhere.\n\nThe 4-square mile lake about 30 miles northwest of Newark is surrounded by five towns and is the largest freshwater lake in the state.\n\n\"I would like to see me get this thing, get it into a zoo safe where someone isn't going to shoot it, kill it,\" he said. \"The snake can be on display, safe in captivity and the lake community can get back to normal.\"\n\nNaked thieves take burgers from Florida eatery\n\nBONITA SPRINGS, Fla. – A southwest Florida waitress has dubbed the trio of naked hamburger thieves who broke into an eatery \"dumb, dumber and dumbest.\"\n\nWaitress Nancy Sansevieri was still laughing after police released surveillance video July 23 showing the college-aged men — two naked and one clad in underwear — stealing 60 hamburgers from Doc's Beach House in Bonita Beach.\n\nPolice say the men broke in early July 20 and left a trail of red peppers on the beach.\n\nDoc's general manager Lou Bangert told the News-Press of Fort Myers that he's never witnessed such a crime in the restaurant's 27-year history.

The spelling mistake was \"a bit of a PR hiccup\" but the cycling event was otherwise a success, drawing 8,000 riders, Fraser said.\n\nThe ride came two days after the July 18 birthday of Mandela, who died in December at the age of 95. The goal is to promote commuter cycling and to connect communities in Johannesburg, a city that was divided into wealthy white suburbs and poor black townships during white minority rule, which ended in 1994.\n\nThe ride passed the Nelson Mandela Bridge, which was completed in 2003 amid efforts to revive the dilapidated downtown area; a cemetery where anti-apartheid activists are buried; and Soweto's Vilakazi Street, where Mandela and Desmond Tutu, a former archbishop and fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, had lived.\n\nThe quotation on the cyclists' T-shirts is from Mandela's prison desk calendar, and was written on June 2, 1979, while he was on Robben Island, where the anti-apartheid leader was held for part of his 27 years of incarceration during apartheid. He was released in 1990 and became president in South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994.\n\nMost people took the spelling error with a \"pinch of salt\" and laughed, Fraser said. He speculated that Mandela would have done the same.\n\n\"He had a great sense of humor,\" Fraser said. \"He would understand.\"\n\nNew Jersey sues over Florida pizza shop logo\n\nTRENTON, N.J. – The New Jersey Turnpike Authority wants a Florida pizza shop to pay a big toll for using a logo similar to the Garden State Parkway's green and yellow signs.\n\nThe agency sued Jersey Boardwalk Pizza on July 22 in federal court over the logo it uses for its two pizza shops and on merchandise sold online. It said in the suit that the company is trying to trade upon the fame of the Garden State Parkway logo to attract customers and potential franchisees.\n\nJoyAnn Kenny, a lawyer with the Red Bank firm of Marks & Klein LLP, which represents the company, defended its use of the logo in a letter to turnpike authority lawyers included in the suit. She wrote that there's no way anyone would confuse a highway and a pizza place 1,300 miles away.\n\n\"Given the very distinct difference in the goods and services offered by our respective clients (yours being a governmental agency providing highway maintenance and travel related services exclusively in the state of New Jersey — ours being a franchisor of pizza restaurants providing the opportunity to provide delicious pizza and Italian food to patrons of its licensed restaurants), there is no plausible likelihood of confusion,\" she wrote.\n\nThe turnpike authority sued over two logos, one used by the pizza business and one by a franchising business it owns. Kenny said that logo for the restaurants was approved by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and has been used since April 2011.\n\nNew Jersey says that \"there is no question\" that the logos \"were directly copied and appropriated from Plaintiff's famous Garden State Parkway Logo.\" It asked a judge to require the company to stop using the logos and to destroy any merchandise that includes it.\n\nIt calls the Garden State Parkway one of the most iconic and well known highways in the country. Its logo includes a green map of the state with a line showing the highway on a yellow background with the words \"Garden State Parkway\" written in yellow on a green background.\n\nJersey Boardwalk Pizza also includes a green map of the state and its title written in yellow on a green background.\n\nAnother tiny Wyoming town goes up for sale\n\nALADDIN, Wyo. – Here's a gift for someone who has everything: A tiny town in far northeastern Wyoming named Aladdin.\n\nJust $1.5 million gets you 30 acres and 15 buildings, including a 118-year-old general store that's still operating.\n\nRick and Judy Brengle bought the town 28 years ago and now want to move on from the full-time job of running it.\n\n\"We bought this place because I had empty-nest syndrome,\" Judy Brengle said. \"All our kids had gone to college, so my husband bought me a town.\"\n\nAladdin doesn't have a government population count but about 15 people live in the town on a state highway midway between Devils Tower National Monument and Sturgis, S.D., famous for its huge annual motorcycle rally.\n\nRecreation opportunities abound in the nearby Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains.\n\nAladdin isn't the only Wyoming town to hit the market. Last year, the southeast Wyoming town of Buford, population 1, sold for $900,000 and was renamed PhinDeli Town by its new owner to promote a brand of Vietnamese coffee sold there.\n\nThe Brengles haven't changed a thing about the two-story general store in Aladdin, except to put on a new roof. A pot-bellied stove provides heat, the Gillette News-Record reported July 20.\n\nThe place sells fishing supplies, groceries, antiques, art, beer and hardware. It doesn't have running water, but there are two working outhouses nearby.\n\nAladdin got its name in 1894 from folks who hoped to strike it rich just like the fellow in the Arabian Nights folktale.\n\nOwning Aladdin has been a full-time job and then some for the Brengles. When Judy Brengle isn't ordering clothes or doing inventory, she's sorting mail or selling beer and cigarettes.\n\nShe said she has grandkids who will keep tending the store and post office indefinitely.\n\n\"We've had several interested buyers, but not very many people want to work seven days a week,\" Brengle said.\n\nCompiled By Paul H.

Here's why prices go up, and who's to blame ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nConfused about inflation? You’re not alone.\n\nInflation is, paradoxically, both incredibly simple to understand and absurdly complicated.\n\nLet’s start with the simplest version: Inflation happens when prices broadly go up.\n\nThat “broadly” is important: At any given time, the price of goods will fluctuate based on shifting tastes. Someone makes a viral TikTok about brussels sprouts and suddenly everyone’s gotta have them; sprouts prices go up. Meanwhile sellers of cauliflower, last season’s trendy veg, are practically giving their goods away. Those fluctuations are constant.\n\nInflation is when the average price of virtually everything consumers buy goes up. Food, houses, cars, clothes, toys, etc. To afford those necessities, wages have to rise too.\n\nIt’s not a bad thing. In the United States, for the past 40 years or so (and particularly this century), we’ve been living in an ideal low-and-slow level of inflation that comes with a well-oiled consumer-driven economy, with prices going up around 2% a year, if that. Sure, prices on some things, like housing and health care, are much higher than they used to be, but other things, like computers and TVs, have become much cheaper — the average of all the things combined has been relatively stable.\n\nStill with me?\n\nAll right, let’s cut to today, and why inflation is all over the news.\n\nWhen ‘inflation’ is a bad word\n\nInflation becomes problematic when that low-and-slow simmer gets fired up to a boil. That’s when you hear economists talk about the economy “overheating.” For a variety of reasons, largely stemming from the pandemic, the global economy finds itself at a rigorous boil right now.\n\nIn the United States, prices have climbed 6.2% — the biggest increase since November 1990, and well above the Federal Reserve’s long-term inflation goal of around 2%.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index for July rose 8.5%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which the Federal Reserve prefers, rose 9.8% in July from the same period a year earlier.\n\nAnd here’s where Econ 101 merges a bit with Psych 101. There’s a behavioral economics aspect to inflation, where it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. When prices go up for a long enough period of time, consumers start to anticipate the price increases. You’ll buy more goods today if you think they’ll cost appreciably more tomorrow. That has the effect of increasing demand, which causes prices to rise even more. And so on. And so on.\n\nThat’s where it can get especially tricky for the Federal Reserve, whose main job is to control money supply and keep inflation in check.\n\nHow’d we get here?\n\nBlame the pandemic.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, as Covid-19 spread, it was like pulling the plug on the global economy. Factories around the world shut down; people stopped going out to restaurants; airlines grounded flights. Millions of people were laid off as business disappeared practically overnight. The unemployment rate in America shot up to nearly 15% from about 3.5% in February 2020.\n\nIt was the sharpest economic contraction on record.\n\nAt the same time, the Fed implemented emergency stimulus measures to keep financial markets from tanking. The central bank slashed interest rates to near zero and began pumping tens of billions of dollars every month into the markets by buying up corporate debt. In doing so, the bank likely prevented a full-on financial meltdown. But keeping those easy-money policies in place over the past 20 months has also fueled — you guessed it — inflation.\n\nBy early summer, however, demand for consumer goods started to pick back up. Rapidly. Congress and President Joe Biden passed a historic $1.9 trillion stimulus bill in March that made Americans suddenly flush with cash and unemployment assistance. People started shopping again. Demand went from zero to 100, but supply couldn’t bounce back so easily.\n\nWhen you pull the plug on the global economy, you can’t just plug it back in and expect it start humming at the same pace as before.\n\nTake cars, for example. Automakers saw the Covid crisis beginning and did what any smart business would do — shut down temporarily and try to mitigate losses. But not long after the pandemic shut factories down, it also drove up demand for cars as people worried about exposure on public transit and avoided flying. Automakers had whiplash.\n\nCars require an immense number of parts, from an immense number of different factories around the world, to be built by highly skilled laborers in other parts of the world. Getting all of those discreet operations back online takes time, and doing so while keeping workers from getting sick takes even more time.\n\nEconomists often describe inflation as too much money chasing too few goods. That’s exactly what happened with cars. And houses. And Peloton bikes. And any number of other items that became hot ticket items.\n\nHow’s the supply chain involved in all this?\n\n“Supply chain bottlenecks” — that’s another one you see all over, right?\n\nLet’s go back to the car example.\n\nWe know that high demand + limited supply = prices go up.\n\nBut high demand + limited supply + production delays = prices go up even more.\n\nAll modern cars rely on a variety of computer chips to function. But those chips are also used in cellphones, appliances, TVs, laptops and dozens of other items that, as bad luck would have it, were all in high demand at the same time.\n\nThat’s just one example of the disconnect in the global supply chain. Because new cars have been slow to roll in, used car demand shot through the roof, which drove overall inflation higher. In some cases, car owners were able to sell their used cars for more than what they paid for them a year or two prior.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nPrices and wages are likely to keep going up well into 2022, officials and economists say. But for how long and how much depends on countless variables across the globe.\n\nPolicymakers’ top priority is to unclog the supply chain bottlenecks to get goods moving at their pre-pandemic pace. That’s a lot easier said than done. And there’s no telling what kind of shocks — a resurgent Covid variant, a massive shipping container getting stuck in a key waterway, a natural disaster — could set back progress.\n\nThe conflict has upended commodity and oil markets, driving up prices of food and gasoline around the world. That’s compounding supply chain headaches, leading to further shortages of critical food items and oil.\n\nLockdowns in China earlier this summer, meanwhile, left the world’s largest seaport essentially at a standstill. Corporations bear some blame as well, as many big companies have been raising prices to protect their profit margins.\n\nAnd there’s no telling what kind of new shocks — a resurgent Covid variant, a massive shipping container getting stuck in a waterway, a natural disaster — could set back progress.\n\nThere’s no single government or central bank that can fix the inflation resulting from those global disruptions.\n\nBut central banks are doing what they can. In the United States, the Fed began raising rates in March by a quarter of a percentage point — its first increase since 2018 — and have since raised rates four times this year. There’s no sign that they’ll stop anytime soon.\n\nEconomists and investors in the United States expect that the Fed will tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates and dialing back emergency stimulus, thereby slow the pace of inflation. When money becomes more expensive to borrow, that can take the heat off price increases and bring the economy back down to that nice, gentle simmer.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/economy/railroad-strike-economic-impact/index.html", "title": "How the freight rail workers strike could affect you and the US ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe US economy can keep running without freight trains — but not for long.\n\nThat is why the risk of the first national railroad strike in 30 years is so worrying to economists and businesses. A brief work stoppage — some previous rail strikes have lasted only hours — likely won’t cause much economic disruption.\n\nBut a prolonged walkout of a week or more will cripple the nation’s still struggling supply chain, cause widespread shutdowns and shortages, and likely further drive up prices even as inflation remains near a 40-year high.\n\n“At a week, you see real damage in the US economy,” said economist Patrick Anderson of Anderson Economic Group, which conducts impact estimates on work stoppages.\n\nIf it lasts a week, a strike will mean reduced gas production, spoiled crops, a choked off supply of new cars and empty shelves at stores over the holidays. Your commute may be snarled. And for factory workers, there could be temporary layoffs in the near future.\n\nAmerica’s railroads remain crucial for keeping the US economy running smoothly. They carry nearly 30% of the nation’s freight, measured by the distance traveled and the weight of the cargo, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. And there really isn’t an alternative if the trains stop running.\n\n“Idling all 7,000 long distance daily freight trains in the US would require more than 460,000 additional long-haul trucks every day, which is not possible based on equipment availability and an existing shortage of 80,000 drivers,” said Chris Spear, CEO of the American Trucking Associations in a letter to members of Congress asking that they act to prevent a strike. “As such, any rail service disruption will create havoc in the supply chain and fuel inflationary pressures across the board.”\n\nAnderson said it is impossible to come up with a dollar estimate for the impact on the economy at this point, but he said the costs will grow geometrically the longer the strike lasts, starting out at tens of millions of dollars and growing rapidly each day.\n\n“It might only be millions, but that’s a lot if it’s your job that’s one that is being lost,” he said. “If we reach a week-long strike, we’re in uncharted territory,” he said.\n\nGasoline\n\nThe price of gas has been falling steadily for three months. But a rail strike could send prices shooting higher again due to limited supplies.\n\nRefineries get most of their crude oil via pipelines and ship out most of the products they produce, such as gas, diesel and jet fuel, via pipelines as well. But railroad tank cars are a key part of the process to make the gas that ends up in your tank.\n\nJust about all ethanol that goes into gasoline moves by rail. Without ethanol, gasoline wouldn’t be compliant with some environmental regulations. But even if those regulations could be waived, the lack of ethanol could increase the cost of a gallon of gas by about 16 cents due to the loss of tax breaks, according to Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS.\n\nAlthough pipelines carry most crude oil to refineries, about 300,000 barrels move by rail each day, a volume that could supply about two mid-size refineries, according to data from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the refineries’ trade group. Numerous chemicals used in the refining process also arrive via rail, and some lower-grade products and waste materials need to be shipped out by rail.\n\n“If rail cars aren’t coming in regularly to pick up facility products, including the sulfur that refiners remove from crude oil, production will have to curtail,” the refineries’ trade group said.\n\nFood\n\nThe strike would be hitting at a particularly bad time for the nation’s agricultural industry. Bureau of Transportation Statistics data show that trains account for 27% of the distance grains travel when measured by weight.\n\n“A rail stoppage on September 16 would hit right as the fall harvest accelerates in many parts of the United States,” said Mike Seyfert, CEO of the National Grain and Feed Association. “The economic damages across the food and agricultural supply chain would be swift and severe.”\n\nThe railroads started refusing to take new shipments of grain as of Wednesday in preparation for the possible strike. If the work stoppage happens, grain operators will load what they can onto rail containers sitting in their yards. But they won’t be able to move them out or accept additional grain from farmers, who will then have limited options to sell their crops.\n\nIn recent months there have been improvements to farmers’ supply chain issues suffered during the pandemic.\n\n“The gains we’ve made in the last seven to eight months will be reversed largely if this strike happens,” said Terri Moore, spokesperson for the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nIn addition, farmers preparing to plant for the fall season could see shortages of the fertilizer they need, since the railroads have already stopped accepting shipments because they are classified as hazardous materials in many cases. That could hurt future supplies of crops.\n\n“There definitely would be at least some price increase for consumers,” said Max Fisher, chief economist at the National Grain and Feed Association. “If our processing plants are not running, the food manufacturers that buy these ingredients won’t have access to them for an extended period of time. Depending on how long it would go on, we worry about scarcity — being able to actually get the food.”\n\nBeyond domestic food prices, the strike could affect global food markets, since the US is a major grain exporter. With the war in Ukraine cutting off much the grain from that country, a disruption in US supply will only make a bad situation worse.\n\nCars and trucks\n\nCar and truck production has already been hampered by a shortage of numerous essential parts, most notably computer chips. That has created a dearth of vehicles available for sale on dealer lots, which in turn has resulted in record high car prices.\n\nBut that’s nothing compared to what would happen with a prolonged rail strike. About 75% of cars built in US factories or imported here move by rail. There are nowhere near enough trucks to carry that many vehicles.\n\nIn addition, many of those parts move between suppliers and car assembly plants by rail. Production will quickly halt if those rail links are severed.\n\nEventually production would resume, but it would take some time to make up for lost output. Which means more upward pressure on car prices.\n\nConsumer goods\n\nThe snarl of container ships coming into West Coast ports is finally easing after years of backlogs and delays. And although things have gotten better, they are by no means “normal” yet.\n\nAs of Tuesday the Port of Los Angeles, the nation’s largest, said it had 27,000 shipping containers waiting to be loaded onto trains. That’s roughly three times as many as under normal conditions. Two thirds of the current inventory of containers have been there nine or more days, when none should have been there that long.\n\n“Efficient rail operations are critical to the Port of Los Angeles,” said Gene Seroka, the port’s executive director. “With two-thirds of our cargo leaving California by rail, the supply chain and the US economy need all of us working at maximum effort.”\n\nThe peak season for imported goods heading to retailers ahead of the holiday shopping period is now. The National Retail Federation said last week it is concerned about shortages later this year if there is a rail strike.\n\n“We are in the middle of the peak import season,” said the trade group. “Any rail network disruptions this month could have long-lasting negative effects on this important selling season. Product delays and shortages are correlated with inflation.”\n\nManufacturing\n\nMost factories aim to have parts and raw materials delivered just before they are used in assembly lines — a process known as “just-in-time” deliveries. And many factories depend on rail to get those parts and supplies, as well as to ship them out.\n\n“For years now, America’s manufacturing workers have endured the effects of rapidly rising material costs and severe supply chain disruptions,” said a statement from the National Association of Manufacturers. A rail strike would “devastate the movement of manufactured products that families depend on.”\n\nThe rail strike could result in temporary plant closures, as happened across the global auto industry due to the shortage of parts and computer chips brought on by the pandemic.\n\nCommuting\n\nAlthough only the nation’s freight rail lines face a pending strike, many of the nation’s commuter trains travel on tracks maintained and operated by the freight railroads. As a result, many passenger railroads expect to shut down operations once the freight strike starts.\n\nAmtrak already has cut service on many of its long distance trains. The company owns roughly 700 miles of track, mostly between Boston and Washington, DC, but about 97% of its 22,000 mile system runs on freight lines.\n\nMany commuter railroads also are preparing to shut much of their operations for the same reason.\n\nThat could mean more commuters driving to work, and more traffic and congestion even for those who don’t normally take a train.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/14/economy/craft-beer-industry-sales-rebound/index.html", "title": "It's going to be a 'make-or-break' year for struggling craft brewers ...", "text": "San Francisco CNN Business —\n\nFor many of the nation’s small and independent brewers, this year will prove to be a true test of their staying power.\n\nEarly data for 2022 shows that brewery closures are on the rise and some sales have been spotty, said Bart Watson, senior economist for the Brewers Association, craft beer’s largest trade organization.\n\nThe pandemic and its ongoing effects, as well as the war in Ukraine, continue to drag down smaller brewers, who are battling climbing costs, rising rents, and seemingly interminable supply chain challenges, Watson said.\n\n“2022 is going to be a make-or-break year for many breweries,” he said earlier this month while delivering the results of the association’s state-of-the-industry report.\n\nDuring the first three months of 2022, at least 53 craft breweries shut their doors, up from 42 closures in the first quarter of last year. That still leaves some 9,100 breweries in operation, but more closures are expected.\n\nAfter being hit hard in 2020, the US craft beer industry started bouncing back last year. But this year, the outlook has grown hazier.\n\n“We still had the government raining down helicopter money [in 2021],” Watson told CNN Business, referring to the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, a federal pandemic relief program offering aid to struggling restaurants, bars, breweries, wineries and similar businesses. “The [breweries] are going to have to stand on their own [now].”\n\nThe craft beer business was already experiencing some choppiness before the pandemic: In 2019, there were a record 300-plus closures, a reckoning after thousands of breweries had opened up in just a few short years.\n\n“We may see increased closings, but it’s not going to be a huge bubble burst,” Watson said of this year’s projections. “We were already moving toward a more mature place.”\n\nHowever, the current economic outlook – and the war in Ukraine, which has played havoc with crucial commodities like wheat and barley – “could accelerate that,” he said.\n\nThat could mean an increase in consolidation and in brewers paring down, rethinking or shuttering operations, he said.\n\n‘Not clear sailing’\n\nIn North Texas, the Lone Star State has seen popular breweries close their doors in recent weeks, including Legal Draft Beer and Armadillo Ale Works, the Dallas Morning News and Denton Record-Chronicle first reported.\n\n“Poor sales led to the accumulation of expenses and debt and although government assistance helped keep us afloat, we were unable to fully recover,” Armadillo Brewing Company officials said in a Facebook post on March 27.\n\nTexas brewers faced some unique challenges early on in the pandemic because they were initially classified as bars, which were targeted for shutdowns as part of Gov. Greg Abbott’s Covid-19 measures, said Charles Vallhonrat, executive director of the Texas Craft Brewers Guild.\n\n“Now we face a lot of the challenges a lot of hospitality groups face with supply chain issues and staffing – keeping staff on board, being able to run at capacity, ” he said.\n\nThe supply chain constraints span a number of products breweries rely on, with aluminum for cans and can availability as the biggest issue, Vallhonrat said. But it also extends to shipping costs, delivery timelines for equipment and even the branded glasses sold in brewery gift shops, he said.\n\nIt all adds up, especially if brewers are already on shaky ground, in debt or in a tenuous leasing situation.\n\n“Things have to click for the brewery to be bringing in the revenue with visitors, with events,” he said. “One hiccup, one bad delivery, one missed equipment, one bad batch, and you can be at risk. People are getting by, but it’s not clear sailing right now.”\n\nChanges are brewing\n\nThis past weekend marked the final day of operation for Second Street Brewery at its namesake original location off 2nd Street in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Second Street had operated there for more than 25 years, but the lease renewal terms – including higher rent – were not favorable enough, said Rod Tweet, Second Street’s president and brewmaster.\n\nRod Tweet, Second Street Brewery's president and owner, with brewer Ben Murdock. Courtesy Mariah Cameron Scee\n\nWith two other taproom restaurants in the Southwestern arts hub, the company is “doing pretty solid business” and both breweries are “very busy,” Tweet told CNN Business. “We’re in pretty good health on the whole, but we pay attention to what’s going on around us, too.”\n\nThe company’s restaurant footprint was a little too big for post-Covid times, he said. Not to mention the extent to which the lingering, cascading economic pressures have created an uncertain business climate.\n\nThis now includes the ripple effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the price and availability of oil, food, lumber and other materials. The global crisis could put additional price and demand pressures on items used by brewers, such as wooden pallets and malted barley, Watson said.\n\n“It’s a good time to be super careful and super strategic because we’re facing rising prices in pretty much everything,” said Second Street’s Tweet. “We’re trying to think of where we want to be five years from now.”\n\nBeer as a path toward economic renewal\n\nDespite uncertainty, optimism is brewing in places like Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nThat’s where local musician Kemet Coleman is teaming up with craft brewers Woodie Bonds and Elliott Ivory to open Vine Street Brewing in the city’s historic Jazz District. When Vine Street makes its debut in September – an opening date already pushed back because of supply chain and construction delays – it will be Kansas City’s first Black-owned brewery.\n\nColeman was inspired to start a brewery after getting a job at Kansas City’s venerable Boulevard Brewing nearly 10 years ago. He had also learned about the history of brewing in parts of Africa and the roles of Black women and female slaves in America’s early beer industry. Coleman said he sees the potential in not only introducing craft beer to new consumers and educating them about the different styles of beer, but also in economic renewal.\n\nFrom left to right: Woodie Bonds, Elliott Ivory and Kemet Coleman, founders of Vine Street Brewing, which will be Kansas City's first Black-owned brewery. Kemet Coleman/Vine Street Brewing Co.\n\nBreweries are “great community builders,” he said, noting that in downtown Kansas City he’s seen breweries emerge and development follow. Vine Street hopes to serve as a community gathering place and offer historical tours and host local musicians and events.\n\nIn the Jazz District, “some of our most important milestones and moments and spaces have either been demolished or haven’t really been taken care of,” he said. “So I see beer in general, but also this brewery specifically, as a way to help bring back a community to not former glory but to a new place that everybody would enjoy and would be proud to boast about.”", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/01/economy/summer-camp-cost-2022/index.html", "title": "Summer camp costs surge in 2022 | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nPrices are going up for everything from food and cars to gas and clothes. Now, families can add summer camps to that growing list.\n\nSome 26 million children nationwide are expected to be enrolled in camps this year after schools wind down in just a few weeks.\n\n“Demand is extremely strong for camps as parents are desperate for their kids to be out in nature with their peers and away from tech devices after two years of social distancing,” said Tom Rosenberg, president and CEO of the American Camp Association, a non-profit that represents the summer camp industry.\n\nAs demand surges, parents should prepare to pay more to secure a camp spot for their child. Rosenberg said camp fees are estimated to jump 10% to 15% this summer over 2021.\n\nSome of this is demand-driven, he added. The summer camp industry, made up of over 15,000 camps, was already running at full capacity heading into the pandemic. In 2020, 82% of overnight camps and 60% of day camps didn’t operate at all. The loss of business forced some camps to shut down completely. Demand is outstripping supply even more now, he said.\n\nThe other factor is soaring inflation.\n\nJust as households are paying more for everyday goods and services, camp operators said they’re incurring more costs by having to pay more for camp supplies such as food, bus transportation staff and insurance.\n\nThe pandemic has added another expense category, too: on-premise Covid safety and testing protocols.\n\nOut of space\n\nCamp Creek Run is a 50-acre non-profit camp and nature preserve in Marlton, New Jersey, that runs summer day camps for kids ages 4 to 12. The camp typically gets 200 campers a week.\n\n“We’re a smaller camp so demand is always high. But this year has definitely been different,” said Keara Giannotti, the camp’s executive director and director of Eco Studies. “Our slots filled up quickly. Some of our age groups filled up within two weeks once we opened registration, and that has never happened before.”\n\nCamp operators say demand has surged this year and they are also paying more for supplies, transportation and staffing costs. Courtesy Camp Tawonga\n\nThe camp currently has a waiting list for every week and every age group this year. “We had to close registration a few weeks ago, which we have also never done before, [and] we have canceled a couple of open houses,” she said.\n\nAlthough its campers aren’t provided food, Giannotti said costs have gone up in other areas, such as supplies, insurance and payroll.\n\nCamp Creek Run fees are $330 a week this summer, compared to $300 in 2019.\n\nCamp Tawonga, a non-profit 97-year-old Jewish summer camp located on 160 acres in the Stanislaus National Forest outside of Yosemite National Park, offers both summer camps and year-round programs.\n\nIts most popular summer camp programs that run from five days to three weeks are full, said Casey Cohen, the camp’s senior communication’s director.\n\n“Those programs filled up as early as the end of last November for summer 2022 and the camp opened waitlists,” she said.\n\nFees for its programs are higher, too: In 2019, a two-week session at the camp cost $4,065. In 2022, that same program costs $4,850, Cohen said.\n\nCamp Tawonga CEO Jamie Simon said virtually all expenses are higher, driving up the cost of running overall.\n\n“As our fees go up, we try to balance that increase with expanded financial assistance options,” said Simon. “We want to ensure that people can participate in Tawonga programs regardless of their financial situation. To that end, we give away over $750,000 a year in financial assistance.”\n\nNot every family can afford to pay for summer camp. The Salvation Army is one of several organizations that offers free camps.\n\nThe organization runs 43 sleep away camps and hundreds of day camps nationwide for 6- to 17-year-olds, according to The Salvation Army Commissioner Kenneth Hodder.\n\nParents are expected to pay 10% to 15% more this summer for camps, according to the American Camp Association. Pictured here is Camp Tawonga in the Stanislaus National Forest outside of Yosemite National Park. Courtesy Camp Tawonga\n\n“These camps are crucial for families. Parents right now are stressed at every step. As schools are about to close, many don’t have the option of doing their jobs remotely and have to be at their day jobs,” he said.\n\nHodder said demand has soared this year.\n\n“80% of our campers don’t pay for the experience we provide, such as learning a new skill like swimming or archery or a craft. We also provide our campers with three meals a day. Many of them don’t get that at home,” he said.\n\nThe Salvation Army relies on public donations to fund its week-long summer camps, which Hodder estimates costs about $400 a week. “With inflation, it will cost considerably more this year, but that cost varies from place to place,” he said.\n\nHodder hopes public donations will continue to help offset the higher costs of running the camps.\n\n“I worked at summer camps for eight summers. I was a dishwasher and a camp counselor. And I even met my wife at camp,” Hodder said. “These camps are vital for children, and families need to know they have an option for their child.”", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/10/economy/may-inflation-gas-prices/index.html", "title": "Inflation rises at fastest pace in 40 years, pushed up by record gas ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe pain of higher prices continues for US consumers.\n\nRecord gas prices drove inflation to 8.6% for the 12 months ending in May, higher than the pace in April, according to the latest Consumer Price Index, the government’s basic inflation measure.\n\nThe reading for core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, posted a 6% increase over the same period, higher than the previous month’s level. Both readings are among the biggest jumps in prices experienced by consumers since 1981.\n\nOverall, the increases were higher than forecast by economists, who had been expecting prices to jump by 8.3% over the 12 months ending in May, and which would have matched April’s reading. This report dashed hopes that inflation had peaked earlier this year.\n\n“Inflation is going higher and broader with a worsening outlook,” said Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. “The probability of a recession in the next year or so is rising. Inflation is eating away at consumers’ purchasing power. Since consumer spending accounts for about 70% of the economy, a real decrease in consumer spending would deal a big blow to the economy.”\n\nThe typical US household is spending about $460 more every month than they did last year to purchase the same basket of goods and services, said Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody’s Analytics.\n\nEnergy prices rose 34.6% compared to a year ago, driven by a nearly 50% jump in gas prices over the last year. AAA’s tracking of gas prices shows the price of a gallon of regular gas nationwide is now at $4.99, after setting records in 31 of the last 32 days. The June CPI report due next month is certain to show another big jump in gas prices.\n\nBut energy price hikes were not limited to the record gasoline prices. Electricity prices rose 12% over the last 12 months, the biggest annual increase since 2006. And the price of natural gas being used by consumers rose 30.2%, the biggest jump since 2008.\n\nThe higher energy prices alone added 2 percentage points to the overall CPI.\n\nIt’s not just energy that is driving prices higher. The Labor Department said almost all the major components that make up the index showed increased prices.\n\nPrices for food purchased to eat at home rose 11.9%, the largest 12-month increase since 1979, with eggs up 32.2%, milk up 15.9% and poultry up 16.6%.\n\nThe shelter index, which measures rents and other housing costs, posted a 5.5% increase, its biggest 12-month gain since 1991. While that might not be as big an increase as the double-digit price hikes in other categories, the money that consumers spend on their home, whether renting or buying, is typically the largest expenditure they make each month.\n\nUsed car prices, which had shown signs of moderating with monthly declines over the last three months, rose once again, lifting prices 16.1% over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, new car prices are up 12.6% over the same period. A shortage of computer chips has curbed production at automakers, and that limited inventory is responsible for the rise in prices.\n\nStrong demand for air travel at the start of the summer travel season is also lifting airfares, which posted a one-month jump of 12.6% in May, the third-straight monthly rise of more than 10%. In the last 12 months, airfares are up 37.8% and fares in May are 21.7% higher than in May 2019, before the pandemic caused a near halt in demand for air travel.\n\nThe continuing high pace of inflation means the Federal Reserve is all but certain to continue to aggressively raise interest rates when it meets next week. At its May meeting, the Fed raised rates by half a percentage point, the first such move in 22 years. Another half-point hike is likely at next week’s meeting, with some forecasters now calling for a three-quarter-point hike in light of Friday’s report.\n\nBut there are worries that the Fed’s monetary tightening could plunge the US economy into a recession. That has been a major factor in the sharp decline in US stock prices in recent months that has wiped out a great deal of household wealth. Stocks were sharply lower again Friday following the inflation reading.\n\n“Inflation is proving to be more persistent than was widely believed a year ago, when transitory was the buzzword,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. “The two key questions now? How far will the Fed go to knock inflation down, and how far can the Fed go without pushing the economy into recession?”\n\nWhile the inflation report brought new attacks on the Biden administration from Republicans, the White House sought to blame the worst of the inflation on the rise in the price of oil and gasoline after Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n“Today’s inflation report confirms what Americans already know. Putin’s price hike is hitting American hard,” President Joe Biden said at the Port of Los Angeles, where he was pausing from a regional summit to address what his team views as the most pressing current issue: high prices on everything from gas to groceries.\n\nBiden sought both to acknowledge the pain Americans are feeling, explain how he was looking to solve it and pin blame on others.\n\n“I understand,” Biden said. “Inflation is a real challenge to American families.”\n\nHe lambasted shipping conglomerates for raising prices and oil companies for their stock buybacks, singling out oil giant Exxon for making “more money than God” last year.\n\n– CNN’s Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/us/safeway-shooting-bend-oregon/index.html", "title": "Victim fought gunman in Oregon grocery store shooting that left 2 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne of the victims fought to disarm the suspected gunman during Sunday’s fatal shooting at a Safeway grocery store in Bend, Oregon, according to police spokeswoman Sheila Miller.\n\nTwo people were killed, police said. They were identified as Glenn Edward Bennett, 84, a customer who was shot in front of the store, and Safeway employee Donald Ray Surrett Jr., 66, who fought the shooter in the produce section, Miller said.\n\n“This is the Safeway employee who engaged with the shooter, which is to say he attempted to disarm the shooter and attacked this person, and we believe he prevented further deaths in addition to the quick police response,” Miller said. “Mr. Surrett acted heroically during this terrible incident.”\n\nGov. Kate Brown released a statement on Facebook Monday honoring Surrett.\n\n“While we are still gathering the facts about last night’s shooting, it’s clear that far more people could have been killed if not for the heroism of Donald Ray Surrett, Jr., who intervened to help stop the shooter, and the officers who entered while shots were still being fired,” Brown’s statement said. “In the face of senseless violence, they acted with selfless bravery. Their courage saved lives.”\n\nThe gunman – identified by police as Ethan Blair Miller, 20 – was found dead at the scene and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the police spokeswoman said.\n\nPolice found an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun close to Miller’s body, according to Bend Police Chief Mike Krantz.\n\nThe shooting unfolded shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday at a shopping center, Krantz said. Police initially received reports there may have been more than one shooter, Sheila Miller said, but there is no evidence of a second shooter. There were reports of at least two other people who had injuries that were not life threatening, as well, she said.\n\nThe motive remains unclear, but police are aware of online posts that might be relevant, Sheila Miller said.\n\n“We are aware that the shooter may have posted information online regarding his plan. We are investigating this. We have no evidence of previous threats or prior knowledge of the shooter. We received information about the shooter’s writings after the incident had taken place and the shooter has no criminal history in the area,” Miller said.\n\nSafeway said in a statement the company was saddened by the “senseless violence.”\n\n“Our thoughts and actions now are directed toward supporting our associates, customers, and the community affected by this tragedy. We thank the officers at the Bend Police Department for their response and will continue to support the department’s investigation over the coming days,” the company’s statement said.\n\nSunday’s shooting follows a spate of other grocery store shootings across the country in the past year and amid an overall surge in “active shooter” incidents, according to an FBI report.\n\nIn May, 10 people were killed in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack in Buffalo, New York. A “hero” security guard and a beloved teacher were among those gunned down.\n\nIn March, another 10 people were gunned down at a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. A veteran police officer with seven children was among those killed.\n\nLast September, a gunman shot 15 people – including one fatally – at a Kroger in Collierville, Tennessee. Some people hid in freezers to survive.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nMiller said police received multiple calls of shots fired around 7 p.m. at the Forum shopping center in northeast Bend.\n\nThe gunman entered from an apartment complex behind the shopping center, Miller said. He moved through the parking lot while firing rounds from an AR-15-style rifle before entering the Safeway.\n\nOnce inside, he shot a customer – Glenn Edward Bennett – who died while being taken to the hospital, Miller said.\n\nEmergency personnel respond to a shooting at the Forum shopping center in east Bend, Oregon, Sunday, August 28, 2022. Ryan Brennecke/The Bulletin/AP\n\nThe gunman continued to make his way through the store before having an altercation with and fatally shooting Donald Ray Surrett Jr., Miller said.\n\n“As our officers responded, they entered Safeway while shots were still being fired. They found the apparent shooter dead inside Safeway,” Miller said.\n\nAn AR-15 and shotgun were found near the gunman’s body, Miller said. Bend police did not fire any shots, she said.\n\nHow the gunman obtained firearms is under investigation. Because of online postings, Bend police also contacted the Oregon State Police Bomb Squad, who cleared the grocery store and the apartment complex, Miller said.\n\nPolice said it’s unclear how many people were in the store at the time of the shooting.\n\nOfficers were on scene within three minutes of the first 911 call, Miller said. It took four minutes from the time officers were dispatched to the time the shooter’s body was found, police said.\n\nPlans appeared to be posted online\n\nA search warrant was served on the gunman’s vehicle and home, Miller said. Investigators found three Molotov cocktails in his car along with a sawed-off shotgun. Police are working with the ATF to learn if the firearms were legal.\n\nIn his apartment, authorities found additional ammunition and digital devices that are currently being reviewed.\n\nCNN has identified several blog entries appearing to belong to Ethan Miller which were published on the blogging site “Wattpad” detailing a plan and reasons for the shooting. The posts were made public on the evening of August 28 by an anonymous account and viewable for 12 hours, according to Wattpad. The posts have since been removed.\n\nThe first blog entry was headlined June 29 and signed with the name Ethan. The writer of the post blamed Covid-19 and quarantine for worsening their mental health.\n\nInitially, this person planned a shooting inside a high school on September 8, according to the posts.\n\nMore than 35 posts were made by this same account on the blogging site. Most of the posts indicated a desire to commit violence.\n\nOne post referenced being “partially inspired” by the Columbine High School shooting.\n\nIn other posts signed with the name Ethan, several reasons were cited for the writer turning into a “ticking time bomb,” which included their family and their love life, which was detailed in a post headlined July 8.\n\nThe writer mentioned buying a shotgun and an AR-15 for the shooting, and said they hoped to kill over 40 people.\n\nThroughout the posts, other mass shootings were also referenced.\n\n“I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’”\n\nCustomers and employees described a chaotic scene at Safeway, saying they scrambled for safety as bullets flew.\n\nJosh Caba told CNN affiliate KTVZ he and his four children were shopping in the store when the shots broke out.\n\n“We started heading to the front. Then we heard I don’t know how many shots out front – six or seven. I immediately turned to my children and said, ‘Run!’ People were screaming. … it was a horrifying experience,” Caba told KTVZ.\n\nCaba said he was worried about his wife, who stayed in the car because she wasn’t feeling well. But as he and three of his children fled through exit doors by the produce department, he found that his wife had driven to the back of the store and was “sitting in the car, saying ‘Get in the car! Get in the car!’” KTVZ reported.\n\nThe father was able to rush back into the store and find their fourth child, he told KTVZ.\n\nAn employee who identified himself only as Robert told the Central Oregon Daily News that he and other employees were working a closing shift in the deli when they heard loud gunfire.\n\n“Me and three other employees ran into a walk-in refrigerator and closed the door and stayed there and stayed hidden until authorities arrived,” he said.\n\nA third person was struck and was in good condition at St. Charles Medical Center, spokesperson Lisa Goodman said.\n\nResidents in the central Oregon city were stunned by the shooting.\n\n“I heard anywhere from five to eight shots. I thought it sounded like backfire,” Heather Thompson, who lives across the street, told Central Oregon Daily News.\n\n“Less than a minute later, there were 10 to 20 shots, and then another 10 to 20 shots,” she said. “And by that time, I went inside and told my dad to get away from the window. And people were running out of Safeway.”\n\nClarification: This story has been updated to clarify when the Wattpad posts were made public.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Tina Burnside Caroll Alvarado Hannah Sarisohn", "Amir Vera", "Tina Burnside", "Caroll Alvarado", "Hannah Sarisohn"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}]}

Kim Reynolds' Fair-Side Chat\n\nMany of the positions advocated by Ramaswamy, author of \"Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam,\" are similar to those of DeSantis.\n\nHe also is an avowed admirer of Trump. In a Sioux City appearance in June, he pledged that if elected, he would pardon the former president, after Trump was indicted on 37 counts of illegally keeping national defense documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, after leaving the White House, and conspiring to obstruct justice by hiding them from federal authorities.\n\nWill Vivek Ramaswamy accept anything other than the presidential nomination?\n\nLarge crowds of people swarmed Ramaswamy as he roamed the fairgrounds, stopping him constantly for pictures or a conversation.\n\nWhile walking in the shade near the Anne & Bill Riley Stage at 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Ramaswamy said he thinks he eventually will overtake DeSantis, leaving himself in a one-on-one battle with Trump.\n\n\"I think the two relevant candidates are going to be pretty quickly Trump and myself,\" Ramaswamy said. \"We're the party of the outsider, and it's going to be a choice between two outsiders with very different attributes.\"\n\nAs Ramaswamy walked between the poultry building and an ice cream stop with Iowa Ag Secretary Mike Naig, several fairgoers asked him if he would accept a potential vice president nomination by Trump.\n\n\"I think I'd be a better president,\" he said while strolling down Grand Avenue around 11 a.m. Saturday.\n\nDuring the Register's Soapbox, a woman asked if he would accept the position of vice president if he didn't secure the GOP nomination, Ramaswamy joked that Donald Trump would do \"pretty well\" as a vice president for him.\n\nDuring a press conference after his Soapbox appearance, Ramaswamy said again said that he is focused on winning the GOP nomination and not securing a cabinet position or a vice-presidential nomination.\n\n\"If I were building a political career, of course, I would do that,\" Ramaswamy said. \"I'm not building a political career.

But Parks said he is supporting Ramaswamy for president.\n\n\"He's got an outsider perspective, and maybe like RFK Jr. he can bring something new to the Republican Party,\" Parks said. \"\n\nParks had not seen Ramaswamy speak before. He simply went to hear what the candidate told voters.\n\n\"He's different,\" Parks said. \"He's very persuasive. I don't know who I'd vote for, but I'd drop RFK, Trump and Vivek.\"\n\nKatie Howard, 67, of Ottumwa said she supported Trump in the past. But she is supporting Ramaswamy over Trump because she is worried that the criminal investigations into his conduct could divide the country.\n\n“I’m worried about a four-year vendetta from Trump,\" Howard said. \"I’ve watched what happened since 2020. I don’t like it. I don’t like negativity. I like positive outlooks, and Vivek has got that.”\n\nShe loves Ramaswamy because he, “Is articulate, he is radiant, he actually has a plan,” she said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, a Republican, is declining to endorse a candidate in GOP the field.\n\n\"He clearly brings a ton of positive energy to the campaign trail,\" Nunn said. \"I love the fact that he can talk everything from policy to foreign governance and the answer is literate in technology. I think that goes a long way for whoever is going to be the next leader of the free world.\"\n\nNunn joked that on at Friday's Jalapeno Pete's event, Ramaswamy \"bought a round for all of Des Moines.\" Ramaswamy is engaging many young voters, Nunn said.\n\n\"I'm excited to see that he's bringing out the next generation,\" Nunn said. \"When you get a young generation engaged with a philosophy or a candidate style they like, a lot of them stick with them for their entire life. Talk to anybody my age or older and they'll tell you about the good old days of (Ronald) Reagan.\"\n\nRamaswamy dodges climate questions, focuses on fossil fuels\n\nRamaswamy is a staunch supporter of fossil fuels. In the past, he has called out green energy industries. During Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds’ Fair-Side Chat Saturday morning, Ramaswamy said again,” The climate change industry is a hoax.”\n\nJuly was the hottest month on earth in 120,000 years of recorded history, according to Scientific American. And the 2020 derecho produced peak wind gusts of 140 mph and flattened parts of eastern Iowa including Cedar Rapids.\n\nIowa State Climatologist said after the Dec. 15, 2021, derecho spawned 63 tornadoes — a record for any day in recorded Iowa history — that as the climate warms, extreme weather events are happening more often in Iowa.\n\nIn recent years, Iowa has seen flooding caused by higher-intensity rainfall coupled with droughts. While 2018 was the second-wettest year in 149 years of record-keeping, for example, a drought also gripped southeastern Iowa.\n\n\"We're seeing these conditions co-mingle,\" Glisan said in December 2021.\n\nDuring a press conference after his Soapbox speech, Ramaswamy said that global temperatures are going up by \"a little bit\" and that man-made causes are likely the cause.\n\n\"Is that an existential risk to humanity?\" Ramaswamy asked. \"It is absolutely not.\"\n\nInstead, he said as president, he will embrace fossil fuels.\n\n\"We're abandoning the anti-carbon agenda in this country,\" Ramaswamy said. \"We will drill more, we will frack more, we will burn more coal, we will use ethanol, we will use nuclear energy without apologizing for who we are as Americans.\"\n\nVivek Ramaswamy doubles down on eliminating 'three-letter' organizations\n\nRamaswamy has committed to \"shutting down\" the federal government and eliminating federal agencies like the FBI, IRS and Department of Education. While being interviewed by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds Saturday morning, Ramaswamy committed again to downsizing the federal government.\n\n\"We do face a choice in this primary,\" Ramaswamy said during the Soapbox appearance. \"The choice is this — do you want incremental reform? Or do you want revolutions?\"\n\nAddison Lathers covers growth and development for the Des Moines metro.

But she’s still planning to support former Republican President Donald Trump in the caucuses.\n\nHer husband, David Woodcock, has previously supported Trump but is looking for someone new. He likes what he saw in Ramaswamy and said he’ll consider him moving forward.\n\n“He really stood out at the debate,” he said.\n\nAfter Ramaswamy captured national attention at the first GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee Aug. 23, he's hoping to capitalize on his moment in the spotlight by barnstorming Iowa with the go-everywhere and talk-to-everyone strategy that has helped propel his rise so far.\n\nHe’ll need to convert the newly interested — people like the Woodcocks — into firm supporters to help build momentum in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\nEven though national polling shows him surging into third place ahead of better-known candidates like former Vice President Mike Pence and former U.N.

You've got me jazzed.”\n\nAfter the event, West said he doesn’t believe Trump is electable and he’s ready to support someone different in the caucuses. He worries Ramaswamy could be a little weak on foreign policy, but he said there’s “something special about this guy.”\n\nVivek Ramaswamy leans into support for Donald Trump\n\nRamaswamy has established himself on the debate stage and on the Iowa campaign trail as a Trump supporter, embracing the former president’s MAGA instincts and refusing, more than any other candidate, to criticize him.\n\n“Let’s just speak the truth,” he said during the debate. “President Trump, I believe, was the best president of the 21st century. It’s a fact.”\n\nHe reiterated his promise to pardon Trump if voters give him the chance, and he called on his competitors to do the same.\n\nWhen debate moderators asked candidates to raise their hands if they would still support Trump if he’s convicted in any of the legal cases that are advancing, Ramaswamy was the first to do so.\n\n“That shows me that there’s some leadership skills there,” said state Sen. Brad Zaun, who spoke at the Polk County Summer Sizzle event where Ramaswamy also appeared in Clive Friday night. Zaun has endorsed Trump.\n\nAt that event, Ramaswamy sat at a table with former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who served in the Trump administration as the U.S. ambassador to China.\n\nCurrently, Trump dominates the Iowa caucus field, leading Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis 42% to 19% among likely Republican caucus attendees, the Iowa Poll showed.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina is in third place with 9%, Haley and Pence tie at 6%, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at 5% and Ramaswamy follows with 4%. Seven other candidates are polling at 2% or lower.\n\nIn total, the poll showed 34% of respondents are considering supporting Ramaswamy in the caucuses. That includes the 4% who name him as their first choice for president, the 12% who say he is their second choice and another 18% who say they are actively considering him.\n\nBy that measure, Ramaswamy places fifth behind Trump, who has a total footprint of 63%, DeSantis (62%), Scott (53%) and Haley (40%).\n\nBut Ramaswamy is less well-known than those other top-tier candidates. According to the poll, 38% view him favorably, 20% view him unfavorably and 41% are not sure — an indication that they don't know enough about him to form an opinion.\n\nThat may change after the debate, where Ramaswamy had the second-most speaking time of anyone on stage.\n\nIn Newton, Ramaswamy argued that the debate showed a clear divide between the candidates on stage and cast himself as the true change candidate.\n\n“We had some banter on the basketball court a couple nights ago,” he joked, drawing chuckles. “And that’s OK. That’s a good thing. It makes our party stronger to have real, open debate. But I do think we face a choice — a choice between good people who I respect. Do you want incremental reform, or do you want revolution? I stand on the side of revolution.”\n\nRamaswamy delivers, withstands attacks on first debate stage\n\nAt the debate, Ramaswamy both delivered the most attacks and was the recipient of the most attacks, according to NBC News.\n\nPence repeatedly attacked Ramaswamy's lack of experience calling him a \"rookie\" and Christie derided him as an \"amateur.” Ramaswamy has never held elected office.\n\nOn the campaign trail in Iowa Friday, Ramaswamy addressed those critiques directly.\n\n“You know how old (Thomas Jefferson) was when he wrote the Declaration of Independence?” he asked. “Thirty-three. Thirty-three years old. I'm an old man compared to what he was.”\n\nMuch like Trump, Ramaswamy has cast his political inexperience as an asset, saying he’s the only candidate who isn’t “bought and paid for.”\n\n“If you have a broken car, you don't turn over the keys to the people who broke it again,\" he said during the debate.\n\nBut those quips did little to stop the barrage of debate-night attacks.\n\nPence and Haley attacked Ramaswamy for saying he would freeze the current lines of control in Ukraine in return for a promise from Russia that it would not form a military alliance with China.\n\n“Ukraine is not a priority for the United States of America,” Ramaswamy argued, raising China as a bigger threat.\n\nHaley argued that a win for Russia is a win for China and said Ukraine is the first line of defense. And she accused Ramaswamy of wanting to “go and defund Israel” after he said in an interview that the U.S. should aim to reduce its aid to Israel.\n\n“You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows,” Haley told Ramaswamy.\n\nOne event attendee in Newton asked Ramaswamy to clarify his position on Israel after that debate exchange, calling it a “stumbling block” for her.\n\n“I'm new to politics,” he said. “This is a dirty game. People will, maybe they'll distort what you say. I did not expect people to literally make up things that you've never said. So I'll be very clear about where I am on Israel.”\n\nHe said that in his original comments, he said it should be the goal to “get to a place where Israel is so strongly integrated back into the security and economic infrastructure of the Middle East, that they no longer even require the $30 billion in aid that we give them.”\n\nHe said he stands with Israel because “it is deeply in American interests to do so.”\n\n“I come to it with my own conviction, which means we're actually going to see it through rather than approaching it as a check-the-box transactional client relationship,” he said.\n\nInformation from USA Today and the Associated Press was used in this report.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

Instead of the steady drumbeat of cases, hospitalizations and deaths, we were tracking a new number: the percentage of Americans who had been vaccinated. This number, we believed, was our best chance to beat the virus.\n\nThe US was caught up in a fever dream of reaching herd immunity, a threshold we might cross where vulnerable individuals – including those too young to be vaccinated or those who didn’t respond well to the vaccines – might be protected anyway because, as a community, we would weave an invisible safety net around them.\n\nWith herd immunity, if someone does get infected by a virus, they are surrounded by enough people who are shielded against infection that the virus has nowhere to go. It fails to spread.\n\nAs a country, we had reached this point against some formidable viruses, such as rubella and measles. We thought we could get there with Covid-19. We were probably wrong.\n\n“The concept of classical herd immunity may not apply to Covid-19,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview with CNN.\n\nAnd that “means we’re not going to be without SARS-CoV-2 in the population for a considerable period of time,” said Fauci, who recently co-authored a paper on herd immunity for the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n\nHow we beat measles\n\nFauci points to measles as an ideal case study in herd immunity.\n\nLike the virus that causes Covid-19, the measles virus spreads through the air. It is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people around them will catch it if they are not immune to it, according to the CDC. Some experts have estimated that the Omicron viruses are as contagious as the measles.\n\nThe US eliminated transmission of measles and has successfully kept the virus from circulating in this country because of three things: an extremely effective vaccine; a virus that doesn’t change, or mutate, in significant ways over time; and a successful childhood vaccination campaign.\n\nThe measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing the disease, according to the CDC. Once a person is vaccinated, studies have determined that protection lasts virtually their whole lives.\n\nMany states in the US had once reached an ambitious public health goal of getting more than 90% of their children vaccinated against the disease by the time they started kindergarten.\n\nThis high level of vaccination coverage, the durability and effectiveness of the vaccine, and the relative stability of the virus have helped the United States prevent major outbreaks of the disease for more than 20 years.\n\nStill, herd immunity has to extend beyond the borders of the United States. Each year, a certain number of cases arise when travelers bring it into the country, but it has never regained a foothold here and continued to circulate, because we have community-level protection against it.\n\nElimination of the virus isn’t infallible. In the United States, herd immunity against measles is wearing thin in many parts of the US – and indeed around the world – because of vaccine hesitancy.\n\nThe World Health Organization warned in 2019 that measles could become endemic again around the world as more people refuse their shots.\n\nCorralling Covid\n\nCovid-19, unfortunately, isn’t playing by those same rules.\n\n“Bad news number one,” said Fauci, is that the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 changes a lot and in significant ways.\n\n“We’ve already experienced over a period of two years that we’ve had five separate variants Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron. And now BA.2 from Omicron one,” he said.\n\n“Bad news number two is that there’s a lack of a wide acceptance of safe and effective vaccines,” Fauci said. Put simply, not enough people have been vaccinated.\n\nThe more contagious the virus, the more people have to be vaccinated to stop it from ripping through a community, according to Dr. Adam Kucharski, co-director of the Center for Epidemic Preparedness and Response at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In a July 2021 Twitter thread and in a recent interview with CNN, Kucharski explained how expectations around herd immunity have to shift as viruses become more contagious.\n\nKucharski estimated that for a virus as contagious as the Delta variant, 98% of the population would need to be vaccinated if the vaccines we have could prevent 85% of transmission of the virus.\n\nIf the vaccines didn’t prevent transmission to that extent, he said, then herd immunity probably wouldn’t be possible with the vaccines we currently have.\n\nIn a May 2021 paper on the same theme published in the journal Eurosurveillance, Kucharski and his co-authors explain that much of herd immunity also depends on how well the vaccines prevent transmission – the act of an infected person passing the virus to someone else.\n\nVaccines that prevent transmission are said to convey sterilizing immunity. The measles vaccine creates sterilizing immunity. The Covid-19 vaccines do not. While vaccination reduces the chances that you might pass Covid-19 to someone else, contact tracing studies have shown it still happens.\n\nIf not enough people get vaccinated – which has to be virtually the entire population for highly contagious variants – or the vaccines we have don’t stop nearly all transmission, we may not be able to reach herd immunity for Covid-19 until most people have developed immunity after getting the infection, Kucharski wrote in the article.\n\nThere are other factors to take into account, too, such as the durability of immunity over time.\n\n“Not only is vaccine induced immunity not lifelong, but infection induced immunity is not lifelong,” Fauci said, which means we’re going to need repeated exposures to either vaccines or infection to keep our defenses up to speed.\n\nHolding out hope\n\nSome are not ready to completely give up on the idea, however.\n\nBarry Bloom is an emeritus professor of public health at Harvard University. He says one way to get there would be to make better vaccines.\n\nCompanies are working on vaccines that would target more stable regions of the virus, including the stem of the spike protein, that doesn’t appear to mutate as much. That might create more durable immunity that could stand up to to the shape-shifting of the viruses’ variants.\n\nThere are also promising nasal spray vaccines that may help develop antibodies in nose and throat. The hope is that these vaccines may generate immunity in the tissues its most needed to create the kind of sterilizing immunity that prevents transmission.\n\nIf not a vaccine in a nasal spray, Bloom says, why not put monoclonal antibodies in a spray you could take daily before leaving home to prevent transmission of the virus?\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“And the question is are they good enough to wipe it [the virus] out before they’re asymptomatically transmitted? Or is it a constant game that we’re going to have to live with?” Bloom said in an interview with CNN.\n\nOr, Bloom says, maybe the best we can expect is an assist from evolution. He says the virus is changing to become more contagious over time, but not necessarily to cause more serious disease. Ultimately, killing a person doesn’t do the virus much good. It needs hosts. It would be much better for the virus to evolve to become as contagious as it can be, but maybe with less propensity for causing severe disease.\n\nBloom thinks this is probably what happened to the coronaviruses that now cause common colds. He thinks they probably once started as fierce predators but evolved over time to just be pests.\n\nThat way, they get to live on, but so do we.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/health/vaccine-effectiveness-bivalent-boosters-cdc/index.html", "title": "Updated boosters add limited protection against Covid-19 illness ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUpdated Covid-19 boosters that carry instructions to arm the body against currently circulating Omicron subvariants offer some protection against infections, according to the first study to look at how the boosters are performing in the real world. However, the protection is not as high as that provided by the original vaccine against earlier coronavirus variants, the researchers say.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, called the new data “really quite good.”\n\n“Please, for your own safety, for that of your family, get your updated Covid-19 shot as soon as you’re eligible to protect yourself, your family and your community,” Fauci said at a White House briefing Tuesday.\n\nUptake of the bivalent boosters, which protect against the BA.4/5 subvariants as well as the original virus strain, has been remarkably slow. Only 11% of eligible Americans have gotten them since they became available in early September.\n\nThe new study found that the updated boosters work about like the original boosters. They protect against symptomatic infection in the range of 40% to 60%, meaning that even when vaccine protection is its most potent, about a month after getting the shot, people may still be vulnerable to breakthrough infections.\n\nThat’s in about the same range as typical efficacy for flu vaccines. Over the past 10 years, CDC data shows, the effectiveness of the seasonal flu vaccines has ranged from a low of 19% to a high of around 52% against needing to see a doctor because of the flu. The effectiveness varies depending on how similar the strains in the vaccine are to the strains that end up making people sick.\n\nThe authors of the new study say people should realize that the Covid-19 vaccines are no longer more than 90% protective against symptomatic infections, as they were when they were first introduced in 2020.\n\n“Unfortunately, the 90% to 100% protection was what we saw during like pre-Delta time. And so with Delta, we saw it drop into the 70% range, and then for Omicron, we saw it drop even lower, to the 50% range. And so I think what we’re seeing here is that the bivalent vaccine really brings you back to that sort of effectiveness that we would have seen immediately after past boosters, which is great. That’s where we want it to get,” said Dr. Ruth Link-Gelles, an epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nVaccines are only one tool to stay well\n\n“This protection is not 100%, but it is something,” Link-Gelles said. “Especially going into the holidays where you’re likely to be traveling, spending time with elderly relatives, with vulnerable people. I think having some protection from infection and therefore some protection from infecting your loved one is better than having no protection at all.”\n\nLink-Gelles says it also means that people should continue to adopt a layered approach to protection, utilizing rapid tests, good-quality masks and ventilation as a comprehensive approach, rather than relying on vaccines alone.\n\n“This should be sort of one of the things in your toolbox for protecting yourself and your family,” she said. “Personally, we’re my family is all vaccinated up to date, but I think if we go to the airport tomorrow, we’ll be wearing our N95 [masks] because we’re seeing elderly relatives this weekend. And while we of course trust the vaccines, and I’m not super worried about a mild infection in myself or my healthy husband, we certainly would not want to infect his grandmother.”\n\nLink-Gelles added that she expects that vaccine protection against severe outcomes from Covid-19, like hospitalization and death, will be higher, but that data isn’t in yet.\n\nThe study, which was led by CDC scientists, relied on health records from more than 360,000 tests given at nearly 10,000 retail pharmacies between Sept. 14 and Nov. 11, a period when the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants were causing most Covid-19 infections in the US. The study included people ages 18 and up who had Covid-19 symptoms and were not immunocompromised.\n\nThe study looked at how effective the boosters were in two ways: Researchers calculated a value called absolute vaccine effectiveness, which compared the odds of symptomatic infection in people who received bivalent boosters with those who reported being unvaccinated. They also calculated relative vaccine effectiveness, which looked at the odds of symptomatic infection in people who received updated bivalent boosters compared with those who had two, three or four doses of the original single-strain vaccine.\n\nCompared with people who were unvaccinated, adults 18 to 49 who had gotten bivalent boosters were 43% less likely to get sick with a Covid-19 infection. Older adults, who tend to have weaker immune function, got less protection. Those ages 50 to 64 were 28% less likely, and those ages 65 and up were 22% less likely to get sick with Covid-19 than the unvaccinated group.\n\nThe relative vaccine effectiveness showed the added protection people might expect on top of whatever protection they had left after previous vaccine doses. If a person was two to three months past their last vaccine dose, the bivalent boosters added an average of 30% protection for those who were ages 18 to 49, 31% more protection if they were 50 to 64, and 28% more protection if they were 65 or older. At 3 months after their last booster, people ages 50 and older still had about 20% protection from Covid-19 illness, CDC data show. So overall, the updated boosters got them to around 50% effectiveness against symptomatic infection.\n\nIf a person was more than eight months away from their last vaccine dose, they got more protection from the boosters. But Link-Gelles said that by eight months, there was little protection left from previous shots against Omicron and its variants, meaning the vaccine effectiveness for this group was probably close to their overall protection against infection.\n\nThose ages 18 to 49 who were eight months or more past their last dose of a vaccine had 56% added protection against a Covid-19 infection with symptoms; adults 50 to 64 had 48% added protection, and adults over 65 had 43% added protection, on top of whatever was left from previous vaccinations.\n\nShort, modest protection from boosters\n\nJohn Moore, an immunologist and microbiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine, said it boils down to the fact that that boosters will probably cut your risk of getting sick by about 50%, and that protection probably won’t last.\n\n“Having a booster will give you some additional protection against infection for a short term, which is always what we see with a booster, but it won’t last long. It’ll decline, and it will decline more as the more resistant variants spread,” said Moore, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nThe immunity landscape in the United States is more complex than ever. According to CDC data, roughly two-thirds of Americans have completed at least their primary series of Covid-19 vaccines. And data from blood tests shows that almost all Americans have some immunity against the virus, thanks to infection, vaccination or both.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nA new preprint study from researchers at Harvard and Yale estimates that 94% of Americans have been infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 at least once, and 97% have been infected or vaccinated, increasing protection against a new Omicron infection from an estimated 22% in December 2021 to 63% by November 10, 2022. Population protection against severe disease rose from an estimated 61% in December 2021 to around 89%, on average, this November.\n\nAll of this means the US is in a better spot, defensively at least, than it ever has been against the virus – which is not to say that the country couldn’t see another Covid-19 wave, especially if a new variant emerges that is very different from what we’ve seen, if immunity continues to wane or if behavior shifts dramatically.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/health/covid-reinfection-risk/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 reinfections may increase the likelihood of new health ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRepeatedly catching Covid-19 appears to increase the chances that a person will face new and sometimes lasting health problems after their infection, according to the first study on the health risks of reinfection.\n\nThe study, which is based on the health records of more than 5.6 million people treated in the VA Health System, found that, compared with those with just one Covid-19 infection, those with two or more documented infections had more than twice the risk of dying and three times the risk of being hospitalized within six months of their last infection. They also had higher risks for lung and heart problems, fatigue, digestive and kidney disorders, diabetes and neurologic problems.\n\nThe findings come as a fresh wave of coronavirus variants, notably Omicron’s BA.5, have become dominant in the United States and Europe, causing cases and hospitalizations to rise once again. BA.5 caused about 54% of cases nationwide last week, doubling its share of Covid-19 transmission over the past two weeks, according to data posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBA.5 carries key mutations that help it escape antibodies generated by both vaccines and prior infection, leaving many people vulnerable to reinfection.\n\nDr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, led the research, which was posted as a preprint ahead of peer review. He said he decided to do it after watching reinfections become more and more common among his own patients.\n\n“If you asked me about reinfection maybe a year and a half ago, I would tell you that maybe I have a patient here or there, but it’s really, really rare,” Al-Aly said. That’s not true anymore, though.\n\n“So we asked a simple question that if you got Covid before and now you’re on your second infection, does this really add risk? And the simple answer is that it does.”\n\nTallying the risks of reinfections\n\nAl-Aly and his team compared the health records of more than 250,000 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 one time with records from 38,000 others who had two or more Covid-19 infections documented in their medical records. More than 5.3 million people with no record of a Covid-19 infection were used as the control group.\n\nAmong those with reinfections, 36,000 people had two Covid-19 infections, roughly 2,200 had caught Covid-19 three times, and 246 had been infected four times.\n\nCommon new diagnoses after reinfections included chest pain, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, inflammation of the heart muscle or the sac around the heart, heart failure and blood clots. Common lung issues included shortness of breath, low blood oxygen, lung disease, and accumulation of fluid around the lungs, Al-Aly said.\n\nThe study found that the risk of a new health problem was highest around the time of a Covid-19 reinfection, but it also persisted for at least six months. The increased risk was present whether or not someone had been vaccinated, and it was graded – meaning it increased with each subsequent infection.\n\nAl-Aly said that’s not what people really think will happen when they get Covid a second or third time.\n\n“There is this idea that if you had Covid before, your immune system is trained to recognize it and is more equipped to fight it, and if you’re getting it again, maybe it doesn’t affect you that much, but that’s not really true,” he said.\n\nAl-Aly said that doesn’t mean there aren’t people who have had Covid and done just fine; there are lots of them. Rather, what his study shows is that each infection brings new risk, and that risk adds up over time, he said.\n\nEven if a person has half the risk of developing lasting health problems during a second infection than they did during their first infection, he said, they still wind up with 50% more risk of problems than someone who didn’t get Covid-19 a second time.\n\nThe study has some important caveats. Al-Aly says it was more common to see reinfections among people who had existing risks because of their age or underlying health. That shows that reinfection may not be random, and it could be that the health risks linked to reinfections aren’t, either.\n\n“It is possible that sicker individuals or people with immune dysfunction are at higher risk of reinfection and adverse health outcomes after reinfection,” Al-Aly said.\n\nHe wasn’t interested in trying to isolate the pure effects of reinfection but wanted to understand how repeated infections are affecting the people who get them.\n\n“The most relevant question to people’s lives is, if you get reinfected, does it add to your risk of acute complications and long Covid, and the answer is a clear yes and yes,” he said.\n\nThe study is observational, which means it can’t determine cause and effect.\n\nAl-Aly says the researchers saw these increased risks even after they weighted the data to account for the effects of age, sex, medication use and the person’s underlying health before they got Covid-19.\n\nCovid-19 continues to surprise\n\nExperts who were not involved in the research say it is compelling.\n\n“There is this idea that I think a lot of people have that ‘if I survived my first infection, that I’m really going to be just fine the second time. There really shouldn’t be any problem,’ ” said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an instructor in clinical medicine at Columbia University.\n\n“The popular wisdom, right, is that reinfections are mild, nothing to worry about, nothing to see here,” Griffin said of the study on the podcast “This Week in Virology.” But that’s not really being borne out, he said.\n\nThis is not how it’s supposed to work. Even when viruses shape-shift – as influenza does – our immune system generally retains its memory of how to recognize and fight off some part of them. They may still make us ill, but the idea is that our prior immunity is there to mount some of kind of defense and keep us from serious harm.\n\nWith coronaviruses, and especially SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, the hits just keep on coming.\n\n“A year later, you can get reinfected with the same coronavirus the second time. It is not clear that that second infection can be more mild, because coronaviruses intrinsically have the ability to interfere with long-lasting lifetime immunity,” Griffin told CNN.\n\nGriffin says he’s seen Covid-19 reinfections go both ways. Sometimes, the second or third is milder for his patients, but sometimes it’s not.\n\nHow does that compare with other respiratory infections?\n\nEarly in the pandemic, people would get Covid, and three months would go by when they were pretty well protected, he said. But now, those reinfections are happening more frequently, no doubt because of the rapid changes to the virus. He says he’s seen some people infected four times in the past two years.\n\n“We don’t really see much of that with the flu,” Griffin said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs for what people should be doing now with regard to this risk, Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says Americans are really done with the pandemic. That doesn’t mean that the pandemic is done with us, though.\n\nOsterholm said he has three close friends who recently went to a restaurant for the first time since the pandemic started. All of them tested positive within 72 hours of that restaurant visit.\n\nIf you’re at higher risk of serious illness or you just want to avoid getting sick, it’s a good time to be wearing an N95 mask in public places, he says.\n\n“People don’t want to hear it, but that’s the reality.

Thanksgiving gatherings have the potential to amp up the spread of other viruses too, notably respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, and influenza, which are both already at high levels for this time of year.\n\n“We have seen, in some regions, RSV numbers starting to trend downward. Flu numbers are still on the rise. And we are concerned that after holiday gathering, lots of people coming together, that we may see increases in Covid-19 cases as well,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday on CNN.\n\nBut things have been relatively quiet on the Covid-19 front. Experts say it may not stay that way for long.\n\n“Covid positivity is going up,” said Shishi Luo, associate director of bioinformatics and infectious disease at the genetic testing company Helix, which has been monitoring coronavirus variants. “It’s increasing fastest among 18- to 24-year-olds” in the Helix sampling.\n\nIt’s the first time test positivity in the Helix data has risen since July.\n\nWhen test positivity increases, it means a greater proportion of Covid-19 tests are returning positive results, and it can be an indication that transmission is on the rise.\n\n“We should expect more cases,” Luo said. “Whether they’re measured in how we measure cases right now, I don’t know, but I think in general, you should see more people who are sick. I definitely am.”\n\nIncreasing cases may not be picked up as quickly by official counts because people are mostly testing for Covid-19 at home and not reporting their results – if they test at all.\n\nWill new subvariants drive a wave of cases?\n\nThe BQ subvariants of Omicron have risen to dominate transmission in the US. BQ.1 and its offshoot BQ.1.1 are descendants of BA.5; they have five and six key mutations, respectively, in their spike proteins that help them evade immunity created by vaccines and infections. Because of these changes, they’re growing more quickly than BA.5 did.\n\nFor the week ending Nov. 19, the CDC estimates that BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 were causing about half of all new Covid-19 cases in the US. But so far, they’ve risen to predominance without much impact.\n\nCovid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have remained flat for the past four weeks. But it’s not gone: On average, more than 300 Americans die and 3,400 people are hospitalized each day with Covid-19, according to CDC data.\n\nNobody knows exactly what will happen with the BQ variants. Many experts say they feel hopeful that we won’t see the big waves of winters past – certainly nothing like the original Omicron variant, with its jaw-dropping peak of nearly a million new daily infections.\n\nThere’s reason for optimism on a number of fronts.\n\nFirst, there’s the experience of other countries like the UK, where BQ.1 has outcompeted its rivals to dominate transmission even as cases, hospitalizations and deaths have fallen. Something similar happened in France and Germany, notes Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\n“Cases went up in France and Germany just before the subvariants came in. Then the subvariants came in, and cases actually dropped,” he said.\n\nBill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, thinks our behavior and our social contacts might be bigger determinants of whether cases will rise this go-round than whatever variant is in the lead.\n\nHe thinks it’s likely that we’ll see a rise in cases that may peak around the second week in January – as it has in years past – but that it won’t have a big effect on hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nAndrew Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that’s probably because BQ.1’s advantages are incremental, not drastic.\n\n“It’s probably got a bit more of a fitness advantage, so what we’re seeing is gradual replacement without a massive change in the total number of Covid-19 cases,” he said.\n\nAmerica lags in vaccination\n\nAll that’s not to say that BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 won’t have any impact. They’ve shown marked resistance to the antibodies that are available to protect and treat people who are vulnerable to severe Covid-19 infections. From that standpoint, there’s good reason for people to be cautious if they have weakened immune systems or will be around someone who does.\n\nBut these subvariants will land at a time when population immunity is higher than ever, thanks to vaccines and infections. It’s a very different setting than the virus encountered when Omicron emerged a year ago, and that should also help dampen any coming wave, Pekosz says.\n\n“With lots of people now being boosted and vaccinated and with people having some immunity from an Omicron infection, it’s also a very, very different sort of population landscape for a variant to emerge in,” he said. “All the signs are, I think, the best part of the scenario in terms of not seeing these massive increases in cases.”\n\nIf there’s reason to worry about BQ in the US, it could be this: Americans aren’t as well-vaccinated or boosted as other countries. CDC data shows that two-thirds of the population has completed the primary series of the Covid-19 vaccines, and only 11% of those who are eligible have gotten an updated bivalent booster. In the UK, 89% of the population over age 12 has completed their primary series, and 70% have been boosted.\n\nNew research indicates that a country’s vaccination rate matters more than any other single factor when it comes to the effects of variants on a population.\n\nScientists at Los Alamos National Labs recently completed a study delving into what drove the effects of 13 dominant variants of coronavirus as they transitioned from one to another in 213 countries. The study includes data up to the end of September and was published as a preprint ahead of peer review.\n\nAmong 14 variables that influenced the speed and height of new Covid-19 waves, a population’s vaccination rate was by far the most important.\n\nThe number of previous cases in a country, the percentage of people who wore masks, average income and the percentage of the population older than 65 ran a distant second, third, fourth and fifth, respectively.\n\nHow many other variants are in the mix when a new one rises is also an important factor, says senior study author Bette Korber, a laboratory fellow in the Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group at Los Alamos.\n\nShe points to the Alpha variant, B.1.1.7, and how it behaved in the UK versus the US.\n\n“When it came through England, it was just extremely fast, but it was much slower in the Americas,” Korber said.\n\nBy the time Alpha reached the United States, we were evolving our own variants out of California and New York “that were very distinctive and had a competitive edge compared to what it had to come up against in England,” Korber said, which probably slowed its roll here.\n\nThe CDC is tracking a soup of more than a dozen Omicron subvariants that are causing cases in the US, and that variety may end up helping dampen any wave over the winter.\n\nBut Korber isn’t making any predictions. She says it’s just too difficult to know what’s going to happen, pointing to Asia as the source of her uncertainty.\n\nAsian countries have been contending with waves driven by the recombinant XBB, a subvariant that really hasn’t had much of a presence in the US. The BQ variants arrived later, but she says they look impressive against XBB, which is also highly immune-evasive.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“BQ is really making a stand there,” Korber said. “So I think it’s not really possible to be certain yet” what could happen in the US.\n\n“To me, it’s a good time, when it’s possible, to wear masks,” she said. Masks protect the wearer as well as others around them. “And get the booster if you’re eligible and it’s the right moment for you,” especially as we gather around the table to feast with our friends and family.\n\n“It’s a time to exercise a little additional caution to prevent that wave that we don’t want to see happening, or at least make it a smaller bump,” Korber said", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/health/updated-boosters-omicron-imprint/index.html", "title": "Updated Covid-19 boosters offer protection, but new studies suggest ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe updated Covid-19 booster shots appear to work about as well against the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants as the original boosters they replaced, according to two new studies from research teams at Harvard and Columbia universities.\n\nThe research suggests that our bodies have been well-trained to fight the original virus, which emerged from Wuhan, China, and that boosters mostly reinforce that response. Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n“We see essentially no difference” between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn’t yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that’s long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes – hospitalization or death from Covid-19 – lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren’t the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho’s study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time – about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n“We can’t say that a few months from now, there won’t be any difference,” he said. “We won’t know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.”\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n“At least at this time point, there’s no discernible benefit” over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch’s studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch’s study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn’t pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn’t protect people any better in the real world.\n\n“We would not expect this to be clinically significant,” said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch’s team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn’t budge much after either vaccine.\n\n“Unfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,” Barouch said.\n\n‘A booster is a booster’\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results “can be considered a disappointment,” especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n“A booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,” Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people – less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up – have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n“Your old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,” Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn’t sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n“I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster – at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals – before next September, October,” he said.\n\n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen, but it’s what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.”\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn’t find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n“Your body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,” said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat’s the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, “but I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.”\n\nIt’s possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants – “things that just happen to really wake up the immune system” – can do it.\n\nBut it’s not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he’s thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna’s. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“For me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA’s advisers in June.\n\nHe says it’s one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n“Certainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,” said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body’s response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat’s something the FDA’s Marks has considered, too.\n\n“I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what’s best moving forward,” he told Stat. “Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/health/thanksgiving-updated-covid-booster/index.html", "title": "Thanksgiving is two weeks away. Get your updated Covid-19 shot ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith Thanksgiving just two weeks away, people who are eligible for an updated Covid-19 vaccine booster but still haven’t received the shot will need to roll up their sleeves Thursday to get as much protection as possible before the holiday.\n\nHealth officials are worried about a possible surge in respiratory illnesses this winter – including Covid-19, flu, RSV and rhinoviruses – and they are urging people who are not up-to-date on their Covid-19 shots to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n“The way it makes protection is to create these proteins, which we call antibodies, that then circulate in the bloodstream. Well, that can’t be done with a snap of the finger. There’s a biological process that takes place,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\nAfter getting the updated Covid-19 vaccine, that biological process can take about 10 to 14 days.\n\n“So it starts right away, and gradually you get more and more of these antibodies into your bloodstream until, by about two weeks, you’re close to having a maximum,” Schaffner said. “The booster actually functions as a booster: You get an increase in antibody that’s faster than if you started from scratch.”\n\nThe rollout of the updated boosters has been sluggish, and there’s some urgency to building protection before gathering with family and friends for the holidays – the first festive season of the pandemic since most prevention measures, including masks and social distancing, largely became things of the past.\n\nIn October, White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said that getting the updated Covid-19 vaccine is “the most important thing” Americans can do for their health right now.\n\n“The most important thing every American can do to reduce their likelihood of having significant, preventable health issues in the next three to six months is to go get an updated Covid vaccine,” Jha said. “Beyond that, we need to make sure that everyone over the age of 50 or otherwise with high-risk conditions gets treatments if they do get infected. We have treatments widely available.”\n\nAs colder weather arrives, people spend more time indoors and more holiday celebrations are planned, concern mounts among local health officials that there will be some uptick in the spread of Covid-19, flu and RSV in the weeks ahead, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nThat concern is heightened even more because relatively few people across the United States have gotten the updated Covid-19 vaccine booster that is now available for those 5 and older.\n\n“The message from the local health departments on this is that you should by now – if you are eligible and able – be getting your booster to protect you through the holidays,” Freeman said.\n\n“The longer that time goes on since you’ve received your last booster, the more that your immunity wanes and the more susceptible you become again to getting sick with the virus,” she said. “So all those things together spell out that we have prevention to do right now as we get ready for the end of the year and the holiday season upon us.”\n\nLess than 10% of the US population – about 26 million people 5 and older – has gotten an updated Covid-19 booster dose, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Coverage is highest among older adults: More than 1 in 5 seniors who got their primary series have also gotten an updated booster, compared with about 1 in 15 adults under the age of 30.\n\nBut the pace of uptake is relatively slow.\n\nAbout 1 in 5 adults who have their primary series say they will probably or definitely not get the updated booster – a share that has been consistent since at least September, CDC data shows.\n\n“What clearly will happen if we still don’t have widespread acceptance of this Covid booster is that the anticipated increase that we expect with Covid this winter will increase even more,” Schaffner said. “So we could make the season worse from the point of view of more serious disease.”\n\nHe added that with rising flu activity, an ongoing surge in RSV and the growing concerns around a possible increase in Covid-19 this winter, that is why it will be important to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and flu ahead of the holidays – and to make sure those around you will be vaccinated, washing their hands and staying home when sick.\n\n“You could have a rule: You’re all welcome at the Thanksgiving table, for example, if you’re vaccinated and not only against Covid, against influenza, too,” Schaffner said.\n\nHealth officials say it’s fine to get the updated Covid-19 booster and flu vaccine at the same time.\n\nFlu activity continues to ramp up\n\nFlu is already spreading at high levels in some areas.\n\nLast week, government health officials warned of an early and severe start to cold and flu season in the United States, saying they were closely monitoring hospital capacity and medical supplies and were ready to send help if needed.\n\n“We suspect that many children are being exposed to some respiratory viruses now for the first time, having avoided these viruses during the height of the pandemic,” said Dr. Jose Romero, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\n\nAcross the United States, cases of RSV and influenza are increasing. At the same time, Covid-19 cases, which had been dropping, appear to have plateaued over the past three weeks, Romero said. A raft of new variants has been gaining ground against BA.5, the Omicron subvariant that caused a wave of illness over the summer.\n\nLooking ahead, some vaccine makers, including Novavax and Pfizer and BioNTech, are developing two-in-one combination vaccines that will offer protection against both flu and Covid-19 in a single shot.\n\nLast week, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that the first study participant has received a dose of their investigational flu-Covid combination vaccine in a Phase 1 trial. The vaccine candidate contains components of the companies’ updated Covid-19 booster and their investigational flu vaccine.\n\nIn October, Novavax announced that its Covid-19 and flu combination vaccine generated immune responses against coronavirus and influenza strains, showing “positive results” in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. That trial is “the first of its kind” to evaluate a Covid-flu combination vaccine, the company said, and insights from the trial will inform a Phase 2 study that’s expected to start by the end of this year. The investigational vaccine is a two-in-one combination of Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine and its quadrivalent flu vaccine candidate.\n\nModerna is also developing a combined flu and Covid-19 mRNA vaccine and another combination vaccine targeting flu, Covid-19 and RSV.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHealth officials have long suspected that Covid-19 vaccinations will be needed annually in the future, similar to how seasonal flu vaccines are given each year.\n\nA combination vaccine could be available as soon as for the next flu season, Freeman said, making it easier for people to roll up their sleeves on an annual basis.\n\n“We may see as early as next year,” she said. “And that will help make it easier for people to make that choice to get both their flu and Covid either together in one vaccine or together at once wherever they’re able to get their vaccine.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/31/health/covid-19-china-us-different/index.html", "title": "A Covid-19 spike like the one in China is unlikely in the US, experts ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Omicron coronavirus variant may be reaching around the world, but different places are seeing significantly different effects.\n\nIn the United States, Covid-19 case numbers have been falling since January. They may have hit a plateau as a subvariant of Omicron, BA.2, becomes the main cause of infections.\n\nBut in China, an area of the world that has had few spikes during the pandemic, there has been a dramatic increase in cases as BA.2 rips through the country.\n\nThe difference, experts say, is part policy and part population-level immunity. What’s happening in China doesn’t necessarily mean the US is in for another huge spike in cases.\n\nAll health is local – at least now\n\n“Public health is very much a local thing,” said Andy Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.\n\nWith the first Covid-19 cases in 2020, he said, trends were similar around the globe because most people’s bodies had no experience with the coronavirus, and there were no vaccines. They had no protection against it.\n\nSince then, different countries have used different vaccines and have had different success with vaccination campaigns. There’s also a different level of immunity among populations in different regions. All of that affects the trajectory of Covid-19 cases.\n\n“You would probably expect to see more variation from country to country in terms of case numbers and surges and fatality rates from here on out,” Pekosz said. “All of that means it’s just difficult to make blanket statements about how things are going to go forward.”\n\nDifferent case management strategies\n\nLockdowns in the US are a thing of the past and will probably stay that way, public health experts say. Though the decline in case numbers seems to be leveling off in the US, it’s rare to see someone wearing a face mask in many places.\n\nBy comparison, China has a zero-Covid policy. As cases have been on the rise in more than two dozen provinces, restrictions have gotten much tougher.\n\nIn Shanghai, a city of 26 million, people are confined to their homes, able to go out only for essential supplies. Regular tests are mandatory. Officials throughout China check color-based “health code” systems to monitor people’s movements. Everyone has a smartphone app that shows their personal QR health code: green for healthy, yellow for close contacts and red for confirmed or suspected cases.\n\nIf someone tests positive for Covid-19 – even if they don’t have symptoms – they must isolate in large temporary facilities set up in stadiums and convention centers. They can’t leave until they test negative twice. Pets are even sent to other centers for monitoring. Public health officials cordon off the person’s home and disinfected everything.\n\nWith the highly contagious Omicron variant, lockdowns can’t totally stop the growth in cases, but the strategy has helped, experts say.\n\nChina’s seven-day daily new case average is more than 14,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. By way of comparison, the country has about four times as many people as the US – but as of Thursday, the US is averaging more than 30,000 new Covid-19 cases per day. This is one of the lowest daily case rates since mid-July.\n\n“That’s a stark contrast,” said Abram Wagner, a research assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan. “We’re in different trajectories, with the US case numbers going down and kind of plateauing at this point in time, so the direction is different. But I think seeing the smaller number of cases in China, I think the policies that China has in play with restrictions on some level have had an effect.”\n\nWhether strict lockdowns are too heavy-handed and infringe too much on personal liberties is a different conversation, he said. But China has kept cases much lower overall than in the US, even during a spike.\n\nWhat’s made things more difficult is exactly how easy it is to catch Covid with Omicron.\n\n“Omicron has changed the equation in China,” Wagner said. “It’s just hard to maintain a dynamic zero-Covid policy that stamps it out completely.”\n\n‘Their firewall has broken down with Omicron’\n\n“Omicron, to compare it to other variants before it, has really changed an awful lot of the playing field,” Pekosz said. “Its transmissibility is just off the charts.”\n\nOmicron is three times as likely to spread as the Delta variant. None of the vaccines made to protect against the original strain works as well, especially in populations in China that haven’t seen spikes over the past two years.\n\n“Sort of their firewall has broken down with Omicron, and they have a massive amount of people who are susceptible to this virus,” said Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health.\n\nBA.2, which is playing a role in the spike in cases in China and is now the dominant strain in the US, is especially contagious. Some epidemiologists have said BA.2’s basic reproduction number may be as high as 12, meaning each sick person can infect an average of 12 others. That puts it on par with measles.\n\nThough it’s difficult to predict the trajectory of the pandemic in the US, Lessler said, community immunity could keep the country from seeing an across-the-board spike. Instead, we should see a “mild blip.”\n\n“I expect to see some resurgence here, but it’s a very different picture, even with the increase in the Omicron subvariant BA.2,” Lessler said.\n\nThe US population has built up immunity that China does not have. China has seen relatively few cases over the course of the pandemic, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 37 million Americans – about 1 in 11 – got Covid-19 in the past winter alone.\n\n“The [BA.2] subvariant of Omicron is not an entire leap ahead of Omicron, whereas Omicron was really quite different than Delta,” said Dr. Davidson Hammer, a professor of global health and medicine at Boston University. “I think that there are a lot of people, at least the United States, that have had Omicron, and there’s growing evidence that there’s they’re close enough in terms of their immunologic profile that if you’ve had 1, you’re unlikely to get 2.”\n\nIn other words, there’s a more limited pool of people who might become infected in the US than in China.\n\nVaccine strategy differences\n\nMany in the US have some coronavirus immunity from vaccination and boosters. More than 81% of the population has at least some protection with at least one dose, according to the CDC. Boosters have been less popular, but they do work when people get them.\n\nAnother problem for China may be the kind of vaccines it’s used, according to Dr. Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.\n\n“The increase in the number of cases reflects a combination of factors. Your population that’s immunologically naive, they haven’t seen much of the virus in the past and because they haven’t been vaccinated effectively to resist them,” Likpkin said.\n\nChina has mostly used the Chinese-made Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines. Both companies said their vaccines were more than 78% effective against Covid-19, but studies suggested otherwise. Late-stage trials of the Sinovac candidate in Brazil showed an efficacy rate of 50.38%, barely above the World Health Organization threshold for approval.\n\nOther studies have suggested that immunity from two doses of these vaccines wanes rapidly and that the protection may be limited, especially among older people and especially compared with mRNA vaccines used in the US. And against Omicron, all vaccines have been found to offer less protection.\n\nWagner thinks the difference between US and Chinese vaccines may be more of a wash when it comes to Omicron, but Lipkin says he has been telling colleagues in China for months that they need better protection.\n\n“A way out of the surge would be to rapidly vaccinate everyone with more effective vaccines. That’s not what they’re doing,” Lipkin said. “The notion that you can somehow conquer this with lockdowns is not going to work unless you’ve coupled the lockdown with an effective vaccine strategy.\n\n“It’s so disheartening and worrisome,” he added. “I spend enormous amounts of time in China, and I’ve been advising them to switch vaccines for many months, and they just won’t do it.”\n\nIt matters who’s vaccinated\n\nThe US has done a pretty good job of vaccinating the elderly, who are more vulnerable to severe disease and death, Lessler said. Almost 90% of people 65 and older have gotten two doses of the vaccine, according to the CDC, and 70% have gotten a booster.\n\n“In China, my understanding is, the vaccine rates are sort of inverted somewhat, and the elderly have lower vaccination rates,” he said.\n\nWith the most at-risk population unprotected in parts of China, Hong Kong has seen the world’s highest death rate by population size this month.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn the US this week, the Biden administration expanded eligibility for second boosters to people who are 50 and older, but one element that could limit this strategy is money. Congress failed to pass legislation that would fund Covid efforts. The uninsured may lose access to free treatments, tests and vaccines, and that could affect case numbers and deaths in the US.\n\nWith so many people getting sick globally, what also could change the direction of the pandemic in the US is another variant. If more people get sick, there’s more of a chance that another strain could come along – one that escapes the protection of current vaccines and treatments.\n\n“A new variant could certainly come along in the future that will bring another wave, and we will be forced to respond,” Lessler said. “That’s why it still makes sense to get vaccinated and boosted.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/04/19/coronavirus-herd-immunity-vaccines-determine-covid-second-wave/5151957002/", "title": "Coronavirus: Herd immunity, vaccines will determine COVID second ...", "text": "Even before the first horrific phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has run its course, scientists are worried about the second wave of the disease.\n\nIt could crash worse than the first, killing tens of thousands of people who did such a good job of sheltering in place they remain virgin ground for the virus. Or it could be a mere swell, with so many people having been infected without symptoms that levels of immunity are higher than realized.\n\nThere is no crystal ball to look to, because so many crucial pieces of information remain missing.\n\nAre people who've had COVID-19 immune? How long does immunity last? Will the virus play out like influenza and the common cold, peaking during cooler months and falling during warmer ones? Is its deadly path undeterred whatever the weather?\n\nCoronavirus Watch: Sign up for daily updates to your inbox\n\nUntil there’s a vaccine “it’s unfortunately not unlikely that we may see a second wave or even a third wave,” said Peter Marks, director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccines. He spoke on a call with reporters about vaccine development organized by the Commonwealth Fund.\n\n“I shudder to think of that, but I think we have to be realistic.\"\n\nImmunity: Can you get the coronavirus more than once?\n\nThe first question on every doctor’s mind is whether someone who has had COVID-19 is immune, and if so for how long. People who've had mumps are immune to mumps for life. Versions of the common cold caused by different types of coronavirus see immunity wane within a year. Variations are wide.\n\nCOVID-19 is such a new disease that there is no solid data on the immunity of survivors. But given its similarities to coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), it's expected to convey at least some immunity.\n\nThat’s good news because so many people have contracted COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease. Many more probably have had it asymptomatically and didn’t know. Both groups likely have some immunity.\n\nA class war? A global power shift? How experts see the future after coronavirus.\n\nWhat percentage of the population is immune is impossible to know because the United States doesn’t yet have widespread testing, experts say. An answer is likely months away. Even if immunity isn't lifelong, the virus may have infected enough people to make it hard for it to find new victims.\n\n“It would mean we’d be getting to herd immunity through natural immunity” even before a vaccine is developed, said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health, who co-wrote a paper in the journal Science modeling what COVID-19 might look like after the initial pandemic has passed.\n\nWhen it comes back, it’s likely to hit hardest areas not severely infected the first time, said Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and editor-in-chief of the journal Vaccine.\n\n“This outbreak has predominantly been on the two coasts. Wave 2 will be in the interior of the county where there are a lot of susceptible people,” he said.\n\nAmerica has suffered great loss before.Here's how we may learn to cope with coronavirus death toll.\n\nWill the coronavirus go away in the summer?\n\nAnother factor is whether the virus survives longer in cooler, drier weather. That’s why the flu is more common in winter, its virus survives longer and people are more likely to be indoors in close contact.\n\n“We have no idea really whether this is going to bounce back the moment people start going back outdoors or if the warmer weather is actually going to help us out,” said Michael Mina, a professor of epidemiology at the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard's Chan School of Public Health.\n\n“If it doesn’t happen in the summer, we’d all be very surprised if we don’t see some reemergence in the fall,” he said.\n\nFact check:Sunlight does not kill the new coronavirus\n\nIn that case, COVID-19’s sweet spot could be the same as influenza, roughly October to May, with a peak between October and November, modeling suggests. If it does behave like influenza, it will move to the Southern hemisphere for winter there, then return to the Northern hemisphere for its cold months.\n\n“To anthropomorphize, the virus will come back here looking for new victims,” Poland said.\n\nThe first wave of the disease, which the world is experiencing now, hit so hard because no one had immunity. It could eventually fall into a pattern of yearly reoccurrence, like influenza.\n\nIf compounded with the annual wave of winter flu, the nation’s hospitals would be further taxed.\n\nA fall spike also seems likely as children go back to school, said Mike Reid, a professor of infectious disease at the University of California-San Francisco.\n\nTo prevent that, wide-scale testing will need to be available, and contact tracing must be in place to find everyone who has been exposed and get them to self-isolate for at least 14 days.\n\n“Given the potential for repeated waves, the more that can be put in place to rapidly jump on every new spike and ring-fence every infected individual with wraparound health services is going to be crucial,” Reid said.\n\nWhen will life return to normal? Expert says US testing is too far behind to know\n\nWhat we do matters\n\nExperts say how we behave will play a large part in the size and severity of subsequent waves. People can help by remaining vigilant about washing their hands, continuing to socially distance and wear masks in public.\n\nAdd to that more surveillance and widely available tests, chances improve the second wave is smaller than the first.\n\nAs states begin to ease restrictions, the United States will effectively become a massive series of experiments. Epidemiologists will be watching carefully, Lipsitch said.\n\nSome areas will reopen schools, while other will have staggered school days, so not all students are there at the same time. The same will happen in workplaces, even as more work from home. Some areas will “cocoon” the elderly, taking special care they are not exposed. Others may create “passports” for people who are immune, if there's data showing infection confers immunity.\n\n“There are many things we can do, and we don’t know how any of them will work yet,” Lipsitch said.\n\nDoing temperature testing in schools and businesses, as is now done in Asia, could be helpful.\n\n“It’s not the most sensitive test in the world, but it is a screen that keeps people conscious that they have an obligation not to infect other people,” said Barry Bloom, a professor of public health at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health.\n\nStaying Apart, Together:This newsletter will help you cope with the coronavirus pandemic\n\nThe price of health is eternal vigilance\n\nVigilance will be key, experts say.\n\n“No one can say when the coast is clear,” said William Hanage, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health.\n\nCOVID-19 is easy enough to spread and has a long enough incubation period it’s possible to go from 100 known cases one week to 65,000 a few weeks later. “One slip and we could see it resurging,” he said.\n\nThere’s a cautionary tale from the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Toronto, which infected 375 people there and killed 44. The city took expanded precautions beginning in March, but they were lifted in May when it appeared the outbreak was over. It wasn’t.\n\n“Toronto took the brakes off,\" Hanage said. \"They had a flare, and it took them weeks to get it back under control.”\n\nContact reporter Elizabeth Weise at eweise@usatoday.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/health/rsv-immunity-gap/index.html", "title": "RSV: Pandemic 'immunity gap' is probably behind surge in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe measures that helped keep us safe from Covid-19 over the past 2½ years – lockdowns, physical distancing, wearing masks, washing hands – also helped limit the spread of other viruses. As people return to school and work and take off their masks, those viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus and flu, are back in full force.\n\nThat “immunity gap” from the last few years is probably behind the “unprecedented” early surge in RSV infections this year, scientists say – and it has thrown other seasonal respiratory viruses out of whack around the world.\n\n“As long as we’ve had a record of RSV and other respiratory diseases in the United States, there have been these very regular patterns of outbreaks,” said Rachel Baker, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at Brown University.\n\n“RSV pops up every year in the late autumn/wintertime and has these outbreaks mostly in young kids. Then it disappears again for the spring/summer months and pops up again the following winter,” Baker said. “It’s very regular and predictable.”\n\nUntil it isn’t.\n\nCases of RSV in the United States started showing up in the spring and are now 60% higher than 2021’s peak week, a CNN analysis shows, and that’s probably an undercount.\n\nAcross the US, the number of flu cases has also been increasing a little earlier than usual. A handful of schools have seen large absences, and medical offices say they are seeing more people sick with other respiratory viruses at times that don’t fit the usual patterns.\n\nThere have been similar unusual patterns in respiratory infections such as adenovirus, parainfluenza and rhinovirus in other countries, too.\n\nScientists think unparalleled actions of the pandemic had unparalleled effects.\n\nCovid interventions stopped other viruses, too\n\n“The degree of societal changes that occurred with the Covid pandemic really is unprecedented in modern day,” said Dr. Kevin Messacar, an associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Children’s Hospital Colorado.\n\nLike Covid-19, RSV and the flu spread through droplets released into the air when people cough or sneeze. The droplets also linger for hours on frequently touched surfaces like doorknobs and light switches.\n\nSo the people who washed hands and disinfected surfaces, who wore masks and kept their distance from others, did more than stop the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n“Those interventions, while they were great at limiting the spread of Covid-19, they also did a really good job of limiting the spread of other respiratory diseases such as RSV and influenza,” Baker said.\n\nThere was a sudden dropoff in RSV cases and hospitalizations in the seasons of 2020 and 2021, studies have showed, as well as unusually tame flu seasons.\n\n“It was really striking,” Baker said.\n\nBut as Covid-19 vaccines and treatments became available, more people started going back to school and work and interacting without masks. They also started sharing germs. The pandemic behaviors created an “immunity gap” or “immunity debt” that makes more people in the US vulnerable to diseases like RSV.\n\nUnderstanding the immunity gap\n\nChildren build natural immunity to viruses when they’re exposed to them. Most kids catch RSV at some point before they turn 2, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Newborns get some passive protection from their mothers, who pass along antibodies through breast milk.\n\nBut for a couple of years, there was little opportunity for children born during the pandemic or the people around them to catch RSV – or other viruses, for that matter. Their immunity waned or never formed at all. So when those little ones and their parents started to interact with others, they were more likely to get sick.\n\n“Decreased exposure to endemic viruses created an immunity gap – a group of susceptible individuals who avoided infection and therefore lack pathogen-specific immunity to protect against future infection,” Messacar and Baker wrote this summer in a commentary published in the medical journal The Lancet.\n\nThey warned hospitals that they needed to remain flexible and prepared for unpredictable seasons of respiratory illnesses because of this gap.\n\n“We knew it was inevitable that these diseases would come back,” Messacar told CNN.\n\nThe commentary warned about an influx of infections that would include older children who hadn’t been exposed to viruses as well as newborns whose moms weren’t able to pass along antibodies because they hadn’t been in contact with these germs.\n\n“Now we’re seeing it’s spreading really well,” Baker said. “And it’s not just striking the kids that it would typically strike with that first birth cohort. It’s also creating infections in older kids.\n\n“That’s how infectious diseases work,” she added. “Once you have more cases, they create more cases, and you get this spike.”\n\nBaker and Messacar don’t think this early-season pattern with RSV is permanent, but it could take a while to return to its more predictable cycle.\n\n“Now we’re in a little bit of a strange period, but I think in the next few years, we’ll start to see those regular outbreaks – well, depending on what happens with Covid,” Baker said. If the coronavirus gets bad enough that more lockdowns are necessary, it could once again throw off the seasonality of other viruses.\n\nWith viruses like the flu, there are more variables involved, Messacar said.\n\nThere’s no vaccine to prevent RSV, but there is for flu, so if the flu shot is a good match for the strain in circulation and enough people get it, the country could avoid a spike in cases like it’s seeing now with RSV.\n\nScientists are working on an RSV vaccine, but it won’t come in time to help this season.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nIn the meantime, there are some things to do to limit the spread of RSV, and they’ll sound very familiar.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWash your hands. Keep frequently used surfaces clean. Sneeze or cough into a tissue or into your elbow rather than your hands. Boost your immunity by getting plenty of sleep and eating a healthy diet. Wear a mask, especially when you’re sick. And most important, if you’re sick, stay home.\n\n“These non-pharmaceutical interventions all work, clearly, and the more we can do to keep cases of any of these viruses down, the better,” Baker said.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/09/25/herd-immunity-study-us-infection-rate-too-low-prevent-covid-spread-lancet/3518749001/", "title": "About 9% of Americans exposed to COVID-19 by midsummer.

Chan School of Public Health.\n\nHanage is also concerned communities not yet hit by COVID-19 will feel a false sense of security.\n\n\"We expect small-town America not to be in the first surge,\" he said, but over time, as people move around more and it gets introduced multiple times, more communities will have outbreaks.\n\nDr. George Rutherford, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at the University of California, San Francisco, was surprised the national infection rate appeared so high. He would have expected closer to 3%-4%. But whatever the number, he said, the U.S. is nowhere close to an end to this pandemic.\n\n\"The only way we're going to get to herd immunity, unless you're in a very closed community like a prison, is for everybody to get vaccinated,\" Rutherford said.\n\nHanage said the study also confirms what he has long thought: that the outbreak in the spring was enormously underestimated, \"ridiculously so,\" and started earlier and infected more young people than have been diagnosed.\n\nThe new study, published in The Lancet, is in line with previous, smaller studies, and also showed areas with high numbers of Black and non-white Latino residents had higher infection rates than mostly white communities.\n\nStephen Morse, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, said the study is an important contribution at a time when there isn't much good information about who has been infected with the virus.\n\n\"The sad truth is that we don’t have reliable national data,\" Morse said via email. \"Testing for public health surveillance is an enormous gap right now. We test mostly sick people, and others who are somehow able to get a test, and access can vary tremendously even in the same city. This isn’t very helpful for public health.\"\n\nTo understand an epidemic and help slow it, epidemiologists need lots of information at as local a level as possible, he said. But for most of the United States, \"we have very little knowledge of what the virus is doing in that community.\"\n\nThe Stanford University researchers, who led the new study, looked for antibodies to COVID-19 in the blood of people who receive dialysis in clinics or at home. When someone mounts an immune response to an infection, their body produces antibodies that can be read to determine their infection history.\n\nDialysis patients, whose kidneys are failing, get routine blood tests, so researchers were able to use existing blood samples. The patients were treated at 1,300 dialysis centers in 46 U.S. states, representing about one-third of counties.\n\nDialysis patients tend to be older than the general population, and more diverse, as Blacks and Latinos are more likely to suffer from kidney disease than whites.\n\nDr. Shuchi Anand, a kidney specialist at Stanford and the paper's first author, said she thinks the dialysis patients provide a useful and interesting – though imperfect – snapshot of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe patients might have been more careful to avoid infection but also more likely to suffer severe consequences if they were infected, said Dr. Glenn Chertow, the paper's senior author and a Stanford nephrologist.\n\n\"It should be a pretty good estimate of the population in the United States with a little bit of tweaking around the edges,\" he said.\n\nThe data was most precise for Texas, New York and California, all of which had very large outbreaks, said a third author, biostatistician Maria Montez-Rath. Roughly one-third of New York patients had antibodies, compared to 3.6% of Texans and 3.8% of Californians.\n\nThe team also plans to continue looking at samples from dialysis patients to watch COVID-19 over time, Anand said. \"It will give us a good sense of the epidemic as it evolves,” she said.\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

For people ages 20 to 64, drinking-related deaths accounted for 1 in 8, the study said.\n\nThe percentage of deaths attributed to alcohol use varied state by state, but nationally it’s a leading cause of preventable death, said lead study author Dr. Marissa Esser, lwho leads the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s alcohol program.\n\nResearchers took national and state mortality data from 2015 to 2019 and looked at deaths either fully or partially attributable to excessive drinking. Those causes of death included vehicle accidents, alcohol poisoning and other health impacts, such as liver disease, Esser said.\n\nThe data showed that the deaths fully attributable to alcohol have risen in the past decade, Esser added.\n\n“I’m not surprised at the numbers,” said David Jernigan, a professor of health law, policy and management at Boston University. “This is a conservative estimate.”\n\nJernigan was not involved in the study.\n\nEsser said there were deaths that alcohol likely contributed to that the study’s researchers could not include in their estimates. Some conditions may have had alcohol as a factor, but researchers were not able to verify for sure the role that drinking played. In other cases, they were not able to determine if someone who died of an illness used to drink excessively but then stopped, Esser added.\n\nAnd people often underreport how much they are drinking, Jernigan said.\n\n“It doesn’t get anywhere near the attention that it should,” he said. “The bottom line is (researchers) continue to show that excessive alcohol use is a big problem in the US.”\n\nHow to know when it’s too much\n\nFor health and safety, Jernigan said the goal for state and local government agencies should be encouraging almost everyone to drink less.\n\n“States and communities can prevent these premature deaths using evidence-based strategies to reduce the availability and accessibility of alcohol and increase its price,” Esser said.\n\nThat can mean increasing taxes on alcohol or limiting where alcohol is sold, Esser added.\n\nOn an individual level, Esser suggested that people could try to stop or limit alcohol consumption.\n\nThe CDC defines moderate drinking as two drinks or less in a day for men or one drink or less in a day for women. Two-thirds of adults report drinking more than moderate amounts at least once a month, the organization added.\n\nThe CDC also estimates that 1 in 6 adults binge drink — defined as consuming four or more drinks on an occasion for a woman or five or more drinks on an occasion for a man — with a quarter of those doing so at least weekly.\n\nReducing drinking can have a similar effect as dieting – the more you tell yourself you can’t have it, the more you want it, said Natalie Mokari, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nShe recommends starting with one less drink than you would usually have at each occasion or breaking a daily habit by limiting drinking to certain days. You can also have a sparkling water in between drinks or make weaker cocktails than usual to reduce your alcohol consumption, she said previously.\n\nAnd if you are overcoming a social pressure to drink, remember that people may make you feel bad because they are uncomfortable about their own relationship with drinking, said Annie Grace, author of “This Naked Mind: Control Alcohol” in a prior article.\n\nIt often helps to have a nonalcoholic drink in your hand at social events, so the offer to have a drink doesn’t even come up, said biological psychologist Aaron White, senior scientific adviser to the director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n\nSlow down your body’s alcohol intake by eating while drinking, alternate alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks and planning alcohol-free days, Harvard Medical School in Boston suggests.\n\nA tool on the CDC website can help individuals evaluate their drinking and then come up with a plan to make healthier alcohol choices.\n\nIf you need help or support immediately, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has a free, confidential National Helpline active 24/7/365 to provide information and treatment referrals to local treatment facilities, support groups and community-based organizations: 800-662-HELP (4357) and 800-487-4889 (TTY option).", "authors": ["Madeline Holcombe"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/09/fda-might-tighten-reins-on-vicodin/1822211/", "title": "FDA might tighten reins on Vicodin", "text": "Donna Leinwand Leger, @DonnaLeinwand, USA TODAY\n\nCDC calls prescription painkiller abuse an epidemic\n\nDEA wants to elevate Vicodin to the most restrictive category\n\nFDA will hold a hearing in January on it\n\nThe DEA for nearly a decade has pushed for tighter restrictions on Vicodin, the nation's most widely prescribed drug. The chronic abuse of such painkillers, and devastating toll associated with this abuse, has reached epidemic proportions in the United States.\n\nThe agency could get its wish later this month when the Food and Drug Administration considers the DEA's request to put Vicodin in the same category as OxyContin and other powerful narcotics.\n\nA recommendation from the FDA has proven elusive and is far from certain, but such a reclassification would allow the Drug Enforcement Administration to elevate the powerful painkillers from Schedule III to Schedule II, the most restrictive category of medically accepted drugs.\n\nFor the millions of patients across the nation who rely on Vicodin for relief from severe pain, the new rules could sharply restrict the number of pills they can get and drastically increase the number of doctor visits necessary to get them. Many patients who can now get a six-month supply would need to visit their doctors every 30 days to renew a prescription.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls prescription painkiller abuse an epidemic. Opioid painkillers, such as Vicodin and OxyContin, cause 75% of prescription drug overdoses, the CDC says. In recent years, such overdoses have outpaced cocaine and heroin deaths combined, the CDC notes.\n\n\"This is a real problem for the country,\" said Lynn Webster, president-elect of the American Academy of Pain Medicine and a board-certified anesthesiologist. He will speak before the FDA committee that meets Jan. 24-25 to consider the DEA's request.\n\nThis is the DEA's second attempt to get the FDA to elevate the powerful painkillers from Schedule III to Schedule II. In 2008, the FDA rejected the DEA's initial request submitted in 2004. The reasoning: The hydrocodone combination drugs have less potential for abuse than the other drugs in Schedule II, including oxycodone.\n\nThe DEA counters that abuse, trafficking and diversion of the drug have grown since its first request, causing a \"devastating effect\" on public health.\n\n\"Schedule III controls are not adequate,\" DEA Deputy Assistant Administrator Joseph Rannazzisi wrote Feb. 13, 2009, in a letter to the FDA requesting a scientific and medical evaluation of the drug for rescheduling.\n\nEmergency room visits involving hydrocodone jumped from 37,844 in 2004 to 57,550 in 2006, the DEA says. In 2010, the most recent year available, the number had doubled from just four years earlier: 115,739 people were treated.\n\nThe FDA committee will evaluate the DEA's evidence, hear comments from the public and vote on its recommendation to the FDA commissioner and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe vexing question during the last review, and surely this one, is whether changing the classification will stem the misuse of the drug, or simply inconvenience patients. An analysis completed last year and submitted by the Department of Health and Human Services in advance of the meeting concluded the painkillers are \"widely abused,\" but found no evidence to support that rescheduling would curb abuse.\n\nWHAT PATIENTS SEE\n\nVicodin is a combination of hydrocodone and acetaminophen, the medicine in Tylenol. As a Schedule III drug, doctors can authorize up to five refills on one 30-day prescription, giving patients a six-month supply before they must visit a doctor.\n\nDoctors wrote nearly 131 million prescriptions for the combination hydrocodone painkillers for 47 million patients in 2011, the FDA found in its analysis. IMS Health, a consulting and research firm, put the number of prescriptions at 137 million.\n\nIf Vicodin and other hydrocodone combinations, such as Lortab and Vicoprofen, are elevated to Schedule II, doctors cannot prescribe refills of a 30-day supply or phone a prescription in to a pharmacy. Rescheduling the painkillers would add another layer of regulations for manufacturers and pharmacies, including more extensive record-keeping and tighter security.\n\n\"On the surface, it looks like it might be the right thing to do,\" Webster said. \"With increasing availability, we've seen an increase in the amount of harm from the drug, but I'm not sure rescheduling is going to reduce that harm.\"\n\nWebster predicts that a reclassification would change prescribing practices because the restrictions on such drugs place burdens on physicians who have to do more paperwork and see patients more frequently. Patients who need the drug could face higher costs and more co-pays with increased doctor visits, he said.\n\n\"If we're talking about the problem of abuse, it's not just about the drug,\" Webster says. \"It's also about the person and the environment. Part of the solution is for us to not focus only on the drug but also on the risk factors that lead to a substance-abuse problem.\"\n\nEd Michna, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who is board-certified in anesthesia, pain and palliative care, says the hydrocodone combinations have the same abuse potential as oxycodone, so there's no medical or scientific reason why they are not in the same category.\n\n\"It's one of the most abused drugs in the country,\" Michna said.\n\nBut he points out that changing the classification won't end abuse and might cause other problems.\n\n\"The other side of it is there's going to be an impact on patient care,\" Michna said. \"Certainly, there will be less Vicodin prescribed. What's going to happen is that patients who probably deserve to have this as a treatment option are going to suffer.\"\n\nA DECADE OF CONCERN\n\nDoctors, the DEA and the FDA have wrestled with the drug since 1999 when a physician petitioned the DEA to change the classification, citing increasing reports of abuse. The DEA, after compiling abuse data, in 2004 asked the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research for a scientific and medical evaluation.\n\nOn March 6, 2008, the FDA recommended against changing the classification. A year later, on Feb. 13, 2009, the DEA resubmitted its request with new data.\n\nThe January hearing is the final step in the FDA's latest evaluation.\n\nLast year, the Senate unanimously passed a measure offered by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., to elevate the hydrocodone combinations to Schedule II as an amendment to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, but the House did not include the measure in its bill.\n\nThe DEA's administrator could issue an emergency order that would reschedule the drugs for two years, as it did when drugs such as K2 and Spice, synthetic forms of marijuana, emerged as a problem. The DEA declined to say Wednesday why it had not issued such an order.\n\nThough the DEA and experts concerned with painkiller abuse are urging quick action, FDA spokeswoman Morgan Liscinsky defends the pace, and method, of the deliberation.\n\n\"Because this issue would impact millions of people, it has to be handled carefully and we have to make sure we are evaluating all the available data we have and make a really informed evaluation.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/29/nightmare-roof-fire-starting-drones-pennywise-jeep-news-around-states/40468927/", "title": "'Nightmare' roof, fire-starting drones: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: An animal expert says fencing erected by the Alabama Department of Transportation is helping to protect an endangered turtle species. University of South Alabama herpetologist David Nelson tells AL.com the number of Alabama red-bellied turtles killed on the Mobile Bay Causeway dropped by more than 80% after fencing went up alongside it in 2008. In 2001, Nelson counted 580 Alabama red-bellies that were killed while crossing the causeway. Most of those were females traveling to or from nest sites or hatchlings. Transportation officials have also put up signs during the turtle’s peak nesting and hatching seasons that encourage drivers to be cautious.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Opponents of petroleum drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are preparing for a response to a possible petroleum lease sale. The Interior Department hopes to conduct a lease sale by the end of the year. More than 30 groups have joined the Arctic Refuge Defense Campaign, which is a coalition dedicated to protecting the refuge that provides breeding habitat to polar bears, migratory birds and the Porcupine Caribou Herd shared with Canada. Campaign director Desiree Sorenson-Groves says the environmental review for the sale was rushed and has flaws and will be challenged in court. Her group is also warning potential bidders that companies will face damage to their reputations if they bid on leases within the refuge because it will harm polar bears and other Arctic species.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A new report by an Arizona State University think tank questions whether the state can find enough water to replenish aquifers for pumping to new homes in fast-growing suburban areas without access to Colorado River water. The Arizona Daily Star reports that the Kyl Center for Water Policy report also suggests that the state revamp a landmark 1980 setting current policy on groundwater management. The report warns that some suburbs of Tucson and Phoenix will struggle to find enough water to keep growing without damaging underground aquifers by overpumping. According to the report, the result could be land subsidence, including ground fissures, lower water quality and even the possibility of wells drying up.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A woman woke up to find that her trailer filled with rare and ancient fossils, including dinosaur eggs that are 70 million-year-old dinosaur eggs, was gone. The trailer was taken late last month after Rodger Perkins, Gwynn Shafer and Paul Yumlu packed fossils in it for this month’s Greater Little Rock Gem, Mineral and Jewelry Show, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Perkins says the trailer had skulls of the perchoerus, a piglike mammal that is one of the rarest of fossils; the doglike cynodictis; the marine reptile keichousaurus; and a pair of baby rabbits that died nearly 15 million years ago. He says the fossils were worth nearly $20,000. Perkins doubts that whoever stole the trailer knew what was inside but says the thieves likely know how expensive the fossils are because they had price tags on them.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Clarita: Freshman Rep. Katie Hill, a rising Democratic star in the House, announced her resignation amid an ethics probe, saying explicit private photos of her with a campaign staffer had been “weaponized” by her husband and political operatives. The California Democrat, 32, had been hand-picked for a coveted leadership seat. But in recent days, compromising photos of Hill and purported text messages from her to a campaign staffer surfaced online in a right-wing publication and a British tabloid. The House ethics committee had launched an investigation into whether Hill had an inappropriate relationship with an aide in her congressional office, prohibited under House rules. Hill, one of the few openly bisexual women in Congress, has vowed to fight a “smear” campaign waged by a husband she called abusive.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: Planning is in the works to build a new Veterans Affairs clinic that will give veterans in northern Colorado better access to health care. The Cheyenne Veterans Affairs Health Care System announced that the Loveland clinic is expected to open by the winter of 2022. VA spokesman Sam House tells the Loveland Reporter-Herald that more than half of the population that is served in the Cheyenne system area comes from northern Colorado. House says the facility will more than double the space of the current Loveland and Fort Collins clinics combined and serve more than 200 veterans a day. Construction should start by next summer and take two years to complete. When the new facility opens in 2022, the VA will close its Fort Collins clinic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Haddam: Hundreds of acres in eastern Connecticut are in the process of being acquired by the state to expand existing parks and wildlife conservation areas, but thousands more need to be attained or protected in order to meet a fast-approaching goal of protecting 21% of Connecticut land as open space by 2023. Eric Hammerling, executive director of the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, says the state still has “a ways to go” and hopes officials will keep pushing to reach the goal. Last week, Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney announced $560,000 in federal funds to protect more than 400 acres in eastern Connecticut, including nearly 100 acres that will be added to the Devil’s Hopyard State Park in East Haddam.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state’s only NASCAR racetrack continues to shrink. Reflecting waning attendance nationwide for the popular motor sport, Dover International Speedway, also known as the Monster Mile, will reduce seating at its grandstands to 54,000 from 83,000. It is at least the third time that track owner Dover Motor Sports has removed thousands of seats at the facility in the past decade. Prior to 2009, capacity stood at 135,000. Rebuilding the grandstand with fewer seats will cost the publicly traded company $1.5 million. The project is underway and is scheduled to be complete before the racetrack’s spring NASCAR event.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Smithsonian’s National Zoo has announced the birth of one lesser kudu and the death of another. The Washington Post reports the male calf was born Oct. 14, just weeks after his grandmother died. Citing a news release, news outlets report the zoo says the healthy calf may make his public debut this fall. The calf was born to a kudu named Rogue, who was the daughter of a kudu named Shirley. The 9-year-old Shirley died late last month after what the zoo described as complications during the birthing process. Her calf was stillborn. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says the lesser kudu is a type of antelope considered to be “near threatened,” with a declining wild population of about 100,000.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Homeless people living with HIV now have secure locations in the city where they can store their expensive medications. Through the IDEA Exchange, patients can store their medicine in lockers at a converted shipping container office. They also can choose to have social workers deliver small quantities of the medicine to them. The program is run by the University of Miami. Prescriptions are paid for by Medicaid or a federal drug assistance program for low-income people living with HIV. Storing medication for the homeless has long been encouraged by public health experts. Washington, D.C., New York, Boston and other cities offer similar services. University of Miami physician Hansel Tookes, who directs the Miami program, says the initiative began in 2018 after an HIV outbreak among the city’s homeless.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The National Park Service says crews will spend several months cleaning out years of accumulating storm debris and dead wood around a Civil War-era fort on the Georgia coast. Fort Pulaski National Monument east of Savannah still has a large debris pile left over from the passing of hurricanes Matthew and Irma, as well as a tornado, in 2016 and 2017. Dead and damaged trees remain in the woods outside the fort. The Park Service says in a news release that a cleanup project will remove the debris and dead wood to reduce wildfire risks. Work began in October and is expected to continue until spring. Officials say the work may require temporary closure of some areas of the park outside Fort Pulaski.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Researchers have found the majority of plastic marine debris washing up on the state’s shores is from abroad. The Star-Advertiser reports the study conducted at Hawaii Pacific University revealed that pollution from north and east island beaches is washing ashore where there are fewer residents and tourists. Researchers say it is possible the debris swept in from as far as 3,000 miles away from the coasts of Asia, as well as the Americas. Researchers say more than 4,600 pieces of plastic debris were collected for the study from three sea surface areas, three seafloor dive sites and 11 shorelines. Researchers say based on weathering and chemical composition, the debris could tell experts where it came from and how it got to island shores.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials have made it more difficult for young transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificates despite a U.S. court ruling that appears to ban such obstacles. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare released comments from the public last week on a temporary rule requiring people younger than 18 to get approval from medical or mental health professionals before requesting the change. Many of the comments said they wanted the conservative state to go back to banning all gender changes on birth certificates. A federal judge ruled last year that an Idaho law barring transgender people from changing their birth certificates violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Health and Welfare’s board of directors complied with the order and changed the state’s rules last year. But this May, the board approved the temporary rule requiring anyone under 18 to get approval before requesting the change.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker is endorsing legislation that would allow college athletes in the state to make money from endorsements. During a Sunday interview on WGN-Radio, Pritzker said college athletes deserve the same opportunity as everyone else to earn compensation based on the use of their name and their image and likeness. Democratic state Rep. Emanuel Welch of Hillside has introduced legislation that would put Illinois in line with California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law this year allowing athletes at the state’s universities to use their names and likenesses to make money. The law also bans schools from kicking athletes off the team if they get paid. Illinois House Republican leader Jim Durkin of Western Springs said Sunday that he would urge his GOP colleagues to oppose Welch’s proposed legislation.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state will change the vendor of its teacher licensing exams following complaints about low pass rates under the current program. Test administrator ETS will replace Pearson starting in September 2021. The move comes after Republican state Sen. Jean Leising of Oldenburg introduced legislation this year requiring the state to adopt a national teacher licensing program to replace Pearson’s, which customizes exams to Indiana standards. The Tribune-Star reports Leising says the change will help address the state’s teacher shortage. Some people have said Pearson’s exams are too difficult. Tim McRoberts, associate executive director of the Indiana Association of School Principals, says Pearson doesn’t provide adequate study materials, which makes it difficult for students to prepare. He says there’s no doubt testing changes could be helpful.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: An eastern Iowa school district has secured federal grant funding to monitor students’ social media accounts for possible warning signs that students might harm themselves or their peers. The Iowa City Community School District received the grant from the U.S. Department of Justice. A portion of the $187,000 grant is earmarked to contract with a company that will scan social media posts. It’s part of a districtwide push to improve safety across the school district. School officials have not yet determined what all the monitoring will entail. School officials note that the district already has the right to look at the emails and Google Drive accounts of students who are using district technology.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kris Kobach has acknowledged in a diversion agreement that he failed to properly supervise his staff while representing himself as the then-Kansas secretary of state during federal court proceedings. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the confidential agreement resolves complaints made to the Kansas Disciplinary Administrator’s Office about Kobach’s conduct in a voter registration case. Details of the findings aren’t disclosed under Kansas rules, but a public notice of the agreement says Kobach stipulates he didn’t properly supervise lawyers and non-lawyers during the litigation. The lawsuit involved a challenge to a Kansas law requiring voters to show proof of citizenship to register to vote. The disciplinary administrator’s office says there was no finding of dishonest conduct by Kobach, who is seeking the Republican nomination for an open U.S. Senate seat.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Pennywise the clown has returned to terrorize Derby City, and he’s driving a 2005 Jeep Wrangler. The monster at the heart of the new “It: Chapter Two” film and the shape-shifting villain of Stephen King’s classic horror novel now sits in the driver’s seat next to Andrew Johnson, the owner of a modified SUV with a passenger-side steering wheel and a whole collection of creepy props and decals. The Louisville resident and self-employed auto mechanic has spent the past six years dressing up his two SUVs to fit certain themes. The “It” Jeep, though, has been his biggest hit yet. It has decals with popular phrases and references to the movie. It has theatrical blood sprayed across its white exterior – “if it gets wet,” Johnson says, “it actually drips.” It has two arms pulling poor Georgie’s yellow rain jacket into the Jeep’s grill. And it has a 6-foot-3 clown with glowing eyes and trademark red balloons in the driver’s seat.\n\nLouisiana\n\nCameron: What used to be Louisiana’s largest state wildlife refuge is celebrating its centennial. The Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge was 86,000 acres when the land was bought in 1914 and donated to the state in December 1919. Officials say it’s now down to about 71,500 acres. That’s about a 17% loss. The southwest Louisiana refuge has been a site for research to reduce coastal erosion, such as finding ways to build stone breakwaters light enough not to sink in the soft silt near what remains of the shore. There’s also been a great deal of wildlife research, including studies that helped alligators and bald eagles get off the endangered list. Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Jack Montoucet describes the refuge as a giant outdoor laboratory.\n\nMaine\n\nGeorgetown: An environmental group is working with shellfish farmers to grow more of a species of clam it thinks can better stand up to predators that have plagued the state’s harvest of bivalves. Seafood lovers have sought Maine’s softshell clams for decades, but the state’s harvesters are collecting fewer of those clams, in part because of the spread of crabs and worms that prey on them. Massachusetts-based group Manomet thinks the answer might lie in the aquaculture of quahogs, which are a harder species of clam associated more with Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The group is working with four shellfish farmers to grow quahogs in Maine and study the results. The federal government’s NOAA Sea Grant has taken notice and provided $65,000 to give the project a boost.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The State Department of Education has responded to concerns about Holocaust instruction by announcing plans to enhance and expand how it’s taught. A statement released by the department says the changes include teaching middle schoolers about anti-Semitism and strengthening Holocaust education for high schoolers. News outlets report advocates and elected officials had raised concerns about state curriculum guidelines. Baltimore Jewish Council executive director Howard Libit says the council thought the guidelines didn’t do enough to ensure students learn about the Holocaust. State Superintendent Karen B. Salmon said in the statement that the education department plans to provide teachers with tools to help them teach the Holocaust with confidence.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Worcester Polytechnic Institute has received a five-year, nearly $1.9 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to develop a robotic system to detect and monitor prostate cancer. Grant recipient Haichong Zhang, a biomedical engineer at the school, says his surgical imaging robot will be safer and more accurate than current tests, including ultrasounds and biopsies. Zhang tells The Telegram & Gazette he wants to create a minimally invasive, easily accessible and cost-effective way to better detect prostate cancer, which will affect one-fifth of all men at some point in their lives. Zhang is working on the project with Gregory Fischer, a professor of robotics and mechanical engineering at WPI.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A local museum will begin charging patrons from outside the Motor City area an admissions fee for the first time in seven years to remedy an increasing budget deficit. The Detroit News reports that the Detroit Historical Museum will charge adults $10, while seniors, students, active-duty military and first responders will pay $8. Children ages 6 to 17 will pay $6. Museum executive director Elana Rugh says the museum lost $297,000 in 2018. The museum’s 2019 operating budget is about $4.5 million. Residents of Detroit, Highland Park and Hamtramck will be able to enter at no cost. Detroit historian Ken Coleman says he worries the fee will prevent low-income people from other places from visiting the museum.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Clergy and immigration activists are trying to remove the name of a revered bishop from a federal building where hundreds of deportation orders are issued every year, calling the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown an affront to his memory. The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling houses the Minneapolis-area offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. It’s named for the first Episcopal bishop of Minnesota, who persuaded President Abraham Lincoln to pardon most of the 303 Dakota Indians sentenced to death after the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862, though 38 were still hanged in the largest mass execution in U.S. history. Now the Episcopal Church in Minnesota, the Minnesota Council of Churches and others want Whipple’s name taken off the building – or the eviction of ICE and its immigration courts. They’re planning a vigil and news conference outside it Tuesday to launch the “What Would Whipple Do?” campaign. They’ll also call on the Legislature to declare Minnesota a sanctuary state.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Phil Bryant says the state’s cash reserves are at their highest level ever. The Republican said Friday that the state Department of Finance and Administration has transferred just over $205 million into the state rainy day fund. The money was the unspent surplus for state government for the budget year that ended June 30. With the transfer, the rainy day fund has hit its limit, by law, of $554.8 million. Bryant said on Twitter that the amount of money in the fund is “the most in Mississippi’s history.” Republicans who lead the budget-writing process in the Legislature say conservative spending practices led to the surplus that filled the rainy day fund. Critics say Mississippi government is underfunding education, health care and other core services.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A state panel wants a test track for an ultra-high-speed Hyperloop system to be built in the Show-Me State. The group of elected officials and business leaders made the recommendation Monday as part of a study commissioned by the House speaker. Hyperloop technology involves a tubular track through which a train-like pod carries passengers at speeds of more than 600 mph. Advocates want to connect Kansas City to St. Louis with the high-speed system. The report says Missouri first would need to apply to be the site for a roughly 15-mile test track that could cost between $300 million and $500 million. The estimated cost to build a full hyperloop system across Missouri ranges from $30 million to $40 million per mile, or about $7.3 billion to $10.4 billion total.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: National Weather Service meteorologists say snowfall in the state has broken a 35-year-old record. Through Monday afternoon, more than 35 inches of snow has been recorded in Great Falls in September and October. Scientists say the amount sets a record for the timeframe beginning July 1, blasting past the previous record of 18.1 inches in 1984. Meteorologists say that is well over half of the 60 inches that routinely falls during an entire snow season. Meteorologists say snow is expected to continue with record-breaking cold through mid-November. Scientists say the average temperature in October has been 40.3 degrees, about 5.9 degrees below normal. Scientists say residents should be prepared as current weather continues to behave more like December or January.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: University of Nebraska-Lincoln researchers have launched a university-backed startup company to help prevent and fight wildfires with drones. The university on Monday announced the new business venture, Drone Amplified, which is headed by Carrick Detweiler, an associate professor of computer science and engineering. The company’s drone-mounted technology carries chemical spheres the size of pingpong balls. At the press of a button, the spheres ignite, intentionally sparking small fires to burn vegetation and deprive incoming wildfires of potential fuel. The drones can also be equipped with thermal cameras to help spot hotspots, and they can be used in situations that are unsafe for manned aircraft, such as low-visibility nighttime operations. University researchers tested the technology in 2016 with a controlled fire at the Homestead National Monument of America near Beatrice.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A developer who grew up going to the Huntridge Theater is poised to get city approval to buy the shuttered former movie house in central Las Vegas, renovate its damaged roof and convert it to an arts hub. J Dapper tells the Las Vegas Sun the architecture won’t change, but the building dating to 1943 could be converted into a concert venue, a performance auditorium or a community arts space. Dapper says he also hopes to put restaurants, condominiums or office space on the 4-acre parcel at Charleston Boulevard and Maryland Parkway to make the venture more profitable. Dapper needs city approval because the property has been listed since 1993 on the National Register of Historic Places. A City Council vote is scheduled Nov. 6.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: New Hampshire Attorney General Gordon MacDonald is telling residents to be aware of scammers targeting personal information through the use of popular phone-based word games, such as Words with Friends. The game’s app is downloaded for players to take turns building words in a crossword-style fashion, similar to Scrabble. Authorities say scammers use the app’s communication function to ask users questions to gain personal information that’s used to exploit the individual. They say scammers also try to seek a personal or romantic connection and urge the user to send gift cards, money and valuable property. Scammers also will send harmful links and ask users to switch to other platforms that make it easier for the scammer to access the user’s personal information. Authorities say players should only communicate with people known to them.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: Jersey rock royalty was onstage Sunday night in the state’s musical cradle as rocker Jon Bon Jovi brought crooner Southside Johnny Lyon with him into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. The two rockers played a duet at Asbury Park’s Convention Hall, where both had performed many times on their way up from Jersey shore local bar bands to worldwide stars. Pop rock band The Smithereens was also inducted this year. In the performing arts category, Jason Alexander, who played George Costanza on “Seinfeld,” made the cut. Inductees in the category of arts and letters included “Jaws” author Peter Benchley, longtime Star-Ledger sports columnist Jerry Izenberg, “Game of Thrones” author George R. R. Martin and photographer Timothy White.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State wildlife officials are rejoining direct efforts to manage endangered Mexican gray wolf populations in cooperation with the federal government and counterparts including Arizona. The New Mexico State Game Commission voted unanimously with one absence Friday to become a cooperating agency in the recovery program after leaving a pact in 2011. Wildlife Division Chief Stewart Liley says the agreement will make New Mexico a lead player in the program with greater discretion over management decisions amid concern among ranchers about livestock falling prey to wolves. The Mexican wolf is the rarest subspecies of gray wolf in North America and has struggled since releases into the wild in 1998. Surveys show at least 131 in the wild in the southern mountain ranges of New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The eastern hellbender will get more protection and the bald eagle and peregrine falcon will get less under proposed changes to New York’s list of endangered and threatened species. The Department of Environmental Conservation is proposing removal of 19 species from the state’s endangered and threatened list. Those species including the bald eagle and peregrine falcon show significant population growth, making them no longer threatened. There are now 390 pairs of breeding bald eagles in New York, compared to one pair when they were listed as endangered in 1973. The agency is proposing to add 18 other species as threatened or endangered. They include several species of freshwater mussels, the common nighthawk and the eastern hellbender salamander. Public comments on the list proposals are being taken until Dec. 24.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Parts of the state’s textile, agricultural and railroad past have been recognized as national historic places, a designation that can help preserve them. The state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources said in a news release that seven North Carolina properties have been added to the National Register of Historic Places. They include Caromount Mills in Rocky Mount; Sanford Tobacco Co. redrying plant and warehouse in Sanford; Carolina and Northwestern Railway freight depot in Lenoir; and Taylorsville Milling Co. roller mill in Taylorsville. Also added to the list were the T. Austin and Ernestine L. Finch house in Thomasville; the Gem Theatre in Kannapolis; and the Bunyan S. and Edith W. Womble house in Winston-Salem. Federal and state incentives are created to help preserve National Register places.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWillow City: Wildlife officials say a state game warden escaped serious injuries when he was attacked by a bull moose. Game & Fish Department Chief Game Warden Robert Timian tells KFGO radio that District Game Warden Jonathan Toftland was in the Willow City area Wednesday to investigate a report of an injured or sick bull moose. As Toftland approached the animal, it stood up and charged him, knocking him to the ground. The moose was killed. Timian says the outcome could have been “far worse” and credits help from others who were in the area for helping Toftland. The game warden was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital and released. Timian says investigators are trying to determine if the bull moose was sick.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Some state lawmakers say they hope to prevent numerous vehicle crashes by gradually installing rumble strips down the center of some roads. Ohio Rep. Timothy E. Ginter, a Salem Republican, is chief sponsor of a bill to require the state Department of Transportation to add rumble strips on all undivided, two-way highways with speed limits higher than 45 mph. The Dayton Daily News reports the House passed the bill unanimously in June, and the Senate Transportation Committee held a hearing on it last week. State Highway Patrol data shows more than 500 people have died in the past five years due to drivers crossing over the center of undivided Ohio highways. The Federal Highway Administration says rumble strips have reduced rural two-lane road crashes by about 45% nationwide.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group trying to prevent partisan gerrymandering of Oklahoma’s legislative and congressional districts is seeking a public vote on whether to create a new bipartisan commission to redraw district boundaries. A group that includes the president of the Oklahoma League of Women Voters and Let’s Fix This, an organization aimed at helping Oklahomans engage politically, filed its petition Monday with the Oklahoma Secretary of State’s Office. The group is seeking to gather enough signatures to place the proposed constitutional amendment on a statewide ballot. Under the plan, the power to draw both legislative and federal congressional districts would be transferred from the Legislature to a bipartisan commission. The commission would include an equal number of Republicans, Democrats and representatives unaffiliated with either party selected by a group of retired judges.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: A group of wine industry interests in the state have formed a new trade group. The Eugene Register-Guard reports the new coalition is called the Oregon Wine Council, and it has an agenda that differs from the Oregon Wine Association. Members of the new group earlier this year opposed wine legislation they viewed as anti-competitive. They claim to represent the interests of the entire state. Board member Sam Tannahill says the majority of large, taxpaying wine growers as well as many of small producers around the state don’t have a say in how their tax money is spent. A board member of the Oregon Wine Association, Justin King, says the argument that his organization is made up of selfish people from one area of the state is patently false.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: The front of a city bus was up in the air Monday after a sinkhole opened under it during rush hour downtown. The Port Authority of Allegheny County says only the driver and one passenger were aboard the bus when it plunged into the hole. The passenger was taken to a hospital for a minor injury Monday, and the driver was not injured. The agency tweeted that the bus was at a red light when the street gave way, and the rear half plunged into the hole. A photo shows the front of the bus pitched into the air and the front wheels of a car that was behind it dangling over the sinkhole’s edge. A tow truck was brought in late Monday to remove the bus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The governor and public school superintendents are trying to raise awareness about the importance of regularly reading to children. “SUPERS Read,” a statewide reading event, began Monday and continues through Nov. 8. Superintendents and other guest readers will read to infants and toddlers enrolled in local child care and Early Head Start programs. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo and education leaders will kick off the event Monday at the Children’s Workshop in Warren. Raimondo also plans to unveil an updated website that makes accessing state programs for young children and families more straightforward. The Rhode Island Association for the Education of Young Children, United Way of Rhode Island and Rhode Island KIDS COUNT organized the reading celebration to highlight the importance of reading to children to promote school readiness.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The director of the state’s prisons says his agency will begin classifying inmates by their behavior behind bars, not the crime they committed. Corrections Director Bryan Stirling says the reclassification could reduce the number of maximum-security inmates by 4,000. There are currently about 7,000 inmates in maximum security in South Carolina prisons. Stirling told The Post and Courier of Charleston moving inmates from maximum security will let them move in prison more freely, take more classes and go on work-release programs. They also can become eligible for parole quicker. To get out of maximum security, prison officials say inmates must not be in gangs and must follow the rules. Stirling says consolidating maximum security will allow his chronically short staff to concentrate on the worst behaved inmates.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Entrance and camping fees to state parks will likely cost more next year. The South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission has approved fee increases for 2020. An annual state park pass will be $36, an increase of $6. A day pass will be $8, a $2 increase. Camping fees for prime sites will increase $5 to $26, and preferred sites will increase from $19 to $23. The commission says a wet spring made 10% of campsites temporarily unavailable this year, and revenue is down by $1.9 million compared to last year. And it’s estimated that repairs to campsites, roads and boat ramps damaged by flooding will cost $8 million. The Rapid City Journal says the fee increases still need approval from the Legislature’s Interim Rules Committee.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A psychiatrist whose license was suspended last year for using riding crops on patients may now lose her license again over allegations that she violated her professional probation. The state Board of Medical Examiners says Dr. Valerie Augustus didn’t participate in therapy sessions or reimburse the state $50,000 for the cost of the case. The newspaper recently obtained new charges the state Department of Health filed against Augustus last month, accusing her of misconduct and violating a board order. The board has said the 57-year-old Christian Psychiatric Services operator used a crop or whip on at least 10 patients. Augustus appealed the ruling, saying the whipping was done jokingly. A hearing is set for January.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Houston Police Department has unveiled a new crime lab in a move to accelerate service and shed its scandal-ridden past linked to a backlog of rape kits. Police and city officials several years ago started the process of untangling the lab from the department and into an independent agency, the Houston Forensic Science Center. In 2014, the department transferred management of its crime lab to the center even though the physical lab remained in the Police Department’s downtown headquarters. The Houston Chronicle reports that authorities said the new facility was revealed last week and features state-of-the-art labs, ventilation systems and a consolidated design. The center’s president, Dr. Peter Stout, says the 83,000-square-foot space will serve as a model for the rest of the U.S.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A college professor has completed a massive project decorating the exterior of his house in an elaborate Halloween tribute to Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion and the “Nightmare Before Christmas.” Dixie State University professor Josh Pedersen studied more than 200 images of the attraction to model the design as close to the original as possible. He started by creating digital plans for an intricate pattern along his roofline, then printed the design using a large-format laser printer available at a university Makerspace. Once the pattern was cut out and attached to a base, he added 168 electric candles and 66 fake pumpkins. Many people pitched in to help with the installation, which took about a week. Pedersen says he’s wanted to do the project for years.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: The Vermont National Guard has received 14 noise complaints since the first two F-35 fighter planes arrived at the Burlington International Airport last month. Capt. Mike Arcovitch, whose office tracks noise complaints, says the complaints came from eight people, and two were anonymous. The F-35s are louder than the F-16s the guard used to fly. He says officials had expected more noise complaints when the new jets started flying from the South Burlington airport that is home to the Vermont Air National Guard. The guard took delivery last month of the first two of what will be 20 F-35s, all due in the state by summer. Arcovitch says the guard used to receive noise complaints about the F-16s as well, but he did not have a comparison.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State health regulators are asking lawmakers to greenlight a licensing system for music therapy. The Daily Press reports that regulators want to set credentialing standards for therapists as well as set up a system for the state to look into any complaints. Music therapy is used to help people with various medical conditions develop everything from language skills to motor coordination. It can provide a drug-free way to regulate moods in people with depression or foster socialization in those with limited means of communication. It gained popularity in veterans’ hospitals in World War II as doctors became interested in music’s ability to heal soldiers with both physical and mental problems.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An anti-tax activist is again bringing a $30 car-tab initiative to voters that would cut a major source of funding for transportation projects across the state. Sponsored by Tim Eyman, Initiative 976 would lower most taxes paid through annual vehicle registration to $30 and largely revoke the authority of state and local governments to add taxes and fees without voter approval. The measure would also repeal taxes and fees already in place, a move the state Office of Financial Management says could cost the state and local governments more than $4 billion in revenue over the next six years. Eyman says the November ballot measure is a chance for voters to tell their government that they voted years ago for $30 car tabs, and they meant it.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBluefield: Officials have pulled off a creative rescue of a malnourished German shepherd that was stuck in a dam. The Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports an animal control officer said the dog had probably been trapped in the Ada dam for several days before the rescue. The effort began Friday afternoon when a 911 call came in for an injured and skinny dog in the spillway. But rescuers couldn’t get into the dam, and its tall, steep walls made it impossible for the dog to climb out. So officials used a rope to lower a trap baited with food into the spillway. After about 2 1/ 2 hours, the dog finally went into the trap, and the rescue workers brought him to a shelter. There, they named him Lucky.\n\nWisconsin\n\nJanesville: Former House Speaker Paul Ryan has launched a new nonprofit organization he says will be focused on fighting poverty, increasing economic opportunities and advancing evidence-based public policies. Ryan announced the launch of the American Idea Foundation on Monday. He moved more than $7 million from his congressional account into the nonprofit when he announced its formation earlier this year. The foundation will be based in Ryan’s hometown, Janesville, though he moved his family to Maryland this year. Ryan decided against seeking re-election last year, ending his 20-year career in the House. The Republican from Janesville has kept a mostly low profile since then.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The Federal Communications Commission is expected to provide $12.1 million to expand broadband coverage to rural parts of the state over the next decade. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports three companies are expected to receive funds to extend service to more than 4,700 homes and businesses lacking high-speed internet access. The FCC says Inventive Wireless of Nebraska, Tri County Telephone and Union Telephone will receive funding. Officials say service will be expanded in seven counties: Albany, Big Horn, Niobrara, Park, Platte, Sublette and Uinta. A Wyoming State Broadband Program survey of more than 2,400 residents found 26.9% of respondents lacked reliable broadband.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/10/18/coronavirus-florida-sarasota-inmates-ask-release-due-covid-19/3653230001/", "title": "Sarasota County inmates ask state court to be 'immediately released ...", "text": "SARASOTA COUNTY – Lisa Darabian’s son is a pretrial detainee at the Sarasota County Jail who has been awaiting trial on battery charges since February.\n\nJoel Lindsay, 43, has tested positive for COVID-19 twice since he was detained, according to his mother, who claims he asked to be tested again Monday, Oct. 12, by the evening call nurse, but she refused because they test only symptomatic inmates.\n\n“I seen him recently, and he doesn’t look that healthy if you ask me,” Darabian said. “He’s totally exhausted and mumbling in his words.”\n\nInmates or staff with a fever of 100.4 degrees or greater and cough and/or shortness of breath are determined to be symptomatic, according to a plan created by NaphCare, the jail’s contract medical provider.\n\nEveryone entering the jail must pass a medical check that includes questions, temperature and evaluation for COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nDarabian is afraid the jail isn’t doing enough to keep inmates such as her son protected.\n\nThe Sarasota County jail has reported 159 infected inmates and 36 staff since the beginning of the global coronavirus pandemic in March.\n\nSarasota County Sheriff’s spokeswoman Kaitlyn Perez says the last COVID-19 positive inmate was discovered upon arrest last week and immediately isolated and released.\n\n“There have been no new cases related to the July/August outbreak for nearly 60 days,” according to Perez. “No currently active or suspected staff cases either.”\n\nBut five inmates petitioned the 12th Judicial Circuit Court in August and September asking a judge to “immediately release” them and other inmates from detention because of the threat of coronavirus.\n\nAccording to similar writs of habeas corpus filed by detainees Kailin Brown, 28; Alexander Caraballo, 20; Travis Stewart, 25; Joshua Wirick, 39; and Shelton Chatman, 31, the jail has failed to protect detainees from COVID-19. The petition says it is a violation of their due process rights and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment during pretrial detention, and cited a 2017 habeas corpus case, Banks v. Florida.\n\nThe inmates’ petitions alleged that COVID-19 entered the jail via staff members who were asymptomatic and spread the illness to other staff and detainees.\n\nPerez declined requests for comment related to the inmate letters citing ongoing litigation.\n\n“Further, at this time, we have no active COVID cases in the jail,” Perez said. “We have also increased our 14-day quarantine window to 31 days. We are also regulating the “reclassification” process to limit the movement of inmates from one cell to the other.”\n\nDuring reclassification, inmates are moved around based on a series of factors including charge, behavior, etc., Perez said.\n\n“To limit movement, we are only reclassifying when absolutely necessary,” she said.\n\nThe jail now has rapid testing available for both COVID-19 and the flu, provided by NaphCare.\n\nJuly/August outbreak\n\nIn August, the jail reported that the east wing had been established as an isolation block for inmates who tested COVID-19 positive, according to jail commander Maj. Brian Meinberg.\n\nAt the time, Meinberg said his jail inmates were all asymptomatic.\n\nInmates were provided with soap supplied to each cell block twice a day, and given two cloth masks, Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Megan Krahe said in August.\n\nCircuit Judge Charles Williams has dismissed all five petitions of habeas corpus by the detainees. His order states that habeas corpus was not the correct vehicle for their requests.\n\nIn his dismissal order, Williams said Banks v. Jones – a 2017 habeas corpus case – does not apply to their petitions.\n\nAll five inmates resubmitted the petitions to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, which has not made a ruling.\n\n“They might think they don’t have any rights, but as human beings they do,” Darabian said. “They might not have had the best judgment or done rotten stuff because they were trying to survive, but they still deserve to be treated. They deserve to live.”\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Florida said unaffordable bonds is contributing to problems in jails statewide.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the nonprofit group said, “We are not involved in the litigation, but it is not surprising to see letter upon letter from incarcerated individuals and their family members about the state’s failure to address the spread of COVID-19 in our prisons and jails. From Day 1, we’ve been urging state and local leadership not to unnecessarily detain individuals in jail during this pandemic as the risks of infection and spread are too great. Jails have the responsibility to provide for the safety and security of those in their care. No one should have to suffer the impacts of COVID because they are too poor to afford bail, but tha​t is exactly what’s happening in every jail across the state.”\n\nThe Sarasota and Manatee County jails average about 800 to 900 inmates.\n\nThe Manatee County jail is licensed to hold 1,056 inmates, and the Sarasota County jail can hold 984.\n\nThe 12th Judicial Circuit Court is currently operating in Phase 2. This phase permits limited in-person court proceedings only for specific types of cases. All proceedings will continue to occur remotely where they can be done effectively.\n\nThe court faces a backlog of cases because of the coronavirus restrictions.\n\nIn March, Assistant State Attorney Craig Schaeffer, a division chief for the State Attorney’s Office, said the State Attorney’s Office was identifying appropriate cases for potential release from jail on nonviolent, low-level crimes.\n\n“Consistent with other counties around the state, we are examining each case,” Schaefer said. “We are also examining low-bond individuals. We are measuring public safety and community safety with this horrible virus.”\n\nPublic Defender Larry Eger compiled a list of nonviolent defendants whose release dates were within the next 30 days.\n\nBrown is being held on five counts of fraud and false ownership of pawned items and dealing in stolen property.\n\nCaraballo has been charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill; robbery/carjacking with a firearm or weapon; kidnapping; fleeing police with disregard for safety to persons or property.\n\nStewart was charged with battery, aggravated battery; failure to use a pedestrian crosswalk; criminal mischief; two counts of battery by a person in a detention facility.\n\nWirick was charged with petit theft.\n\nChatman was charged with loitering or prowling; three counts of burglary of unoccupied dwelling; possession of a controlled substance.\n\nIn their petitions, the inmates state that the jail has detainees with “underlying health issues,” and contraction could be a death sentence even before they are sentenced.\n\nThe inmates’ petition states that jail staff are forcing them to choose between confinement with no way to reach family, limited food supply, solitary or being placed with other possibly sick patients, or remaining in general population while sick or with the chance of becoming sick.\n\n“The choice of confinement or population is decided by the choice to speak of coronavirus symptoms or stay quiet,” Caraballo’s petition states.\n\nThe petitions claim masks are not provided on a day-to-day basis by staff, deputies are not wearing masks safely, and overcrowding has made it difficult to socially distance.\n\nCOVID-19 in prison\n\nAs of Oct. 14, the Florida Department of Corrections says that 16,483 state inmates have tested positive for COVID-19 since March, and 16,075 (98%) have been cleared from medical isolation.\n\nThere have been 154 coronavirus-related inmate deaths, according to FDOC Press Secretary Kayla McLaughlin.\n\nCurrently, 293 inmates are in medical isolation because of symptoms.\n\nThere have been 3,313 FDOC staff who tested COVID-19 positive, and 2,932 (88%) have returned to work.\n\n“If you take a look at our COVID-19 webpage, it is important to note positive test numbers reflect the total number of individual inmates who have tested positive for COVID-19, rather than the total number of positive tests that have been returned,” McLaughlin said. “This provides an accurate picture of the number of positive inmates to the public.\n\n“Negative test results are reported as a cumulative figure, as inmates may be tested multiple times with negative results, and this statistic is an accurate indicator of the volume of testing administered to the inmate population over time.”\n\nFor more information, visit floridahealthcovid19.gov.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/18"}]}

Next is the world record of 91,648 set when Barcelona hosted Wolfsburg last April in a UEFA Women's Champions League match.\n\n\"Yes, we believe that goal will be attained,\" Nebraska athletics director Trev Alberts told USA TODAY Sports. \"I think the number is going to be pushing closer to 95,000.\"\n\nMore than just a spectacle to highlight Nebraska's women's program, the event speaks to the measurable increase in interest and popularity around college volleyball and women's sports in general on the NCAA level. Wednesday's event has already spawned at least one imitator looking to highlight its own women's programs in a similar venue.\n\nBut there is something uniquely Nebraska about what is expected to be a record-setting event: If you play it, they will come. And they'll pack the house.\n\nHow to watch the Nebraska volleyball match\n\nDate: Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2023\n\nStart time: 8 p.m. ET\n\nTelevision broadcast: Big Ten Network\n\nThe genesis of Nebraska's volleyball day\n\nThe idea for this event was inspired by Wisconsin.\n\nThe Cornhuskers co-own with Wisconsin the overall NCAA volleyball attendance record (18,755), set when the two met in the 2021 national championship game in Columbus, Ohio. But the Badgers set a new regular-season record (16,833) in a match against Florida last September, sneaking past the previous mark (15,797) set when Creighton hosted Nebraska one week earlier.\n\n“The attendance record for volleyball belongs in the state of Nebraska,\" Alberts said in April.\n\n\"Wisconsin, being as competitive as they are, went and took one of our attendance records away,\" said longtime Cornhuskers coach John Cook, who has won 659 games and four national championships since taking over the program in 2000. \"So we’re like, ‘How are we going to get it back?’\"\n\nTwo years ago this month, Memorial Stadium drew nearly 90,000 for a Garth Brooks concert, giving the administration a roadmap for how to put on non-football events. Afterwards, Alberts and others asked: What else can we do?\n\nComing off the 50th anniversary of Title IX, which Nebraska celebrated at every home football game last season, the university latched onto the idea of building an event around one of the top women's programs in college athletics.\n\nThe Cornhuskers lead the nation in wins since 1975, have been nationally ranked in every American Volleyball Coaches Association poll since 1982, have sold out every home game since 2001 and have won five national championships, the first coming in 1995 under Cook's predecessor, Terry Pettit.\n\n\"It just kind of all seemed to make sense,\" said Alberts. \"We’re celebrating Title IX. We’ve become a national leader in women’s athletics.\"\n\nNebraska's regular-season match against Omaha will come after an exhibition match between two other in-state programs, Nebraska-Kearney and Wayne State. Country musician Scotty McCreery will play a concert following the second match.\n\n\"Let’s celebrate volleyball in the state of Nebraska,\" Alberts said. \"Let’s use athletics to bring our state together. And yeah, let’s have some fun. Let’s break a record once and for all.\"\n\nHow Nebraska is planning and staging the event\n\nThe event has posed a series of logistical hurdles related to scheduling, planning and production.\n\n\"There were a lot of concerns,\" Alberts said.\n\nOne factor in the school's favor: Nebraska football opens the 2023 season with two road games before returning to Memorial Stadium for the home opener against Northern Illinois on Sept. 16, eliminating the need for a quick-change overhaul of the playing surface.\n\nThat's a good thing, given the steps involved in constructing and deconstructing the volleyball court and the separate stage for the postgame performance.\n\nBuilding the staging for the court required dealing with the slight crown on Memorial Stadium to create an even playing surface. To do so, the company contracted for the event screwed together two different layers of plywood and then laid down the regular court. On top of that will be layers of Taraflex, a popular brand of modular flooring that limits slipping and adds shock absorption.\n\nThe regulation-size court – roughly 20 yards long and roughly 10 yards wide – will begin at the lip of Memorial Stadium's north end zone and run south, with benches and seating on the east and west sides along with additional seating on the south end.\n\nBleachers will run along the width of the north end zone. Standing-room areas for students will surround both sides of the court, running from the end zone across midfield to roughly the opposite 25-yard line. The concert stage will be located at the end of the student area.\n\nAccording to financial details shared by the university, the field covering will cost $133,600. Staging, including the bleachers, will cost another $279,888.\n\nIn all, when including event setup, event staffing and the spectator and student-athlete experience, the university will have expenses of roughly $1.3 million for the event.\n\nWhile the university and the city of Lincoln are adept at putting on Saturday events for home football games, this event has posed a different challenge: How can the school bring in this many people on a weekday?\n\nTo ease concerns over congestion, the university purchased satellite parking at a \"really significant\" cost, Albert said. In addition, Nebraska rented 90 buses to transport people from campus and the surrounding community.\n\n\"I mean, we’re going all out,\" Alberts said. \"We’re going to be doing as much or more for this event as we do for a home football game against Michigan. If we’re going to really celebrate women’s athletics, we’re going to do it at a commensurate level or higher.\"\n\nWill Nebraska set the attendance record?\n\nNebraska has also agreed to share revenue with the three in-state schools. Omaha, Kearney and Wayne State will be guaranteed $50,000 payouts if no weather issues force the event inside, which Alberts called a \"big number for those schools.\"\n\n\"I’m thinking, ‘This is nuts, there’s no way we can do this,’\" Cook said, \"and (Alberts) and our president and our governor said, ‘We’re going to do it.’\n\n\"We’re bringing back the alumni, so now it becomes this huge celebration and an attempt to break the attendance record and maybe one that will never ever be broken.”\n\nThe university sold approximately 82,900 tickets in just three days in late April, with the first day reserved for season-ticket holders and two others for the general public.\n\nAs of earlier this month, Nebraska had sold over 90,000 tickets. The school will exceed listed capacity and then some by selling additional field-level passes and standing-room tickets.\n\nBut like a future couple eyeballing the weather map in advance of wedding day, Nebraska administrators have one overriding concern: What if it rains? The Weather Channel is forecasting clear skies with winds between 10 and 15 miles per hour.\n\nNebraska does have a plan for any weather issues, but it's a disappointing one. Season-ticket holders have been given two tickets: one for Memorial Stadium and one for the Devaney Center, which hosts volleyball and other sports. In the case of unsuitable weather, the event will simply move inside.\n\n\"It’ll be a challenge,\" Alberts admits. \"There are 91,000 people coming to Lincoln for a game, and if the weather doesn’t work, only about 8,500, maybe 9,000 of them are going to leave happy.\"\n\nWhat the event says about NCAA women's sports\n\nWednesday's event comes as the sport is experiencing dramatic growth.\n\nAccording to the National Federation of State High School Associations, girl's volleyball had 454,153 participants during the 2021-22 school year, leaving the sport just 2,500 participants behind track and field for the most popular girls sport. Participation has grown approximately 11% in the past five years and 34% in the last decade, according to data provided by USA Volleyball, the sport's national governing body.\n\nESPN will air more than 2,500 women's volleyball matches across multiple platforms this season, the most in the network's history. ESPN will air more than 945 matches in September alone.\n\nThe matches in Memorial Stadium have led to at least one similar event and could lead to other games played inside larger venues featuring some of the top women's programs in college sports.\n\n\"But if you’re looking at what we’re capable of, women’s volleyball at Nebraska is putting a court on the middle of their football field,” said Oklahoma softball coach Patty Gasso, who has won the last three national championships and seven overall. \"They’ve sold out 80,000 fans already. So you know what my next conversation to (athletics director) Joe Castiglione is going to be.”\n\nFor now, the only school with a similar event in the works is Iowa, which will face DePaul in an outdoor women's basketball scrimmage at Kinnick Stadium on Oct. 15.\n\nThe Hawkeyes' event, called the \"Crossover in Kinnick,\" will be a showcase for last year's national runners-up and senior guard Caitlin Clark, the reigning national player of the year.\n\n“We’re super excited to play in front of the best fans in the country inside Kinnick Stadium,” said senior guard Gabbie Marshall. “We’re thankful to have an administration that gives us this platform to elevate our sport.”\n\nThe events at Nebraska and Iowa speak to a deeper point than just one match or game: Women's sports on the college level, and the student-athletes involved, have never been bigger.\n\nAnd while increasingly popular, these competitions could further broaden the interest in sports such as women's volleyball by potentially bringing in a new audience drawn to the spectacle of this unique event.\n\n“It’s a whirlwind of emotions to know that we’re going to be playing in front of that many people, but I think all of us know how important this is and not just for the sport of volleyball but for women’s sports in general,\" said Nebraska junior libero Lexi Rodriguez.\n\n\"It’s a huge monument for where women’s sports are going and I think it’s an amazing first step. It going to be really fun to be part of.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/volleyball/2023/08/30/nebraska-volleyball-womens-sports-attendance-record/70723628007/", "title": "Nebraska volleyball sets women's sports attendance record", "text": "\"Volleyball Day\" in Lincoln, Nebraska, will go down in history.\n\nWednesday's matchup between the Nebraska Cornhuskers and the Omaha Mavericks drew 92,003 spectators to the Cornhuskers' Memorial Stadium, according to Nebraska, setting not only a NCAA record for women's volleyball attendance, but the national and world attendance record for any women's sporting event.\n\n\"The WORLD RECORD for a Women’s Sporting Event lives in Lincoln,\" the team announced on social media. \"There is NO place like Nebraska.\"\n\nHuskers head coach John Cook got emotional while talking about the feat. \"We’ve dreamed big here tonight… (Junior setter) Kennedi Orr wrote me a note today that said, 'Coach, tonight the impossible will be possible.'

I think their defense is really awesome. … And at the end of the interview that was going down, the guys said something about just reloading it.

(AP) — Tennessee and Virginia Tech will finally play a football game at Bristol Motor Speedway in what is being billed as the \"Battle of Bristol.\"\n\nTrack and officials from both universities formally announced the plans Monday during a news conference. The game scheduled for Sept. 10, 2016, will be a national showcase for both programs that could set an NCAA attendance record at the 52-year-old racetrack.\n\nVirginia Tech athletics director Jim Weaver said this is something that he started talking to his Tennessee counterparts about nearly 17 years ago.\n\n\"I remember talking to (former Tennessee athletic director) Doug Dickey about the possibility of a game, and then (former Tennessee AD) Mike Hamilton.\"\n\nAfter all that talking, the rumors and speculation, it's finally going to happen.\n\nWeaver said the game is \"a reality that's as big as anything that's happened in the world of football.\"\n\n***\n\nBristol's speedway can hold around 160,000 fans. The track sits nearly halfway between the campuses of the schools, off Interstate 81 in Tennessee. The NCAA-recognized attendance record for college football of 115,109 was set last month at Michigan Stadium for Michigan-Notre Dame.\n\n\"To be a part of football history is something that's very important to both our universities, our student athletes and everything,\" said Tennessee coach Butch Jones.\n\nAdded Hokies coach Frank Beamer, \"Next to Lane Stadium, this is my favorite sports venue, I promise you.\"\n\nHokies vs. Volunteers at BMS first came up in the late 1990s, then again when the track underwent major renovations in 2005. The conversations got serious between the track and school officials last year.\n\nBurton Smith, track owner and president of BMS did not attend Monday's news conference because of a scheduling conflict. But he told the Associated Press everyone wants \"to make this a huge, huge deal.\"\n\n\"Our goal is to set a world record for the largest attended football game in the world,\" he said.\n\nThe NCAA record book does note that in the late 1920s, Notre Dame played two games at Soldier Field in Chicago in front of crowds estimated at 120,000\n\nSmith said when he brought the idea to the schools after BMS was reconfigured in 2005, Virginia Tech was interested but Tennessee wasn't.\n\nBut things have changed in recent years. Power conference schools such as Tennessee from the Southeastern Conference and Virginia Tech from the Atlantic Coast Conference are now more willing to bolster their schedules with potentially tough opponents and they are more willing to play neutral site games that can pay big bucks and land prime television spots.\n\n\"I think the landscape from college scheduling worked,\" said Jerry Caldwell, executive vice president and general manager of the track.\n\nTennessee AD Dave Hart said, \"It's the perfect match.\"\n\nTo accommodate a football field, the speedway will need modifications, some of which will happen as soon as next year, Caldwell said.\n\nA massive video board that sits atop a pylon in the middle of the infield will be taken out, Caldwell said.\n\n\"Screens will be added inside the facility so everyone can still see everything,\" he said.\n\nMaking room for a field will be easy compared to actually installing the field.\n\nBristol's big NASCAR race is in late August. Only until after that's complete can the football field be installed, with 8,500 tons of rock as its base.\n\nCaldwell said track officials are confident they will have a safe and sound playing surface, despite the quick turnaround.\n\n\"As we started meeting with turf companies and engineers, we learned it is not uncommon for them to do that type of thing,\" he said.\n\nThen there is the matter of fans in the stands being close enough to the field to be able to tell what is going on down there.\n\nTennessee's Neyland Stadium, which holds more than 102,000, would fit inside Bristol Motor Speedway.\n\n\"It's not a football stadium so it's going to be a bit different, but I think you'll see that the sight lines are great and are going to be very similar to what you would see in a college football program maybe within 10 to 20 yards from where you would be in a football stadium,\" Caldwell said.\n\nTrack officials are still working on sponsorship and television deals and are banking that there will be plenty of fans looking for tickets.\n\n\"I want the state of Tennessee and the state of Virginia.

The leagues will overlap this summer, forcing Alo to choose.\n\nThe all-time NCAA Division I home-run leader with 122 and the Most Outstanding Player of the 2022 Women's College World Series, Alo likes the fact that there is a choice at all. She said she’s encouraged by the work that both leagues have put in and sees it as a promising aspect of the sport’s overall growth.\n\n“One, I’m excited to join one of the two. Second, I’m excited to see how good it’s going to get from here because of the college game and how much people want to watch it and stuff like that,” said Alo, who is also a two-time USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year and has drawn attention from tennis legend Billie Jean King and football star Tom Brady. “I’m excited for players who want to continue to play that they’ll have the opportunity and even little girls in the stands will now say, like, ‘Oh, now I can become a professional softball player.’\n\n\"I think it’s going in a really good direction.”\n\nThat direction seems to be up. On-site attendance at the Women’s College World Series in Oklahoma City set numerous records, including the 12,533 people who came to the June 4 session and the average of 12,250 spectators per session.\n\nThe championship series averaged 1.6 million viewers on ESPN — down slightly from the record-setting 1.84 million in 2021. Plus, for the first time, two World Series games were shown on ABC in addition to the usual ESPN coverage.\n\n“I never thought in a million years I would be seeing what is going on right now. It’s been fabulous,” Oklahoma coach Patty Gasso said. “It is great for our game.”\n\nFor years, the game built to a crescendo at the World Series, only to see the sport fall out of the spotlight and leave fans wanting more.\n\nAthletes Unlimited has stepped into the void. In 2020, the organization started its first softball season, and Cat Osterman was the individual champion. Last year, the league signed World Series star Odicci Alexander — the breakout Black star from underdog James Madison. After the season, the league signed players to its first two-year deals.\n\nBut there was a gap between the end of the College World Series and the start of the Athletes Unlimited season.\n\nThis year, there’s an additional two-week Athletes Unlimited season, AUX, starting Monday at San Diego State. There are three teams and 42 players who compete for an individual title. Among the competitors are Aleshia Ocasio — last year’s Athletes Unlimited Champion — and Georgina Corrick, a rookie who was a USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year finalist at South Florida this past season.\n\nAthletes Unlimited vice president Cheri Kempf said ESPN agreed that the time was right to offer something more.\n\n“That’s really going to be the perfect thing to satisfy the excitement that is whipped up by the Women’s College World Series,” she said.\n\nAfter AUX, the third Athletes Unlimited championship season will run from July 29 to Aug. 28, returning to the Chicago area at the Parkway Bank Sports Complex in Rosemont, Ill.\n\nThe other league, WPF, has started up in conjunction with USA Softball, the USSSA and Smash It Sports.\n\nThe league will begin exhibition play Tuesday between its two teams, the USSSA Pride and the Smash It Sports Vipers. They will travel throughout the United States, with the season concluding Aug. 6.\n\nThe goal is to use the exhibition-style summer slate to gain more information to decide how to proceed after this year.\n\nBoth leagues are important from a developmental standpoint, USA Softball executive director Craig Cress said.\n\nIn the U.S.' gold-medal Olympic loss to Japan last year, the Japanese players — who compete in long-standing competitive leagues that put limits on the number of American participants — were better prepared for some of the tough moments, he said.\n\n“That’s what we need the professional leagues to provide is that high-level performance opportunity to where when it’s tense and they’re put in those positions, that they become accustomed to it,” Cress said. “Then it becomes the norm, not the abnormal. And the more reps you can get, the better off you are. So I think that it also gives us the chance to look at players’ body of work, their makeup, what they do over a long period of time.”\n\nTexas catcher Mary Iakopo, who also was drafted by both leagues this year and is on the Vipers roster, said it gives her a lot to look forward to.\n\n“I think right now, I’m just grateful that we even have this opportunity, for those that came before us and those that are still doing it that we can learn from,” she said. “It’s just a really cool thing for our sport, and I can’t wait to see what it looks like 10 years from now.”\n\n___\n\nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: https://twitter.com/CliffBruntAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/mississippi-state/2023/04/15/mississippi-state-baseball-dudy-noble-field-attendance-record-ncaa-ole-miss-super-bulldog-weekend/70112943007/", "title": "Mississippi State baseball sets attendance record at Dudy Noble Field", "text": "STARKVILLE – Mississippi State baseball broke its own NCAA on-campus record Saturday against rival Ole Miss with a crowd of 16,423.\n\nThat surpassed the old record of 15,586 set against the Rebels in 2014.\n\nThe new record comes during Super Bulldog Weekend.

Has 4th Gen Intel chip, with Intel Iris Graphics, 90% faster than previous generation. 9 hours of battery life. \"You can watch the 'Dark Knight' trilogy on one charge.\"\n\n10:26: Phil Schiller takes the stage from Federighi to talk about MacBook updates.\n\n10:26: Mavericks available today.\n\n10:26: Federighi says that upgrading OS \"will be as easy as downloading an app. The days of spending hundreds of dollars to get the most out of your Mac are gone. Today we are announcing Mavericks is free.\"\n\n10:22: Interesting - with iMaps on the Mac, the Calendar becomes \"geographically aware\" and includes driving or walking directions to and from appointments.\n\n10:19: Big laugh when Craig gets a message from his wife (code name: Hair Force Two) saying \"untucked shirt, scandalous!\" Federighi writes back: \"Phil (Schiller) is my fashion guru.\"\n\n10:17: New apps for the Mac - Maps with directions and flyover, and iBooks for Mac, including textbooks. Federighi now behind an iMac doing a demo: He pulls up iBooks (textbook on Mars) and essentially lays out a new study experience for today's schoolkids.\n\n10:15: Craig Federighi on the mic now: talking about upgrades to Mac and OS X. Changes include power efficiency: \"even 13 inch MacBook Air, if you install Mavericks you get up to an hour long web browsing on a single charge.\" Also improvements to memory. New Mavericks feature is \"compressed memory,\" making space for new allocations - 6 GB of data fit in 4 GB of system RAM.\n\n10:12: Mac talk next up from Cook. \"Our competition is different, they're confused. They're trying to make PCs into tablets and tablets into PCs. We have a very clear direction and very ambitious goal. We believe deeply in this category (the Mac) and we're not slowing down on innovation.\n\n10:08: Cook singing the praises of iOS7. Going over highlights like iTunes Radio, a billion songs listened to so far. App Store has \"over 1,000,000 apps in the store...cummulative dowloads are at 60 downloads ...developers have earned more than $13 billion.\"\n\n10:06: Cook says iPhone updates are next up, but first ...another video: Footage of how 9 million new iPhone 5cs and 5s's hit stores globally, lots of pumped up people waiting in lines on streets from Barcelona to New York.\n\n10:02: Tim Cook strides out on stage in his jeans and black button down shirt. \"I really love that video ...it does such an incredible job of talking about our values. It reflects the unique way Apple creates what we believe are the very best products in the world.\"\n\n10 a.m.: Show starts. \"How can anyone make anything perfect\" on the screen, video playing. \"Designing something requires focus.\" Sounds like a precursor to a Jony Ive voiceover.\n\n9:58: Music playing - empty stage here at Moscone Center, huge white Apple logo floats in the middle of a black screen. The usual Apple show preamble.\n\nUpdate at 9:55 a.m. PT: Apple's event starts in about five minutes.\n\nOur original post\n\nThe company will likely reveal two iPad models: the standard version with a thinner, lighter design, faster processing chips and a better camera; and a new iPad Mini that will boast a sharper Retina display.\n\nApple's event arrives as the company continues to face pressure from rivals launching lower-cost tablets running on Google's Android mobile operating system. According to IDC, twice as many Android tablets were shipped during the second quarter of this year than Apple devices.\n\nApple is also expected to unveil a new Macbook laptop computer as well as details on the OS X Mavericks operating system for Macs.\n\nUSA TODAY will have live updates from the event from reporter Marco della Cava starting at 1 p.m. ET.

(By comparison, the CES show in January touted many new products, but most won't be on sale until the spring at the earliest.)\n\nNostalgia:Bye-bye, BlackBerry? When the phones may finally disappear for good\n\nSnoops:Your smart TV is watching you. Will Samsung, LG, Vizio do more to protect privacy?\n\nEnthusiast sites have already posted leaks of product photos and details of the Samsung devices. Max Weinbach, who writes for the Android fan site XDA-Developers and has posted screenshots of the devices, says the top-of-the-line Galaxy phones will feature the highest resolution and specs of any major smartphone camera to date and will try to address issues some consumers have had with photos on the Apple iPhone.\n\n\"Sometimes, moving images can be blurry,\" he says. \"Samsung is going to address that.\"\n\nThere will be three editions of the Galaxy S series, he says, skipping 11 through 19 and going straight from 2019's S10 to the new S20.\n\nIn general, all three editions will have larger pixels on the camera sensor, which will enable the smoother photos and the top of the line Galaxy Ultra will have a whopping 100X zoom telephoto lens, something that has been lacking on iPhones.\n\n\"It sounds like Samsung is basically trying to improve in all the ways the iPhone doesn’t do well,\" Weinbach says. \"A lot of pictures are blurry with movement, so fix that. You can shoot on the iPhone in every mode but big zoom. So Samsung has an answer for that.\"\n\nAll three Galaxy phones are expected to work with the new, faster 5G networks the wireless companies are introducing.\n\nBut the star of the show could be the phone the enthusiast sites say is named the Z Flip.\n\nIt's a flip phone, like we used to use decades ago, except that it's expected to be a smartphone. It's similar in design to the Galaxy Fold, which Samsung introduced in 2019, Weinbach says, except half the size. The Fold is a phone that, when extended, basically is the size of a tablet.\n\nThe Z Flip is a small device that when folded can easily fit in a pocket or purse, and extends to 6.7 inches when unfolded, he says.\n\n\"It's really aimed at young millennials, the influencer crowd,\" he says.\n\nWeinbach says he's come across screenshots of the phone available in pink, silver, gold and black.\n\nDespite Apple's position shipping the most sold specific phone, in the iPhone, Samsung is the all-around world leader for shipments of phones, moving some 295 million phones in 2019, according to market researcher IHS Markit Technology. China's Huawei was second with 241 million, followed by Apple at 193 million phones.\n\nUSA TODAY will be covering the Unpacked event live, so stick with us for the latest.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2023/06/05/wwdc-2023-apple-keynote-live-updates/70287849007/", "title": "WWDC keynote 2023: Apple unveils Vision Pro AR headset, iOS17", "text": "Apple unveiled its vision for how computing will change in the future.\n\nOn Monday, Apple announced the Vision Pro mixed reality headset during the company's Worldwide Developers Conference at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters.\n\nThe headset incorporates both augmented and virtual reality, requiring wearers only use their eyes, hands and voice to control. The headset will launch early next year for $3,499.\n\n“Just as the Mac introduced us to personal computing, and iPhone introduced us to mobile computing, Apple Vision Pro introduces us to spatial computing,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.\n\nThe Vision Pro includes a three-dimensional interface where apps appear to pop up within the room you occupy, while also still viewing your surroundings if you choose. A knob called the digital crown, also found on Apple Watch, controls how immersed users want to feel while wearing the headset.\n\nThe device will also support Apple's Magic Keyboard and Trackpad for those who want more traditional computing options.\n\nWith the headset, users can have browsing tabs arranged around them, stretch screens for a movie theater experience, or join video calls with spatial audio that can mimic an in-person interaction, according to Apple.\n\nThe device uses advanced eye tracking to let wearers use their eyes to highlight an app or other field. You can tap a finger to select or flick your wrist to scroll. If you view a search bar, once it's highlighted, you can speak to enter a query.\n\nWhat's different about Vision Pro compared to other VR and AR headsets is EyeSight, a feature allowing other people to see the eyes of the person wearing the headset. When the wearer is immersed in an activity, the headset gives visual cues to others when they are busy. Apple said the feature is meant to keep users connected to their surroundings.\n\nApple also introduced iOS 17, the next operating system for iPhones. Features will include Contact Posters to give phone contacts more personality, live transcriptions of voice mails, NameDrop for quickly sharing contact information, and improvements to autocorrect for text messaging.\n\nScroll down for a replay of Apple's WWDC keynote.\n\nReactions: Apple meets 'Ready Player One'\n\nNow that the Vision Pro is here, the immediate reactions on social media like Twitter are the comparisons to Ready Player One.\n\nIf you recall, Ready Player One is novel-turned-film about a dystopia where inhabitants seek escape by entering a virtual reality universe.\n\nVision Pro starts at $3,499\n\nWant to join the future of spatial computing? Prepare to pay up. The headset will cost $3,499 when it launches next year.\n\nOptic ID is like Face ID for Vision Pro\n\nThe headset will support Optic ID, a biometric tool for unlocking when you use Vision Pro.\n\nHow does Vision Pro sound?\n\nThe headset will feature a unique spatial audio system meant to convince users the sound is coming directly from the room.\n\nUnder the hood of Vision Pro\n\nThe front of the product is a single piece of glass providing a view for the user along with a series of cameras. The digital crown controls how immersed you want to be in the environment. Apple said it studied thousand of heads to create a modular system to make sure it can fit any wearer. Like other headsets, it includes an adjustment dial to customize fit.\n\nMickey Mouse meets Vision Pro\n\nDisney is among the partners on board with Vision Pro, providing a preview of entertainment experiences on the headset. A teaser shows experiences such as courtside replays of NBA games and bringing Disney World into your living room. Disney Plus will appear when the Vision Pro launches, said Disney CEO Bob Iger.\n\nHow you view photos and videos in Vision Pro?\n\nUsers can display photos as big as your room, and panoromas can expand and wrap around you, providing a lifelike view. The headset has a camera, too, to capture moments while wearing the device. Video views and cinema environments provide movie theater style vibes, according to Apple. The headset will allow for 3D movies, too.\n\nHow you browse the web in Vision Pro\n\nSo how exactly do apps work? With Safari, you arrange the tabs all around you. For example, you might have one tab when you look left, and others when you look right. But while the tabs are open, you can still see others around you. Accessories are supported with the headset, including mouse and keyboard.\n\nWhat Apple Vision Pro interface looks like\n\nApple's demo shows the user viewing apps that show up right in the room. The headset includes a digital crown like the Apple Watch, and it appears tethered instead of operating independently, although it's not clear what device connects to the headset. The headset itself looks sleek. You use your eyes to move to different apps, while using your hands to scroll or select. The headset supports voice, too. Just look at the search bar, then speak your query. Vision Pro will also display your eyes when wearing the headset through an EyeSight feature. It's a clear blend of VR and AR.\n\nApple introduces Vision Pro, a new AR headset\n\nAnd here comes the mixed reality headset. Apple unveils Vision Pro. Using eyes, head and voice, you control apps and other tools. You can also see through the headset like you're wearing glasses, but apps appear in your environment like augmented reality. \"Vision Pro will introduce us to spatial computing,\" said Cook, comparing it to how the Mac and iPhone revolutionized technology.\n\nApple Watch will add mental, vision health features\n\nThe smartwatch will leverage the Mindfulness app to describe how you're feeling, ranging from very unpleasant to very pleasant. The health app will also include standardized assessments you might take at a doctor's office to determine your state of mind, and whether you should contact a medical professional. If you're a parent, you can use Apple Watch to measure how much time they spend in daylight. Apple devices will also offer a Screen Distance feature to alert users if they're holding screens too close.\n\nWatchOS 10: The latest updates\n\nEven more widgets, readers! When using fun faces like Portraits, you can use the digital crown to pull up widgets quickly with simple details like weather or timers. Apps have been redesigned, such as World Clock, which has dynamic colors that change depending on time of day. The Activity app has been tweaked with a new trophy case and more full screen views. Third-party apps will see new changes such as the NBA app, which provides more in-game information beyond score (finally). Also debuting on the Apple Watch later this year: Snoopy and Woodstock.\n\nThe Watch will soon get several new feature to accommodate cyclists, such as new ways to measure cadence and a new view for monitoring your progress during a ride. Compass and Maps apps will get updates to help hiking lovers.\n\nApple TV is adding FaceTime\n\nBig update to Apple TV: The FaceTime app will be available, so you can view and participate in calls right on your TV. Users can also use services like SharePlay to watch TV shows or movies with friends. You can also soon take Zoom calls through your TV.\n\nAirPods Pro will add Adaptive Audio\n\nAn update to AirPods Pro will support Adaptive Audio, which combines the noise cancelling and passthrough modes to fit your environment. A speaking feature will automatically lower the audio from AirPods when it recognizes you speaking to others. Automatic switching has improved, too, so it happens more quickly.\n\nWhat's new with Mac browser Safari?\n\nPrivate browsing is updated to lock browser windows, blocks trackers for loading and remove any URL trackers. Passwords and passkeys will soon be easier to share with important people in your file. Profiles allow people to create different identities to separate histories, such as work versus personal profiles. Users can also create Web apps from pages.\n\nWhat updates are coming to macOS Sonoma?\n\nThe next release, named Sonoma, is focused on improving productivity, said Federighi. Apple sure loves its widgets, because they're letting users add them directly to the screen instead of popping into view. When you open an app, widgets will fade in the background, and they adjust depending on the background of your desktop.\n\nMacs will add a Game Mode to improve latency, and developers will get better tools for porting their games over to the platform. Speaking of games, legendary designer Hideo Kojima confirmed his hit game Death Stranding will debut on Macs later this year.\n\nFor video calls, small and large overlays can easily move your video presence throughout a call. There will also be fun video effects such as fireworks exploding in the background if you give the thumbs-up.\n\nA PDF miracle for iPad\n\nRaise your hand if you get frustrated trying to fill out a PDF online. Apple's answer to this is the ability to autofill fields the tablet will recognize to quickly update. Apple also improved integration between PDFs and Notes, for easier access and collaboration.\n\niPadOS 17 beefs up widgets, lock screens\n\nOwners of iPad, this is for you. Apple will make widgets more functional, and include customized lock screens similar to the iPhone. Users can also add lock screen widgets. Live Activities such as food orders or travel plans will appear on iPads, too. Apple will also bring the Health app to iPad for the first time.\n\nDropping the Hey in 'Hey, Siri'\n\nA small change, but you soon can drop the \"Hey\" when waking up Siri. Users can simply say Siri. Other new features expected with iOS 17: offline maps, improvements to People albums, and a new Pets album within Photos.\n\nThe iPhone will have a Standby mode\n\nNew to the iPhone later this year is Standby, which turns the smartphone into a smart display when it's locked. It can show info like photos, time and date, or other notifications. If you want to use it as a traditional alarm clock, it will automatically dim to low light.\n\nJournal app to debut on iPhones this year\n\nThe iPhone will get a new Apple app, called Journal. Users can chronicle key moments in their life with a combination of writing and photos. Your phone will also remind you near the end of your day if you want to start writing.\n\nYour keyboard will become smarter\n\nAutocorrect gets a ducking update (see what I did there). Sentence level corrections can fix more types of mistakes. The keyboard will allow you to quickly revert to your original word if autocorrects tries to fix it when you don't want it. Predictive text will improve, too, gets Federighi.\n\nNameDrop quickly exchanges contact info\n\nSimilar to AirDrop, NameDrop allows people to quickly share contact information. Their info will appear on your phone, and you can select how you want to save details like phone number.\n\nStickers on Messages get more love\n\nStickers will get a major update with iOS 17. Users can access Stickers more easily to add to messages. They can also cut out elements from photos and create unique stickers users can customize. Emojis will be available as Stickers, too.\n\nLive Voicemail transcribes on the fly\n\nOne cool feature coming soon to iPhones: Live Voicemail. When a person calls currently, the Phone app will transcribe the message after it's recorded. With Live Voicemail, it will transcribe as the person is leaving the message, so you can see it in real time.\n\nUpdates are coming to Messages, too, including location sharing within a thread, check-ins to alert friends or family when you are safe, and transcribed audio clips shared in texts.\n\nIt's official: iOS 17 is confirmed\n\nApple's Craig Federighi appears to introduce the world to iOS 17. It starts with phone calls (remember it's still a phone). You can create special visual identities for contacts and lock screen style posters that pop up whenever someone calls. \"They're going to stand out in a whole new way,\" said Federighi.\n\nUpdates to Mac Studio\n\nTernus shifts to the Mac Studio, the company's supercharged desktop computer. Consumers can now buy a version with the M2 Max chip, which basically means it's going to operate super fast. Apple introduces a new chip, M2 Ultra, which doubles the performance of Macs running M2 chips, Apple said. It's clearly aimed at higher level production work such as video editing or audio engineering. Definitely don't buy this just for email or playing Wordle. Apple unveiled yet another Mac desktop, the Mac Pro with M2 Ultra.\n\nAll the big performance on the desktops come at a price. The Mac Studio starts at $1,999, while the Mac Pro starts at $6,999. A budget buster for sure.\n\nApple announces 15-inch MacBook Air at $1,299\n\nWe start WWDC with fresh hardware. John Ternus, Apple's senior VP for hardware engineering on Macs, joins to introduce a version of MacBook Air with a 15-inch screen. It's available in four finishes, MagSafe charging, and 1080p camera for video calls. The laptop has six speakers, and supports Apple's in-house M2 processing chip. The revamped laptop also boasts 18 hours of battery life. It starts at $1,299, and is available next week. Also, the 13-inch model will see a discount down to $1,099.\n\nLet Apple WWDC begin\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook kicks off the conference in front of giant rainbow arches right outside Apple Park. Cook notes this year marks the 15th anniversary of the App Store. Cook also said the company is committed to helping developers with the tools to help them do their best work.\n\nWhat time does WWDC start?\n\nThe conference begins with a keynote address starting at 1 p.m. ET.\n\nHow to watch WWDC keynote?\n\nThe keynote is available to watch through Apple's website, or on the Apple TV app. In previous years, Apple has also streamed its keynote on YouTube.\n\nWhat are Apple's plans with AI?\n\nApple is one of the few tech companies that has remained quiet on artificial intelligence, as services like ChatGPT and Google's Bard start to infiltrate the space.\n\nThat should change Monday, said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Apple is expected to discuss its plans and strategy for AI during the keynote.\n\n\"We expect Apple to head down the path to have its own AI driven solution that will be integrated within the Apple ecosystem and enable consumers to further tap into their iOS data, video, music, applications, and Apple devices through next generation AI capabilities,\" Ives said.\n\nWhen will we see iPhone 15?\n\nThe announcement of a new iOS brings us closer to a new iPhone. So when will we see iPhone 15 (granted they stay with the naming convention)?\n\nDon't expect an announcement Monday. Apple saves it for its big iPhone event in September. Typically the new iPhone launches in September, roughly two weeks after its signature fall event. Last year, Apple held its iPhone event September 7, then launched iPhone 14 on September 16.\n\nCan Apple's mixed reality headset break through?\n\nThe journey of the VR headset has felt like a rollercoaster ride. There was the initial buzz when the first headsets made their debuts. But the devices didn't take off like smartphones due to factors such as pricing and the fact that many headsets were tethered to a PC or other device to function.\n\nFacebook parent Meta has seen some success with its Quest line of VR headsets by making them more affordable and allowing them to operate independently.\n\nExpect Apple's rumored headset to remain a niche product for a while, said Forrester analyst Thomas Husson. The more important priority is creating an ecosystem capable of creating unique AR and VR experiences.\n\n\"Let’s not forget the iPhone and Apple Watch experiences were not built overnight but took a couple of years to scale,\" Husson said.\n\nWhat to expect from iOS 17\n\nAmong the rumored features is a new smart display that functions similarly a smart home device with screen like Amazon's Echo Show. When the iPhone is placed in landscape mode (horizontally), it will show specific notifications when the screen is locked, reports Bloomberg. The update will also add a journaling app to update friends and take notes, said the report.\n\nMore on Apple's mixed reality headset\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Apple will roll out its headset combining augmented and virtual realities during the keynote. The device will be named either Reality Pro or XR Pro, said the report, and cost around $3,000.\n\nThe headset will support VR as well as offer a pass-through mode to add AR elements, said the report. The device is meant for tasks such as communication, watching videos or playing games, the report said.\n\nWhat to expect at WWDC\n\nThe main purpose of the conference is to introduce developers to new versions of software for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. Prepare to see not just iOS 17, but fresh versions of iPadOS, watchOS and macOS.\n\nAlthough Apple typically reserves many of its big hardware announcements for its iPhone event in September, this year could be different. Monday could mark the debut of Apple's long-rumored mixed reality headset.\n\nWhat devices will be compatible with iOS 17?\n\nThe next iOS isn't just for new iPhone owners. Like previous releases, iOS 17 will be available on multiple iPhone models released over the past couple years. Support for iOS 16 stretches all the way back to the iPhone 8, released in 2017. However, if you are still hanging on to an iPhone 8, it's possible it gets cut out from this year's release.\n\nWhen will iOS 17 come out?\n\nThe keynote is typically when Apple not only unveils the next iOS but details on its launch. The arrival of iOS 17 is timed to the launch of the next iPhone, so the next update will likely debut in September a couple days before the new smartphone is available in stores.\n\nLast year, Apple released iOS 16 on September 12, four days before the launch of iPhone 14.\n\nWhat does WWDC stand for?\n\nThe annual Worldwide Developers Conference is a week-long gathering of developers of applications for Apple products including the iPhone, Mac, and iPad to connect with fellow developers and discover new tools for creating apps. The conference is free for all developers.\n\nThe conference had previously been hosted at a convention center in San Francisco before the COVID-19 pandemic transformed it to a virtual experience in 2020. This year, Apple will host a special in-person experience Monday at its Apple Park headquarters.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2016/09/07/heres-what-apples-new-iphone-missing/89924200/", "title": "Here's what Apple's new iPhone is missing", "text": "Matt Krantz\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDiehard Apple (AAPL) fans fretted for months over what would go missing in the newest iPhone. But investors are more worried about something other than an absent headphone jack: the missing enthusiasm for Apple's stock.\n\nShares of Apple fell 0.7% in the 30 days leading up to the 11th iPhone product launch Wednesday, lagging the Standard & Poor's 500 index 0.1% increase during the same time. The lackluster stock reaction coming into the smartphone announcement is a departure from previous Apple smartphone launches going back to the original iPhone almost a decade ago.\n\nIf there's a bright spot for investors, it's that Apple's shares performed better Wednesday than on announcement days in the past. Shares closed up 66 cents, or 0.7%, to $108.36. That first-day reaction breaks a string of declines or no changes in the stock following the announcements of the previous four phones.\n\nApple unveils iPhone 7, kills headphone jack\n\nBut expectations going in were low. On average, prior to the iPhone 7, Apple shares have gained 3.8% in the month prior to a product announcement. The last iPhone, the shrunken-down and discounted SE, gained 10.3% in the 30 days prior to the March 2016 announcement as the S&P 500 rose 6.9%.\n\nThe lack of excitement is notable given the importance of the product to Apple; iPhone revenue accounted for two-thirds of Apple's revenue last year, according to market research firm Trefis.\n\nThe lackluster run is even more disappointing since the stock typically runs into pressure afterward. Apple's stock has declined an average of 0.6% in the 30 days after the previous iPhone announcements going back to 2007. In the last four cycles, shares of Apple fell 4% in the two weeks after new phones were actually launched and made available, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich says.\n\nThe smartphone is a mature product, and the company's other offerings ranging from watches to tablet computers as well as music and payment services have failed to pick up the slack. Apple unveiled a new iteration of its watch Wednesday but didn't address one of the top concerns: battery life. Apple's revenue is expected to fall 8% this fiscal year ended in September to $215.4 billion, says S&P Global Market Intelligence. Even with a new smartphone launch next fiscal year, analysts see revenue inching up just 4%, a fraction of its 28% revenue growth in fiscal 2015 and 31% average revenue growth over the past five fiscal years.\n\n8 mistakes Apple could make with the new iPhone\n\nPayPal pushes into stores with Mastercard deal\n\nSamsung continues to challenge Apple. Apple claimed 75% of the premium-tier smartphone profits in the second quarter, says Michael Walkley, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. But that's down from Apple's 90% share in the first quarter due to Samsung capitalizing on better demand for its Galaxy S7 device, he says.\n\nStill, people waiting to upgrade their phones may finally pay up for the iPhone 7 or new phones launched in 2018, Walkley says. Apple still also has a large captive audience of users to pitch its services. Analysts think Apple shares should be worth $123.25 each in 18 months. \"Barring any surprises, such as an iPhone price cut, we see limited downside risk,\" Milunovich says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2014/09/09/apple-product-unveiled/15334771/", "title": "Apple stock falls after announcements", "text": "Matt Krantz\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n\n\nExcitement and disappointment over Apple's new products sent its stock on a roller coaster ride Tuesday as investors reacted to a bevy of announcements.\n\nApple's stock ended down just 0.4% after a volatile day during which the view on Wall Street appeared to be that the news didn't match up to the sky-high expectations and hype.\n\nThe shares closed down 37 cents at $97.99. During the day the stock traded as as high as $103.08 and as low as $96.14 — a big range for the most valuable company on the U.S. stock market.\n\nApple stock initially jumped as the meeting progressed, especially after the announcement of a mobile payment system. But the stock faded again after the company said its new watch would work only with iPhones and wouldn't be available until next year.\n\nShares bounced around $100 a share as the meeting progressed and two new models of the iPhone were announced. The stock gained following the plan to allow consumers to add credit card information to their phones. The gains held as the company unveiled the much rumored $350 smartwatch, but evaporated as the timing and iPhone requirement was revealed.\n\nThe company was widely expected to announce an update to its iPhone smartphones with a larger screen in an effort to catch up to innovation in that area from Samsung and Microsoft's Nokia. Analysts were also expecting the company to announce a watch.\n\nAnalysts expect the company would charge more for the model of the phone with the larger screen, a move to defend the company's relatively high operating margins. Defending profit margins is a key part of the stock's success and increasingly difficult as competition heats up.\n\nThe company said the new iPhone will come in two sizes, a regular-sized 4.7-inch one and a super-sized 5.5-inch one called the iPhone 6 Plus. The company only provided prices including subsidies connected with a two-year contract. With that contract, the iPhone 6 will cost between $199 and $399 depending on how much memory it has. The iPhone 6 Plus will start at $299.\n\nThe Apple Pay service was also expected by investors and analysts. Even so, seeing the service this close to reality was unnerving to eBay investors, who sent the stock down $1.50, or 2.8%, to $52.73. EBay's PayPal unit has been moving to become more of a mobile payment service, but now it will have a new competitor to deal with.\n\nBut the fact the Apple Watch won't be available until next year is a bit of a surprise. Apple has long been known to capture excitement over products by being ready to ship while the hype and anticipation is still there. \"The Apple Watch was more expensive than we had anticipated, will miss the holiday selling season, and must be tethered to an iPhone, which we believe will limit its revenue potential in the near-term,\" says Bill Kreher, analyst with Edward Jones in a note to clients where he reiterated his \"hold\" rating on Apple stock.\n\nA shaky announcement day reaction by the stock is the norm. Apple shares stock have gained 0.3% on average on the first day following the previous iPhone announcements, which is equivalent to the average gains of the market on the same days. The stock fell 2.3% on the day the iPhone 5s was introduced last year.\n\nThe fact is Apple delivered what investors essentially expected. Investors, though, tend to demand more from the market leader. \"Expectations were close to reality,\" according to a report by UBS tech analyst Steven Milunovich to clients. \"We will review our estimates, though we don't expect major changes.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2012/10/27/holiday-gadgets-samsung-launches-note-ii-phone/1656301/", "title": "Holiday gadgets: What to expect in a wave of new gear", "text": "Associated Press\n\nApple will start shipping iPad Mini next week\n\nMicrosoft is branching out into the tablet market with Surface\n\nNew BlackBerry will not be arriving in time for the holiday season\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — It's been a big week for technology releases. Microsoft kicked off its campaign for the Windows 8 operating system and Surface tablet computer, just days after Apple and Samsung refreshed their lineups.\n\nDesktops, laptops and tablet computers running Windows 8 went on sale Friday. That includes the Surface, Microsoft's first foray into manufacturing a general-purpose computer. And now people with older machines can buy upgrades to Windows 8.\n\nWindows 8 is a major revamp to Microsoft's industry-leading operating system. It is designed especially for touch-screen computers and requires users to change their habits. The start button at the lower left corner of the screen is gone, for instance.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft CEO Steve Ballmer encouraged people to visit a store to try Windows 8 themselves.\n\n\n\n\"Seeing, touching, clicking and swiping really is believing,\" he said at Thursday's launch event in New York.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Samsung released its large-screen Note II smartphone and Apple announced new iPads and Mac computers. Microsoft has an announcement Monday on its Windows phone system, while Google has one on its Android system for mobile devices.\n\n\n\nWith those announcements, these are some of the gadgets to expect for the holidays:\n\nAPPLE DEVICES\n\nApple has done well selling its full-sized tablet computer, which has a screen that measures nearly 10 inches diagonally. The iPad dominates the worldwide tablet market, accounting for 70 percent of all tablet shipments in the second quarter of this year, according to IHS iSuppli. But companies such as Amazon.com and Google have made in-roads selling tablets with smaller, 7-inch screens and lower price tags.\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple said it will start shipping the iPad Mini next week. It will have a 7.9-inch screen, making it slightly larger than those smaller rivals but about two-thirds the size of a regular iPad.\n\nThe iPad Mini starts at $329, well above the $159 starting price for Amazon's Kindle Fire and $199 for Google's Nexus 7. Both have 7-inch screens. The Mini will be just $70 cheaper than the 2011 iPad 2, which is still available.\n\nUnlike its rivals, Apple will make a version of the iPad Mini that can access cellular networks from AT&T, Verizon and Sprint. That version will start at $459, compared with $629 for the full-sized cellular model.\n\nApple is also refreshing its full-sized iPad, giving it a faster processor and faster Wi-Fi capabilities. It will go on sale next week as well.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple unveiled a 13-inch version of a MacBook Pro with sharper, \"Retina\" display, complementing the 15-inch version unveiled in June.\n\nApple also updated its iMac line. Some versions will sport a hybrid storage drive that combines the speed of flash memory and the capacity of regular hard drives. They will go on sale in December.\n\nLast month, Apple began selling its iPhone 5. The new phone is bigger, but thinner than previous models and works with faster cellular networks known as 4G.\n\nApple's leading rival, Samsung, came out with a new version of its flagship phone, the Galaxy S III, months ago. But Samsung is known for releasing products throughout the year, each targeted at a different base of consumers. For those who like to work with a stylus, the Galaxy Note II smartphone is coming soon.\n\nTABLET RIVALS\n\nAmazon's 7-inch Kindle Fire is one of the smaller tablets with decent sales. Last month, it started shipping an updated version with a faster processor, more memory and longer battery life. It also cut the price to $159, from $199, making it far cheaper than the iPad, which starts at $399.\n\nAmazon is also releasing higher-end models under the Kindle Fire HD line. A 7-inch one goes for $199 and an 8.9-inch one for $299. There's also a $499 model that can use the 4G cellular networks that phone companies have been building. A data plan will cost an extra $50 a year. The smaller HD model is already available, while the larger ones will be available Nov. 20.\n\nBarnes and Noble is also updating its Nook tablets. The new Nook HD will come in two sizes, one at 7 inches (starting at $199) and one at 9 inches (starting at $269). They will be out Nov. 1.\n\nIn addition to the new HD screen and a lighter body, Barnes & Noble is increasing the services the Nook offers. It's adding a video purchase and rental service, allowing users to maintain different profiles and making it easier to browse titles in its book and magazine stores.\n\nGoogle has an event in New York on Monday. All the company is saying is that it has to do with its Android operating system for mobile devices. Google started selling the Nexus 7 over the summer and could use the event to announce an update.\n\nToys R Us, meanwhile, is making a 7-inch tablet aimed at children. The Tabeo went on sale this week for $149.99.\n\nCALLING ON WINDOWS\n\nMicrosoft released a new version of the Windows operating system on Friday, one that's designed to work on both traditional computers and tablet devices.\n\nPC manufacturers including Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard,, Samsung and Dell are launching new desktops, laptops and tablet computers.\n\nMicrosoft has its own tablet computer, too. It's new territory for Microsoft, which typically leaves it to others to make devices using its software. Now, it will be competing against its partners.\n\nThe Surface tablet will come in two versions, both with 10.6-inch screens, slightly larger than the iPad's.\n\nOne model will run on the same type of lower-energy chips used in the iPad. It will start at $499, also like the newest, full-sized iPads. A keyboard cover will cost another $100. That will go on sale Friday.\n\nA heavier, more expensive version will run on Intel chips and be capable of running standard Windows applications.\n\nA new version of the Windows Phone system is coming out this fall as well. Once-dominant phone maker Nokia has been struggling in the shadow of Apple and Android, and it's counting on the new Windows system for a revival. Nokia and Microsoft have unveiled two new devices, but few details are available on when and where they would go on sale.\n\nNEW BLACKBERRYS\n\nA year ago, Research In Motion disclosed that it was working on a next-generation phone system for the BlackBerry, which now looks ancient next to the iPhone and Android devices. It was supposed to be out in time for this year's holiday season. That won't happen.\n\nIn June, RIM pushed the release of BlackBerry 10 devices into early next year, saying it wasn't ready. That means RIM will not only compete with the new iPhone and Android devices out this fall, but it will also have to contend with the new Windows devices.\n\nPLAYING GAMES\n\nNintendo's new Wii U game machine will go on sale in the U.S. on Nov. 18. A basic, white model will cost $300. A deluxe black version for another $50 comes with an extra game and more accessories. The GamePad touch-screen controller for it will offer new ways to play.\n\nIn \"New Super Mario Bros. U.,\" for example, players holding the old Wii controllers control Mario, Luigi and other characters. The person with the GamePad can help them along by using a stylus to create stepping stones for the characters or stun enemies.\n\nPlayers can also turn off the TV entirely and play on the GamePad.\n\nNintendo has been trying to drum up excitement for the Wii U, the first major gaming console to launch since 2006.\n\nThe company also announced new entertainment features for the console. Called Nintendo TVii, the service collects all the ways users have to watch movies, TV shows and sports. This includes pay-TV accounts along with services such as Hulu and Netflix. The GamePad works as a fancy remote controller and will let viewers comment on what they are watching.\n\nTVii will be available Nov. 18 as well, at no extra cost.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2016/03/21/apple-already-wins-big-teeny-phone/82060956/", "title": "Apple already wins big with teeny phone", "text": "Matt Krantz\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nApple (AAPL) investors are betting that smaller is better.\n\nShares of Apple have rallied 10.3% over the previous 30 days as investors anticipate the company's new product announcement today, according to a USA TODAY analysis of market data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Apple is widely anticipated to Monday announce a smaller iPhone rumored to be called the SE.\n\nThe details of the announcement won't be known for hours, but the stock's run-up ahead of the announcement is impressive. Shares closed Friday at $105.92, which is up 15% from its lowest point over the past 52 weeks. It's the best stock-market run-up ahead of a new iPhone announcement in years.\n\nThis rally is noteworthy because it is:\n\n• Reinvigorating the famous Apple rally ahead of announcements. Apple's gain over the past 30 days ahead of Monday's announcement is the best gain of shares ahead of an unveiling of new model of smartphone since the 11.4% bump before the 5C and 5S back in September 2013. Buying on the rumor of new iterations of iPhones ahead of announcements used to be an easy way to make money. Apple shares have gained 4% on average in the 30 days ahead of the 10 iPhone announcements in the past - while the broad market was flat during the same period. This \"buy the rumor\" winning streak was starting to look like it was fading faster than a smartphone battery. Shares of Apple sank 6.4% in the 30 days leading up to the announcement of the widely disappointing iPhone 6S. But with the SE — the bump is back.\n\n• Outperforming the broad market's rally. Apple's rally is even more notable since it even outpaced a broad market gain. The S&P 500 has enjoyed a powerful 6.9% rally over the past 30 days — helping major market measures to pull back into the black for the year and shake off the abysmal January and first part of February. But Apple's gain during that time is even 65% greater.\n\n• Putting Apple back back as most valuable company. The rally in Apple has been enough to push it back past Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) as the world's most valuable company at $587 billion, a title it briefly lost earlier this year. Alphabet shares are up too, rising nearly 5% over the past 30 days. But even with that gain, Alphabet has slipped behind Apple with a market value of $514 billion.\n\n• Rising despite the overhang of a pending legal battle with the Department of Justice. Later this week, Apple and the Justice Department are expected to get into the thick of a skirmish with broad implications over the company's future with regards to security and cooperation with the government. The Justice Department is arguing the company much comply with federal orders to help it examine the contents of a phone owned by a gunman involved in the San Bernardino shooting.\n\nSeeing Apple's stock act better lately underscores that \"things may be better than feared,\" according to a report to clients co-authored by Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse. Investors turned negative on Apple's stock starting last year as it became increasingly clear profit would decline in fiscal 2016 ended in September. \"In our view, this improvement could be the first positive movement since the Apple iPhone supply chain cuts began late last year.\"\n\nNew product announcements that further solidify Apple smartphones as a platform for other technology to built upon is a driver for the stock price, says Steven Milunovich, research analyst at UBS said in a note to clients. Companies that make \"platforms,\" or ways for producers and consumers to connect, are where investors will focus their investments, he says. At Apple's Friday closing price of $105.92, the stock is trading for just 10.6 times what the company is expected to earn in fiscal 2017. Based on the company's strategy of building a platform, the stock could trade closer to 12 times fiscal 2017, which would put the stock at $120 a share, Milunovich says.\n\nBut despite Apple's rally on the rumor of a new phone, the shares are still beat up as investors realize the company's fast-growth days are over. It's unclear if a teeny phone will be enough to get the company back on the fast track. Shares are down 21% from the all-time high of $134.54 — putting it in a bear market. Adjusted earnings in 2016 are expected to drop 1.4% this fiscal year ended in September.\n\nIt's also typical for Apple shares to fade following the announcement of a new smartphone. Shares of Apple have, on average, have fallen 1% in the 30 days after an iPhone announcement. Following the last update, the 6S, shares of Apple declined 1.9% in the 30 days following even after dropping 6.2% in the 30 days ahead of the announcement.\n\nBut for now — investors have big hopes for this small phone.\n\nFollow Matt Krantz on Twitter @mattkrantz", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2013/10/22/nokia-unveils-windows-tablet-lumia2520/3147577/", "title": "Nokia unveils Windows tablet, supersized smartphones", "text": "Edward C. Baig\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLumia 2520 is Nokia%27s first connected Windows tablet\n\nTwo new Lumia phablets have 6-inch screens\n\nNokia devices push photography\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — There's probably an apt metaphor in Nokia announcing its first connected Windows tablet and two new \"phablet\" devices Tuesday in far-far away Abu Dhabi. Nokia has to travel great distances to catch up to its Android and iOS rivals in the U.S.\n\nThe timing of the announcements doesn't seem all that terrific for Nokia either, at least from a U.S. perspective. That's because all the attention in tech will be focused on San Francisco, where Apple Tuesday is expected to unveil its latest Pads.\n\nStill, there is a lot of renewed curiosity in what Nokia is up to these days, especially with the Finnish phone maker about to join Microsoft.\n\nNokia's connected Windows tablet — it is LTE-capable along with Wi-Fi — is called the Lumia 2520. It sports a 10.1-inch HD display, a 6.7 megapixel camera, and Zeiss optics that Nokia says is a first for a tablet, promising excellent pictures even when shot in low light.\n\nIndeed, one area Nokia has been generating a lot of noise these days is in photography, exemplified by the 41-megapixel sensor in the Lumia 1020 smartphone that came out earlier in the year.\n\nNokia says all the latest devices include very good cameras too, if not quite getting up to 41 megapixels.\n\nNokia decided with the 2520 to go with Windows RT 8.1, the same version of Windows as in Microsoft's new Surface 2 tablet. It is the version that is aimed more at the tablet user, as opposed to the more PC-oriented Pro version on Microsoft's Surface 2 Pro.\n\nOther details: Nokia claims the 2520 can reach an 80% charge in one hour. And Nokia with the 2520 is teaming with DreamWorks Animation on a new \"Dragons Adventure\" interactive game. Also included, a Nokia Storyteller app that lets people curate and relive images and videos as a story on a map.\n\nSpeaking of maps, Nokia says its integrated HERE Maps app makes the 2520 the only tablet with true offline maps.\n\nU.S. availability comes later in the year on AT&T, at an expected price of $499. Verizon also has confirmed it will be carrying the 2520 this quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, Nokia weighs in with a pair of new super-sized screen smartphones, commonly known as \"phablets.\" The high-end quad-core Lumia 1520, as well as the more modestly-priced Lumia 1320 devices have whopping 6-inch high definition displays. The former can get up to full 1080p resolution, the latter 720p.\n\nThe 1520 carries a lofty $749 price before any taxes or subsidies; the 1320 is at $339 before subsidies. The 1520 will be available this quarter in the U.S. (exclusive to AT&T to start) and elsewhere. The 1320 will be available after the first of the year but not the U.S.\n\nA 20 megapixel \"Pure View\" camera is included in the 1520, which can be dressed in yellow, white, black or glossy red. The 1320 has a 5-megapixel shooter and is also available in multiple colors.\n\nThe latest handsets also feature the Storyteller. And the Windows Phone 8 platform that these phones run on will be helped by the addition of various popular third party apps, including Instagram and Vine.\n\nAmong the options on the device side: wireless charging.\n\n\"Nokia's challenge is not so much in its ability to deliver qualitative new product experiences but more in the overall brand perception - especially when entering a brand-new market like tablets,\" Forrester analyst Thomas Husson says. \"Despite a more affordable price, the respective positioning of Nokia's new tablet versus the Surface 2 is not obvious and will have to be dealt with post Nokia's acquisition.\"\n\nFrom Abu Dhabi, Nokia also unveiled lower-priced Asha-branded handsets but they're not currently slated for the U.S. market.\n\nFollow Ed Baig on Twitter: @edbaig.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/08/05/samsung-unveils-note-galaxy-watch/5529533002/", "title": "Samsung unveils Note20 phones, Galaxy Watch with fall detection", "text": "Samsung has two new premium-size and priced Note smartphones for you, calling them \"power devices\" that have more oomph than last year's models.\n\nAt a live-streamed event from South Korea, Samsung on Wednesday confirmed the pending release of the two Galaxy Note20 phones; an updated smartwatch; two new tablets; Galaxy Buds; and a new version of the Fold phone, the nearly $2,000 hybrid tablet/phone first seen in 2019.\n\nIt's that time of the year when manufacturers begin introducing and shipping new phones. This week, Google announced its new budget Pixel 4A, selling for $349, and in September, Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 12 for an October release. The new Apple device will be delayed from its usual September debut.\n\nThe new Note20 phones will be available Aug. 21, and they're not cheap: They'll start at (Note20) $1,000 and (Note20 Ultra) $1,300 with 128 gigabytes of storage.

There is a new and improved S pen this year that Samsung says has \"more lifelike precision ... accuracy and responsiveness.\"\n\nWhile the new Note20s are larger (6.7 inches and 6.9 inches, respectively) than the 6.3-inch and 6.8-inch 2019 models, they aren't bigger than two of the Galaxy S20 2020 phones, the 6.7-inch S20+ or 6.9-inch S20 Ultra.\n\n“Historically, there has been a niche set of consumers who could be termed ‘Note loyalists’\" says Ben Wood, an analyst with CCS Insight. \"They appreciated the biggest screen and particularly loved the stylus. These days, the screen size is no longer a differentiator, so Samsung will be hoping the stylus is enough to set Note20 devices apart from its Galaxy S20 products.”\n\nSamsung says the new Note phones are \"the most powerful Note series,\" yet, in that they work \"like a computer and lets you game like a pro.\"\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note20 gets Xbox Game Pass subscription\n\nSamsung is pushing gaming for the Note series, announcing a deal with Microsoft to offer a $15 monthly subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which will allow more than 100 video games to be played on the Note. Currently, the subscription is available only for PCs and consoles. The Game Pass offer will begin Sept. 15.\n\nThe Ultra phone has a 120Hz refresh rate, which means that webpages and videos will open faster, compared with 60Hz on the previous edition.\n\nThe new Z Fold2 is the update to last year's Fold phone, with a larger body (unfolded, it's 7.6 inches, to the previous 7.3 inches.) Pricing hasn't been announced.\n\nThe tablets, Galaxy S7 ($650) and S7+ ($850) will be Samsung's first that work with the growing 5G wireless standard and the improved S pen. Like the Note20 phones, the tablets both have a 120Hz refresh rate, with the S7+ boasting a super large 12.4-inch screen. Samsung lists availability as \"fall.\"\n\nNew Galaxy Watch to catch your fall\n\nThe Galaxy Watch3 ($400 or $430) will be sold starting Thursday and is available in two models: 41mm and 45mm variants. There are 120 video workouts available for viewing, via the Samsung Health app, which steals a page from Apple's playbook with a \"trip detection\" feature that sends an SOS if it detects a fall. Apple introduced a similar feature in the 2018 edition of its Apple Watch.\n\nThe South Korea edition also offers the ability for ECG and blood pressure monitoring.\n\nFinally, the new Buds ($170), also available Thursday, promise a larger, 12mm speaker than on last year's model, as well as improved noise-cancellation features.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/06/05/apple-unveils-349-homepod-compete-amazon-echo-google-home/102523820/", "title": "Apple unveils $349 HomePod to bring voice to home audio", "text": "Jefferson Graham\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSAN JOSE — Apple has set its sights on the living room, with a voice-activated $349 speaker called the HomePod that leverages personal digital-assistant Siri and stresses its functionality with core Apple services like Apple Music.\n\nThe iPhone maker was expected to announce a smart speaker, a market that Amazon — with its sleeper hit, the Echo — and then later Google Home, powered by Assistant — now dominate, giving them an integral place in users' lives. Such a speaker was missing from Apple's line-up, allowing rivals Amazon and Google to siphon off some of its loyal user base.\n\nBut while comparisons with Amazon Echo and Google Home are inevitable, Apple is positioning HomePod more as an alternative to connected music-systems from Sonos and Bose, says Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies. HomePod \"is one of the best-sounding speakers I've ever heard,\" says Bajarin, who was given a private demo by Apple. \"I was blown away.\"\n\nMore:\n\nLive: Apple unveils $349 smart speaker HomePod\n\nApple's big wow moments: a voice speaker and augmented reality\n\n11 changes coming to iPhone with Apple's iOS 11\n\nWith Siri most widely used on iPhone, which has limited voice range, Apple risked losing out on the daily, at-home tasks consumers increasingly talk to Echo or Home for — reminders, calendars, music, reservations. This activity, in turn, gives Amazon and Google rich veins of information about consumer behavior. This year, 35.6 million Americans will use a voice-activated assistant device at least once a month, according to research firm eMarketer.\n\nBut Apple clearly sees a different scenario for the speaker, its first \"pod\" product since the days of the iPod music player than Amazon and Google. Indeed, at $349 it's priced substantially higher than the $175 Echo and $129 Google Home.\n\nApple says its looking to “reinvent” the way we listen to music in the home. In its demo at the Worldwide Developers Conference here, Apple focused less on the novelty of using the speaker to answer queries about the weather and calendar appointments and more on using the speaker as a multi-room wireless sound system—exactly what Sonos and Bose do — as well as home automation functions.\n\nThe speaker \"can rock most any room with distortion free music and be a helpful assistant around your home,\" said Apple senior vice-president Phil Schiller.\n\nOvum analyst Ronan de Renesse said it was smart for Apple to ignore the low end of the market. \"Amazon Echo and Google Home users for the most part don’t care enough about audio quality to pay an extra $150-200 and it is just not in Apple’s interest to make smart speakers at lower price points.\" However, the analyst expects Apple to still lag far behind Amazon and Google in sales.\n\nThe HomePod is positioned to be a companion for Apple Music, its subscription service, while Echo and Home work with rivals Spotify, Pandora and others.\n\nApple said Siri can be used to play specific songs or playlists, ask questions about the music (\"who's the drummer on this song?\" get news, sports and weather updates and run the home.\n\nApple said the same A8 chip used in the iPhone will power the speaker. “It’s the biggest brains ever in a speaker,” said Schiller.\n\nAs part of the announcement at the Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple touted upgrades for the Siri personal assistant in the fall update to the IOS mobile operating system.\n\nSiri will add inflection to her voice, to say phrases three different ways. Additionally, Siri will be able to chime in by answering follow-up questions, and offer multiple results to queries.\n\nFollowing in Google’s footsteps, Siri will also be able to translate and speak phrases from six languages, with more coming later, Apple said. The HomePod speaker has six built-in microphones compared to 1 on Siri, so response rate should be much better.\n\nLive: Apple unveils $349 smart speaker HomePod\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham and listen to the daily #TalkingTech podcast on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher and iTunes.

Union St., Wilmington; (302) 571-8929\n\nEvery state has foods that it's known for: Maryland has crabs, Pennsylvania has the cheesesteak and Delaware has the Bobbie.\n\nThe iconic \"Thanksgiving on a roll\" was invented by the late Wilmington native Lois Margolet. She launched the Capriotti's Sandwich Shop chain in 1976 in the Little Italy neighborhood where she grew up. Margolet named the mom-and-pop sub shop after her grandfather Philip Capriotti.\n\nThe specialty sandwich that established Capriotti's is the famed Bobbie. It's made with pulled turkey, cranberry sauce, homemade stuffing and mayonnaise. The dish was a recreation of a sandwich served to the Margolets by their Aunt Bobbie. The national restaurant chain now has 106 locations in 17 states.\n\nWhat to order? The Bobbie, of course. We also recommend the turkey sub and the Capastrami, hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and coleslaw on a roll.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Casapulla's shop at 514 Casapulla Ave. in Elsmere, has been making meaty Italian subs since 1956. It had been considered Capriotti's longtime rival, although the families were good friends.\n\n\"The only problem between us was that Capriotti's and Casapulla's almost sound the same,\" Lou Casapulla told The News Journal in 2017. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\nGrotto Pizza\n\n36 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach; (302) 227-3278\n\nSo much nostalgia, and debate, surrounds Grotto Pizza. We're convinced the best slice is served with a side of salty sea air. Go to the original Rehoboth Avenue home, a few steps from the ocean, to enjoy pies that feature a blend of cheeses (they won't say what kind) and tomato sauce applied in a signature swirl.\n\nOh, and in case you're wondering what those regulars are doing with the napkins, dabbing the top of a slice to soak up \"pizza juice\" is a Grotto's tradition.\n\nGrotto Pizza was founded in 1960 by Dominick Pulieri, along with his brother-in-law, Joe, and sister Mary Jean Paglianite. At the first take-out stand, pizza slices sold for 20 cents a piece. A second Grotto Pizza on the Rehoboth boardwalk opened in 1963. The chain now has more than 20 locations.\n\nWhat to order? A traditional oven pizza. Sizes include a 12-inch regular or a 16-inch large. For toppings, we'd go with pepperoni or Pennsylvania mushrooms.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Nicola Pizza at 8 N. First St. in Rehoboth has been around since 1971. Owner Nicholas Caggiano gave Delaware's pizza culture the Nic-o-Boli, the First State's version of the stromboli.\n\n2020 Naamans Road, Brandywine Hundred; (302) 475-3000\n\nOwner Xavier Teixido's classy, convivial restaurant is modern and innovative, but it also focuses on old-school classics. It offers the state's best prime rib, along with seafood, steaks and a wine list deeper than Barry White's dulcet tones.\n\nBuilt on the bones of old Admiral Inn, it has roots tracing back to 1939 when it was the Log Cabin. Harry's has been operating since 1988 with Teixido purchasing it after a split with a former partner in 1993. It's not named after a particular person. Teixido once joked, \"Who doesn't love a Harry?\"\n\nWhat to order? Oysters, hot crab and artichoke dip, aged steaks, prime rib au jus medium rare, soft shell crabs (seasonal), and lobster mashed potatoes.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Walter's Steakhouse at 802 N. Union St. Since the early 1990s, owner John Walter Constantinou has continued the legacy of his father George's long-gone Constantinou's House of Beef.\n\n1722 N. Scott St., Wilmington; (302) 658-8625\n\nOwner August Muzzi has been standing in front of the grill at this old-school lunch counter tucked into the city's Forty Acres neighborhood since 1967.\n\nIt's a cash-only establishment, though there is an ATM machine where the old candy counter used to be. Almost nothing changes at Angelo's and that's the way Muzzi and his longtime patrons like it. The last renovation was in the early 1990s when booths replaced tables. It's open for breakfast and lunch Monday through Friday, and from 7 a.m. to noon on Saturdays. It can be tough beating the regulars to one of the 12 counter stools.\n\nWhat to order? A fried egg and meat breakfast sandwich, grilled cheese and Campbell's tomato soup, Italian sausage sandwich, root beer float, Angie's burger.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Libby's Restaurant at 227 W. Eighth St. in downtown Wilmington is sometimes called \"the 'Cheers' of food.\" Breakfast is served all day at this cash-only establishment that's been in operation since 1982.\n\n1200 N. Dupont Highway, New Castle; (302) 328-5380\n\nLou Sloan and his three brothers opened The Dog House in 1952. At that time, the four-lane highway where the Wilmington Manor eatery sits at Stahl Avenue was only two lanes with trees growing in the median.\n\nThe Sloans are no longer the owners, but split, foot-long hot dogs, cooked on a flat-top grill remain The Dog House's signature dish.\n\nCustomers still find refuge at the cash-only roadside eatery that features the same long, throwback counter with 17 stools that has been in place for 56 years.\n\nWhat to order? A foot-long dog, a cheese dog with chili, a hot dog with sauerkraut or maybe even a cheesesteak.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Deerhead Hot Dogs has been a part of Delaware's eating landscape since 1935. We sometimes hit the 620 S. Maryland Ave. site in Wilmington for a double dog with \"secret\" sauce. There's also a Deerhead Hot Dogs food truck.\n\n4866 N. Dupont Highway, Smyrna; (302) 653-4200\n\nIf you see a line at Helen's, and you will because it's such a popular place, be patient and don't leave. It moves fast.\n\nHelen's home since 1983 has been a squat, white building with bars on the outside windows. Keep an open mind if this is your first visit. Some of the best eateries don't always impress at first glance.\n\nIt's home to the quintessential Delaware breakfast. While most people assume that's scrapple, and Helen's has it, but, as the name suggests, order the sausage. It's deep-fried and it's terrific.\n\nYou can take your meal to-go or sit in the small seating area decorated with Elvis Presley memorabilia. Helen's is an early morning establishment. Really early. It opens at 4 a.m. and the staff calls it a day at noon, Mondays through Saturdays.\n\nWhat to order? Double sausage sandwich with fried peppers and onions; scrapple and egg sandwich; bone-in jumbo pork chop sandwich; home fries.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Royal Treat in Rehoboth Beach is a family-run, cash-only, seasonal breakfast and ice cream parlor that's been at 4 Wilmington Ave., near the boardwalk, for almost 30 years.\n\n2216 Pennsylvania Ave., Wilmington, 302-575-9651\n\nClubby, warm and definitely old-school Wilmington, the Columbus Inn got its current name in 1953, but its roots go back to the 18th century.\n\nOnce considered \"a men's club for the clubless,\" a longtime joke has been that more business deals were made at the Columbus Inn bar than in offices\n\nRenovations in 2010 by the Capano family, after the restaurant was closed for three years, made it much more inviting and modern.\n\nIn a nod to the past, brass nameplates on walls honor longtime customers who have died. The tavern area still has the walnut, horseshoe-shaped bar where for 65 years a congregation of regulars has rested elbows, swapped gossip and sipped cocktails and brews.\n\nWhat to order? Corn and crab chowder, the tavern burger, house-cut fries, crab cakes, the 8-ounce filet.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Jessop's Tavern in Old New Castle is housed in a structure originally built in 1674. In the 1950s, it was known as Captain’s Log Restaurant and it became The Green Frog Tavern in the 1970s. It's been Jessop's since 1996.\n\n101 N. Maryland Ave., Richardson Park, Wilmington; (302) 655-8772\n\nIndia Palace was one of the first Indian restaurants in the state when the Kumar family-run business opened in 1991 not far from the Five Points Volunteer Fire Co.\n\nIt quickly developed a loyal following due to the graciousness of Pinky Kumar, who runs the front of the house, and her husband, Sushil Kumar, who makes the delectable homemade naan in a clay tandoor oven.\n\nThere’s a small lot out front of the brick building, but parking isn’t all that easy. The decor, old-fashioned pine paneling, and a mix of tables and booths for about 50 people looks as though it hasn’t been updated since the restaurant opened.\n\nWhat to order? The buffet lunch; roti (homemade bread), bayngan bhurta (roasted eggplant), marinated sliced lamb, and tandoori mixed grill.\n\nWhat's similar to it? India Palace helped change Delaware's dining scene in 1991 and so did Toscana, Dan Butler's Trolley Square eatery which opened the same year. Butler is credited with setting a new standard for high-quality Italian restaurants.\n\n42 W. 11th St., Wilmington; (302) 594-3154\n\nNo contest: The Green Room inside of the 1913 Italian Renaissance hotel in downtown Wilmington is the most majestic dining room in the state.\n\nWhile the historic Hotel du Pont is no longer owned by the DuPont Co., it is still considered one of the most lavish hotels of America's Gilded Age.\n\nSomehow, you sit up straighter when dining at the Green Room (which, incidentally, has a crimson decor). Sunday brunch is pretty awesome and afternoon tea isn't bad.\n\nThe Green name refers to a family, not the color of the dining room. The hotel has already undergone some changes since The Buccini/Pollin Group acquired the building in 2017, and The Green Room is expected to do the same.\n\nWhat to order? Foie gras, crab cakes, any dessert and definitely the macaroons, the restaurant's signature baked treat. Go for Sunday brunch.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Dan and Missy Lickle brought fancy, but not posh, dining to Hockessin in 1980 with the opening of the Back Burner Restaurant. For a more lavish experience, go to Lickles' Krazy Kat's at The Inn at Montchanin Village.\n\nThe Deer Park Tavern\n\n108 W. Main St., Newark; (302) 369-9414\n\nDespite the legend, Edgar Allen Poe never raised a glass here. But he did lecture at the nearby Newark Academy and, as the story goes, cursed the Deer Park after he fell in the mud outside of it. Poe's \"Raven\" is the DP's mascot.\n\nAn inn, built in 1747, once stood on the ground. The Deer Park was built in 1851 and was once a hotel, and later became a restaurant and popular watering hole for University of Delaware students and local residents.\n\nThe Ashby family acquired the Deer Park in 2001 and made major renovations. The scruffiness is gone, but the Ashbys kept \"the townie bar\" and other traditions such as the Sunday Bloody Mary bar and half-price nachos on Wednesdays.\n\nWhat to order? Nachos grande, burgers, New England clam chowder, fish and chips, eggs Benedict, Bloody Marys.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Klondike Kate's, another popular UD haunt at 158 E. Main St. in Newark, offers American fare and a colorful history tracing back 281 years.\n\n59 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach; (302) 227-3674\n\nBeach eats come and go like the tide, but the Back Pork Cafe has endured for 45 seasons. This funky place, with a Key West vibe, started out as the Hotel Marvel and expanded over the years.\n\nRegulars like its laid-back elegance, three decks, regular live music and terrific cocktails. The food is upscale and the service attentive. Locals and tourists both are catered to, and it's not unusual to see a well-behaved dog by its owner's feet on one of the decks. The seasonal eatery closes in October and usually reopens by April.\n\nWhat to order? Dark and stormy cocktails, anything with wild mushrooms, grilled octopus, rabbit bolognese, coffee drinks flamed tableside.\n\nWhat's similar to it? It's probably not surprising to hear some of the Back Porch's original owners in 1981 opened the Blue Moon. The stylish, theatrical 35 Baltimore Ave. eatery is located in a 1907 Sears Craftsman house.\n\n2 Jay Drive, off Basin Road, New Castle; (302) 328-9740\n\nFew places look like the Dairy Palace anymore. It is truly like stepping back in time at this very popular, old-fashioned New Castle ice cream shack. Leave your cellphone in your pocket and soak in the \"American Graffiti\" vibe.\n\nThe seasonal business has been in operation since it was founded in 1956 by Vince and Joyce Parker.\n\nThe couple's daughter and her family are continuing the cash-only, walk-up stand that offers soft serve ice cream with curls that Beyonce would envy. Don't want ice cream (and, uh, why not?) you can also order sloppy Joes, hot dogs and chili dogs.\n\nOn a warm summer night, when the neon lights blink on spelling out \"Dairy Palace,\" it almost feels like you could run into Sandy, Danny, Kenickie and the rest of the \"Grease\" gang.\n\nWhat to order? Pretty much anything, but our preference is a chocolate, vanilla or twist soft serve cone with sprinkles.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Since 1972, three generations of the King family have run King’s Homemade Ice Cream Shops. The flagship Milton is in the oldest commercial building, circa 1830, in Sussex County. The Lewes location has served scoops since 1981.\n\n120 Four Seasons Parkway (off Del. 896), Glasgow; (302) 738-9935\n\nFamily photos decorate the walls of the restaurant that has an atmosphere as Italian as the Trevi Fountain.\n\nFrank Sinatra croons from the speakers and the aromatic smell of tomato sauce and freshly made pasta drifting through the four dining rooms can make the stomach rumble.\n\nLa Casa Pasta was founded in 1978 by Giuseppe Martuscelli who emigrated from Santa Maria di Castellabate, near Salerno, Italy. The family also owns Klondike Kate's in Newark and the Chesapeake Inn in Chesapeake City, Maryland.\n\nWhat to order? Arancini, mussels in spicy marinara sauce, vitello Giuseppe, lobster fra diavolo, bronzino, tiramisu, ricotta cheesecake.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Vincente's Restaurant has moved a few times during its 47 year history. At its 5914 Kirkwood Highway home, chef/co-owner Dan Mancari presents showstopping, tableside Caesar salads and Bananas Foster.\n\n2038 Foulk Road, Brandywine Hundred; (302) 475-1887\n\nIt's hard to believe the building, dating back to the 1920s, has been known as anything but Stanley's Tavern. Still, when the state's best-known sports bar first opened in 1935, it was called Bill's Place.\n\nFormer Browntown resident Stanley Minakowski took over in 1947 and Stanley's Tavern was born. And 71 years later, it's still going strong.\n\nManaging partner Steve Torpey has been in the house since 1982. Stanley's has long been a favored spot to watch football (Philadelphia Eagles are the house team) or pretty much any televised athletic event. Walls are lined with sports-celebrity photos. Bartenders are friendly and chatty, and the beer is ice cold.\n\nThe restaurant has wide-ranging offerings and a popular salad bar.\n\nWhat to order? Chicken wings, burgers, sandwiches, meatloaf, baby back ribs, cheese fries.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Wilmington's Kid Shelleen's Charcoal House & Saloon has been going strong since 1983. The 1801 W. 14th St. site, owned by Xavier Teixido, has continuously operated as a Wilmington restaurant since 1940.\n\n283 Front St., Leipsic; (302) 674-9724\n\nSambo's Tavern, founded by Samuel “Sambo” Burrows in 1953, sits alongside the 17-mile (or so) Leipsic River in Kent County where farms, marshlands and tidal streams converge.\n\nYou have to be at least 21 years old to enter. The establishment, run by Isaac and Elva Burrows, has a tavern license, not a restaurant license. It's also cash only, though there's an ATM machine on site.\n\nYou can call ahead and reserve a table. Try to get a window seat so you can watch watermen pull up and unload crab catches.\n\nOn summer weekends, the bar is full, pitchers of cold beer are flowing and crowds at newspaper-covered tables pick their way through batches of hot, steaming blue crabs. Visitors can go to a giant map that hangs on a wall and stick a pin on their hometown.\n\nWhat to order? Crabs, crabs, crabs. Oh, and the crab cake sandwich, French fries and potato salad.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Blue crab lovers also have been coming to Lestardo's, a relaxed crab house at Del. 273 and Prangs Lane in New Castle's Rambleton Acres Shopping Center since 1969.\n\n1406 Coastal Highway (Del. 1), Fenwick Island; (302) 539-7156\n\nBreakfast has been a tradition at Warren's Station since 1960, but if you want a Bloody Mary or mimosa, head somewhere else. The beach eatery doesn't serve alcohol. It's been that way since it was founded by turkey farmer Warren D. Johnson who then called the business Warren's Family Restaurant.\n\nJeff and Paula Mumford bought the restaurant in 1971 and have since slightly changed the name. They also remodeled and enlarged the site to resemble a replica of a United States Lifesaving Station. Other Mumford family members now work in the business that's still affable and affordable.\n\nWhat to order? Chocolate chip pancakes, Fenwick Island Beach Patrol Sandwich, roast turkey, crab imperial, Delmarvelous rotisserie chicken, any housemade pie.\n\nWhat's similar to it?The equally family-friendly Robin Hood Restaurant at 54 Rehoboth Ave. in Rehoboth has been operating in the beach town since 1968.\n\n5812 Kennett Pike, Centreville; (302) 656-9776\n\nBuckley’s Tavern is to Centreville what the Deer Park Tavern is to Newark.\n\nWhile its home is an upper-crust, affluent area, the egalitarian eatery holds a place in the hearts of Delawareans partly because its crowd has ranged from construction workers in jeans to bankers in suits. It’s been a place of character for characters.\n\nThe building, dating back to 1817, started as a private residence and became a taproom and ice store in the 1930s. Dennis Buckley ran it from 1951 until 1970. It closed for 10 months in 2012 while the restaurant's longtime owners Bob Bolling and Bob Applegate brought in new operators and renovated the historic building.\n\nThe new look keeps the spirit of the original Buckley's while maintaining the integrity of the space.\n\nWhat to order? Roasted garlic hummus, Thai noodle soup, crab Cobb salad, Buckley's burger, French dip, macaroni and cheese. Go for the Sunday pajama brunch where half-price discounts are offered to those wearing PJs.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Feby's Fishery, operating since 1974, moved from Elsmere to its Lancaster Pike location in 1984. Snapper soup is a signature offering and devoted followers like that owners Philip and MarySue DiFebo remain wedded to tradition.\n\nBy limiting the list to 20 we're sure we've neglected some eateries. Here are a few more honorable mentions: Doyle's Restaurant in Selbyville; Mr. Pasta in Holly Oak; Cosmos Diner in Wilmington; The Hearth in Odessa; and Knotty Pine in Wilmington.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.comand on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2021/11/25/jimmy-hoffa-theories/8758204002/", "title": "Theories in disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa", "text": "Roger Schneider\n\nAssociated Press\n\nThe FBI's confirmation last week that it was looking at a spot near a New Jersey landfill as the possible burial site of former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa is the latest development in a search that began when he disappeared in 1975.\n\nA number of theories have emerged about Hoffa since he was reported missing, though many of them have been tied to book releases. From serious to scurrilous, here are some of the best:\n\nFlorida swamp\n\nTheory: Hoffa was killed on the orders of alleged New Jersey mob figure Anthony \"Tony Pro\" Provenzano. His body was \"ground up in little pieces, shipped to Florida and thrown into a swamp.\"\n\nWho put it forth: Self-described mafia murderer Charles Allen, who served prison time with Hoffa and participated in the federal witness-protection program, told the story to a U.S. Senate committee in 1982.\n\nOutcome: The FBI never found enough evidence to support the claim and questions were raised about Allen trying to sell the story to make money.\n\nGiants Stadium\n\nTheory: Probably the most infamous had Hoffa buried under Section 107 of Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nWho put it forth: Self-described hit man Donald \"Tony the Greek\" Frankos in a 1989 Playboy magazine interview.\n\nOutcome: The FBI found nothing to support the claim and didn't bother to show up when the stadium was demolished in 2010.\n\n\"When that information came to our attention we batted it around, but we were all convinced in the end that this guy was not reliable,\" FBI agent Jim Kossler said then. \"We were able to prove to our mind that what he was telling us couldn't have happened because he either couldn't have been there or he was in jail at the time.\"\n\nRemembering Jimmy Hoffa 45 years after his disappearance: 5 things to know\n\nMore:Events in disappearance of former Teamsters head Jimmy Hoffa\n\nGreat Lakes\n\nTheory: Hoffa was abducted by \"either federal marshals or federal agents,\" driven to a nearby airport and dropped out of a plane, possibly into one of the Great Lakes that surround Michigan.\n\nWho put it forth: Former Hoffa aide and strong-arm Joseph Franco in the 1987 book \"Hoffa's Man.\"\n\nOutcome: Other than Franco's word, there was nothing to support his claim.\n\nA Chicago Tribune review of the book put it this way: \"Former New York Times reporter Richard Hammer, who helped Franco with the book, candidly writes in the introduction that the stories have the 'ring of truth.' Maybe, but they also reek of something else.\"\n\n'The Irishman' plot\n\nTheory: Hoffa was killed by one-time ally Frank Sheeran at a Detroit house. Key parts of the narrative became the basis for the 2019 movie \"The Irishman.\"\n\nWho put it forth: Sheeran.\n\nOutcome: Bloomfield Township police ripped up floorboards at the house in 2004, but the FBI crime lab concluded that blood found on them was not Hoffa's.\n\nMore:'The Irishman' stirs controversy over its version of what happened to Jimmy Hoffa\n\nMore:New York stands in for Detroit in 'The Irishman,' Martin Scorsese's Jimmy Hoffa epic\n\nNew Jersey junkyard\n\nTheory: New Jersey mob hit man Richard \"The Iceman\" Kuklinski killed Hoffa in Michigan, drove the body to a New Jersey junkyard, sealed it in a 50-gallon drum and set it on fire. He later dug up the body and put it in the trunk of a car that was sold as scrap metal.\n\nWho put it forth: Kuklinski, who contended in his 2006 book, \"The Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer,\" that he received $40,000 for the slaying.\n\nOutcome: The former chief of organized crime investigations for the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice told The Record of Bergen County, New Jersey, that he doubted the claim.\n\n\"They took a body from Detroit, where they have one of the biggest lakes in the world, and drove it all the way back to New Jersey? Come on,\" Bob Buccino said.\n\nBay County swimming pool\n\nTheory: Hoffa was killed and his body was buried beneath a swimming pool in Bay County’s Hampton Township.\n\nWho put it forth: Richard C. Powell, who used to live on the property and who was serving life in prison without the possibility of parole for a 1982 homicide in Saginaw County.\n\nOutcome: Police used a backhoe to demolish the pool and dig beneath it in 2003, although no trace of Hoffa was found. At one point, police brought Powell to the scene handcuffed and shackled. Then-Bay County Prosecutor Joseph K. Sheeran told the Bay City (Michigan) Times that Powell “didn’t have any connection to Hoffa at all” and that the convict just wanted a few moments of fame.\n\nRenaissance Center\n\nTheory: Hoffa's killers buried him beneath the 73-story Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit.\n\nWho put it forth: Marvin Elkind, a self-described \"chauffeur and goon for mob bosses,\" in the 2011 book \"The Weasel: A Double Life in the Mob.\"\n\nOutcome: The building, home to General Motors' headquarters, stands and the claim has never been taken seriously.\n\nOakland Twp. barn\n\nTheory: Hoffa was buried in a makeshift grave beneath a concrete slab of a barn in Oakland Township about 25 miles north of Detroit.\n\nWho put it forth: Reputed Mafia captain Tony Zerilli in the online \"Hoffa Found.\" Zerilli was in prison for organized crime when Hoffa disappeared, but he claimed he was informed about Hoffa's whereabouts after his release.\n\nOutcome: The FBI and police in 2013 spent two days digging at the site that no longer had the barn, but found nothing.\n\nJersey City landfill\n\nTheory: Hoffa's body was delivered to a Jersey City landfill in 1975, placed in a steel drum and buried about 100 yards away on state property that sits below an elevated highway.\n\nWho put it forth: Journalist Dan Moldea, who has written extensively about the Hoffa saga, as a result of interviews with Frank Cappola. Cappola, who died in 2020, says his father owned the landfill and buried the body.\n\nOutcome: To be determined. The FBI obtained a search warrant to do a site survey, which it completed last month and is analyzing the data. The agency hasn't said whether it removed anything from the site.\n\nCorrection: This story was updated to correct that Michigan's Hampton Township is in Bay County, not Oakland County.\n\n► Stay connected and stay informed.

(AP) — It is Pennsylvania Dutch country's mystery meat.\n\nCrispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, scrapple is a meaty, thrifty and filling comfort food.\n\nLove it or hate it, scrapple is a Lancaster County tradition. It was created as a way to use what was left over on butchering day and consists of pork mixed with cornmeal and pepper. Depending on where you live, you might add a little sage or buckwheat flour.\n\nYou might use venison, beef or chicken instead of pork.\n\nFor some, the love of this odd meat product can be traced to childhood. When you grow up eating scrapple, it's a comfort food wrapped in nostalgia. It's synonymous with a family breakfast.\n\n\"Without starting young, I'm not sure I could even bring myself to taste crisped, fried, mushy animal innards,\" says Judy Sandt of Lancaster Township.\n\nNot everyone is a fan.\n\nLaurie Brahl remembers her mother often serving fried scrapple for dinner because both her father and grandmother liked it.\n\n\"My brother, sister and I hated it,\" says Brahl, of Quarryville. \"We would cover it in ketchup, but there's not enough ketchup in the world to hide the taste.\"\n\nScrapple has its roots in Colonial times, when folks didn't let much go to waste. Making use of the butchering scraps would yield breakfast meat for months, writes Amy Strauss in her book \"Pennsylvania Scrapple.\"\n\nThe tradition continues today. Sixty-five percent of scrapple-lovers who responded to a LancasterOnline survey say they like scrapple for breakfast; 6 percent say they like it for dinner; 3 percent say they like it for lunch; and the rest say they will eat it all day long.\n\nWhen it comes to their favorite scrapple toppings, 22 percent say they favor maple syrup; 17 percent like ketchup; 13 percent say they eat it with syrup; and another 13 percent mention King syrup.\n\nAnd 40 percent of readers chose eggs as the best food to pair with scrapple, with 25 percent favoring potatoes.\n\nWhether fried up at deer camp or at home, scrapple is a filling meal to start the day.\n\n\"My mother would fix it for breakfast a few times a year, especially in the winter,\" says Richard Sherer, who now lives in southern California. \"I hardly ever get it. But I still can taste it and look forward to trips to Pennsylvania and the chance to have at least one helping of scrapple.\"\n\nTraditionally, butchering day on the farm happened as temperatures cooled, in November or December.\n\nJeremy Weinhold makes his own venison scrapple with friends and family a few times a year, usually starting the week before Christmas. That gives them plenty of time to bring a deer home after a day of hunting.\n\nHis father-in-law, Jody Walters, has been making scrapple for more than 20 years, and Weinhold is now part of the scrapple-making crew.\n\n\"It's pretty much an excuse for a bunch of guys that hunt to get together,\" the Ephrata man says. \"We don't see each other all year long. At that time of year, we get together in the garage and make scrapple.\"\n\nA different person hosts the event every year. They start Friday night by boiling the deer bones. Saturday morning, the crew arrives to strain, grind and mix the meat with cornmeal and flour before pouring it into pans so it can cool. They get together again in January and perhaps in March until the venison is gone.\n\nWeinhold likes to slice up his scrapple and then freeze it, making it easy to grab a few slices for breakfast all year round. He prefers the venison version over pork scrapple.\n\n\"I can definitely taste the difference,\" he says. \"You can taste the venison, and it's darker.\"\n\nOn a much larger scale, Shady Maple Farm Market makes more than half a ton of scrapple every week, says Nate Good, smoked meats manager. The scrapple is sold wholesale and in its market, as well as being served as part of its smorgasbord, where breakfast cook Cindy Brown fries 18 pieces at a time in butter on the grill.\n\n\"Marvin (Weaver, Shady Maple's founder) likes it really crisp, so you let it fry until it's nice and crispy,\" she says.\n\nOn a rainy weekday, the traffic at the smorgasbord is light enough for her to handle the scrapple one batch at a time. But on a busy Saturday, with three breakfast bars to fill, there often is one cook who is dedicated to just cooking scrapple.\n\n\"We always have pork scrapple out,\" she says.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: LNP\n\nSCRAPPLE IN DELAWARE CULTURE\n\nApple Scrapple Festival gets a nod as one of country's 'underrated tourist stops'\n\nYour Delaware bucket list: 66 things you've got to do in the First State\n\nDogfish Head bottles its scrapple beer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/09/27/fall-festival-season-southern-del-brings-sea-witch-apple-scrapple/5786503001/", "title": "Fall festival season in southern Del. brings Sea Witch, Apple Scrapple", "text": "Apples, scrapple, jazz and a sea witch are coming up on southern Delaware's fall festival menu.\n\nMany October events are returning after taking a year off due to COVID-19, with organizers refreshed and and potential festival-goers eager to get out and enjoy the cooler temperatures among friends.\n\nThose potential festival-goers include Sussex County residents (which are more numerous now than ever before) and people from throughout the mid-Atlantic who have come to look to southern Delaware for fall fun.\n\nThe Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce's Sea Witch Festival alone brings tens of thousands of people to the area and has an over $60 million economic impact, according to Chamber President and CEO Carol Everhart.\n\nNo matter the events you choose to attend, the pandemic continues, so make sure to take all applicable COVID-19 precautions wherever you go.\n\nSUSSEX:Residents protest 'uncontrolled development' in Sussex County\n\nPlanned Parenthood is returning to Sussex County.

I called the Serpe’s business office on Thursday and they yet don’t have a date for reopening.\n\nHowever, there’s a small possibility, in the future, they might do some baking at another site until the bakery is ready – “it’s possible,” said an office worker, “we have so many options on the table” – but for now, you’ll have to look elsewhere for cannoli, Frank.\n\nI was no fan of the pasty-tasting cannoli I tried a few months ago at Bella Coast Italian Kitchen & Market. (You can read more of my Dec. 31 review on delawareonline.com). A new chef has come on board – Michael O’Hare, formerly of Capers & Lemons Italian Restaurant – so maybe it’s better now. I did, however, enjoy the cannoli available at the old Black Lab Breads in Wilmington, but they closed up their city shop in October.\n\nChef Anthony’s Italian Market, 100 Ridge Road in the Old Ridge Shopping Center near Glen Mills, Pa., usually has cannoli.

She even remembers a bull getting loose once in the slaughter room.\n\nEvan Arndt remembers being as young as his mother when he first helped his grandfather in the butcher shop, which is now in Littlestown. Evan worked as a butcher and now runs the family beef jerky operation, Stoney Point Beef Jerky.\n\n“I wanted to be like my grandpa and dad,” Evan Arndt said. \"This was our life.\"\n\nMore: Become a butcher for a day and earn your chops\n\nWhile butcher shops are a dying breed in some areas of the country because of competition from grocery stores and regulations for slaughterhouses, in the Hanover area, those locally owned butcher shops that remain have adapted and persevered, mostly thanks to family tradition.\n\nNell and his wife, Naomi, purchased the current shop in Littlestown in 1980, which is now known as Stoney Point Farm Market. Michelle Arndt and her husband, Bruce, have worked there since, and now their two children carry on the tradition.\n\n\"They've grasped the vision and ran with it,\" Bruce Arndt said. \"Otherwise my wife and I would have cleaned everything up here and sold it.\"\n\nMore: Forest to table: How your deer becomes steak\n\nAccording to the 1942-43 Hanover City Directory, there were 12 meat retail stores in Hanover. In 1975, there was only one and in 2001, it was back up to four.\n\n\"It's a changing environment,\" Evan Arndt said.\n\nThe Arndts competed with grocery stores but couldn't keep up, Evan Arndt said. According to a report from the United States Department of Agriculture, 87 percent of households buy food from large grocery stores or supermarkets.\n\n\"We've had to change over the years how we do our business,\" Evan Arndt said.\n\nStoney Point changed the quality aspect, focusing on the highest grade and grass-fed and locally raised meats. Unique cuts of meat and the experience they give also sets them apart from regular grocery stores, the family said.\n\nMost grocery stores have butchers, but not all are meat cutters, which are what the butchers at Stoney Point Farm Market are called. Meat cutters are similar to butchers but have more finesse in breaking down meat into different cuts and tailoring those per individual customer requests, according to Michelle Arndt.\n\n\"I tell people all the time we are like meat surgeons,\" Michelle Arndt said.\n\nStoney Point Farm Market doesn't typically have a lot of young people looking to train as meat cutters, creating another void small butcher shops struggle to fill. But that could be changing. Right now, Stoney Point does have a crew of younger people who have picked up the art.\n\n\"We have a lot of young guys who want to learn the business,” Michelle Arndt said.\n\nOne of them is Taylor Kuhns, who has worked as butcher for Stoney Point Farm Market for two years. He previously worked for a corporate grocery store and wanted more freedom.\n\n“I wanted to shy away from the corporate world and interact with costumers more,” Kuhns said.\n\nMore: Hanover Foods featured at Pa.

Ramsburg is gearing up to open a butcher shop on his Baltimore Pike Farm, an idea that has been ten years in the making.\n\n“We very much believe (butcher shops) are making a comeback, and we want to be part of the comeback,” Ramsburg said.\n\nPart of the 10-year time period was because of a battle with township officials, who told him in 2014 that he could not operate a slaughterhouse for poultry. In August 2015, the zoning ordinance was amended after the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office found it to be in violation of the Right to Farm Act.\n\nMore:Mount Joy amends Right To Farm Act violations\n\nThe retail store is now set to open in the coming months. It will primarily sell meat, with the poultry and pork raised and slaughtered on the farm. In an effort to provide an alternative to fast food, they also will serve prepared carryout food created by chef and butcher Steve Luttrell, who was a chef in New York City for about ten years before coming to Rettland. He said all the meat and food in the shop will reflect the Pennsylvania land.\n\n“Prior to coming here I’ve cooked thousands of chickens,” Luttrell said. “But I didn’t know what went into raising them.”\n\nStoney Point Farm Market and Rettland Farm both sell to local chefs and restaurants.\n\n\"We've experienced for ten years that people want to connect with the producer of that food,\" Ramsburg said.\n\nMore: Hanover Shoe's history saved by local collector\n\nChef Andrew Little, a Hanover native who worked for the Sheppard Mansion for many years, said he values the number of butcher shops in the Hanover area.\n\n“The amount of butcher shops and the relationship I had with them is still something I think about on a weekly basis,” Little said.\n\nLittle now works in Nashville. In 2014, Pennsylvania had 347 meat market establishments and Tennessee had 56, according to a US Census Business Patterns report for meat markets.\n\n“It’s a very unique thing to central Pennsylvania to have so many them still,” Little said.\n\nSome organizations predict the services offered by butcher shops will make a comeback this year. The National Restaurant Association forecasts that the No. 1 trend in 2017 will be new cuts of meat and the No. 1 concept trend to be hyper-local sourcing.\n\n\"I have a lot of people say that the reason they come back is because we can help them figure out what the best cut of meat is, how to prepare that and where the animal came from,\" said Kristin Chrismer, the Arndts' daughter, who runs the company's location at the Markets of Hanover.\n\nThe future of butcher shops now lies in the hands of younger generations, like Kristin and Evan, who said they plan to be in the business for the long haul.\n\n“It makes me really excited to see what the future hold for us,\" Chrismer said. \"All of us together.”\n\nMore: Markets at Hanover highlight importance of small businesses\n\nUnique meats and cuts found at butcher shops\n\nScrapple\n\nAged beef\n\nHouse made sausage\n\nCowboy steak\n\nTomahawk chops\n\nTail on porterhouse\n\nPork crown roast\n\nFrenched standing rib roast\n\nBone in chuck roast\n\nBone in arm roast\n\nNavel briskets", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/maryland/2015/09/13/shorebirds-oral-history/71925408/", "title": "20 Years: The Delmarva Shorebirds", "text": "Mitchell Northam\n\ntnortham@dmg.gannett.com\n\nArthur W. Perdue founded Perdue Farms, a poultry company in 1920. That same year, he and his wife Pearl would welcome a son into their world, Franklin Parsons Perdue.​\n\nAfter a short-lived college baseball career, Frank Perdue left Salisbury State College, as it was called then, to join his dad at the company in 1939. Frank may have left school, but he did not leave his love for baseball behind.\n\nOver the next few decades, Perdue Farms grew and began to change the poultry industry. Frank had become the face of the business with his commercials in the 1970s, most of which ended with the famous slogan, “It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken.”\n\nBy the time the 1990s came around, Frank was less in love with chicken and more in love with baseball. He often attended Baltimore Orioles games, but desperately wanted a team right in his backyard in Salisbury.\n\nFrank cared about bringing a professional baseball team to the Eastern Shore just as much, if not more, than he cared about his chicken business. Frank ate, slept and breathed baseball. Without him, it is easy to say that the Delmarva Shorebirds would not exist.\n\nAt the very least, they most certainly wouldn’t be celebrating their 20th season on the Eastern Shore.\n\nJIM PERDUE, Perdue Farms’ chairman and advertising spokesman: My dad was always a lover of baseball, ever since he went to Salisbury State College. He played on the team there back in 1939. Unfortunately he didn’t have the God-given gifts to do well, so as he said, he always picked up more lumber on the bench in his britches than he did with a bat.\n\nGARY MACKES, former Wicomico County Director of Recreation and Parks:\n\nFrank Perdue loved the game of baseball. He often cited how difficult it was for residents of the Eastern Shore to attend baseball games in Baltimore. By the time local fans returned home from a night game, it would be in the early hours of the morning and they’d be faced with returning to work with limited rest. It was his vision to bring professional baseball to Salisbury.\n\nPERDUE: When the new stadium was built at Camden Yards, dad got a box there. He shared it with another company, but that other company wanted it as a place to take customers, and dad said, “Look, I’m just here to watch baseball.”\n\nPETER KIRK,majority partner of Maryland Baseball: Frank was at an Orioles game after Camden Yards had opened, and he was sitting in the luxury suite that belonged to the Maryland Stadium Authority and (Maryland) Gov. (William Donald) Schaefer was there. They started talking baseball and Frank told the governor that he would really like to have a minor league team on the Eastern Shore. Frank had made some contacts in baseball but told the governor that he was frustrated because he was unable to make anything happen.\n\nKENT BAKER, former Baltimore Sun reporter:Kirk built Frederick first. Then, at the time, they had a Double-A team in Hagerstown, and they were going to move them to Bowie, but they didn’t have a stadium. So their first season, they played at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore while that was being built. Then came the Shorebirds. The Orioles at that time were trying to move all of their affiliates closer to Baltimore.\n\nKIRK: The governor introduced us and we really hit it off and as a result Frank became part of our Maryland Baseball partnership. Very few people knew that, but in that way he learned about the business of minor league baseball and together we started putting plans together to try and bring an Orioles’ affiliate to the Eastern Shore.\n\nDOUG FLEETWOOD, former head coach of Salisbury University baseball: The thing with minor league baseball is the financial commitment that has to come from the community. It’s not like the Orioles are just building these teams and stadiums everywhere. They needed help and commitment from different people, like the Perdue Family.\n\nKIRK: Frank was definitely the one that got the ball rolling. We had not considered having a team on the Eastern Shore at the time. Frank was just way ahead of us.\n\nMACKES: Maryland Baseball was connected in the industry and they were capable of obtaining a team and putting together a good product.\n\nKIRK: Because of the teams in Frederick and Bowie, and because the Eastern Shore was not a strong enough market for a Triple-A team, that left us with two possibilities with either pursuing a New York Penn League short season team, or a South Atlantic League team. We went out and spoke with both of those leagues and the South Atlantic League team had a team in Albany, Georgia – the Albany Polecats – that was for sale and was available to be relocated.\n\nTROY MATTES, pitcher, Albany Polecats; 1995, Delmarva Shorebirds; 1996: From what I remember, we had a two-year deal with Albany and the team just didn’t draw well there at all. So after the first year, they told us the Delmarva stadium should be just about ready and, I’m not sure if they were prepared to have a team there, but they sped things up and got it ready.\n\nKIRK: We went down to Georgia and signed a contract with the owner of that franchise which had a player development contract with the Montreal Expos at that time. We went through the labyrinths of baseball approvals and Maryland Baseball was able to acquire the franchise and were able to get the approvals to move it to Wicomico County.\n\nA team was coming, Frank Perdue and Maryland Baseball just needed a stadium. On a February night in 1994, more than 600 people attended a public hearing hosted by the Wicomico County Council.\n\nMACKES: The Wicomico County Council was approached by Maryland Baseball to construct a minor league baseball stadium which would be owned by the county. The 22-member panel headed by Victor Laws III concluded that the stadium would be a viable asset to the county. The contract was extremely favorable. It wasn’t going to cost the citizens any money, thanks to the generosity of Frank Perdue.\n\nMACKES: Frank Perdue paid a substantial amount of money to build that stadium. The price tag was about $10 million and with county and state money combined we had $4.2 million. Frank came up with the rest out of his pocket, plus he gave us the 39 acres of land that was very valuable real estate because it’s at that intersection of Route 50 and the Route 13 bypass.\n\nPERDUE: I remember as a kid, there was a dirt road that came all the way back (to where the stadium is now) and there were two chicken houses out there.\n\nMACKES: The construction schedule was ambitious and met as the stadium opened 15 months later in April 1996. The stadium was financed with $2.1 million in both state and county funding. Maryland Baseball came up with the balance of the funds. The stadium cost over $10 million.\n\nIn January 1995, the Wicomico County Council halted the construction of the stadium because, due the Major League Baseball strike, Maryland Baseball was unable to obtain the Albany Polecats.\n\nMACKES: There was a little uncertainty with Major League Baseball at the time as far as what the outcome or effect was going to be on us obtaining on a minor league franchise. When you’re building something like that with public dollars, we had to be sure that we were going to be able to get a team. It didn’t really last long though.\n\nFour months later, the strike ended and Kirk and his group announced that they would have a team for the 1996 season.\n\nMACKES: We had a very protective agreement that the franchise’s use of the facility would continue and if that wouldn’t happen then Maryland Baseball was going to be responsible for paying the county back what it invested in the stadium, which was very unusual, but that’s what Frank agreed to do.\n\nAt the intersection of Route 50 and Hobbs Road, chicken houses were removed and the building of a baseball stadium had begun. Frank Perdue’s dream of having a professional baseball team on the Eastern Shore was just starting to be realized. A team was coming, but there was still work to do. Maryland Baseball had a staff to fill, a schedule to map out and a team and a stadium without a name.\n\nGAIL POTTS, Shorebirds’ accounting manager since 1996: I had on my mind that I would like to apply there and work in baseball. I recently had just left another job and I thought it would just be fun to do, so I called and found out where their office was, and found out they were looking for a bookkeeper and applied.\n\nBOB SOCCI, Shorebirds’ play-by-play voice; 1996-1998: It was an opportunity for me to go to Delmarva and establish myself and be the voice of their inaugural season. I knew that there was a solid and stable ownership there, and there was also an opportunity for me to go across the (Chesapeake Bay) and do some (Naval Academy football and basketball) games.\n\nGILL DUNN, president of the Shorebirds’ fan club: When they first started talking about putting the team in town they had a lottery system for season tickets. I was able to pick out my own seats and I got four of them right behind the dugout.\n\nPERDUE: I think the county asked dad about naming the stadium and he wanted it under his father’s name, Arthur W. Perdue. There was nothing else in the area that would really help remember his name, and dad wanted that.\n\nDICK “DOC SHOREBIRD” PASSWATER, season ticket holder: I’ve been here since Day One. We were going to be an Orioles team, so it had to be a bird. Then we’re on the Shore, so, yea, Shorebirds. And we wanted it to be regional, not anything too local, so we picked Delmarva.\n\nPERDUE: We didn’t have a say in the name of the team. It was put out to the public and they came up with a great name.\n\nKIRK: In the first season it was too late to go through the next step, which was to exchange the player development contract with the Expos for the Orioles. So the first season we were an Expos affiliate, but very few people knew that because we had Orioles colors, uniforms and the name was Shorebirds.\n\nPASSWATER: Salisbury Polecats? Don’t laugh, it could have happened.\n\nSOCCI: We were originally in temporary offices and it was not the operation that I expected it to be. New management came in including the late (former Shorebirds’ general manager) Keith Lupton. I can’t say enough about the good that Keith did those first couple of seasons to establish the right culture at the ballpark and behind the scenes and for the fans.\n\nKIRK: Starting the team, getting it going and everything, none of that would have happened without Keith Lupton. He was our go-to guy. He was the guy who made the success really happen.\n\nMATTES: We went on a road trip when the season started and as we were gone they finished some things up. The clubhouses were halfway done and the concourse was still being worked on too.\n\nKIRK: Right before the stadium opened, when all the pieces were coming together, the carousel was delivered and Keith Lupton and I walked out of the office and there was Frank Perdue, riding the carousel and sitting on the chicken. And the two of us looked at each other and tried to find a camera, but no one had one.\n\nAlthough it had a carousel that received Frank Perdue’s approval, Arthur W. Perdue Stadium wasn’t quite finished in time for the start of the Shorebirds’ inaugural season in the South Atlantic League. But after a road trip to begin the season, the stadium was good enough to get the green light for the first professional baseball game that had been played in Salisbury in many years. In front of a crowd of 5,787 people, the Shorebirds topped the Columbus Redstixx by a score of 4-2 on April 17, 1996. To start the night off, the man that made the idea of minor league baseball on the Eastern Shore become a reality threw out the first pitch.\n\nBAKER: Frank Perdue threw out the first pitch. It was a big deal.\n\nPERDUE: My dad was always a little self-conscious about baseball, so during that day he had one of the sales people bring their mitt out and they practiced throwing all day long so he made sure that it got to home-plate, which it did. He didn’t want to miss.\n\nSOCCI: The stadium was not complete. The press box was wide open, we had office dividers between the two radio teams, the windows weren’t in place yet, I was sitting on milk crates, but it was awesome because the fans were so passionate.\n\nKIRK: When the team went on the road, the contractors would scurry back and continue to work. It was actually fun because when the team came back after each road trip it was like you could see something new each time.\n\nPOTTS: We were over on Mt. Hermon Road and our offices were in townhouses. Then we moved here in July of 1996, and for each game we had to set up lights and everything for the ticket office. It was a little rough for the first few months.\n\nBAKER: That stadium was built better than Frederick and Bowie. Delmarva always struck me as a nice and tidy stadium.\n\nMO BLAKENEY, Delmarva Shorebirds outfielder; 1996: Being in the outfield and seeing all the signs was cool. The billboards were like targets during batting practice.\n\nPERDUE: I don’t know if it was supposed to be planned this way or not, but the Expos loaded that team with some unbelievable and really talented players.\n\nKIRK: The Expos, for not having a lot of money, really ran a wonderful minor league system.\n\nMATTES: Chemistry-wise it was a pretty awesome team. Everyone got along with each other.\n\nBLAKENEY: I played with Javier Vasquez and Orlando Cabrera. They were really cool guys and it was the first time I had really played with Latin players.\n\nMACKES: The thing with minor league is that, if someone is doing really well, then they’re going to get moved up, that’s the whole goal. But Frank actually went to the Montreal Expos and says, “Hey, I want you to keep my team together because we want to win the championship in our first year.” I don’t know if they listened, but that’s Frank Perdue, and for the most part, that team stayed intact there and these guys all stayed.\n\nMATTES: It was really Cabrera’s first chance to get some extended playing time. He was brought in as a backup infielder and our first couple of years playing he was sitting behind first- and second-round picks. It was fun to see him get some legitimate playing and to see the talent finally be let out.\n\nSOCCI: The team that the Expos put in Delmarva was extremely likable and extremely talented. We had Michael Barrett and Brian Schneider, who wound up having long catching careers, then Javier Vasquez and Orlando Cabrera. It was really talented team who lost in the championship series.\n\nKIRK: I remember after the very last game of the season I was sitting in the dugout with Michael Barrett and everyone had left and I was talking to Michael and he said, “This place is really wonderful. I have to figure out a way to get traded to the Orioles so I can come back here.”\n\nIn their first season, the Delmarva Shorebirds set the SAL attendance record with 315,011 fans coming to Arthur W. Perdue Stadium that year. On Sept. 1, 1996, they attracted the largest crowd of the season with 10,293 fans. Arthur W. Perdue stadium was voted as the best playing field in the SAL. Javier Vasquez led the team with 14 wins, 173 strikeouts and an earned-run-average of 2.68. He was joined on the SAL all-star team by four other Shorebirds.\n\nMATTES: The fans really embraced the players on that team. Everyone recognized you and it felt like you were a celebrity in a small town. We felt like royalty, but we were eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and riding on buses for eight to 12 hours at a time.\n\nSOCCI: The fans were really attached to that Expos team. 1996 was a tough act to follow.\n\nOn Sept. 26, 1996, the Delmarva Shorebirds officially became an affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nKIRK: After we announced we were switching it was sort of ho-hum. It was like, “Well, of course it’s becoming an Orioles’ team.”\n\nPOTTS: There wasn’t really any change in here in the front office when we went from Expos to Orioles.\n\nIt was hardly noticed by the fans and the people who worked in the stadium, but the switch from Expos to O’s had taken place. The people of Delmarva said their goodbyes to future MLB players in Orlando Cabrera, Javier Vasquez and then fan favorites like Troy Mattes and Michael Barrett. The question now was, would they be as welcoming to a new batch of players?\n\nThere was one player on that 1997 team that Delmarva essentially adopted as its own. His name was Ryan Minor and in his only season on Delmarva he helped lead the team to a league championship while hitting for an average of .307, blasting 24 home runs and notching 97 RBI’s in 134 games. Standing at 6 feet and 7 inches, he towered over third base.\n\nMinor grew up in Oklahoma and became a two-sport varsity athlete at the University of Oklahoma, starring on the diamond and the hardwood. As a junior basketball player he averaged 23 points and eight rebounds per game and earned All-American honors. On the baseball field, he was a member of the OU team that won the College World Series in 1994.\n\nMinor’s NBA draft stock fell after his senior season and he was taken in the second round by the Philadelphia 76ers. The Orioles also drafted him that summer, but not until the 33rd round.\n\nRYAN MINOR, Delmarva Shorebirds third baseman; 1997: I picked both sports to start with. I went to the NBA Summer League first and ended up playing 30 or so games in Bluefield, which was (the Orioles’) short season team at the time, and then I went to pre-season camp with the Sixers and then played a bit in the (Continental Basketball League) in Oklahoma City. Then the Orioles offered me a contract to just play baseball exclusively.\n\nCALVIN PICKERING, Delmarva Shorebirds first baseman; 1997: It was really nice here, especially coming from Bluefield, West Virginia. The year before we won the championship in Bluefield and they kind of kept that team together and moved us all to Delmarva, so we had really good chemistry.\n\nMINOR: I really didn’t know much about the Eastern Shore. Being from Oklahoma I had no idea where I was going. The stadium was just about brand new.\n\nSOCCI: I remember the first game of the 1997 season, for whatever reason, that team didn’t shower at the ballpark, they showered at the hotel. So, I get on the air for the postgame show and I walk out and I see the bus pulling away from the stadium and I’m like, “Where are they going?” Fortunately, that was the last time that happened.\n\nBAKER: (The Baltimore Sun) didn’t cover games full time, but several times a year we would come down. I was down there on Delmarva a few times a year, usually doing features and stuff like that instead of game coverage. We were interested in who might get to the big leagues, like Minor and Pickering and the big sluggers.\n\nDUNN: You had two home run hitters in Ryan and Calvin and then awesome players around them.\n\nMINOR:Calvin was a big and strong first basemen and had a great personality. He always had a smile on his face, but when the game started he was really competitive.\n\nSOCCI: Calvin Pickering never became the player that he was forecast to be but there are a lot of guys like him. Ryan Minor was really popular player on that team.\n\nPICKERING: We had Ryan and I as the one-two punch, and with the other guys around us we were very good. We had a lot of confidence coming to Delmarva after Bluefield. We had speed, power and good defense. Everyone did their part.\n\nMINOR: We ran into Bill Murray once. He was the part owner of the Charleston team down in South Carolina and we were playing a night game there. He was in the crowd hooting and hollering and was giving stuff out to the kids. He came down to us after the game and talked to us and he signed a bat for me and I gave it to my wife.\n\nSOCCI: I remember that. (Bill Murray) was on the field playing catch after the game. He was an investor to that team and after the game he hopped on to the field over on the third base side and started playing catch with the guys.\n\nRight after fans were introduced to the new team, they were introduced to a new room in Arthur W. Perdue Stadium that included decades of history.\n\nA half-century before the Shorebirds arrived on Delmarva, there was the Eastern Shore League, and through its stints of active play from 1922 to 1949, many prominent players played in the league. Guys like Frank “Home Run” Baker, Jimmie Foxx, Red Ruffing, Mickey Cochrane, Don Zimmer and Jack Sanford played for teams that stretched from Cambridge, Easton, Crisfield, Dover, Rehoboth, Milford, Pocomoke, Federalsburg and Salisbury.\n\nIn a 1996 interview with Maryland Magazine, Frank Perdue talked about how much of his love for baseball was forged during the Eastern Shore League’s 1937 season. Salisbury’s team, a Washington Senators affiliate, started that season with a 21-6 record but forfeited their wins due to using an ineligible player. But the team fought on, and climbed its way back into contention and won the league pennant that year after Joe Coleman pitched a no-hitter to close the season.\n\nThe history of baseball on the Eastern Shore was rich, but the memories of those teams and players in the forms of photos, scorecards, uniforms and other memorabilia didn’t have a home. But when Arthur W. Perdue Stadium was being built, an extra room was installed.\n\nOn May 24, 1997, the Eastern Shore Baseball Hall of Fame opened its doors for the first time.\n\nDUNN: The stadium was a great location for the Eastern Shore Baseball Hall of Fame and it was important to fans. You got to give the people who planned the stadium out credit for including that in the stadium so you could see all the older guys who played ball back in the day when baseball was really big here.\n\nMACKES: The idea was to put the Hall of Fame at the Henry S. Parker complex, but when the stadium came into fruition it was a no-brainer to move the location to the stadium. Frank included that space at no cost to the Hall of Fame. The only thing we had to do was secure a state grant for $100,000 to furnish that space and equip it. The late senator Joe Long was very involved in helping us secure that money.\n\nKIRK: As we met with the local business leaders, politicians and the baseball leagues, we found that there was a group there that had an archive of old memorabilia and when we met with them they were looking for a home. We all just decided that the natural place would be to have a room in the stadium to have that entire memorabilia to be displayed.\n\nSOCCI: The fact that they were building this museum at the stadium was unlike anything I had been a part of in the minor leagues. Other teams didn’t care about the past history of their region. It wasn’t the typical minor league experience. It helped bring back to life this great baseball history of the Eastern Shore and places like Easton and Cambridge.\n\nSTEVE “SUPERFAN” MORAN, season ticket holder: I think it was really important to have that here. It goes back into the history of baseball on the Eastern Shore and it shows people all of the guys that played here, some of which made it to the major leagues.\n\nMINOR: I know a lot of guys that have been inducted into the Hall of Fame here. It’s pretty neat to be able to walk through and see the history of some of the baseball that has been played here on the Eastern Shore.\n\nPASSWATER: They say that it’s one of the Eastern Shore’s best-kept secrets. Most people aren’t aware of it. They walk by and they say, “Well, how much does this cost?” and they figure out that it’s free and they go in and really enjoy it. There is some amazing stuff in there.\n\nFLEETWOOD, Eastern Shore Baseball Hall of Fame Inductee; 2014: If you go back into the old Eastern Shore Baseball League, you had some big dogs playing in those games. To be able to go to the stadium and walk through that is really cool. To me, that’s part of the whole experience.\n\nAs the 1997 season went on, Pickering and Minor truly became a lethal one-two punch in the middle of the lineup. With other solid players on the team like Carlos Casimiro, Luis Matos and Scott Eibey the Shorebirds were rolling towards wins, and a spot in the SAL playoffs seemed like a sure thing.\n\nPerdue always had a front row seat to all the action, often setting himself up in the press box next to Socci.\n\nPERDUE: Dad loved watching those guys and he wanted to know who was doing what, who was batting and what the stats were. That was the place to do it, to sit right next to the play-by-play man.\n\nSOCCI: Frank was really a fan. He wanted to know about different players that the Shorebirds were playing. He’d sit there with a stat sheet and drink his soda right in the press box.\n\nPERDUE: Dad didn’t need that red phone to call down to the dugout to find out something.\n\nKIRK: Frank used to call Peter Angelos at like 7 a.m. and would be saying, “The closer you gave us last night blew the game, you got to give us a new one.” He was so into the baseball aspect of things.\n\nPERDUE: Dad would go to all of the away games, which was nice, because the more he was with the Shorebirds, the less he was with the business. He wouldn’t ride with the team, but he would meet them there, especially if it was a playoff game.\n\nMINOR: I saw him around the ballpark a few times and we would occasionally see him on road trips. Frank was very interested in and involved with the ball club.\n\nPICKERING:I saw Frank a couple of times at the field and different functions. He would invite the whole team to his house for parties. He was a good guy.\n\nMINOR: Back then teams usually left players in one spot. So if you started the year out somewhere teams kept you there unless you were at the higher levels. So I stayed here the whole year and we ended up winning the championship.\n\nKIRK: We kind of really struggled through the playoffs. We had a bunch of rainouts because a big tropical storm came through.\n\nMINOR: I don’t know if it was a hurricane or what, but we missed a few doubleheaders. We played in the championship series at Greensboro, and I know we had to wait a couple of days because of the water that came through the stadium. It filled up the dugouts and took a few days to dry out.\n\nRyan Minor was named to the SAL All-Star team and led the Shorebirds in RBI’s with 97 and hits with 150. Calvin Pickering blasted 25 home runs and ended the season with a slugging percentage of .554. In front of a crowd of 1,414 in Greensboro, North Carolina, the hard-throwing Gabe Molina struck out two batters with the bases loaded in the eighth inning and the Shorebirds scored two more runs in the ninth to go on and win the game, 8-1, and their first SAL title.\n\nKIRK: That was a fantastic season. Winning a championship at any level of baseball is awesome. It doesn’t happen often. It takes a lot of hard work, but it also takes a lot of luck.\n\n1997 was a fun ride for Kirk, Perdue, Lupton and the Shorebirds. Not only had they brought baseball to the Eastern Shore, but they brought a winning product that fans enjoyed. However, the next two seasons wouldn’t be full of so many wins. Still, fans were able to enjoy the early playing days of future MLB players such as Jayson Werth.\n\nKIRK: Jayson Werth was this clean cut and skinny catcher.\n\nSOCCI: I always liked Jayson. He was a guy who was really talented. He was a catcher back then, but he was a guy who was a bit misunderstood. The impression was very contrary to what my experience was with him.\n\nDUNN: Werth had the funny stance with his knees together and feet spread out at the bottom. I thought, “How in the world can somebody hit like that?” But he did. You wondered with how fast he was and, with his height, if would stay as a catcher.\n\nSOCCI: He was trying to be a catcher, but a catcher who could run. He ran into some health issues, but he persevered. People realize now that there was a lot of substance behind his style.\n\nIn an effort to establish a fall baseball league here in the United States, Major League Baseball reached out to Kirk, Lupton and Maryland Baseball about forming a small league. There were four teams and one of them was the Delmarva Rockfish. The Maryland Fall League, as it was named, lasted just one season, and in that time the Rockfish went 21-20 while the Frederick Regiment won the league's only title. Milton Bradley, an MLB All-Star in 2008, played with the Rockfish and hit for the league’s highest average with a .330 mark. However, Bradley was suspended at the end of the year for a confrontation with umpire Matt Schaeffer.\n\nKIRK: We were approached by the commissioner’s office who had this idea of a domestic fall league. We had our fall and winter leagues outside of the country, but they wanted a domestic one. So we put together a four-team league with Delmarva, Bowie, Wilmington and Frederick, and the major league teams did a grouping, so each one of those teams had like, six major league clubs to it made up of their best young players.\n\nPOTTS: We did everything for that team too, because it was still Maryland Baseball. I did the same kind of bookkeeping for that team as I did for the Shorebirds.\n\nMINOR: I didn’t play for them because I was playing in a fall league in Arizona at the time, but my brother played on that team.\n\nKIRK: Milton Bradley had an interesting reputation. I got a call from Keith saying, “He just blew up at an umpire.” I wasn’t there, but I think he actually threw a punch.\n\nDUNN: I was here for that. Bradley was going after coaches, umpires, he just didn’t care. You didn’t know what he was going to do next.\n\nMINOR: Yea, I heard about that. He had some issues with umpires every once in a while. I actually played with Milton in Montreal when I got traded there.\n\nPOTTS: It was very cold though. One night we did a glove giveaway at the last minute. We went to all the hardware stores and bought up the gloves and gave those away so people could keep their hands warm.\n\nLike the baseball players he talked about on the radio, Socci had done his time in the minors and he was ready to move on. He continued to be the voice of the Naval Academy’s football and basketball teams for a number of years while also calling minor league games in Frederick and other areas. He is now the lead play-by-play man for the New England Patriots.\n\nSHANE GRIFFIN, Shorebirds’ play-by-play voice; 1999-2003: It was always a dream of mine to do play-by-play announcing. I put together a resume and tapes and sent them to every team in Low and High-A ball and the only call I got back was from the Shorebirds. Bob Socci was heading out and the position opened up.\n\nIn 1999, the Shorebirds not only welcomed future MLB All-Star Brian Roberts and the South Atlantic League All-Star Game to Delmarva, but it was also the year that the team’s mascot, Sherman, was hatched.\n\nKIRK: I can’t remember when we introduced Sherman, but it wasn’t initially. Keith had a theory that you didn’t do too much too quickly and that you allowed the team and the fan base to develop its own personality.\n\nDUNN: I remember the guy that was in the costume was a little daredevil. He would be on the roof of the stadium, sliding across the dugout, I don’t how he didn’t kill himself. He smashed into the railing a few times. He was a soccer player at Pocomoke.\n\nPASSWATER: The first Sherman was crazy. He was something. He would be on the roof, on the fence, he would mimic the batter on deck – that really irritated the other teams. But the fans loved him. He drove in sometimes on this three-wheel all-terrain thing. He never did anything sane, safe or sensibly. He would risk himself quite a bit for a laugh.\n\nDUNN: I don’t think he was here a full season. Roberts was one of those guys where you could see right away that he was going to be a star. They moved him up pretty quickly.\n\nKIRK: The All-Star game is always fun. We brought the league officials and front office people into town. At that time we had the highest attendance of any team in the league. It wasn’t just the game, but the host city got to run seminars and things for all of the other teams.\n\nGRIFFIN: The All-Star game that year was pretty cool. Those few days were just amazing. Boog Powell came down and I introduced him at the All-Star luncheon, which was a highlight for me.\n\nDUNN: We had started the fan club in 1998, and the front office had asked us if we would help set up for the All-Star game, so I remember being out there putting up balloons and helping out with ushers. They didn’t have a large staff. I sat next to the snack bar and was blowing up balloons all day.\n\nAfter a tough 1999 season, the Shorebirds got back to their winning ways at the turn of the century. 2000 didn’t bring any stars to Delmarva, but the team was a solid group that won more games than expected.\n\nJoe Ferguson was introduced as the manager and during his time on Delmarva he amassed a record of 211 wins and 205 losses. In 1999, then Orioles director of player development Tom Trebelhorn told the Daily Times that, “Of all our guys, Joe is probably the most rounded as a teacher and in-game management.”\n\nIn Ferguson’s first season, the Shorebirds’ earned a wild card berth into the playoffs that ended in dramatic fashion right in Arthur W. Perdue Stadium.\n\nGRIFFIN: That year was incredible because in 1999 we finished dead last. So we went worst to first. That was a special team. It wasn’t full of stars, but we had guys like Willie Harris, Matt Riordon and Napoleon Calzado who knew their role and did their job.\n\nHarris, who would go on to have a 12-year career in Major League Baseball, set the Shorebirds’ team record that season for runs scored with 106.\n\nGRIFFIN: Calzado was there pretty much the whole year and was a staple at third base. Most of those guys stayed at least 75 percent of the season at that time. Erik Bedard was a big part of that pitching staff in 2000, too. He was solid.\n\nBedard led the Shorebirds in strikeouts with 131 and finished the season with a 9-4 record.\n\nGRIFFIN: We caught fire near the end of the season. They just gelled at the right time. We just seemed to get the timely hits and the timely pitching.\n\nKIRK: That 2000 Championship was special for our fans. Except for maybe Hagerstown, the other teams really aren’t close enough for them to visit.\n\nDUNN: A strikeout on a wild pitch. Ray Cabrera was on third, he was like a cheerleader for the team, a fan favorite, and he came home and scored.\n\nPASSWATER: Mike Seestedt struck out and we had runners on first and third. The ball went past the catcher and Mike just stood there, so everyone is yelling, “Run Mike! Run!” And finally he takes off, and he would’ve been out, but the first basemen came up to cover the catcher. By the time the second basemen came over, Mike, who wasn’t the fastest guy in the world, had already gotten to first. Game over, we won the championship.\n\nKIRK: To win the championship at home was extra special.\n\nPeter Kirk and Maryland Baseball had been in Delmarva for five years. By teaming with Frank Perdue, they brought professional baseball to a region that longed for a team of its own for some time. But everyone has a price.\n\nPERDUE: My dad continued to have a close relationship with (Kirk and Lupton) at Maryland Baseball for a number of years until he felt it was time to get out of the business side of it. But he still continued to come here and go to the games, so much that they named the press box after him.\n\nKIRK: Comcast had owned a basketball team and a hockey team already and they really wanted to get into baseball. They came to us and made us an offer that we could not refuse. They bought the three teams in Delmarva, Frederick and Bowie in a package.\n\nGRIFFIN: It was a pretty seamless change. I remember Frank Miceli (Comcast Vice President of Minor League Operations) coming in and sitting us down behind home plate and just telling us that they were going to continue with the way things have gone, but that they were going to make a few changes to try and be a bit more profitable and bring better shows to the fans.\n\nPOTTS: It was a bigger organization, but I didn’t notice much of a difference.\n\nGRIFFIN: There were obviously some other changes that I wasn’t aware of that was above my paygrade. But the day-to-day things for me didn’t really change.\n\nFLEETWOOD: When Comcast came in it was really more business oriented. It really wasn’t as much focused on the community, at least I didn’t think so.\n\nDUNN: The Maryland Baseball guys were pretty nice people. Comcast didn’t really have a big interest in it being a baseball team. I think a lot of people felt the same way and that it was just another thing to own and if we lost money they didn’t care. They really didn’t take care of the stadium and the attendance and services dipped down, too.\n\nComcast’s reign over the Shorebirds didn’t bring many star players on Delmarva, or many winning seasons. But, future Oriole and Atlanta Brave Nick Markakis spent some time in Salisbury in 2004, playing in 96 games and hitting for an average of .299.\n\nPASSWATER: Nick actually used to be a pitcher. He had a 90-mile-per-hour heater with some good control. So that’s why he had that great arm from right field. When they drafted him, the question was should we develop him as a pitcher or an outfielder?\n\nWALT McCABE, season ticket holder: You could see who wasn’t going to be here very long and Markakis was one of those guys. He was really good here and then he went on to play in the Olympics that year for Greece.\n\nSalisbury native Randy Scott took over as the play-by-play man in 2005 and as he tells it, the Shorebirds didn’t have many names on their roster that stuck out over the next few seasons, but they often played teams with future MLB all-stars.\n\nRANDY SCOTT, Shorebirds play-by-play voice; 2005-2009: The 2005 team was full of guys who didn’t really have a chance, but were solid together at that level. I think the Orioles’ minor league system was a lot different then. They picked up players to have decent minor league teams, just to fill rosters, but weren’t really guys who they had planned on being the future of the Orioles. I think that quickly changed the next year. In 2006 it seemed like they were drafting with a little bit more of a purpose and they were changing their philosophy. They started to actually build the minor league system because the Orioles weren’t doing very well.\n\nThe 2005 Shorebirds won 72 games. Jason Fransz led the team in hitting with a batting average of .308, 22 home runs and 111 RBI’s. Erik Bedard did a rehab stint in Delmarva, pitching five innings and striking out nine batters in a win.\n\nSCOTT: Andrew McCutchen was great. He came to Delmarva in 2006. He was coming up with the Hickory Crawdads. You could tell right away that he was a talent.\n\nAt 19 years old, McCutchen played in 114 games with the Crawdads, who were a Pittsburgh Pirates affiliate in 2006. McCutchen hit 14 home runs, stole 22 bases, notched 62 RBI’s and batted for an average of .291. Playing in three games at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium that season, he notched five hits and stole a base. Current Oriole Steve Pearce also played for the Crawdads in 2006.\n\nSCOTT: There were some decent Shorebirds during that time that made it up. Brandon Snider had a cup of tea in the bigs. Pedro Florimon had a walk off hit (on Aug. 18, 2015) for the Pirates the other night. He’s a guy that was good.\n\nPedro Florimon played in 192 games for the Shorebirds between the 2007 and 2008 seasons. Snider played in 156 games for the Shorebirds between the 2006 and 2007 seasons and hit 14 home runs, drew 53 walks and knocked in 78 runs in that time.\n\nDuring Scott’s time as a broadcaster for the Shorebirds was also when Steve Moran became “Superfan” as the season ticket holder became notorious for hanging glasses on the net behind home plate after bad calls from the umpires.\n\nMORAN: I hang glasses up here behind home plate when there is a bad call. I started doing that probably around, 2007. I have 13 pairs of glasses that I bring with me. There’s a guy in West Virginia that throws toast in the air when a pitcher strikes someone out, and I hang glasses for bad calls from the umpire. There’s this book on the various minor league teams, and when you get to the Shorebirds’ page it says other than Sherman, you have to check out the Superfan, and that’s me. It was something fun to do.\n\nAfter owning the Shorebirds for a few seasons, Comcast was ready to sell. In November 2006, 7th Inning Stretch LLC purchased the Delmarva Shorebirds and has owned them since. To many of the staff members and fans, the switch in owners and general manager was noticed right away. 7th Inning Stretch made the impression on Delmarva that they cared about the team, the fans and the community.\n\nThe face of their efforts was Chris Bitters, a California native who has been the team’s general manager since 2006.Under the direction of Bitters, the Shorebirds saw attendance increase, a new stadium sound system installed, a kids play area expansion, an upgraded parking lot, playing surface, stadium structures and new logos were introduced in addition to 7th Inning Stretch playing a big role in hosting numerous baseball and non-baseball events at the stadium for the community.\n\nCHRIS BITTERS, Shorebirds’ general manager since 2006: I came here in the fall of 2006 and you could tell that it was a team that the community was passionate about.\n\nFLEETWOOD: When Chris Bitters and his people came in it got back to that family thing like what it was before under Maryland Baseball.\n\nSCOTT: There was definitely a change of the guard in philosophy, because it was more than just a general manager change – there was an ownership change, too.\n\nDUNN: When Chris came in it went in the complete other way of where Comcast was. The attendance started to go up again. I think he does a great job. They take care of the fans the best that they can.\n\nBITTERS: I was a “come here” and I’m about as far as you can come, but I knew the team was embraced by the community and my job was to really ramp that up and I think we have done a really good job over my nine years of engaging the community even more.\n\nSCOTT: It was just more focused on the team and not the owners and management. Chris really emphasized that it was going to be about the team and the community. Our fans don’t care who own the team.\n\nFLEETWOOD: In my opinion, this community is very fortunate to have Chris Bitters and Ryan Minor around. It’s not all about the team. They really care about the community. He and Ryan Minor have been the faces of the team since they got here.\n\nMACKES: We’ve gone through three owners of the franchise, and I got to say, Maryland Baseball was very good, but the people we have right now in 7th Inning Stretch is just as good.\n\nBITTERS: There was one night where I was watching the game and I was standing behind home plate. Sherman used to ride around and toss candy into the stands and there was this dad, probably about my age, and his daughter, probably 4 or 5 or so, sitting behind the net behind home plate. And Sherman is riding around, but he can’t throw the candy way up over the net, so the little girl gets upset and starts crying. So I radio over to whoever was with Sherman and told them to bring a big handful of candy. So Sherman walks up to the little girl and dumps a pile of candy into her lap. Those kinds of experiences are what I enjoy most.\n\nArthur W. Perdue Stadium has played host to several events in its 20-year history. Artists like Kenny Chesney, the Blues Brothers, Martina McBride, Montgomery Gentry and Lynard Skynard have performed concerts there. It has been a host for baseball events like the Bayside Conference High School Championship, the Bi-State rivalry – a slate of games played between Maryland and Delaware high school baseball teams – and the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Baseball tournament, among other events.\n\nBITTERS: We were involved on the ground level when the county first got involved with bringing USSSA here in 2007. It was like 60 or 80 teams and we thought bringing that many teams to Wicomico was a big deal and then it doubled the next year and we started hosting the opening ceremonies here at the ballpark.\n\nPERDUE: This stadium has been a great venue for other things too. Softball, concerts, boxing, anything.\n\nBut the one night at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium that many people remember vividly wasn’t a baseball game or a concert. It was a boxing match. More than 5,000 people flooded the diamond to get close to the ring where Parkside-high product Fernando Guerrero earned the NABO Interim Middleweight title on an October night in 2009 with an impressive 10 round majority decision over Ossie Duran.\n\nHAL CHERNOFF, boxing trainer: We got a lot of feedback from the community that, as nice as it was to do the fights at the Civic Center, people wanted to be able to drink an alcoholic beverage during the event. The people at the Shorebirds’ stadium were very easy to work with and it just made sense to give it a try.\n\nBITTERS: It was during the two-year run where he did a lot fights locally.\n\nFERNANDO GUERRERO, professional boxer, Salisbury native: It just made sense to have it there. The stadium is massive and families go there so much that it was just a no-brainer.\n\nSCOTT: His fights were always big inside the Civic Center, but you expected that. This just had a cool and different feel because it was outside on this baseball diamond.\n\nPOTTS: I didn’t really go outside much for the fight. I was in the office mostly dealing with the boxing people. It was exciting, though. Just something different.\n\nSCOTT: We were able to cover that for what used to be 95.9 The Sports Animal. The crowd was wild, it was a fun night.\n\nBRET LASKY, Shorebirds’ play-by-play voice; 2009-2013: It was pretty interesting. Chris and the team were trying to grow the events outside of baseball and Guerrero was a big name in Salisbury and it was cool to bring something else to the ballpark.\n\nBITTERS: The boxing ring was right on top of the pitcher’s mound and we had seats right on the field. It was really cool.\n\nSCOTT: They had to deal with some moisture on the mat, so there were definitely some variables that they weren’t used to.\n\nCHERNOFF: When the dew started to settle on the mat it became very slick and it was causing a problem. It certainly caused Fernando to make an adjustment. Can you imagine holding a boxing match on a frozen pond? That’s basically what we had. Everything turned into a delicate process of trying to fight without slipping.\n\nGUERRERO: I went to throw a punch and I slipped and they called it a knockdown. My legs just got tangled up because it was so slippery.\n\nCHERNOFF: It was colder there than any indoor venue in the country would have been. Ossie’s corner was putting a ton of water on him, so much that the commission threatened to stop the fight if they put any more water on him because it got to the point where they were dumping water on him to make the condition of the mat even worse. When they saw Fernando slip, they started going with that. Ossie would position himself on the canvas of the mat that wasn’t painted and Fernando was on ice.\n\nSCOTT: I remember the lighting being a bit of issue, too, but the atmosphere was electric. Fernando was a hot prospect then and the community was really behind him.\n\nGUERRERO: It was the first time I fought for a title and it was outdoors and the whole experience was awesome. It was like my Muhammad Ali “Thrilla in Manilla” moment.\n\nCHERNOFF: We pulled it off and got a win. People really enjoyed watching a fight there.\n\nLASKY: For me, it was cool to learn how baseball teams generate revenue outside of baseball. Before I came to the Shorebirds I just knew broadcasting and a little bit about media relations. Then all of a sudden I was learning how to run non-baseball events. It wasn’t just about the 60 or 70 home games.\n\nGUERRERO: Winning there kind of made me feel like I was a part of the baseball team. The Shorebirds have always been big for me. That’s the team I rooted for growing up. A couple of players were at the fight. Then after all that we did the Guerrero “Bobble Gloves” night. I have a lot of good memories in that stadium. Of course, you can never forget their fireworks.\n\nAcross the country there are towns that have a minor league baseball team and a collegiate baseball team. Often, those two teams will play against each other in an exhibition game. But for the first 14 years of its existence, two teams that shared significant bonds to Frank Perdue - the Delmarva Shorebirds and the Salisbury University Sea Gulls - never shared the same field.\n\nThat changed in 2010, when the efforts of Bitters, Ryan Minor and Doug Fleetwood paid off.\n\nFLEETWOOD: Ryan Minor always wanted to do it because they don’t play under the lights in spring training.\n\nMINOR: The front office had been asking the Orioles to do it for years, and they finally gave them the ok to do it.\n\nBITTERS: That was something that we had wanted to do since I got here in 2007 and it just took a little while to get it lined up between the Orioles and Salisbury and Coach Fleetwood.\n\nDUNN: You get a lot of students out for that game, almost half the crowd, which is great. They’re here for most of the spring season so you love to see them out there.\n\nBITTERS: Every minor league team I have worked with likes to do that, to have an exhibition against a local college. Its great exposure for the college guys and it’s great for the community to see two local teams. It’s really a community event.\n\nFLEETWOOD: He told me one year that he had a couple of guys from the Dominican Republic that had never played under the lights.\n\nMINOR: It gives us a chance to acclimate to the environment. It’s a bit colder up here than it is down in Florida after spring training.\n\nFLEETWOOD: They kind of played by our rules. I remember the first year doing it, Ryan Minor and I were standing at home plate with the umpires before the game and we were talking about collision plays at second base, because in college you can’t hit the guy and in the pros you can knock them into left field, and Ryan said they would back off. They went out of their way to make it work. Now, we do play by their rules with the bats. Our kids play with wooden bats in the summer anyways, so it wasn’t a big deal.\n\nBITTERS: For us as an operation it’s kind of a warm-up, so when we had around 3,000 people show up that first year we did it we were completely stunned. The community really embraces that game.\n\nThe 2011 team might have been the most fun team the Shorebirds ever had. That season, with Ryan Minor as the skipper, the Delmarva Shorebirds had two future Orioles in Manny Machado and Jonathon Schoop sharing a middle infield and playing in Salisbury.\n\nThe two players are very close friends now who share a unique handshake that was birthed in the dugout at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium. Machado was the number two overall pick from the previous season’s MLB draft, but while fans bought their tickets and poured into Arthur W. Perdue Stadium to see him play, they couldn’t ignore Schoop either.\n\nIn a short time, both players would bulldoze their way through the minors and make themselves into vital cornerstones for the Baltimore Orioles.But anyone from the Eastern Shore will be quick to remind others that, with Machado and Schoop, it all started in Salisbury.\n\nJONATHON SCHOOP, Delmarva Shorebirds infielder; 2011: The year before I came to Delmarva they said I was going to be playing shortstop, but then they drafted Manny.\n\nMANNY MACHADO, Delmarva Shorebirds shortstop; 2011: (Schoop and I) met at spring training. We were both out there catching grounders at shortstop, so we had time to chat and get to know each other.\n\nBITTERS: That was an awesome season.\n\nLASKY: We got a lot of requests from the local and national media for him and Manny was fantastic with all of them. It was just cool to ride the bus with him and be a small part in his early development. I think everyone knew that he was a special kid and that he was going to be a star.\n\nMACHADO: I wasn’t sure if I was going to Delmarva. I got drafted and went to rookie league and then I wasn’t sure if it would be Delmarva or Frederick.\n\nFLEETWOOD: The year Machado was here he didn’t play against us. I think the Orioles said, “Oh no. Don’t let him get around those college guys. They might stumble into him or something.”\n\nDUNN: Everyone knew about Manny, so his first game everyone came out and you could already see that this kid was the real deal. He was something special.\n\nMACHADO: Delmarva was fun. We got a pretty decent crowd most nights. It was a great first experience in professional baseball.\n\nDUNN: Jonathon Schoop was at second and Manny was at shortstop and you could just see that those guys were special.\n\nMATTES: It was just fun watching those guys. You look at that middle infield and there is Schoop and Machado. Within the next two years, there in Baltimore. The same year they were in Delmarva, you had Jurickson Profar playing in Hickory and Bryce Harper in Hagerstown. It was an awesome year for the league.\n\nMINOR, Delmarva Shorebirds’ manager; 2010-2012, 2014-present: Manny had a great work ethic at such a young age and it was impressive to see him handle the spotlight and the media pressure at just 18 years old.\n\nSCHOOP: Ryan Minor was a really good manager. He let you play the game. He just let you be you. He was big for me because that was my first full season.\n\nMACHADO: He wants you to play the game, but to be yourself. Ryan Minor taught me how to be a professional.\n\nBITTERS: Machado had a lot of hype around him, but not quite as much as Harper because he was the number one overall pick. But Machado was awesome. He’s a great guy and was really willing to do whatever we wanted.\n\nLASKY: I just remember Manny being a guy that everybody liked. He was everybody’s best friend. I’m sure sometimes I was a pain in his rear, but he helped me with whatever I needed.\n\nDUNN: I always like the way he carried himself and the way he played. He didn’t have a big ego. Which was nice, because Bryce Harper was playing for Hagerstown that same year and he was the opposite.\n\nMINOR: Manny was so good in a lot of different ways. He was swinging the bat well and we were playing here on a Saturday night once and it was packed. He had a 3-0 count and I gave him the green light. Usually you don’t swing on 3-0 but he was hitting so well so I let him swing away and he hit it over the scoreboard here. In this ballpark, that’s tough. You don’t see that very often.\n\nMORAN: When Machado hit one over that scoreboard? Man, that was incredible. Even Calvin Pickering never hit a ball that far. It went right over the CareFirst sign.\n\nMACHADO: That was one of the best games of my career. I was swinging the bat well, I had a hot week, and he gave me the green light. That’s the first time I’ve ever swung 3-0 and I think that’s one of the hardest balls I’ve ever hit.\n\nLASKY: That was the one. I think I still have that radio call. When that happened Steve Melewski from MASN asked me for the call and put it up on his blog. That’s a moment I’ll never forget. He just absolutely crushed the ball. It sailed over the scoreboard. I’ve never seen anybody hit a ball that hard in my life and I’ve watched a lot of baseball games. That was by far the farthest ball I’ve ever seen anybody hit.\n\nPASSWATER: When Manny was injured and Schoop got his opportunity, there were some of us who were under the impression that Schoop was a better shortstop than Manny while the two were here.\n\nMINOR: He started playing third base and played some second base as well, but when Manny got hurt Jon did play shortstop before he moved up. He was just one of those guys that could play anywhere on the infield and he has a really high baseball I.Q.\n\nLASKY: Jonathon was a heck of a kid. I really liked being around him. He had a young personality and was always joking around. You knew he was going to be a star. He was amazing at third base and then they shifted him around everywhere. His arm was incredible.\n\nSCHOOP: I was a little nervous at first to move to third, but Minor and my teammates helped me out. We had a great team that year.\n\nMACHADO: Did the handshake start there? I think it did. I don’t think it was as defined then as it is now. We started doing it after double plays.\n\nPASSWATER: That was quite a year. Those two became really close friends here.\n\nIn addition to having a roster that featured Machado and Schoop, it was also the year that the Shorebirds would host the South Atlantic League All-Star Game. They hadn’t done so since 1999 and a lot changed in years since. Bitters and his staff started planning a year away and teamed with an old friend, Perdue Farms, to sponsor the event.Perdue Farms, the Shorebirds and other SAL Teams raised over 250,000 meal equivalents for local food banks. Fans engulfed Arthur W. Perdue Stadium for the game and autograph sessions featuring SAL All-Stars Machado and Bryce Harper, and also Orioles’ legends like Earl Weaver.\n\nBITTERS: With Bryce Harper and Manny Machado I think we had one of the coolest All-Star games ever here. There are quite a few guys that played in that game that are in the big leagues now. It was kind of weird that Schoop didn’t make the all-star team, but he was great for us.\n\nLASKY: It was just a really long process. We started probably a year before and we never stopped. Even a year out, we were having weekly meetings about this all-star game.\n\nDUNN: We helped with some of the decorations before, but Chris was like, “I’m not going to use you guys during the game because you guys are the fans and you deserve to watch the game.” That’s one thing about Chris, he knows we’re fans first and he looks out for us.\n\nBITTERS: It was a big crowd and we had great events surrounding it. We were really able to showcase the community during that run. I think we did Delmarva proud that night.\n\nMACHADO: That weekend was fun. It was my first career all-star game. To start your career off with an all-star game in the town you’re playing for was a great experience.\n\nLASKY: I remember standing by Manny and Bryce Harper and those guys and the line was from the visitor’s club house all the way down to where cars come in so fans could get an autograph from these guys. When I was standing by Bryce there was this one lady who brought up four or five different items, but we had to limit the items just to move the line along.\n\nBITTERS: I always felt like the fans and the media were bashing (Harper) pretty hard, but every interaction I had with him was great. He signed autographs before our games here and after the games he would sign for like a half hour. It still wasn’t enough for the fans, apparently. From my perspective, the criticism of him wasn’t warranted.\n\nSCOTT: Bryce Harper wasn’t the nicest guy off the field with the media, but he had an appreciation for the fans.\n\nBITTERS: We had Earl Weaver here signing autographs here. The line was from the center concourse all the way to the right field foul pole.\n\nLASKY: I was walking Earl from the concourse over to Scott Abraham for a live shot that night and it had to be at a certain time. So we’re walking through and some fan comes up to Earl and it was very crowded and the fan says something like, “Hey Earl, sorry to bother you,” and in typical Earl-fashion he says, “Well then don’t bother me.” And he didn’t mean it in a bad way, but it just personified him. He ended up signing the autograph for the lady anyway. I didn’t grow up an Orioles fan, so I didn’t realize how much people adored him. So that was cool to see.\n\nBITTERS: I always joke that the first professional all-star game that Manny Machado and Bryce Harper played together in was right here in Salisbury.\n\nMachado, Schoop, Harper and the SAL All Star Game were all in Delmarva in one season. But, 2011 wasn’t over just yet for the Shorebirds. What way could they make that season better?\n\nBitters and his staff came up with the most Eastern Shore promotion night that one could think of.\n\nOn Aug. 12, 2011, the Shorebirds hosted a salute to scrapple.\n\nBITTERS: We made these t-shirts and they were similar to the “I HEART NY” shirts, except we replaced NY with a picture of scrapple. We bought the shirts for the staff just to wear, but the fans loved them. One guy came up to me and was like, “I’ll give you $40 for the shirt off your back, right now.” I wish I would’ve bought thousands of them to give away in the gift shop.\n\nSCOTT: I love scrapple. I still have the t-shirt.\n\nMINOR: I do like scrapple. I had no idea what it was until my wife introduced me to it when I first moved here, but living here since 1997 I’m real familiar with scrapple. I remember the eating contest and all of that here.\n\nBITTERS: We did a salute to scrapple right before the start of the game. Everyone had a toothpick with a little piece on it and that was the unofficial world record for the most people eating scrapple in one place at one time.\n\nPASSWATER: They had a scrapple-carving contest and fans would vote on scrapple sculptures. You got free scrapple too, it was delicious. I went back two or three times.\n\nMcCABE: That’s a local thing. I’m a “come here” and we don’t eat scrapple, with all due respect.\n\n2011 was going to be a tough act to follow. Machado and Schoop had moved on by then, but the Shorebirds and their fans had to brace themselves for another player with star power. His name was Dylan Bundy and he was a pitcher taken by the Orioles with the fourth overall pick in the 2011 MLB draft. Play-by-play man Brett Lasky described the nights that Bundy pitched in Salisbury as “an event.” People who usually didn’t come to Arthur W. Perdue Stadium were coming out just to see Bundy take the mound.\n\nIn eight starts for the Shorebirds, Bundy pitched 30 innings before the Orioles promoted him to Frederick. He registered one win, struck out 40 batters, gave up just five hits and left Delmarva with an earned-run-average of zero.\n\nMATTES: On any given pitch, Bundy could hit 100 miles an hour. He had unbelievable control for how old he was.\n\nLASKY: His 30 innings here were ridiculous. He was dominating everybody.\n\nDUNN: Once the word got out about Bundy and people knew who he was, every game he pitched those nights were very well attended. He was awesome.\n\nMcCABE: Bundy didn’t play a whole lot. He was only 18, so they would pitch him for a few innings, then take him to the dugout and throw a jacket on him.\n\nMINOR: That was the thing with Dylan. He was on an innings limit to start the year.\n\nPASSWATER: A few games of three innings and a few games of four innings and then he was off to Frederick. He was electric.\n\nMORAN: They had guys sitting right here next to me (behind home plate) counting pitches for Bundy to make sure he didn’t go over his limit.\n\nMINOR: He had that hitless and scoreless streak going on for a long time. Dylan dominated here. He had an above average fastball and his breaking ball was advanced.\n\nLASKY: Every time Dylan pitched I knew that more people were listening. It was a big deal when he was pitching. It just felt more important.\n\nMcCABE: Whenever Bundy pitched it was “Bun-day” night. Chris Bitters liked when he pitched because we were selling more tickets and more hot dogs.\n\nOn Sept. 2, the Shorebirds concluded 20 years at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium with a 7-1 victory over the Hickory Crawdads. The win capped off a five-game home sweep of the Crawdads for the Shorebirds and they moved to 69-64 on the year. Matt Grimes struck out two batters and secured his 10th win of the season. The night was highlighted by Steve Wilkerson’s three-run homer. Doug Newton, who took over for Brett Lasky after the 2013 season as the lead play-by-play voice of the Shorebirds, called the game on Fox Sports 960 and after the final out, he topped it off with his trademark call.\n\n“Goodnight, Irene!”\n\n20 years of minor league baseball in Delmarva had come and gone.\n\nFor the first time in many years, the Shorebirds will receive major updates to their home, beginning this offseason. The first order of business will be to upgrade the playing surface, then a new video board will be installed and the concourse will be extended in addition to a flurry of other upgrades. Arthur W. Perdue Stadium has, and will continue to, serve as a great venue for professional baseball. 10 years after his death, it is safe to say that Frank Perdue’s dream has been realized. Eastern Shore folk don’t have to go to Baltimore or Washington to see good baseball.\n\nBITTERS: Frank Perdue’s original vision was that, on a Thursday night you didn’t have to make the drive all the way to Camden Yards to see professional baseball, you can do it right here in your backyard, have a good time and still get to work the next day.\n\nPERDUE: At this point, I’m a fan. I don’t have the total passion that my dad had, but I try to get out here a few times a year. I don’t sit in the press box like he did.\n\nMACKES: Before Frank died, he called me on my cell phone and he was perplexed. He asked me a question and he said to me, “Gary, can the county ever change the name of the stadium?” And in the agreement, the county council and the executive hold that authority where they could do that. The only thing I could say to Frank was, “I don’t feel that this community will ever do that to you and your name knowing that this facility and this sport mean so much to you.” Frank loved baseball, but more importantly, he didn’t want his employees and the people of Delmarva to have to drive to Baltimore if they loved baseball and wanted to enjoy the game. This is something that he really wanted to give to this community.\n\ntnortham@dmg.gannett.com\n\n410-845-4643\n\nOn Twitter @primetimeMitch", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2020/08/25/new-jersey-restaurants-tired-takeout-try-these-great-brunch-options/5444871002/", "title": "New Jersey restaurants: Tired of takeout?

Here are some of the most interesting breakfast takeout options in New Jersey:\n\n4 Brothers Breakfast, Warren\n\nA getaway to the South probably isn't in the cards right now. But thanks to 4 Brothers Breakfast in Warren, you can still pick up down-home Southern fare, made-to-order and prepared from homemade recipes from the four co-owners' grandmother in Alabama.\n\nYou can't miss the chicken and waffles, which include a buttermilk waffle and three pieces of fried chicken.

There are old favorites, meal bundles, and tons of Instagram-worthy specials available for curbside pickup or dining outdoors.\n\nComing up:'Top Chef' participant and celebrity chef Viviani helps bring Chuck Lager America's Tavern to SJ\n\nRecently, the restaurant began offering to go-only brunch options on Sundays. Plan to order ahead for Sunday morning curbside pickup.\n\nCustomers can expect a rotating offering of bloodies, breakfast sandwiches, egg dishes, seasonal salads, doughnuts, Pop Tart-style handpies and other pastries.\n\nGo: 1442 Route 70 West, Cherry Hill. 856-356-2282; fandftavern.com\n\nKitchen 87, Mount Holly\n\nThey call it a “new spin on an old staple” that’s made from scratch daily for breakfast and lunch.\n\nOpen from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. every day but Monday, the chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits – two of their well known items – give you that seriously down home flavor and feel.\n\nThey’re not afraid to try different, things. One recent morning, they offered the “pig stack”, which is two of their pancakes with pulled pork cooked in them served with a side of bourbon barrel aged syrup from the nearby Train Wreck Distillery.\n\nHow about orange dreamsicle-stuffed French toast or confetti cheesecake stuffed French toast or breakfast egg rolls?\n\nKitchen87 opened in 2014 after a longtime local restaurant George’s closed at the same location.\n\nHusband and wife team Melo and Michael Smith are the owners, the latter is also the chef who \"wanted this restaurant to truly feel more like someone’s kitchen where people gather and linger and connect.”\n\nGO: 87 Washington Street, Mount Holly, 609-261-1700; kitchen87.com.\n\nMacona BBQ, Collingswood\n\nCan't travel? Don't fret.\n\nYou only have to get as far as Collingswood to take a trip around the world.\n\nThere, Chef Cory Reuss has the next best thing to post-pandemic passport, and it all comes out of his smokehouse just behind his Haddon Avenue barbecue joint.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, Macona offered breakfast once a week — on Wednesdays — and the experience was always inspired by a different part of the globe.\n\nThe pressures of pivoting to an all-takeout business and working with a smaller crew have put an end to those breakfasts for the moment (follow the restaurant on Instagram because they will be back), but that doesn't mean you can't get in on the fun. Reuss plans to offer breakfast for lunch and dinner, available as takeout, starting now.\n\nThink scrapple and buttermilk dulce de leche donuts; Taiwanese-citrus brick toast; shrimp and grits with furikake, red-eye dashi and pickled tomatoes; or quinoa donburi with smoked beef larb, tomato-long hot jam, wakame and nori\n\nYou don't need a suitcase but you will likely learn a few things on these culinary adventures..\n\nGo: 577 Haddon Ave, Collingswood.

The trio of restaurants currently serve nearly a dozen varieties – pared down from their usual 20 – that start with buttery challah bread. From there, take your pick of Churro French toast, which is coated in cinnamon sugar and topped with cream cheese glaze ($11); Bananas Foster with rum sauce, bananas and pecans ($12); and the Fraffle, which is French toast that's been crisped in a waffle maker ($10.50).\n\nFor something spicy, try the Dark & Stormy, a dish of pork roll hash beneath over-easy eggs, peppers, crispy onions, tomatoes and horseradish sauce ($11).\n\nGo: 1383 Route 35 in Middletown, 732-856-9499; 1825 Route 35 in Wall, 732-359-8544; and 56 Chambersbridge Road in Brick, 856-473-3733; meemoms.com.\n\nMissy’s Main Street Cafe, Randolph\n\nMissy Addison closed her popular breakfast-and-lunch spot when COVID-19 hit for two months. She opened her eponymous café on June 3rd – and today she’s doing about as well with takeout/delivery and outdoor dining as she did when her funky spot was fully opened.\n\nIf you’ve got a dog who loathes being left behind, no worries: Bring him or her to this dog-friendly restaurant where your pooch can lap up burgers, chicken and even doggie ice cream.\n\nAs for us humans, Addison has introduced two dishes including the Fleeky’s Huevos Rad-Cheros, a spin on the traditional Mexican dish, that features fried tortillas topped with creamy white bean puree, sunny side-up eggs, chorizo, pico de galo and queso fresco served with a side of sour cream and guacamole (“yes, it’s big,” she said).\n\nThe other, called The Yas, Queen…Yaasss! (the name is an homage to Rupaul’s Drag Race show) that features two sunny-side eggs on top of a slice of toasted rye bread with creamy ricotta and crumbled crispy bacon.\n\nYou can breakfast at noon and lunch at 8 a.m. here. And as much coffee as your nervous system can tolerate: refills are free. Closed Mondays. Open from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nGo: 181 E Main St.,Rockaway; 973-625-0552; missysmainstreetcafe.com\n\nPlated by D, Ridgewood\n\nWhen making her Brunch Board, Dylan Elias, owner of Plated by D, asked herself, “What goes well with mimosas?” The answer: soft, hard and crumbly cheeses; salty salami and paper-thin prosciutto; grapes, apricots, berries and walnuts; jams and olives; cinnamon buns and macaroons. All this comes in her Brunch Board Box, a neatly packaged charcuterie display you can take home.\n\nElias’ charcuterie business opened in April, amid the pandemic. “I used to do brunches for my girlfriends all the time and make these boards,” she said. “They always loved them, so I thought, maybe I should start a little business.”\n\nAt first, Elias planned to focus solely on catering. But, folks were looking for easy ways to bring the restaurant experience home with them during the pandemic. So, she started offering personalized charcuterie boards to-go.\n\nThe Brunch Board Box starts at $150 and feeds eight people. To order, visit platedbyd.com.\n\nProject PUB, Somerville\n\nWith a concept as unique as a rotating brew pub — each month, this sister restaurant of Tapastre does a tap takeover of a new brewery and also creates a new menu of item designed to be paired with that brewery's beers — you can bet that Project PUB also offers a distinctive brunch menu.\n\nProject PUB features brunch items to-go such as bulgogi steak and eggs, bananas foster French toast and a Bloody Mary board which includes grilled shrimp, marinated olives, housemade pickles, a deviled egg, fresh ricotta, sourdough toast and more — and of course, don't forget to add on the Bloody Mary, Bloody Kickin' or Bloody Maria.\n\n\"Brunch has been killing it,\" said Mike Proske, Project PUB owner. \"People love any excuse to sit outside and drink and eat the morning away. Before COVID-19, it wasn’t uncommon to have a two-hour wait for brunch.

With only a three-foot grill, things got really difficult, and with 12 pancakes on the grill, I couldn't cook anything else on my flat-top.\n\nOld and new again:Weber's Drive-In restaurant in Stratford plans to reopen in the coming weeks\n\n\"We have these ceramic dishes we use for our parmesan baked egg, so we tried our first ever deep-dish pancake,\" she said. \"We piped it with our filling from our crepes – kind of like cheesecake, only better – and put all fresh fruit inside. ! I always tell my customers, Chicago may have deep dish pizza, but New Jersey has deep dish pancakes\" ($9.95 for small, $13.95 for large).\n\nAs for that parmesan baked egg, it's also pretty popular: an egg baked in an English muffin and topped with bacon and Parmesan cream sauce ($9.25).\n\nGo: 1403 Long Beach Blvd. in Ship Bottom, 609-361-2425, and 2604 Long Beach Blvd. in Surf City, 609-361-2524; sandboxcafelbi.com.\n\nToast, Montclair, Asbury Park and Red Bank\n\nCome Sunday, residents of Montclair and environs make a beeline to Toast, Amy Russo Harrigan's kitschy super-popular two-story spot. It’s her first Toast, she went on to open two more locations: one is Asbury Park and another in Red Bank.\n\nHarrigan's pancakes are Instagram superstars (she uses a recipe she got from her father, who owned a diner) and food lovers’ dream-come-true breakfast. Wonderfully fluffy, some sport fresh strawberries, others shredded carrots, and still others red velvet cake batter. The latter wears a spoon stencil (get your camera ready).\n\nIn the off chance you’re not a pancake lover, you can’t go wrong with the heady Irish eggs Benedict with house-made Hollandaise sauce and corned beef hash. It’s so darn good you just might break into an Irish jig.\n\nGo: 700 Bloomfield Ave., Montclair, 973-509-8099; 45 Monmouth St.,\n\nRed Bank, 732-224-1234; and 516 Cookman Ave.,\n\nAsbury Park, 732-776-5900; montclair.toastcitydiner.com\n\nWillow & Whisk, Wyckoff\n\nThere really is a willow tree at stunning Willow & Whisk, a new (it opened July 20) breakfast-and-lunch restaurant in Wyckoff. Nature didn’t create this tree but an artist, who fashioned the trunk out of wood and flowers out of silk.\n\nBut you’ve come to eat, not to ogle.\n\nCulinary Institute of America alum Brandon Csaki likes to make, he said, “simple food the right way.” Shishito peppers may be simple but they’re not usually on breakfast menus. Csaki blisters them and serves the smoky peppers with chipotle aioli. Love cacio e pepe pasta? Consider cacio e pepe scrambled eggs. And have someone order what may be the best Mediterranean dish any time of the day: shakshuka. Use your bread to sponge up every last drop of the dish’s sweet and spicy tomato sauce.\n\nGo: 319 Franklin St., Wyckoff; 201-425-9931; https://www.willowandwhisk.com/", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/delaware/2019/05/15/new-restaurants-rehoboth-popular-md-barbecue-spot-new-crab-house/3677610002/", "title": "New restaurants in Rehoboth: Popular Md. barbecue spot, new crab ...", "text": "Patricia Talorico\n\nDelaware News Journal\n\nWith Memorial Day weekend right around the corner, the summer beach season is gearing up.\n\nAs usual, newcomers have moved in and changes are happening at old-time favorites. That means new menus, new looks and entirely new restaurants, in some cases.\n\nHere's a look at what's happening at some Sussex County sandboxes:\n\n2nd Street Tavern\n\n102 Second St., Lewes; 2ndstreetavern.com; 302-645-7755. Hours: 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays, and 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, though the bar might stay open later. Reservations accepted only for parties of six or more.\n\nThe Buttery, one of Lewes' most recognizable restaurants, has been revamped and renamed.\n\nThe longtime eatery at the corner of Second Street and Savannah Road owned by Wilson Gates and family members was rechristened the 2nd Street Tavern on May 1. The family has owned the restaurant since 2016.\n\nThe Buttery has been a part of Lewes since 1994 when then longtime owners John Donato and Twain Gonzales created a thriving business, featuring fine French cuisine, at the former New Devon Inn, now the Hotel Rodney.\n\nThe eatery, featured in magazines such as the now-defunct Gourmet and Bon Appetit, eventually outgrew its site.\n\nIn 1999, The Buttery moved from its home to what is known as the Trader mansion off one of the town's main thoroughfares in the historic district. The partners brought in Lewes architectural designer John Lester to help restore the Victorian gingerbread, a landmark built about 1894.\n\nEarlier, it had been a private home of a sea pilot and the longtime home of the Trader family, who own a jewelry store in town. It also had been a boarding house and home to an antique shop.\n\nWhen a pipe burst in the restaurant in December 2018, The Buttery was closed for repairs.\n\nExtensive renovations were required, so the Gates family decided to change to a more casual concept. Gone are the heavy draperies and the old name. The restaurant has reopened with new flooring, a new bar area and a revamped seating area for patrons to enjoy drinks and snacks. The corner round table overlooking Savannah Road and Second Street now has a cool chandelier that looks almost like a glass octopus. It's a place to be and be seen.\n\nThe new menu includes some dishes that were on the menu of the Gates family's former Lewes restaurant The Gate House at 109 W. Market St,. which has been rebranded as Bushi Sushi.\n\nThe current 2nd Street Tavern menu has pork belly bao bun tacos ($12.95), pimento beer cheese ($9.95), stuffed clams with whiskey bacon butter ($15.95), the Impossible Burger ($16.95) and shrimp po'boy sandwiches ($14.95).\n\nThe restaurant will honor gifts cards and online gift card purchases made through The Buttery.\n\nHowever, any promotional cards such as \"Brunch for Two\" or handwritten cards will not be honored. The restaurant says they will try to accommodate a solution for those cards, but they were hit with a rash of “fake” handwritten gift cards.\n\nRaas\n\n210 Savannah Road, Lewes; raaslewes.com\n\nLast summer, the newly formed Masala Hospitality Group was in the initial stages of planning an Indian restaurant in a purple, three-story Queen Anne Victorian house on Lewes' Savannah Road.\n\nOver the past year, they've been renovating the former Ocean Retreat Day Spa & Hair Studio.\n\nThe house, built in 1899, has been repainted a much more soothing blue and will soon become Raas, an Indian fusion-Pan Asian restaurant.\n\nIt will be the second Indian restaurant in Sussex County after Indigo, which opened in 2017 on Rehoboth Avenue in Rehoboth Beach. The name Raas means a celebration of culture and food.\n\nRaas will be led by India-born Chef Gyandera Gupta, known as \"Chef GG.\" He has worked at Taj Mahal Bombay; Vivanta by Taj and Taj Holiday Village, both in Goa; Jai Mahal Palace of Taj in Jaipur; and in the Caribbean.\n\nNo menu was available yet. Stay tuned.\n\nGo to raaslewes.com for latest updates.\n\nChaps Pit Beef\n\nCoastal Station shopping center, 19791 Coastal Highway (Del. 1), Rehoboth Beach; chapspitbeef.com; 302-727-5284. Hours: 10:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nBaltimore's “World Famous” barbecue pit beef sandwich has made its way to Delaware.\n\nChaps Pit Beef, a Maryland favorite since 1987, opened a new location in March in Coastal Station off Del. 1, next to the Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant in Rehoboth.\n\nOwners/brothers Chris and Gary Desch are continuing the Chaps tradition of cooking beef on a charcoal pit. You can smell the smoke before you enter the front door.\n\nThe eatery, where customers order at the counter, has high and low tables, as well as picnic-style seating and three outdoor tables with umbrellas. There also is a bar featuring craft beers and, coming soon, selected bourbons.\n\nWe stopped in recently for a $13.95 daily special which included the \"Famous Pit Beef Sandwich,\" small fries and a small soft drink.\n\nDon't believe what you read. A small fry is anything but small. It's actually a giant pile of hot, boardwalk-style French fries that are very good.\n\nThe counter clerk suggested we get the beef cooked medium and it was sliced thin and plentiful with a smoky flavor on a soft, almost squishy bun.\n\nYou'll get charged extra for add-ons such as lettuce and tomato ($.70), American cheese ($.75) ranch dressing ($1) and jalapenos ($1).\n\nBut the condiments bar does a variety of toppings including free horseradish and pickles, and sauces ranging from barbecue to \"tiger sauce,\" a blend of mayonnaise and horseradish.\n\nNalu Hawaiian Surf Bar and Grille\n\n41 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach. Hours: 11 a.m. to midnight daily.\n\nIt's the second location for this Hawaiian-themed eatery that has been a part of Dewey Beach since 2008. The new site, the former Wilmington College location on Rehoboth Avenue, is just steps away from the boardwalk and the ocean.\n\nIt resembles a tiki bar from the outside with its thatched exterior.\n\nThe casual setting is in a perfect location. Recently, doors were wide open to let in the sounds of the squawking seagulls. Inside, ocean wave murals decorate walls, surfboards substitute for tables and the top of the bar continuously changes colors of the rainbow. (We really like the red.)\n\nNalu owner Regan Derrickson told our sister publication, delmarvanow.com, the restaurant will have \"its own identity\" from the original, Hawaiian-themed location in Dewey.\n\nThe menu has poke bowls, a spam BLT and Kona-braised short rib tacos. Kona Brewing Co. beers are on draft and Kapu drinks are served in a pineapple shell.\n\nThe coconut shrimp was hot and crunchy and a nice nosh to go along with a Mai Tai and a Maui Mule, a \"Hawaiian-style\" Moscow Mule which sounds funky but was very refreshing and satisfying.\n\nRise Up Coffee Roasters\n\n502 Rehoboth Ave, Rehoboth, riseupcoffee.com\n\nRise Up Coffee, an independent small-batch coffee roaster and retailer for the past 14 years, has popped up next to the traffic circle as you drive into downtown Rehoboth. It takes over a former 7-Eleven location.\n\nThe business was founded in St. Michaels, Maryland, by owner Tim Cureton in a tricked-out coffee trailer. The double-sided drive-thru is open all year.\n\nRise Up serves only organic coffees that are generally considered a medium roast.\n\nRise Up also has Maryland locations in Salisbury, Ocean City, Cambridge, Annapolis, Edgewater and a coffee roastery in Easton, Maryland, in a former gas station that dates back to the 1920s.\n\nThe Rehoboth location will serve breakfast with items such as smothered kimchi Tater tots, rockfish tacos, burritos and breakfast sandwiches made with bacon, sausage and scrapple.\n\nThe Pines\n\n56 Baltimore Ave., Rehoboth; thepinesrb.com; 302-567-2726. Hours: Dinner served daily at 5 p.m. Happy hour is from 3:30 to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday.\n\nThe Pines has been a work in progress for more than a year and a half.\n\nRenovations began in 2017 to transform the old Hobos, which bowed out in 2016, into a \"modern coastal tavern\" with a menu that reflects both the land and the sea.\n\nOwner/partners are Bob Suppies, a Maine native and Rehoboth resident since 1997 who has had a career in retail, and Tyler Townsend, a former baseball player who was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in 2009.\n\nThe building, dating back to least the 1970s, has been gutted inside and out. The main entrance is now on the side of the building. It's modern and sleek and unrecognizable from its darker and cramped Hobos years.\n\nThe restaurant opened in early December. During a recent weekday visit, the second floor, which has a lounge, live music and bar, was not open. There is a cool balcony and outdoor area overlooking Baltimore Avenue that kind of reminds me of some of the Bourbon Street buildings in New Orleans.\n\nThe building has a modern flair, but also pays homage to old Rehoboth. The Pines name comes from an old Rehoboth postcard that read \"where the pine forest meets the ocean.\"\n\nMany dishes are multi-layered. Hummus three ways ($11) in an intriguing idea and it came with little scoops of red wine fig, sweet potato and chickpea-flavored dips with sides of pickled carrots and asparagus and homemade chips.\n\nNone of the three flavors totally won my group over. Mostly we left wishing for just one great hummus. (Think of the fabulous Zahav in Philadelphia.)\n\nLobster spaetzle mac balls were two deep-fried bocce-size balls with a nice crunch, but seemed in need of a sprinkling of salt.\n\nTraditionalists might frown at the clams and housemade linguine ($19) given it's served with black and \"white\" pasta as well as spongy-tasting seafood sausage, sea beans and tasso butter. The clams, however, were nicely cooked and not too chewy.\n\nA better bet might be the ginseng and tea-brined, grilled pork chop ($31) with apple and juniper spelt pilaf, kimchi carrots and huckleberry gastrique.\n\nOther menu items include seared scallops and butterfly pea \"purple\" risotto ($33) with arugula and beet butter and a hand-ground T.A. Farms beef burger ($16) with fries.\n\nPlaya Bowls\n\n220 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth, www.playabowls.com\n\nAfter the wild success of the Newark restaurant, which opened in February 2018, the owners of Playa Bowls decided to increase their Delaware locations.\n\nA new site was added to the Middletown area at 832 Kohl Ave. in the Hedgelawn Plaza. And now another shop featuring the popular acai bowls is coming very soon to downtown Rehoboth, just across from the fire station.\n\nIt's not surprising Playa Bowls is opening at the Delaware beach given that the first one originated on the boardwalk in Belmar, New Jersey, in 2014.\n\nFounders Rob Giuliani and Abby Taylor are New Jersey shore natives and longtime surfers. They opened the business after being inspired by surf trips to Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, California, Hawaii, Nicaragua and Panama.\n\nAlmost every town they visited offered versions of acai or pitaya bowls.\n\nWe're fans of the Newark location and have become hooked on the Tropical Bowl ($9), pure açaí topped with granola, bananas, pineapple, coconut flakes and honey. Another favorite is Nutella ($11) which includes açaí, banana, strawberry, coconut flakes and Nutella drizzle.\n\nBreakfast Guru Restaurant & Bar\n\n19 Wilmington Ave., Rehoboth Beach; breakfast-guru.com; 302-567-2829 Hours: 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily\n\nThis family-owned breakfast restaurant, which opened in early May, takes over the spot of a short-lived Italian eatery, and there are still Italian seaside murals on the wall.\n\nBreakfast is always big in a beach town and Breakfast Guru is laser-focused on the most important meal of the day.\n\nThe menu includes the basics such as The Shore breakfast ($11), which is two eggs, a choice of sausage or two thick strips of bacon, house potatoes and a choice of bread or breakfast burritos ($14) made with ribeye steak or sausage, eggs, potatoes and pepper jack cheese wrapped in a soft tortilla served with fried tomato bacon sauce.\n\nThere are ham-and-spinach crepes, omelets, eggs Benedict, French toast, waffles, pancakes and breakfast tacos made with chorizo sausage and potatoes, a sunny side up egg along with garnishes of sliced radishes, sprinkles of feta or ricotta and fresh cilantro.\n\nLooking to satisfy the sweet tooth? The Campfire Delight ($10) is graham cracker-crusted challah bread topped with toasted marshmallows and chocolate sauce.\n\nSteamin' Blues Crabhouse\n\n29 Baltimore Ave., Rehoboth; visit Steamin’ Blues Crabhouse Facebook page\n\nComing soon to downtown Rehoboth will be Steamin' Blues, a new crabhouse from the owners of The Surfing Crab Restaurant & Bar at 16723 Coastal Highway (Del. 1) in Lewes.\n\nOwner Donald Vechery is taking over the former Jakes Seafood Restaurant site in Rehoboth at the corner of First Street and Baltimore Avenue. Renovations have been ongoing for several months.\n\nIt will be a second location for The Surfing Crab.\n\nWhat else:\n\n• El Dorado Mexican Restaurant, the Rehoboth Baja-style taco shop in business for more than 12 years, closed in late December. The 18766 John J. Williams Highway (Del. 24) site is now Dos Locos Fajitas & Stone Grill.\n\n• Crust & Craft pizza restaurant off Del. 1, formerly owned by chef Brenton Wallace, was sold in February to Rehoboth-based hospitality group SoDel Concepts, which owns such popular Sussex County eateries as Bluecoast and Matt's Fish Camp. Nina Maddox is the new executive chef at the Midway shopping center restaurant that specializes in wood-fired pizza, pasta and craft beer.\n\n• The former Sandy Pony Donuts food truck, owned by Brea and Ben Wang, has morphed into a brick-and-mortar location at 115 Garfield Parkway in downtown Bethany Beach. The shop also will be selling acai bowls. The Wangs will no longer be operating the Sandy Pony food truck in South Bethany Beach, nor their Wang's World food truck. Call Sandy Pony at 301- 775-2005.\n\n• Ristorante Zebra, the seasonal Italian eatery at 32 Lake Ave., Rehoboth, known for its safari-themed decor, has closed. It will become a coastal Italian seafood restaurant called Sazio run by Big Fish Restaurant Group. Italian is not a new concept for Big Fish. Previously, they ran Bella Coast Italian Kitchen & Market on Concord Pike in Brandywine Hundred before selling the restaurant in December 2017 to Touch of Italy.\n\n• Owner Chris McKeown of Agave Mexican Restaurant & Tequila Bar, a Lewes favorite since 2008 and one of Delaware's busiest restaurants, is planning a second location in Rehoboth next to the Summer House at 230 Rehoboth Ave. So far, only the sign announcing the new restaurant is standing at the location.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico\n\nMore: Scrapple hot dogs topped with lobster?

Here's when you'll ...", "text": "We haven’t made it through summer just yet, but fall is on the horizon, and soon after, daylight saving time will once again end as our clocks fall back for the winter.\n\nEach fall, those who observe daylight saving time, commonly referred to as daylight savings time, set clocks back one hour to allow for more daylight during winter mornings, according to Timeanddate.com.\n\nAlthough we’re more than two months away from the annual event, here’s a refresher on daylight saving time and related information to keep in mind.\n\nWhen does daylight saving time end?\n\nFor those wondering when daylight saving time begins, we have a secret for you: we’re already in it.\n\nDaylight saving time began Sunday, March 12 this year, when clocks in the United States jumped to 3 a.m. once the clock struck 2 a.m.\n\nWhat you’re really wondering is when daylight saving time will end.\n\nDaylight saving time officially ends Sunday, Nov. 5 at 2 a.m. Clocks will fall back one hour to 1 a.m., returning us to standard time for the winter months.\n\nStandard time will be in effect until Sunday, March 12 at 2 a.m., when daylight saving time returns after clocks spring forward.\n\nWhy do we practice daylight saving time?\n\nThe idea behind daylight saving time is that it allows us to use natural daylight better, according to Almanac.com.\n\nMoving clocks forward one hour in the spring provides more daylight in the evenings during the warmer months. Moving clocks back one hour in the fall provides more daylight during the winter mornings.\n\nAdvocates of the practice say brighter afternoons and early evenings help stimulate the economy, though the practice originally began to save fuel during World War I, according to Almanac.com.\n\nDespite the seemingly simple solution, daylight saving time has faced opposition in recent years, with many wanting to do away with the practice.\n\nWho observes daylight saving time?\n\nOver 70 countries use daylight saving time, fewer than 40% of all countries in the world, and many have different beginning and end dates. More than 1 billion people participate in the phenomenon each year, according to timeanddate.com.\n\nThe only U.S. regions to not participate in daylight saving time are Hawaii, parts of Arizona, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nWho's in charge of time?\n\nSurprisingly, the U.S. Department of Transportation is in charge of daylight saving time and all time zones in the U.S.\n\n\"The oversight of time zones was assigned to DOT because time standards are important for many modes of transportation,\" according to the department's website.\n\nThe department is a proponent of the practice, as they say it conserves energy.\n\nAre daylight saving time clock changes going away?\n\nIn March, the U.S. Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent this November.\n\nThis would end the twice-annual clock-changing routine by making daylight saving time the official standard time at 2 a.m. on Nov. 5, extending the eight-month practice to year-round.\n\nThe legislation was reintroduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and is supported by more than half the states.\n\nThe House of Representatives, which has held a committee hearing on the issue, must past the bill before it can end up on President Joe Biden’s desk for signing.\n\nStates may exempt themselves by state law in accordance with the Uniform Time Act, as amended.\n\nICYMI:New law will ban polystyrene, some single-use plastics from Delaware restaurants\n\nSupport for permanent daylight saving time\n\nIf permanent daylight saving time takes effect, the biggest benefit would be no sleep disruption. No need to change your clock twice a year before, at or after 2 a.m. on a Sunday in the fall and spring. Experts say ending the adjusting of clocks and disruption of established sleep patterns is better for our health.\n\nOther perks would be and end to resetting clocks and other devices, and more time during the day to be out and about in daylight hours.\n\nObjections to permanent daylight saving time\n\nOpponents of permanent daylight saving time say extending sunlight later into the evening will result in greater sleep loss and pose a public health threat.\n\nThis doesn’t mean opponents of permanent daylight saving time enjoy changing clocks twice a year, though. Those who oppose daylight saving time often voice a preference for making standard time, also known as winter time, the permanent timeframe.\n\nWhat to do for the end of daylight saving time\n\nAt least for now, Delaware remains a participant of daylight saving time and will fall back in November.\n\nWith most of our computers, smartphones and other devices automatically changing the time for us, it's not as much of a chore as it used to be. Unless you have smart appliances, microwaves and ovens are on the short list of household items that will need a manual adjustment, as will manual clocks.\n\nUnlike the spring forward earlier this year, where many people woke up grouchy after losing an hour of beauty sleep, you can sleep soundly on Nov. 5 knowing you’ll be getting an extra hour of rest.\n\nGot a tip or a story idea?

Less than a month later, Assemblyman Kansen Chu introduced a bill to do just that, AB 7, but the Legislature never passed it.\n\nEven if it had, the federal government would still need to OK the change.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act, which was introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida. The bill would permanently extend daylight saving time from eight months of the year to the full 12 months.

Daylight Saving Time (DST) is used to save energy and make better use of daylight. It was first used in 1908 in Thunder Bay, Canada.\"\n\nDaylight saving time became a national standard in 1966 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Uniform Time Act, which was established as a way to continue to conserve energy. The thinking was, if it's light out longer, that's less time you'll need to use lights in your home.\n\nIn your best Cher voice ...\"If I could turn back time, if I could find a way\" and other songs about time\n\nIs daylight saving timehealthy for you?

The bill was first introduced in January 2021 and reintroduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and seven other bipartisan members of Congress in March 2022. The bill would make daylight saving time permanent across the U.S. But so far, it's only passed the Senate.\n\nClick here to read the Sunshine Protection Act bill from congress.gov.\n\nIs it daylight savings time, daylight saving's time, daylight saving time?\n\nIt's daylight saving time. No hyphen, no apostrophe and no extra S in the phrase. Also, no capitalization.\n\nWhat does 'spring forward, fall back' mean?\n\nAccording to dictionary.com, daylight saving, commonly referred to as daylight savings, \"is begun in the spring by setting clocks one hour ahead. They are then set one hour back in the fall. ... People often use the simple mnemonic spring forward, fall back to remember to set clocks forward one hour (e.g., from 2 a.m. to 3 a.m.) in the spring and backward one hour (e.g., from 2 a.m. to 1 a.m.) in the fall.\"\n\nWho's in charge of daylight saving time?\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation oversees the nation's time zones and the uniform observance of daylight saving time, according to transportation.gov. The oversight of time zones was assigned to the DOT to help keep track of transportation. The DOT manages daylight saving time and cites energy reduction and reduced crime as reasons for the time change.\n\nWhat is the Standard Time Act?\n\nThe Standard Time Act of 1918 was the first federal law that implemented standard time and daylight saving time.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation states, \"federal oversight of time zones began in 1918 with the enactment of the Standard Time Act, which vested the Interstate Commerce Commission with the responsibility for establishing boundaries between the standard time zones in the U.S. This responsibility was transferred from the Interstate Commerce Commission to DOT when Congress created DOT in 1966.\"\n\nWhat is the Uniform Time Act?\n\nIn 1966 when the U.S. Department of Transportation was created, the Uniform Time Act established a system of uniform daylight saving time across the U.S. It simplified when and where daylight saving time would take effect.\n\nWhich states don't observe daylight saving time?\n\nArizona and Hawaii do not recognize DST. There's also no need to change the clocks in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas.\n\nWhich states don't want to observe daylight saving time?\n\nMore than 30 states are considering legislation related to the practice of changing clocks twice a year, and seven states — Alabama, Arkansas, Nevada, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington and Florida — have already approved the legislation. However, these states still need the OK from Congress to enact the change.\n\nWhich countries observe daylight saving time?\n\nDaylight saving time is used in more than 70 countries worldwide and affects more than a billion people each year. The beginning and end dates vary from one country to another.\n\nWhat are the pros of daylight saving time?\n\nIf permanent daylight saving time takes effect, the biggest pro by far would be no sleep disruption. No need to change your clock twice a year before, at or after 2 a.m. on a Sunday in the fall and spring.\n\nOther perks would be more time during the day to be out and about, and experts say it's better for your health — no sleep disruption.

Why does the United States and more than 70 other countries observe it? Here are the answers to those questions, and more:\n\nDo we gain or lose an hour?\n\nWe all lose an hour of sleep when going to DST, as the day is only 23 hours long.\n\nWhen clocks go forward, that one hour of daylight is basically shifted from morning to evening as daylight saving time begins. We won't go back to standard time until Sunday, Nov. 5.\n\nWho's in charge of time?\n\nSurprisingly, the U.S. Department of Transportation is in charge of daylight saving time and all time zones in the U.S.\n\n\"The oversight of time zones was assigned to DOT because time standards are important for many modes of transportation,\" according to the department's website.\n\nWhat is the future of daylight saving time?:Year-round change depends on federal vote.\n\nWhen did the U.S. officially enact daylight saving time?\n\nDST became a national standard in the U.S. in 1966 with the passage of the Uniform Time Act. States either have to change the clocks at a specified time or stick with standard time throughout the year.\n\nIn 2007, the federal government expanded daylight saving time in order to reduce energy consumption. The law now specifies that daylight time applies from 2 a.m. on the second Sunday of March until 2 a.m. on the first Sunday of November\n\nDaylight saving time now accounts for about 65% of the year.\n\nFederal law does allow states to remain in standard time all year, but states must first get approval from Congress before making daylight saving time permanent.\n\nDid Benjamin Franklin invent the time change?\n\nWhile not necessarily advocating changing time, Benjamin Franklin urged his fellow countrymen to work during daylight and sleep after dark, thus saving money on candles.

It's known as summer time in some countries, including the United Kingdom and in Europe. No one is sure just how much daylight is saved, globally, each year, though physics indicates none.\n\nWhy was daylight saving time created?\n\nThe DOT says daylight saving time conserves energy. When the sun sets later, it's presumed that people will stay out longer and spend more time outside. Theoretically, that leads to less electricity for lights and appliances.\n\nThe debate over daylight saving time, which was first enacted by the federal government during World War I as a way to conserve coal, has picked up momentum in recent years.\n\nWhat are the downsides to DST?\n\nNot everyone agrees it offers energy-saving benefits. Some studies report the time switch saves energy on lighting, but is surpassed by increases in heating and air conditioning. It can also mess with our sleep patterns, at least temporarily.\n\nOther health impacts consequences, according to various studies and research, include increased headaches, heart attacks and depression.\n\nWhat states do not do daylight saving time?\n\nOnly two states don't observe it – Hawaii and Arizona. Other non-observers include American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\nDo some states want year-round DST?\n\nYes. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, in the past five years, 19 states have \"enacted legislation or passed resolutions to provide for year-round daylight saving time, if Congress were to allow such a change, and in some cases, if surrounding states enact the same legislation. Because federal law does not currently allow full-time DST, Congress would have to act before states could adopt changes.\"\n\nGrammar check: It's actually saving –not savings time\n\nThe correct term is daylight \"saving\" (not savings) time. However, the incorrect term “daylight savings time” is commonly used, especially in Australia, Canada and the United States.

However, nothing came of their ideas.\n\nSome also credit Benjamin Franklin for daylight saving time due to a satirical letter he wrote in 1784 stating: \"Every morning, as soon as the sun rises, let all the bells in every church be set ringing: and if that is not sufficient, let cannon be fired in every street to wake the sluggards effectually.\"\n\nMore:Williamson County's estimated ice storm damage reaches $11 million\n\nA city in the province of Ontario, Canada, called Port Arthur — now known as Thunder Bay — first used daylight saving time in 1908 when they advanced their clocks by one hour.\n\nGermany and Austria followed suit in 1916 to save fuel for World War I efforts — fuel that had been going toward artificial lights.

After a long, cold season, most of us can agree we’re ready for warmer days – and more daylight hours, too!\n\nBut when it comes to daylight saving time, that conversation gets a little trickier. The biannual time change is no fun for anyone – we’re tired, our sleep schedules are out of whack, our pets are confused and try to wake us up well before our alarm clocks.\n\nBut DST also has been linked to more serious problems, including an increase in car accidents and serious health risks. Sleep medicine specialists at Northwestern Medicine say daylight saving time could be linked to cluster headaches, weight gain, an increased risk of heart attacks and a higher risk of stroke.\n\nThat makes one thing easy to agree on: With the increased risks in injury and health risks – and the general sleep challenges and annoyances most of us experience for at least a few days after – DST has got to go.\n\nOpinions in your inbox: Get exclusive access to our columnists and the best of our columns\n\nAre they ending daylight saving time in 2023?\n\nAmericans are so united on this that the Sunshine Protection Act, a bill meant to put an end to the recurring time change and make daylight saving time permanent, passed unanimously through the Senate last year.\n\nBut the bill stalled in the House. According to Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the House is divided – by region, not party – on whether to do away with the biannual time change and which time should become the standard.\n\nWhen is daylight saving time 2023?:Here's what to know about the time change in March.\n\n'Fall back' and thrive:How Finland taught me to embrace the end of daylight saving time\n\nI understand where the resistance to permanent daylight saving time comes from. Along with most other sleep experts, I think a shift to permanent standard time would benefit the health of the nation more than a shift to permanent DST. Permanent standard time puts us on a schedule that’s closer to the sun’s day and night cycle, which has dictated human habits and sleep schedules for millennia.\n\nOf course, we understand the broad appeal of longer days. Who doesn’t love long, balmy summer nights? But overall, the negative health consequences that come with permanent DST aren’t worth it. Permanent standard time would be a much better switch for our natural body clocks.\n\nEven if you don’t like permanent standard time for yourself, it’s worth thinking about the implications a change like this would have on children and teens.\n\nPermanent daylight saving time doesn’t align with our natural circadian rhythms. Our sleep schedules are guided by the Earth's light and dark cycle. If we shift to darker mornings and lighter evenings, our sleep schedules would get thrown severely out of whack – a long-term issue with long-term implications.\n\nMy neurofibromatosis:A stranger filmed me without my consent and put it on TikTok. I stood up for myself – and won.\n\nWe've just had enough:Understaffing at hospitals puts our patients at higher risk\n\nToo much light in the evening for prolonged amounts of time has been linked to a plethora of series health issues, such as: diabetes, hypertension, cancer, heart disease, strokes, disruptions to the digestive and endocrine systems, mood disorders and reduced life expectancy.\n\nA change to permanent DST would be particularly bad for teenagers. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, teens need between nine and nine and a half hours of sleep a night – that’s more than adults and young children need, and it’s less than many get now.\n\nDST is especially hard for teens and their sleep\n\nA 2015 study that examined long-running surveys of more than 300,000 American teens found that 40% get less than seven hours of sleep per night – far less than they need.\n\nThe relationship between sleep deprivation and depression should have alarm bells blaring in our heads when we look at these sleep statistics, especially given the rising rates of depression in teens.\n\nTeenagers’ circadian rhythms naturally cause them to want to stay up later and wake up later. We’re already setting them up for failure by asking teens to wake up far earlier than their natural body clock wants for school.\n\nListen to parents:How teachers can help repair the fracture between schools and families\n\nSCOTUS hears student loan forgiveness:Biden's student loan plan is an abuse of power.

Do you remember how hard it was to wake up in the dark and be in homeroom by 7 a.m.? Or how difficult it was not to fall asleep during your least favorite subject? How about studying for a big exam when all you wanted to do was sleep?\n\nThese feelings are side effects of fighting the teenage body’s natural sleep needs, and shifting to permanent daylight saving time would exacerbate the issue.\n\nWe can all agree that we’re ready to get rid of this biannual time change, both for the sake of our health and our sanity. But before you pick a side regarding permanent DST or standard time, think hard about the long-term effects – both for yourself and the teenagers you love.\n\nDr. Shelby Harris specializes in the use of cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety and depression.

Arizona tried going back to daylight saving time that year, but state legislators soon decided to opt out, and the state reverted to standard time beginning in 1968.\n\nFor one thing, Arizonans just don't need an extra hour of daylight during our summer months.\n\n\"Arizona participated in daylight saving time in 1967, but energy consumption soared,\" Arizona State University history professor Calvin Schermerhorn told ASU News in 2018. \"In most of the country, an extra hour of daylight supposedly saved fuel used to heat and light buildings.

The DOT said energy reduction and reduced crime are reasons for having both standard and daylight saving time.\n\nWhich states don't observe daylight saving time?\n\nArizona and Hawaii do not recognize daylight savings time as well as territories Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas.\n\nHow many countries observe daylight saving time?\n\nMore than 70 countries in the world observe daylight saving time, however the start and end dates can differ.\n\nLess than 40% of countries globally still observe daylight savings time switches, despite over 140 countries implementing them previously, according to Statistica.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/health/permanent-daylight-savings-health-harms-wellness/index.html", "title": "Permanent Daylight Saving Time will hurt our health, experts say ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe end of Daylight Saving Time is upon us again, an autumn tradition when the United States, Europe, most of Canada and a number of other countries move their clocks backwards an hour in a sort of Groundhog Day trust fall. We’ll move them forward (again) next spring when governments put daylight saving back in place.\n\nBut are we putting our trust in an unhealthy, outdated idea?\n\nNot according to the United States Senate, which in March passed the Sunshine Protection Act of 2021 – if it becomes law, Daylight Saving Time will be permanent.\n\n“The call to end the antiquated practice of clock changing is gaining momentum throughout the nation,” said Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who first introduced the bill in the US Senate, in a statement. Florida’s legislature voted to make Daylight Saving Time permanent in Florida in 2018, but it can’t go into effect until it is federal law as well.\n\nThe bill still has to make its way through the US House of Representatives and be signed into law by the President. If or when that is the case, we’ll move our clocks forward and leave them that way, permanently living one hour ahead of the sun.\n\nHowever, a growing number of sleep experts say the act of moving our clocks forward in the spring is ruining our health. Studies over the last 25 years have shown the one-hour change disrupts body rhythms tuned to Earth’s rotation, adding fuel to the debate over whether having Daylight Saving Time in any form is a good idea.\n\n“I’m one of the many sleep experts that knows it’s a bad idea,” said Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology in the division of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\n“Your body clock stays with (natural) light not with the clock on your wall,” Klerman said. “And there’s no evidence that your body fully shifts to the new time.”\n\nDr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Evanston, Illinois, also opposes Daylight Saving Time.\n\n“Between March and November your body gets less morning light and more evening light, which can throw off your circadian rhythm,” she said.\n\nStandard time, which we enter when we move our clocks back in the fall, is much closer to the sun’s day and night cycle, Zee said. This cycle has set our circadian rhythm, or body clock, for centuries.\n\nThat internal timer controls not just when you sleep, but also when you want to eat, exercise or work, as well as “your blood pressure, your heart rate and your cortisol rhythm,” Zee added.\n\nOur bodies need the early morning light to set our internal body clock, experts say. Marilyn Nieves/E+/Getty Images\n\nA call to ban Daylight Saving Time for good has come from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine: “Current evidence best supports the adoption of year-round standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology and provides distinct benefits for public health and safety.”\n\nThe proposal has been endorsed by more than 20 medical, scientific, and civic organizations, including the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, the National Parent Teacher Association, the National Safety Council, the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms and the World Sleep Society.\n\nWhat’s the harm?\n\nWhen our internal clocks are offset from the solar day-night cycle by even one hour we develop what sleep experts call “social jet lag.” Studies have shown social jet lag increases the risk of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, raises the risk of heart disease and stroke, worsens mood disorders such as depression, affects the digestive and endocrine systems and shortens our sleep duration. It can even reduce life expectancy,\n\nA 2003 study found getting one hour less sleep for two weeks had the same effect on thinking and motor skills as going without sleep for two full nights. Reducing sleep by 90 minutes from the recommended 7 to 8 hours for adults altered the DNA of immune cells and boosted inflammation, a key cause of chronic disease, according to another study.\n\nMaking the time change permanent would make the chronic effects of any sleep loss more severe, not only “because we have to go to work an hour earlier for an additional 5 months every year but also because body clocks are usually later in winter than in summer with reference to the sun clock,” according to a statement from the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms.\n\n“The combination of DST and winter would therefore make the differences between body clocks and the social clock even worse and would negatively affect our health even more,” the authors concluded.\n\nWhy did the Senate pass the bill?\n\nThere are reasons the US Senate unanimously passed the Sunshine Protection Act. Proponents say that extra daylight in the evening cuts down on car accidents and crime, and increases opportunities for commerce and recreation, as people prefer to shop and exercise during daylight hours.\n\nHowever, research has shown both heart attacks and fatal car accidents increase after the clock falls forward in the spring. Children also end up going to school in the morning while it is still dark – with disastrous consequences.\n\nWhen President Richard Nixon signed a permanent Daylight Saving Time into law in January 1974, it was a popular move. But by the end of the month Florida’s governor had called for the law’s repeal after eight schoolchildren were hit by cars in the dark. Schools across the country delayed start times until the sun came up.\n\nBy summer, public approval had plummeted, and in early October Congress voted to switch back to standard time.\n\nA similar backlash occurred when the US first implemented Daylight Saving Time in 1918, as a way to to reduce demand for electricity usage by adding sunlight to the end of the day in response to World War I. (Studies since have found little to no cost savings from the practice.) The time switch was so unpopular that the law was repealed the following year.\n\n“The United States has tried permanent daylight saving time twice before and ended it early. The UK tried once before and ended it early. Russia tried it once, so did India and ended it early,” Klerman said. “I think we should learn from history.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}]}

January's first full moon occurred Jan. 1.\n\n“These three lunar events separately are not uncommon, but it is rare for all three to occur at the same time,” AccuWeather meteorologist and astronomy blogger Brian Lada said.\n\nThough the exact moment of this full moon is 8:37 a.m. ET Jan. 31, the moon will appear plenty full for a day or two before and after that.\n\nHowever, the moon doesn't actually appear blue.\n\nAs for the total lunar eclipse, it will be visible early in the morning of Jan. 31 from western North America across the Pacific to eastern Asia, NASA said.\n\nIn the United States, the best view of the eclipse will be along the West Coast. For skywatchers in the central and eastern U.S., only a partial eclipse will be visible since the moon will set before totality.\n\n“The lunar eclipse on Jan. 31 will be visible during moonset,\" said Noah Petro, a research scientist from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. \"Folks in the eastern United States, where the eclipse will be partial, will have to get up in the morning to see it.\"\n\nThe eclipse will last almost 3½ hours from the beginning of the partial phase at 3:48 a.m. PT until it ends at 7:12 a.m. PT, according to Sky and Telescope. Totality lasts a generous 77 minutes, from 4:51 a.m. PT to 6:08 a.m. PT.\n\nBy that time, however, the moon will already have set in the eastern time zone.\n\nAs for the weather, clear skies are forecast across the eastern and south-central United States, according to AccuWeather.\n\nAdditionally, some astronomy historians can quibble about the origin of the \"blue moon\" name: It was originally a name for a season that had four full moons instead of three; a definition which was later mistakenly expanded to two full moons in a single month.\n\nBut even the venerable publication Sky & Telescope — in which the original \"mistake\" was made decades ago — said that \"the second-full-moon-in-a-month (mis)interpretation is like a genie that can't be forced back into its bottle.

Sometimes it can be slightly closer to us and appear slightly larger in the sky. The closest full moon of the year is often nicknamed the supermoon. Will the moon on Jan. 31 be “super” as well? Not quite. At the start of the lunar eclipse, the moon will be about 223,000 miles above you. The full moon on Jan. 1 was actually measurably closer at only about 218,000 miles.

No. It is just a name coined in 1946 but has no true astronomical significance.\n\nThe moon can actually appear blue in color on rare occasions (thus the phrase “once in a blue moon.” This effect is caused by particles in Earth’s atmosphere turning moonlight a shade bluer. Volcanic eruptions on Earth that eject dust and ash high into the air are generally the culprit of actual blue moons.\n\nMore: For the first time, scientists have been able to clone monkeys\n\nMore: Humanity's first visit to the Antarctic seafloor finds it 'carpeted with life'\n\nA Partial Astronomical Event\n\nNow we get to the main event. Although it cannot rival a total solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse is an amazing and beautiful thing to witness. When you head outside on the morning of Jan. 31, face west. Weather permitting, there you will see the full moon lighting up the pre-dawn sky. However, at 6:48, look carefully at the upper left edge of the moon for a dark bump. It will look like someone is slowly nibbling at the edge of the moon and throwing it into shadow. That is Earth’s shadow being cast onto the moon. At that moment, Earth is directly between the sun and moon and the eclipse has begun.\n\nAs minutes pass, more and more of the lunar surface will be plunged into shadow. By 7 a.m., there will be a noticeable curved shadow covering about one-fifth of the moon, and by 7:30, more than half of the lunar surface will be dark. For viewers in the Tristate, this is where things get dicey. Since this is happening at 7:30 a.m., the sun is rising in the east and the entire sky will start brightening. Meanwhile, the moon will be just above the western horizon and setting fast. Buildings, trees and dawn may obscure your view after 7:30 (if not sooner). The best-case scenario is that you will see the moon all the way until it sets at 7:44 a.m. but this will still be before totality – when the entire moon is in the shadow of Earth. From Cincinnati, moon gazers will only see a partial lunar eclipse.\n\nMore: Why it won't be easy to see the 'super blue blood moon' here\n\nPeople that live east of Cincinnati will see even less of the eclipse while the entire event is not visible from Europe, Africa and western Asia. However, the farther west you live in the United States, the more of the eclipse you will see. People in the central time zone will see it nearly reach totality while those in the Mountain and Pacific time zones will see the moon turn an eerie shade of orange that some people call the “blood moon.”\n\nNo matter where you live, get up a little early on Wednesday and try to see part of the lunar eclipse before work or school. It may not be “super” or “blue” but it will keep you looking up.\n\nDean Regas is the Astronomer for the Cincinnati Observatory, co-host of PBS’ Star Gazers, and author of the books 100 Things to See in the Night Sky and Facts from Space!

That night, viewers around the globe will see a supermoon and blue moon all in one package.\n\nWhat does that mean and what will you see? You will not witness a moon in the sky twice its normal size and the color of a blueberry. But here’s your guide to watching a moonrise in super style.\n\nHow to watch the Aug. 30 supermoon\n\nAs the moon orbits the Earth, it slowly changes its distance from us. It varies from about 250,000 miles at its farthest to around 218,000 miles at its closest. When you combine the night when the full moon is also closest to us, astronomers call that a perigee syzygy. The more common name for this phenomenon is “supermoon.”\n\nAn average stargazer can’t tell the changing distance of the moon from night to night. However, when one compares a supermoon to the farthest full moon, a so-called \"puny moon,\" the change is dramatic. The supermoon is over 31,000 miles closer, and appears 14% larger in diameter and shines 30% brighter than the puny moon. That is like comparing the size of a quarter to a nickel.\n\nThe best time to see any full moon is just as it rises. As the sun sets in the west-northwest on Aug. 30, turn 180 degrees to look for the moon peaking above the east-southeastern horizon. At first glance, the moon will look reddish in color. That’s because the moonlight is traveling through more of Earth’s atmosphere to reach your eyes and shifts the color to the red end of the spectrum. It is the same reason why a setting sun turns red, too.\n\nAlthough the moon looks extra large when it is on the horizon, most of the time the moon is actually slightly closer to you when it is highest in the sky. For most viewers this month, the closest point for the supermoon will be between midnight and 2 a.m. At that point, the moon will be about 219,600 miles away.\n\nOnce in a blue moon\n\nSynonymous with rarity, the moon on Aug. 30 is also considered by many to be a blue moon. This does not mean the moon will actually turn the color blue. This naming tradition only goes back to the mid-20th century, when astronomy writers began nicknaming the second full moon in a calendar month a \"blue moon.\" It’s not such a rare occurrence since the moon phase cycle takes about 29.5 days to complete. If you have a full moon occur on the first of a month, the next full moon on the 30th or 31st would be the blue moon.\n\nBy this definition, the last blue moon was on Halloween 2020 (Oct. 31) and the next one will occur on May 31, 2026.\n\nA blue supermoon is super rare\n\nIf you miss the supermoonrise on Aug. 30, you have another chance the next evening. The moon on Aug. 31 will be almost as full and almost as close and will rise 30-45 minutes after sunset. But the difference from night to night will be indistinguishable and either evening should present a tremendous sight.\n\nHaving a supermoon on the same night as a blue moon is extremely rare. The closest approximation in your lifetime will occur on March 31, 2037, when a blue moon happens alongside the third closest full moon of that year. There will not be another true supermoon/blue moon combination again this century.\n\nDean Regas is an astronomy educator and author of six books including \"1000 Facts About Space\" and \"How to Teach Grown-Ups About Pluto.\" He can be reached at www.astrodean.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/world/celestial-events-2023-scn/index.html", "title": "Watch the night sky for these celestial events in 2023 | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

And if you ever want to know what planets are visible in the morning or evening sky, check The Old Farmer’s Almanac’s calculator.\n\nHere are the rest of 2023’s top sky events, so you can have your binoculars and telescope ready.\n\nFull moons and supermoons\n\nMost years, there are 12 full moons — one for each month. But in 2023, there will be 13 full moons, with two occurring in August.\n\nThe second full moon in one month is known as a blue moon, like the phrase “once in a blue moon,” according to NASA. Typically, full moons occur every 29 days, while most months in our calendar last 30 or 31 days, so the months and moon phases don’t always align. This results in a blue moon about every 2.5 years.\n\nThe two full moons in August can also be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky. Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is brighter and closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger in the night sky.\n\nSome astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit. By that definition, the full moon for July will also be considered a supermoon event, according to EarthSky.\n\nHere is the list of full moons for 2023, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac:\n\nJanuary 6: Wolf moon\n\nFebruary 5: Snow moon\n\nMarch 7: Worm moon\n\nApril 6: Pink moon\n\nMay 5: Flower moon\n\nJune 3: Strawberry moon\n\nJuly 3: Buck moon\n\nAugust 1: Sturgeon moon\n\nAugust 30: Blue moon\n\nSeptember 29: Harvest moon\n\nOctober 28: Hunter’s moon\n\nNovember 27: Beaver moon\n\nDecember 26: Cold moon\n\nWhile these are the popularized names associated with the monthly full moon, each one carries its own significance across Native American tribes (with many also referred to by differing names).\n\nLunar and solar eclipses\n\nThere will be two solar eclipses and two lunar eclipses in 2023.\n\nA total solar eclipse will occur on April 20, visible to those in Australia, Southeast Asia and Antarctica. This kind of event occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, blocking out the sun.\n\nAnd for some skywatchers in Indonesia, parts of Australia and Papua New Guinea, it will actually be a hybrid solar eclipse. The curvature of Earth’s surface can cause some eclipses to shift between total and annular as the moon’s shadow moves across the globe, according to NASA.\n\nLike a total solar eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and the Earth during an annular eclipse — but it occurs when the moon is at or near its farthest point from Earth, according to NASA. This causes the moon to appear smaller than the sun, so it doesn’t completely block out our star and creates a glowing ring around the moon.\n\nA Western Hemisphere-sweeping annular solar eclipse will occur on October 14 and be visible across North, Central and South America.\n\nBe sure to wear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun’s light can be damaging to the eye.\n\nMeanwhile, a lunar eclipse can occur only during a full moon when the sun, Earth and moon align and the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. When this occurs, Earth casts two shadows on the moon during the eclipse. The partial outer shadow is called the penumbra; the full, dark shadow is the umbra.\n\nWhen the full moon moves into Earth’s shadow, it darkens, but it won’t disappear. Instead, sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere lights the moon in a dramatic fashion, turning it red — which is why the event is often referred to as a “blood moon.”\n\nDepending on the weather conditions in your area, it may be a rusty or brick-colored red. This happens because blue light undergoes stronger atmospheric scattering, so red light will be the most dominant color highlighted as sunlight passes through our atmosphere and casts it on the moon.\n\nA total lunar eclipse appeared in the skies of Canta, east of Lima on May 15, 2022. Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA penumbral lunar eclipse will occur on May 5 for those in Africa, Asia and Australia. This less dramatic version of a lunar eclipse happens when the moon moves through the penumbra, or the faint, outer part of Earth’s shadow.\n\nA partial lunar eclipse on October 28 will be visible to those in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of North America and much of South America. Partial eclipses occur when the sun, Earth and moon don’t completely align, so only part of the moon passes into shadow.\n\nMeteor showers\n\nThe new year kicks off with the Quadrantid meteor shower, which is expected to peak in the overnight hours between January 3 and 4 for those in North America, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nIt’s the first of 12 meteor showers throughout the year, although the next one, the Lyrid meteor shower, doesn’t peak until April.\n\nHere are peak dates of other showers to watch in 2023:\n\nLyrids: April 22-23\n\nEta Aquariids: May 5-6\n\nSouthern delta Aquariids: July 30-31\n\nAlpha Capricornids: July 30-31\n\nPerseids: August 12-13\n\nOrionids: October 20-21\n\nSouthern Taurids: November 4-5\n\nNorthern Taurids: November 11-12\n\nLeonids: November 17-18\n\nGeminids: December 13-14\n\nUrsids: December 21-22\n\nIf you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn’t littered with city lights. If you’re able to find an area unaffected by light pollution, meteors could be visible every couple of minutes from late evening until dawn.\n\nFind an open area with a wide view of the sky. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up. And give your eyes about 20 to 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness — without looking at your phone! — so the meteors will be easier to spot.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2018/01/30/super-blood-blue-moon-total-eclipse-wednesday-could-eclipsed-clouds/1076412001/", "title": "Still a chance to see super-blood-blue moon Wednesday despite ...", "text": "Amateur astronomers and stargazers in southern Wisconsin had to contend with cloudy skies during the total lunar eclipse early Wednesday.\n\nClouds arrived in Milwaukee just as the rare super-blood-blue moon passes directly behind the Earth.\n\nThe super moon was visable from time to time through breaks in the clouds.\n\nBob Bonadurer, director of the Milwaukee Public Museum's Daniel M. Soref National Geographic Dome Theater & Planetarium, said folks who want to see it shouldn't be dissuaded by the forecast. He encourages them to get up early and look up, just in case clouds don't materialize or clear up when the eclipse starts at 5:48 a.m.\n\nRELATED:How to photograph, make the super-blood-blue-moon total eclipse a family event\n\nIf skies are clear or partially clear, Bonadurer will bring the museum's telescopes to the roof of the Urban Ecology Center at Riverside Park, 1500 E. Park Place, from 5:30 a.m. to 7 a.m. Wednesday for anyone who wants to see the blue moon total eclipse.\n\nThere's a reason the phrase \"once in a blue moon\" means something rare, but what about two blue moons happening in the same year?\n\nIs twice in a blue moon even a thing?\n\nWhile a blue moon — the second of two full moons occurring in the same month — happens roughly every 2½ years, the phenomenon of two blue moons in a calendar year appears only a handful of times a century.\n\nIt's happening this year.\n\nFull moons on Jan. 1 and 31 will be followed by full moons on March 1 and March 31. The last time two blue moons happened in the same year was 1999.\n\n\"It's because every 19 years the sun and moon match up again,\" said Bonadurer.\n\n\"It's not going to turn blue. That's just an expression that came up in the 1940s by a writer in Sky and Telescope magazine and it kind of stuck,\" Bonadurer said.\n\nThere's an added bonus for stargazers, astronomy nerds and telescope aficionados — the blue moon on Wednesday will feature a total lunar eclipse. Plus, it will be a super moon, appearing about 7% bigger than normal.\n\nAnd because the heavenly orb will turn a reddish/orange color, which makes it look like the moon is rusting, a total lunar eclipse is often called a blood moon. In Bonadurer's monthly newsletter to Milwaukee Public Museum planetarium visitors and astronomy fans, he's calling Wednesday's event a \"super, blue, blood moon.\"\n\nThe phenomenon of the moon turning into a blood orange is caused by red light bending as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere and reflecting on the moon's surface.\n\nFull moons materialize once every 29.5 days or so, which makes it unusual for two to fit in one month.\n\nNew and full moons realign on or near the same dates once every 19 years. There are 235 full moons during the 228 months of the 19-year period, which means at least seven of those months will have two full moons.\n\nEach full moon features a name, such as Wolf Moon for January, Snow Moon for February and Harvest Moon for September. Blue Moon was used in years with 13 full moons. That led to an article in Sky and Telescope Magazine in the 1940s that dubbed the second full moon in a month as a blue moon.\n\nFor Wednesday's total eclipse of the blue moon, viewers will be able to see it early in the morning though in Wisconsin it will be low in the western sky. In Milwaukee the eclipse will start at 5:48 a.m. and totality will begin at 6:51 a.m. and last until the moon sets at 7:06 a.m., said Bonadurer.\n\nThe best viewing will be from a tall structure because the moon will be so low on the horizon. But there's no need to move into the countryside away from light pollution.\n\n\"The best thing about this, with lunar eclipses it doesn't matter where you are because the moon is so bright and visible,\" Bonadurer said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/01/30/what-las-crucens-should-know-super-blue-blood-moon/1077136001/", "title": "A Las Cruces guide to the upcoming Super Blue Blood Moon", "text": "Diana Alba Soular\n\nLas Cruces Sun-News\n\nLAS CRUCES - Las Crucens on Wednesday morning will have a chance to see a rare Super Blue Blood Moon that will make an appearance in New Mexico skies.\n\nThree overlapping characteristics join to create the label:\n\na super moon, meaning the full moon is closer to Earth than at other times and so appears brighter;\n\na blue moon, a title given when there are two full moons in the same month; and\n\na blood moon, which means the moon will have a reddish hue, thanks to a lunar eclipse.\n\nThe supermoon is visible throughout Tuesday night going into Wednesday morning. Although also labeled a \"blue moon,\" the term doesn't have anything to do with the moon's color. The eclipse starts in Wednesday's early hours.\n\nMore:Triple treat: Supermoon, blue moon and lunar eclipse all coming to a sky near you this week\n\nEarly-morning eclipse\n\nThe earliest stage of the eclipse is when the moon enters an outer, faint shadow cast by the Earth blocking the sun's light.\n\nBut what usually garners the most attention from observers is when the Earth's darker shadow appears, slated for 4:48 a.m., experts said.\n\n\"It will start looking like there's a piece taken out of the upper left part of moon,\" said Rich Richins, vice president of the Astronomical Society of Las Cruces. \"Then, the darkness will spread out across the moon, down to the right.\"\n\nThe dark shadow will completely cover the moon at 5:51 a.m., the start of the total eclipse. It will have an orange-ish or reddish color because sunlight passing through Earth's atmosphere still reaches the moon's face, hence the nickname \"blood moon,\" experts said.\n\nLook west\n\nJames McAteer, associate professor of astronomy at New Mexico State University, said Las Crucens wanting to view the eclipse should look to the western horizon. They won't need any binoculars or a telescope.\n\n\"Get up early and look west,\" he said. \"It will be the full moon; it will not be hard to find.\"\n\nThe moon will set on the western horizon, just before the end of the total lunar eclipse stage. Morning sunlight will be appearing, too, on the eastern horizon. Both McAteer and Richins said this could create an interesting visual dynamic.\n\n\"It may be a nice contrast across the sky,\" McAteer said. \"A lot of that depends on the way the sunlight is coming in and whether there's clouds and whether there's ice particles in the air and so on.\"\n\nObjects close to the viewer, such as tall trees, might obscure a portion of the eclipse. So an open space will offer the best view.\n\nMostly clear skies\n\nThe forecast for Tuesday night and Wednesday morning in Las Cruces is for \"mostly clear\" skies, according to the National Weather Service, so cloud cover likely won't pose a hurdle to seeing the moon. The nighttime low is expected to dip into the 30s.\n\nThe western United States won't be able to view all stages of the eclipse because the moon sets before they're finished. From locations in the Pacific Ocean, viewers will be able to see all the stages.\n\n\"We don't get to see the entire event,\" Richins said. \"We're going to get to see the best part of it.\"\n\nDiana Alba Soular may be reached at 575-541-5443, dalba@lcsun-news.com or @AlbaSoular on Twitter.\n\nTotal Lunar Eclipse of Jan. 31, 2018\n\nPrenumbral eclipse begins (Earth's faint shadow begins touching the moon's face.): 3:51 a.m.\n\nPartial eclipse begins (Earth's darker shadow touches a portion of moon's face, turning it red.): 4:48 a.m.\n\nTotal eclipse begins (Moon is completely red.): 5:51 a.m.\n\nMaximum (Midpoint of a total eclipse; moon is positioned near center of Earth's shadow.): 6:29 a.m.\n\nMoonset (Eclipse is no longer visible because moon sets.): 7:03 a.m.\n\nTotal eclipse ends (Moon has already set, so this is not visible.): 7:05 a.m.\n\nSource: Timeanddate.com\n\n---\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: Astronomical Society of Las Cruces monthly stargazing event\n\nWhen: Dusk on Saturday, Feb. 10\n\nWhere: Leasburg Dam State Park near Radium Springs, off Interstate 25 north of Las Cruces\n\nInfo:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2018/01/03/astronomical-highlights-2018/1000963001/", "title": "Astronomy calendar 2018: Blue moon, blood moon, lunar eclipse ...", "text": "Dean Regas\n\nSpecial to Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nTwo blue moons, a lunar eclipse, an August meteor shower and the return of Mars are the headliners for another full year of astronomical wonders. Get out your calendars and get ready for the following astronomical highlights of 2018.\n\nThe astronomical event in 2018 that may go viral may only happen once in a blue moon. On the morning of Jan. 31, we will have a lunar eclipse. This happens when Earth comes between the sun and moon and casts its shadow onto the lunar surface. During a total lunar eclipse, the moon turns an eerie shade of orange that some people call a “blood moon.” It is definitely on the top 10 list of every stargazer to see. However, if you are looking for it on the eastern half of the country, you will see only part of the moon eclipsed. The moon will set just before totality. But if you live in the western half of the U.S., you will see the total eclipse just before sunrise.\n\nMore:SpaceX shows off stunning video of Falcon Heavy\n\nMore: Tech to watch for in 2018\n\nEvery lunar eclipse occurs on a full moon, but what’s going to make this lunar eclipse extra special is that Jan. 31 is the second full moon of the calendar month, making it a blue moon. A blue moon does not actually turn the color blue. It is just a made-up name. Nevertheless, the combination of a “blue moon” and a “blood moon” might make the internet explode.\n\nIf you miss the blue moon on Jan. 31, there will be another one on March 31. There will be a full moon on March 1 and 31 this year. And that means that the month of February will have no full moons. This rare non-occurrence has not happened since 2009.\n\nMarsapalooza\n\nAfter a long hiatus from the evening sky, all five naked-eye planets will be visible this year after sunset. First to return is Mercury, which will shine at dusk the week of March 15. Next comes Venus, which will cozy up to Mercury and the crescent moon on March 18. That will be the start of Venus viewing season when the dazzlingly bright planet will grace the western sky every evening until October.\n\nOn May 9, Jupiter will be at its closest point to Earth for the year and will look exceptionally bright in the southeastern sky after sunset that entire month. You will also be able to spot Jupiter right next to the moon on June 23, July 20, Aug. 16 and Sept. 13.\n\nThe ringed planet Saturn will be at its best for viewing on June 27 when the nearly full moon will be just above it. Since you will be able to find Saturn all summer long in the southern sky, make a point to look at it through a telescope this year.\n\nHowever, the big planetary news is that the Red Planet is back. Mars, always a crowd favorite, will be a mere 35.8 million miles from Earth on July 27. This is the closest pass for Mars since 2003. You will notice it in July rising in the east late at night, and throughout August after sunset as a bright, orange, unblinking star. On the night of closest approach, July 27, Mars will also be in conjunction with the full moon. The pair will make a dramatic sight and kick off a month of Mars-watching some astronomers call “Marsapalooza.”\n\nMeteors\n\nThe Perseid Meteor shower this August could be the best shooting star show of the year. The Perseids peak on the night of Aug. 12 and into the morning of Aug. 13. Get out of the city and find a dark spot to view. The moon will be out of the way so you may be able to see even the fainter shooting stars. Whether you moon-gaze, stargaze or Mars-gaze, there is always lots to see when you keep looking up.\n\nDean Regas is the Astronomer for the Cincinnati Observatory, co-host of PBS’ Star Gazers, and author of the books 100 Things to See in the Night Sky and Facts from Space!

It appears that the magazine has assigned a numerical score of “zero” to data that was either unavailable to them or that was inaccurately provided to them by a third party. The Class of 2019 will be our third graduating class. Last year, Newark Charter School was listed as “unranked” by this publication as is MOT Charter High School this year. The rankings are calculated based on the 2016-2017 school year. That is the first year that our school would be eligible to be ranked, if the data were accurate. Newark Charter School can provide the accurate data for that year but we were never asked to provide it. Nor were we asked to verify the information coming from a third party. As a result, for two of five key indicators used by U.S. News, our ranking appears to be incorrectly calculated using “zero” instead of using the available correct information. Therefore, the ranking that is being reported nationally and locally is significantly different from what we believe it should be based on the actual data. We are checking to see if other indicator scores for our school are accurate. For example, the graduation rate for Newark Charter School for 2017 is reported by U.S. News as 98%. The accurate number is 100%. Our school has been in contact with the Delaware Department of Education and they, too, are questioning this ranking based on their own available data and are trying to ascertain where the errors occurred. This concerns us very much, as it would concern any other school.\"\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

So how did Delaware colleges rank?\n\nBoth the University of Delaware and Delaware State University saw incremental changes this year, with UD faltering slightly while DSU improved in multiple categories.\n\nThe University of Delaware came in No. 40 among public schools in the United States – a five-way tie with Auburn University, University of California, University of California Santa Cruz, and University of Utah. UD has slipped in the rankings for a few years, ranking No. 39 last year and No. 38 the year before.\n\nTied among the same four schools, the University of Delaware also ranked 97th among all national universities, a dip from ranking No. 91 last year.\n\nLAST YEAR:Here's how Delaware colleges fared in this year's U.S. News rankings\n\nWhether UD is a private or public school has been a point of contention in the Legislature for years. The school argues that it is a “privately governed, state-assisted” university. Because UD offers in-state tuition, it is classified as a public university by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nPUBLIC OR PRIVATE?:Is UD public or private? 'We're special,' lawyer says, and have to agree to charter changes\n\nDelaware State University ranked No. 144 among public colleges, tied with nine other schools. DSU also sneaked into the national rankings to tie for 284th.\n\nAmong historically Black colleges and universities, DSU ranked No. 11 out of public and private schools and jumped to No. 3 out of public HBCUs nationally. Last year, the university ranked No. 4 among public schools.\n\nHowever, Delaware State also ranked No. 14 of national universities for students with the most debt – DSU graduates leave with a median federal loan debt of $27,000, according to the report.\n\nWesley College ranked second among northern regional colleges when it comes to debt, with graduates owing a median of $31,000 in federal loans.\n\nU.S. News ranks regionally accredited institutions that offer four-year undergraduate degrees. This year’s rankings evaluated more than 1,400 colleges and universities.
