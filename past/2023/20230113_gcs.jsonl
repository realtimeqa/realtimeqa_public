The death toll in Erie County, which contains Buffalo – the area hardest hit in the storm – rose to 37on Wednesday, officials confirmed on Twitter.\n\nAlong with burying the city with more than 50 inches of snow since Christmas Eve, the storm carried frigid temperatures and extreme winds – with gusts measured stronger than 70 mph at times, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThose conditions were expected to dissipate Wednesday as temperatures rise into the 40s and 50s throughout the week. Some rain was in the forecast, which along with melted snow, could bring possible flooding.\n\n\"It looks like the worst could be behind them,\" Brian Thompson, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, told USA TODAY.\n\nConditions across the U.S. were also expected to warm, with some areas, including the Midwest, seeing temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above average, Thompson said.\n\nMeanwhile in the West, the National Weather Service said Wednesday morning that an active and powerful wet system is expected to hit the Western half of the country over the next few days – with forecasts of moderate to heavy rain, mountain snow, and potential flood risks.\n\nNumerous deaths were reported in Oregon as the storm brought powerful wind gusts.\n\nMore weather news from USA TODAY:\n\nWindy storm on West Coast leaves 5 dead\n\nDangerous wind gusts and snow in Oregon on Tuesday caused at least three fatal car accidents, according to preliminary police investigations.\n\nThree people were killed, including a 4-year-old girl, after a large tree fell on their pickup truck as they were driving on U.S. 26, about 15 miles east of the coastline, Oregon State Police said in a news release. All three were deceased when first responders arrived at the scene.\n\nAnother motorist was killed when a large tree fell on the cab of the commercial truck he was driving further east on U.S. 26 on Mount Hood, state police said. The 53-year-old driver was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nA driver was injured and a passenger died after a tree fell on their pickup truck while they were driving on Interstate 84 near Cascade Locks in the Columbia River Gorge, Oregon State Police said. The driver was taken to a hospital.\n\nAll incidents were attributed to severe weather, state police said.\n\nSouthwest cancels more flights\n\nSouthwest Airlines travelers were still struggling Wednesday with canceled flights and lost luggage.\n\nMore than 2,500 Southwest flights are canceled Wednesday, after roughly 5,600 cancellations across Monday and Tuesday, according to FlightAware, which tracks flight status in real time. FlightAware is already reporting more than 2,300 Southwest cancellations for Thursday.\n\n\"We are past the point where (Southwest) could say this is a weather-driven issue,\" U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg told Good Morning America on Wednesday, noting that, while the rest of the aviation system was down to a rate of about 4% of flights being canceled Wednesday morning, Southwest saw a rate higher than 60%.\n\n\"What this indicates is a system failure,\" Buttigieg told GMA. \"They need to make sure these stranded passengers get to where they need to go and that they're provided adequate compensation, not just for the flight itself... but also things like hotels, like ground transportation (and) meals – because this is the airline's responsibility.\"\n\nEarlier this week, President Joe Biden said his administration would hold airlines accountable for the mass cancellations. The Department of Transportation said it would examine Southwest Airlines' cancellations.\n\nAirlines could see further problems later in the week as temperatures rise east of the Rocky Mountains and fog becomes a larger factor.\n\nWHAT TRAVELERS SHOULD KNOW:Nearly 2/3 of Southwest flights canceled\n\nFLIGHTS CANCELED:1,000 Southwest flyers sleep overnight at Denver airport\n\nJoint inquiry into storm's widespread power outages\n\nThe winter storm that rattled much of the U.S. over the holiday weekend also left millions in the dark, with widespread power outages reported across the country.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, North American Electric Reliability Corporation and regional entities announced Wednesday that they would open a joint inquiry \"into the operations of the bulk power system during the extreme winter weather conditions that occurred\" during the winter storm.\n\nWhile most of the outages were from the weather's impact on local utilities' electric distribution facilities, the NERC noted that some utilities initiated rolling blackouts in some parts of the southeast, including Tennessee and North Carolina. In other regions, the bulk power system was also \"significantly stressed.\"\n\nThe winter storm's effects “demonstrate yet again that our bulk power system is critical to public safety and health,” FERC chairman Rich Glick said in a statement. “The joint inquiry with NERC we are announcing today will allow us to dig deeper into exactly what happened so we can further protect the reliability of the grid.”\n\nDeath toll increases as National Guard goes door to door\n\nThe death toll in Erie County rose to 37 on Wednesday, officials confirmed on Twitter.\n\nOf the 37 deaths, 29 were in Buffalo, 7 were in the suburbs and 1 is unknown, according to Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz. As of Wednesday night, there are multiple unidentified bodies.\n\nThe county is facing the possibility of finding more victims in the coming days. On Wednesday, the National Guard was going door to door in parts of Buffalo and its suburbs to check on people who had lost power.\n\nPoloncarz said that officials are \"fearful that there are (more) individuals who may have perished\" during the storm.\n\n\"I offer my deepest condolences and sympathies to the individuals who've lost loved ones,\" Poloncarz said Wednesday. \"I understand that every time that the Christmas season comes along people are going to remember the storm and the death of their loved one. And the stories are just heartbreaking. Just heartbreaking.\"\n\nPoloncarz pointed to the death of a man who went out into the storm \"to get food and provisions for his pregnant wife who was about to give birth ... (but) didn't make it back home.\" The Buffalo News reported that the man, identified as Abdul Sharifu, 26, was found dead outside on Saturday.\n\nSharifu's cousin, Ali Sharifu, told the outlet that Abdul Sharifu was working toward buying a home for his family and \"was so excited to become a father.\"\n\nOther victims were also identified by their families.\n\nCarolyn Eubanks, who relied on an oxygen machine, had collapsed after her Buffalo home lost power. At the time, emergency workers were unable to respond to calls, her son Antwaine Parker told The Buffalo News.\n\n“She’s like, ‘I can’t go no further.’ I’m begging her, ‘Mom, just stand up.’ She fell in my arms and never spoke another word,” Parker told the newspaper.\n\nMonique Alexander, 52, was found buried in snow after going out in the storm, her daughter Casey Maccarone told The Buffalo News. It is unknown why Alexander left her home.\n\nAnndel Taylor, 22, died in her car after it got stuck on her way home from work, her family told WSOC-TV.\n\nVictim identified in Niagara County\n\nThe Niagara County Sheriff's Office identified a 27-year-old man who was found dead on Dec. 25 in Lockport, New York, — a town about 29 miles northeast of Buffalo.\n\nPolice received reports of two individuals unconscious in a residence that was \"overcome with carbon monoxide,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nThe 27-year-old male was pronounced dead at the scene due to carbon monoxide poisoning and was later identified as Timothy M. Murphy. The other individual who was found at the scene has been identified as Kathy D. Murphy and is currently being treated at a hospital.\n\nHeavy rain, snow slams West Coast; thousands without power\n\nAtmospheric rivers were drenching the West Coast and the Rockies with heavy rain, winds, and snow throughout the week, experts say, leaving 11 states in the West under weather alerts Wednesday.\n\nThe next seven days will see rainfall totals ranging from two to six inches in coastal areas out West, \"with higher terrain expected to receive several feet of snow,\" the National Weather Service's Prediction Center said on Twitter.\n\nThe region, particularly parts of southern and central California, may also see some scattered flash floods, \"with the greatest chances for rapid runoff and debris flows near recent burn scars,\" the weather service said Wednesday morning.\n\n'A very wet system':West Coast drenched by atmospheric rivers, raising flood risks\n\nAmid the active wet system moving through the West, thousands have experienced power outages. About 100,000 electric customers in Washington, Oregon, and California combined were in the dark early Wednesday, according to counts by PowerOutage.us. By the afternoon, outages in the three states dropped to closer to 70,000.\n\nStorm surpasses death toll of 1977 Buffalo-area blizzard\n\nThe growing death toll in the Buffalo area reached a grim milestone Tuesday after it surpassed the death toll in the Blizzard of January 1977 – widely regarded as the region's worst storm in recent history that killed 29 people over four days, including 12 who were found frozen in stranded cars, The Associated Press reported.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials said the number of deaths increased from 31 to 34.\n\nThe storm had surprisingly little snowfall, only about 12 inches in Buffalo, but brought sustained, deadly cold temperatures into the area for weeks. Blizzard-condition winds lasted for nine consecutive hours, with zero visibility for 13 consecutive hours.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day\n\nPowerful winds instead blew loose snow from previous storms from frozen Lake Erie onto land, creating huge snowdrifts and fully burying houses and cars.\n\nThe 1977 \"storm is the benchmark storm for the Buffalo area,\" Thompson said. \"This storm certainly seems like it now has become the deadliest storm in the Buffalo area.\"\n\nThompson noted decades of blizzards across the U.S. that have left hundreds dead, including the 1993 Storm of the Century, which killed more than 300 people in more than a dozen states. It is regarded as the second-most costliest winter storm on record, according to federal weather records.\n\nContributing: Cady Stanton and Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/01/04/san-francisco-bay-area-brace-severe-weather-flooding-rain/10983813002/", "title": "Massive California storms pummels state with heavy rain and winds", "text": "Looking for updates on California storms? Follow our latest coverage here.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO – California declared a state of emergency Wednesday as a powerful storm generated 45-foot waves out at sea, dropped soaking rain on already saturated ground, and prompted warnings of floods and mudslides, knocking out power to more than 100,000 people.\n\nThe storm was expected to dump up to 6 inches of rain in parts of the San Francisco Bay Area where most of the region would remain under flood warnings into late Thursday night. In Southern California, the storm was expected to peak in intensity overnight into early Thursday morning with Santa Barbara and Ventura counties likely to see the most rain, forecasters said.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom authorized state National Guard units to support disaster response as a massive storm pummeled much of the state's coastline.\n\nFire and rescue equipment and personnel have been prepositioned in areas deemed most likely to experience severe flooding and mudflows.\n\nGRAPHICS:'Rivers in the sky': Graphics show atmospheric river soaking California's Bay Area\n\n\"If you've still got power, it's a good idea to charge your cellphone, computers and tablets now while you can,\" said National Weather Service meteorologist Cynthia Palmer in the agency's San Francisco area office. If the power goes out, having access to timely information about the storm – and something to watch – will be useful, she said.\n\nThe storm is termed a \"bomb cyclone\" because it is expected to be marked by a quick drop in atmospheric pressure resulting in a high-intensity storm.\n\n\"All told it's about a 30-hour event from start to finish,\" said Rick Canepa, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's San Francisco office. \"The rain won't be done until Thursday afternoon or early evening.\"\n\nSevere weather could drop 10 or more inches of rain in some parts of Northern California over the next week, forecasters say. Wednesday's storm was expected to knock down trees, cause widespread flooding, wash out roads, cause hillsides to collapse, slow airports and potentially lead to the \"loss of human life,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut officials warn even then the danger isn't over. Forecasters are watching other systems out at sea that could also hit the region with more precipitation.\n\nMeanwhile, California wasn't the only place facing severe weather on Wednesday. A possible tornado touched down near Montgomery, Alabama, early Wednesday. There were no deaths but the twister damaged more than 50 homes.\n\nFlood-related deaths confirmed in Sacramento; motorists rescued\n\nTwo more bodies were found Wednesday after flooding in a rural part of south Sacramento County, authorities said, bringing the death toll from the atmospheric river storm on New Year's Eve to three.\n\nThe third body was found in a vehicle that was submerged in water , said Sgt. Amar Gandhi, a Sacramento County Sheriff's Office spokesman.\n\nThe victim had not been identified and there was no additional information about the incident, Gandhi said Wednesday night.\n\nDuring the morning, California Highway Patrol officers found the body of a woman while recovering vehicles that got stuck due to flooding.\n\nOn Sunday, authorities discovered the body of a man inside a submerged vehicle. Gandhi said rescue efforts in Sacramento County are ongoing.\n\nElsewhere across Northern California communities, several motorists were rescued from flooded roads and fallen trees.\n\nThe San Francisco Fire Department rescued a family Wednesday night after fallen trees on a city road trapped the family.\n\nCalifornia residents face outages\n\nWith heavy rain saturating the ground and strong winds, trees are more likely to fall and can cause widespread power outages, according to Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources.\n\nOfficials and power companies warned residents to prepare for possible outages due to the storm by creating emergency kits and keeping essential devices charged.\n\nNearly 178,000 homes and businesses were in the dark Wednesday night, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages. Most outages were reported on the north coast of the state.\n\nHelping homeless people from storm\n\nAt the foot of San Francisco’s Bernal Heights neighborhood, Magaly Rowell waited for her bus under an umbrella at what passes for a bus shelter next to Precita Park. She was defying the elements not because of her job at a security company, but to feed homeless people at a nearby church, something Rowell said she does daily.\n\n“It’s not so bad if there’s no wind,” Rowell said as her umbrella got pelted by the rain and torrents of water flowed down Folsom Street. “It gets harder when the wind picks up like today. I worry about the homeless people. They’re the ones who suffer the most when the weather gets like this.”\n\nEvacuations ordered in coastal cities\n\nOfficials in Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara issued evacuation orders Wednesday as the huge storm puts the coastal areas at high risk due to potential mudslides and flooding.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders were issued for those living in burn scar areas in Santa Barbara County due to potential flooding and debris flows, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown announced during a Wednesday news conference.\n\nThe Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office issued numerous evacuation orders for southern parts of the county throughout Wednesday due to concerns over potential flooding and debris flow from storm conditions.\n\nFlight disruptions amid powerful storm\n\nWith its high winds and heavy rains, the storm is already causing flight disruptions in the Bay Area with more anticipated to come as the peak approaches.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, San Francisco International Airport has experienced 74 flight cancellations, accounting for 8% of all flights.\n\nAbout 191 flights have been delayed by an average of 35 minutes, according to Doug Yakel, a public information officer for the airport. \"Delays and cancellations are a result of both the reduced ceilings and winds,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\n\"In regards to general airport operations here at OAK, our operations team is prepared,\" a spokesperson for Oakland International Airport told USA TODAY. Passengers with flights to and from Oakland are strongly encouraged to check with their airline through their mobile app or website for updates on their flights.\n\nTravel waivers for flights disrupted by California's \"bomb cyclone\":\n\nSouthwest Airlines is offering free rebooking for flights scheduled for Wednesday, for flights to and from Oakland, Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose. The rebooking must have the same city pairs and travel dates within 14 days of the original travel date.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Delta Air Lines issued a travel waiver for flights scheduled on Thursday and Friday to or from San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento, San Jose, and Fresno. The fare difference will be waived when the rebooked travel takes place on or before Jan. 8.\n\nResidents brace for floods\n\nIn San Francisco, customers at Papenhausen Hardware were most worried about flooding, said store co-owner Karl Aguilar.\n\n“Last week a fair amount of people were focused on the roofs – small leaks, windows, things like that,’’ Aguilar said. “There was a point where it transitioned and people became much more concerned with flooding mitigation. This particular storm, it’s all flood mitigation.’’\n\nA few doors to the east, Grace Daryanani at Bulls Head restaurant has sandbags and wet/dry vacuum cleaners at the ready. Her space has flooded in big storms before but she's hoping a new outdoor dining area might divert some of the water.\n\n“Maybe that will help,\" she said.\n\nLEARN MORE:What is a bomb cyclone?\n\nWEATHER TERMS:What is an 'atmospheric river'?\n\nWind gusts as high as 80 mph\n\nForecasters warned of flood threats and issued high wind warnings in the lead-up to the storm. The National Weather Service in the Bay Area delivered a rare admonition saying the coming \"brutal\" storm system \"needs to be taken seriously.\"\n\n\"Honestly, the biggest story right now is the winds,\" said Palmer. Coastal areas could be hit with winds in the 40 to 50 mph range, while some mountain areas could get gusts as high as 80 mph.\n\nFlooding and landslides likely\n\nBecause the ground was already saturated with the more than 5 inches of rain that fell on New Year's Eve, Wednesday's storm could cause severe problems and damage in some areas.\n\n\"The main concern is the smaller watersheds and steep slopes. So mudslides, shallow landslides and urban and small creek flooding could get quite significant for a period of time on Wednesday night in some locations,\" said Daniel Swain, a climatologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nSevere weather, possible tornadoes in South\n\nThe South, too, was being hit with intense weather Wednesday. Heavy rains, flash floods and severe weather were seen in a swath across Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina.\n\nA possible tornado touched down in east Montgomery, Alabama at 3:14 a.m. on Wednesday.\n\nRodney Penn, who was home when the storm hit, said a fallen tree limb broke out the windows in his wife's car but there was no structural damage to his apartment.\n\n“It literally sounded like there were a thousand baseball bats hitting the side of the house at the same time,” Penn said.\n\nIn South Carolina, five counties were under a tornado watch Wednesday.\n\nHeavy rain in California not an end to drought in West\n\nThe extreme drought conditions California has struggled under are helping avert some possible flooding because many of the state's larger reservoirs are still quite low, said Swain.\n\n\"They have a lot of headroom right now to absorb a lot of water,\" he said.\n\nThe state finds itself in the middle of a flood emergency even as it's in the middle of a drought emergency, Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"A lot of our trees are stressed after three years of intensive drought, the ground is saturated and there is a significant chance of downed trees that will create significant problems, potentially flooding problems, potentially power problems,\" she said.\n\nWhile the rains are likely to alleviate the short-term drought in Northern California along the coast, they will do little in terms of bringing drought relief to the West as a whole.\n\n\"It won't really help move the needle in the Colorado basin but it certainly will in central and northern California,\" Swain said.\n\nMore water is on the way\n\nThere are two more possible storms also out in the Pacific, one that could arrive late Friday and run into Sunday and then another possible storm that could arrive Tuesday, Canepa said.\n\nBoth could bring higher-than-normal rain levels through the middle of January.\n\nThere's a wide range of uncertainty for next week, ranging from a couple of additional moderate storms which wouldn't cause too many problems to one or possibly more atmospheric river events.\n\nWhat's an atmospheric river?\n\nThe storm, the second of three or possibly four headed toward the California coast, is coming from across the Pacific ocean. It's what's known as an atmospheric river or, to use the term more common a few years ago, a Pineapple Express because it originates over Hawaii.\n\nThese storms bring heavy rainfall and occur when a line of warm, moist air flows from near the islands across the Pacific Ocean to the West Coast.\n\nWhen it reaches the cooler air over the western landmass, the water vapor falls as heavy rain. Atmospheric rivers are long, flowing regions of the atmosphere that carry water vapor across a swath of sky 250 to 375 miles wide. They can be more than 1,000 miles long – and can carry more water than the Mississippi River.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver and Kathleen Wong, USA TODAY; Evan Mealins and Alex Gladden, Montgomery Advertiser; Hannah Workman, The Record", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/12/06/hawaii-blizzard-warning-canceled-flooding-looms/8889082002/", "title": "Hawaii blizzard: Warning canceled; storms, flooding loom for islands", "text": "A powerful storm system pounded Hawaii on Monday with heavy rain, and forecasters warned of a chance for \"dangerous\" and \"catastrophic\" flooding in some parts of the state throughout Monday night and well into Tuesday.\n\nMore than 2 feet of rain is possible in some areas; widespread amounts of 10 to 15 inches are likely.\n\n\"Expect widespread heavy rainfall with this system, especially under the large heavy rain band, capable of producing catastrophic flooding, and strong gusty southerly winds through Wednesday,\" the National Weather Service in Honolulu said.\n\nFlood watches have been issued for all of the islands and will remain in effect until Tuesday, AccuWeather said.

David Ige declared a state of emergency for the entire state Monday afternoon and urged residents to prepare for major flooding, landslides, road closures and damage to homes.\n\n“Now is the time to make sure you have an emergency plan in place and supplies ready should you need to move away from rising water,” the governor said in a news release.\n\nThe state of emergency will continue through Dec. 10.\n\nSuch heavy rain could cause flooding in areas that don't normally flood, the National Weather Service warned, and numerous landslides are expected.\n\n\"Low spots in roads will become dangerous and impassable due to severe runoff. Debris in streams and gulches may clog bridges and culverts resulting in dangerous flooding,\" the Weather Service said.\n\nOn Oahu, where four shelters had been opened, most of the beaches in Waikiki were empty Monday as only a few people walked with umbrellas during passing heavy showers. Roadways were flooding in the area and cars crept through downtown as water gushed out of manhole covers.\n\nOn Maui, power outages and flooding already have been reported, with more than a foot (30 centimeters) of rain falling in some areas.\n\nThe relentless rain forced three couples from the U.S. mainland to postpone their Maui elopements, said Nicole Bonanno, owner of Bella Bloom Floral, a wedding florist and boutique in Wailea.\n\nPublic schools in Hawaii's Maui County were closed Monday, CNN said.\n\nAs a precaution, the city and county of Honolulu planned to open four emergency shelters ahead of the Kona low storm, which is expected to hit Oahu starting tonight, Honolulu mayor Rick Blangiardi tweeted Monday morning.\n\nKona low storms are a type of seasonal cyclone in the Hawaiian Islands, usually formed in the winter from winds coming from the westerly \"Kona\" direction, the weather service said. Kona lows often bring about wet and unsettled weather.\n\nHawaii blizzard:Hawaii under blizzard warning with 12 inches of snow and winds up to 100 mph expected\n\nAlthough the blizzard warning for the summits of Hawaii's Big Island was canceled early Monday, it continued to snow there. An additional 4 inches of snow was possible, the Weather Service said.\n\n\"Although Hawaii has the reputation of year-round warmth, snow actually makes a yearly appearance atop some of its highest peaks,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Lauren Hyde said.\n\nBlizzard warnings for Hawaii are rare but not unheard of.

However, no major or widespread flooding is forecast.\n\nThe Willamette River in Salem is expected to crest at about about 19 feet on Sunday — meaning it will be very high but not at action or flood stages that tend to bring heavier impact.\n\nHigher in the mountains, however, travel could become more challenging. A winter storm warning remains in effect through Wednesday for snowfall totaling 8 to 15 inches on Oregon's highest Cascade Range summits including Santiam Pass (Highway 20) and Willamette Pass (Highway 58).

In addition to rain, wind gusts up to 60 mph will occur in western Washington, Oregon and, Northern California.\n\nOver a foot of snowfall is also possible across the highest peaks of the Sierra Nevada by the middle of the week, according to AccuWeather.\n\nWhat is an atmospheric river?\n\nAtmospheric rivers have been said to be the cause of big weather issues along the West Coast during the winter. They are like \"rivers in the sky,\" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and are responsible for up to 65% of the western USA's extreme rain and snow events, a 2017 study said.\n\nAtmospheric rivers are ribbons of water vapor that can extend thousands of miles from the tropics to the western U.S. They are able to pick up water vapor from warm, moist air of tropical regions and then drop the water over land in cooler regions as rain or snow.\n\nLOOMING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA?:Experts warn of a disaster 'larger than any in world history.'

An apparent tornado at North Perry Airport in Broward County caused “significant damage” to several aircraft and hangars, Mayor Michael Udine said on Twitter.\n\nThe Category 3 storm was churning 120 mph winds Tuesday night with its center roughly 180 miles south-southwest of the city of Punta Gorda, close to where it’s expected to make landfall in less than 24 hours. City authorities there announced Tuesday night emergency services, including police and fire response will be suspended until after the storm passes, when it will be safe to resume response calls again.\n\nFor days, forecasters and Florida officials have warned this will be a dangerous storm with life-threatening storm surge and flooding and fierce winds. Tuesday night, Ian’s hurricane-force winds extended 40 miles out from its center and tropical storm-force winds extended roughly 140 miles out, with some parts of the Florida Keys reporting wind gusts stronger than 50 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n“I implore, I urge everyone that is in an evacuation zone that has been asked to evacuate – the time is now. You must evacuate now. There will be a time when it will not be safe to travel the roads,” Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie warned in a news conference Tuesday evening.\n\n“There will come a point in time when local public safety officials will not be able to respond to your cry for help. You may be left to fend for yourself,” he added.\n\nIan will likely make landfall Wednesday afternoon to evening between Sarasota and Port Charlotte as a Category 3 or Category 4 hurricane. (Hurricanes are designated as Category 4 when winds reach speeds of 130 mph to 156 mph.) Whichever of the two it is, one forecaster warned the storm still be a “large and destructive hurricane” for the state, urging residents to listen to local leaders’ advice.\n\nAnd it’s not just southwest Florida taking a hit.\n\n“This is going to be a lot of impacts that will be felt far and wide throughout the state of Florida,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said in Tuesday evening’s news conference. “As the storm moves in, you’re going to potentially have (evacuation) directives issued from folks in the interior of our state or even the east coast of the state for low-lying areas that absolutely could end up flooding.”\n\nAll of Cuba in the dark\n\nIan made landfall in Cuba earlier Tuesday as a Category 3 hurricane. Tuesday night, Cuban state media reported the entire island was in a nationwide blackout. Cuban officials said the hurricane caused the power outage and they hoped to begin restoring electricity late Tuesday or early Wednesday.\n\nEarlier, state electric company Unión Eléctrica de Cuba said they would keep power off in Havana to avoid deaths and property damage until the weather improved. The company said they had turned the power off in the area ahead of the storm to avoid electrocutions and to prevent fires.\n\nCuba’s tobacco-rich Pinar del Rio province lost power because of the storm, according to Cuban state television. Floodwater covered fields and fallen trees lay in front of buildings in San Juan y Martinez, a town in the province, images from state media outlet Cubadebate show.\n\nUp to 16 inches of rain and mudslides and flash flooding were possible in western Cuba, the hurricane center said. Mayelin Suarez, a resident of Pinar del Rio city, told Reuters the storm made for the darkest night of her life.\n\n“We almost lost the roof off our house,” Suarez told Reuters. “My daughter, my husband and I tied it down with a rope to keep it from flying away.”\n\nA man walks down a street in Havana, Cuba, on Tuesday during Hurricane Ian. Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘It’s becoming too late’\n\nOf the 2.5 million Floridians under some kind of evacuation directive, more than 1.75 million were under mandatory evacuation orders Tuesday afternoon. Most were in Lee County, which encompasses Fort Myers.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders were issued for parts of counties in the hurricane warning area stretching from north of Tampa to the Fort Myers area. That included Pinellas, Hillsborough and Manatee counties in the Tampa area, Hernando, Sarasota and Charlotte counties, and parts of Lee County. Emergency shelters have been opened.\n\nIn Pinellas County, where more than 440,000 people are under mandatory evacuations, Clearwater Mayor Frank Hibbard told CNN Tuesday afternoon it was becoming too late for residents to leave.\n\n“If you have not yet evacuated, if you have not yet gotten supplies, it’s becoming too late. You just need to shelter-in-place and wait out the storm,” the mayor said.\n\nState agencies were also working to help prepare and protect senior residents, conducting on-site visits to nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the path of the storm.\n\nAhead of the storm, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also issued a state of emergency Tuesday, warning of heavy rainfall and damaging winds in the state later in the week.\n\nSign up for CNN’s free Weather Brief newsletter to get email updates on Hurricane Ian.\n\nWhat the threats are\n\nThe approaching storm threatens several perils for west-central Florida:\n\n• Storm surge: A storm surge warning – meaning the surge could threaten life – is in effect for much of Florida’s west coast, from Suwanee in the Big Bend region to the peninsula’s tip in the Everglades.\n\nA warning also is in effect for far northeastern Florida’s coast, from near the Georgia state line down to Marineland, as well as for St. John’s River further inland.\n\nThe worst – 8 to 12 feet – is forecast for Florida’s west coast from just south of Bradenton down to Bonita Beach south of Fort Myers, the hurricane center said. Large storm surge also is possible in areas outside that zone, including Tampa Bay.\n\nForecasters in South Florida warned the storm surge could damage buildings and wash many away.\n\nA broken section of road and destroyed houses are seen in Matlacha, Florida, on Saturday, October 1.

More than double the normal amount of rain has fallen over southern Florida in the past two weeks, with widespread amounts of more than 6 inches of water dumped over some areas. Multiple rivers across central and western Florida are also already above flood stage as Ian makes its way to the state, boosting flood risks further.\n\n• Damaging winds: A hurricane warning – meaning winds of at least 74 mph are expected – covers about 8 million people in parts of west and central Florida – including an area from the Anclote River north of Tampa to Bonita Beach south of Fort Myers.\n\nThe National Weather Service for Miami and South Florida said powerful winds could damage buildings and blow off roofs, completely destroy mobile homes and leave some locations “uninhabitable for weeks or months.”\n\n“You’re really looking at a multihazard, multiday-long event here in much of the western and central Florida Peninsula,” Michael Brennan, acting deputy director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told CNN on Tuesday morning.\n\nClosures, flight cancellations ahead of Ian\n\nThe hurricane’s menacing approach to Florida triggered preparations across the state as officials announced school closures and flight cancellations, and the military began moving ships and aircraft.\n\nAll along Florida’s west coast, officials are urging residents to get out of harm’s way instead of staying to protect their property.\n\nTampa International Airport suspended operations at 5 p.m. Tuesday; Orlando International Airport is scheduled to do the same at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nAround the state, residents were waiting in long lines Monday to fill bags of sand or pick up bottled water in preparation for the storm’s arrival.\n\nResident Khadijah Jones told CNN she was in line for three hours Monday to get free sandbags in Tampa, uncertain if her home will flood. “Just doing the basics … securing loose materials in the yard, sandbags in low areas, and getting items to prep for no power,” she said.\n\nAs the storm approached a slew of closures and cancellations were announced.\n\nThe HCA Florida Pasadena Hospital in St. Petersburg announced it has suspended services and transferred patients.\n\nA utility pole lies on the street in Consolacion del Sur, Cuba, on Tuesday as Hurricane Ian passes.

The Sheriff’s Office said it’s in “call triage mode” and getting numerous calls of people trapped by water.\n\n“At this point the majority of our 911 calls are water rescues,” Collier County Sheriff’s Office Chief Stephanie Spell told CNN in a phone call.\n\nA broken section of road and destroyed houses are seen in Matlacha, Florida, on Saturday, October 1.

We are still collecting numbers from other areas. We are still rescuing people.”\n\n“Some are reporting life threatening medical emergencies in deep water. We will get to them first. Some are reporting water coming into their house but not life threatening. They will have to wait. Possibly until the water recedes,” a post on the county’s Facebook page read.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Lee County’s 911 system is down and calls are be rerouted to Collier County Sheriff, according to the post. “You can’t imagine the calls,” the post read.\n\nA mandatory curfew was put in place for all of Collier County beginning at 10 p.m. Wednesday and ending at 6 a.m. Thursday, the county government tweeted Wednesday.\n\nLee and Charlotte counties have also implemented curfews. Lee County’s began at 6 p.m. and is in place until further notice, while Charlotte County’s begins at 9 p.m. and ends at 6 a.m.\n\nCity of Naples Fire Rescue posted video of a water rescue in Naples, Florida. City of Naples Fire Rescue\n\nIn Punta Gorda, CNN’s Randi Kaye took shelter in a parking garage as she described how the streets were devoid of people and cars. Trees were either knocked down or standing and stripped bare. Debris could also be seen flying down the street and the only vehicle visible in the city had “STORMCHASER” written on the side.\n\nThe storm made landfall as a Category 4 near Cayo Costa around 3:05 p.m., with winds near 150 mph, according to the hurricane center. At this point, Hurricane Ian is tied for the strongest storm to make landfall on the west coast of the Florida peninsula, matching the wind speed of Hurricane Charley in 2004. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday Ian will rank as one of the top five hurricanes to ever hit the Florida peninsula, behind Hurricanes Andrew (1992) and Michael (2018).\n\nIan weakened to a Category 1 hurricane by Wednesday night as it moved across central Florida, churning sustained winds of 90 mph.\n\nNearly 2 million Florida utility customers were without power as of 6 p.m., according to PowerOutage.us. Officials in Cape Coral and Punta Gorda reported significant impacts, and the storm surge set records for the highest water levels ever observed in Fort Myers and Naples.\n\n“The storm surge is very significant. We’re seeing cars and boats float down the street. We’re seeing trees nearly bent in half,” Frank Loni, an architect from California staying in Fort Myers Beach for the storm, said midday Wednesday. “There’s quite a bit of chaos on the streets.”\n\nDeSantis said storm surge from Ian has hit up to 12 feet in some areas.”It is our meteorologist’s view that the storm surge has likely peaked and will be less in the coming hours,” he said.\n\nIan is expected to retain hurricane strength through the day and into tomorrow as the center of the storm moves northeast over the Florida Peninsula, passing close to Orlando and Daytona Beach, before moving back into the Atlantic Ocean Thursday afternoon. Hurricane warnings have been issued for not only southwest Florida, but also much of central Florida from coast to coast.\n\nA number of other weather advisories have also been issued throughout Florida. A flash flood emergency impacting more than 300,000 people is in effect south central Sarasota county, southeast Manatee, northwest Desoto, Hardee, and northwest Highlands counties through 10:45 p.m..\n\nAn extreme wind warning is in effect for Sebrin, Avon Park and Arcadia until 9:30 p.m. for extremely dangerous hurricane winds as the storm passes.\n\n‘The worst storm I have ever seen’\n\nWater levels in Fort Myers rose more than 6 feet over the span of seven hours and were still rising as strong winds continue to push water from the Gulf of Mexico ashore, according to CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller.\n\n“I’ve been here since the mid-70s, this is actually – by far – the worst storm I have ever seen,” Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nAbout 96% of Fort Myers is without electricity, Anderson told CNN’s Anderson Cooper late Wednesday. The mayor does not know how many people did not heed evacuation orders, but there are thousands currently in shelters.\n\nAnderson also emphasized that it is still unsafe to be outside and that people should stay away from floodwaters.\n\n“There’s no telling what’s in those waters, they are not safe. You know you could step on debris. You know, there’s runoff from sewers and just – it’s just not a good situation,” he said.\n\nJennifer Dexter, a spokesperson for the town of Fort Myers Beach, told CNN backup water pumps are down.\n\n“When the backup water pump system goes down, that shows you how serious it is,” Dexter said. A boil water notice went into effect due to storm surge, loss of power and damage to the backup generators for the drinking water supply.\n\nPresident Biden spoke with the mayor Wednesday, the White House said in a statement. The two leaders “discussed Fort Myers’ ongoing needs including support for the elderly members of the community, families that live in mobile homes and other community members who are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the storm,” according to a readout of the call provided by the White House.\n\nThe President also tried to reach the mayors of Cape Coral, Sarasota and the Chair of Charlotte County, Florida, but was unable to reach them and left messages instead, the White House said.\n\nHurricane Ian made landfall in Florida as a dangerous Category 4 hurricane Wednesday afternoon. Lokman Vural Elibol/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nIn Tampa, Mayor Jane Castor urged residents Wednesday to shelter in place, saying the worst of the storm is “yet to come.”\n\n“We are expecting that we’re going to get the majority of the rain and the higher winds starting about 8 p.m. and they’re going to last throughout the night,” she said. “We are still expecting widespread flooding throughout our city, and anywhere from tropical storm wind speeds to the possibly of category one hurricane wind speeds.”\n\nCastor said that officials are expecting flooding sometime in the next 24 hours.\n\n“We’re going to see the continued rain, the rain will increase dramatically and then that water is going to come back into the Bay as Hurricane Ian continues its northeasterly trajectory.”\n\nFurther south, The Olde Naples Seaport, a community of condos that overlooks the Naples Bay, was consumed by storm surge, according to video shot by Graham Pederson. Pederson experienced knee-high water trying to escape.\n\nIn another video shot from the second floor, wind is seen whipping trees and trucks nearly submerged by the water. Pederson retreated to the second floor to wait out the storm, his brother-in-law Kyle Wendel told CNN.\n\nVideo was taken from Estero Blvd in Fort Myers Beach, Florida, on Wednesday, September 28, 2022. Frank Loni\n\nDeSantis said Wednesday calls for help are coming into several counties due to the storm. The governor said emergency responders have received calls from people in evacuation zones that did not evacuate. Those calls are being logged, he said.\n\n“Local first responders will deploy as soon as it’s safe to do so,” DeSantis said. “By and large until the storm passes, they are not going to go into a situation for rescue and put their own folks at risk.”\n\nDeSantis requested Biden approve a major disaster declaration for all 67 counties in the state due to Hurricane Ian, his office said in a news release. DeSantis is also requesting that the President grant FEMA the authority to provide 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 60 days from Ian’s landfall.\n\nIan already producing record water surge levels\n\nMuch of west-central Florida and places inland face “historic” storm surge, rain and crushing winds. “This is a wind storm and a surge storm and a flood storm, all in one,” CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.\n\nImages and video have showed extensive flooding in coastal neighborhoods in Naples and Fort Myers Beach.\n\nStorm surge began rising late Wednesday morning – more than 4.5 feet above normal highest tides was recorded before noon in Naples, already higher than the previous record there of 4.02 feet from Hurricane Irma in 2017.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for flood-prone areas on the coast, and the National Weather Service warned those who stayed behind to move to upper floors in case of rising water levels.\n\nIan’s dangers still include:\n\n• Storm surge: Some 12 to 18 feet of seawater pushed onto land was predicted Wednesday for the coastal Fort Myers area, from Englewood to Bonita Beach, forecasters said. Only slightly less is forecast for a stretch from Bonita Beach down to near the Everglades (8 to 12 feet), and from near Bradenton to Englewood (6 to 10 feet), forecasters said.\n\nLower – but still life-threatening – surge is possible elsewhere, including north of Tampa and along Florida’s northeast coast near Jacksonville.\n\n• Winds: Southwest Florida is facing “catastrophic wind damage” from ongoing hurricane-force winds. Winds near the core of Hurricane Ian could exceed 140 mph, with higher gusts, the hurricane center said. Multiple locations, including Sanibel Island, recorded wind gusts above 100 mph.\n\n• Flooding rain: 12 to 30 inches of rain could fall in central and northeastern Florida – including Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville. That makes for a top-of-scale risk for flooding rainfall across this area. This amount of rain would usually be two to three months’ worth, but is now falling in less than two days, according to CNN meteorologist Gene Norman.\n\n“As this storm passes your community, understand this is still a hazardous situation” because of downed powerlines, misuse of generators and standing water, Gov. DeSantis said during a Wednesday evening news conference.\n\nWhere the hurricane is headed\n\nIan’s center is expected to move over central Florida through Thursday morning. Heavy rain and flooding also is possible in southern Florida, Georgia and coastal South Carolina. The governors of Virginia, North and South Carolina have already declared states of emergency in their respective states.\n\nStorm warnings have expanded northward to North Carolina, according to the National Hurricane Center’s 5 p.m. update. A tropical storm warning has been extended to Surf City and a tropical storm watch has been issued from north of Surf City to Cape Lookout, North Carolina.\n\nA storm surge watch has been issued north of South Santee River, South Carolina, to Little River Inlet.\n\nBecause Ian slowly approached land, the worst conditions could remain over some areas for eight or more hours.\n\n“Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flash, urban, and river flooding is expected” across central and southern Florida, the hurricane center said.\n\nBy late Thursday, Ian is due to emerge over the Atlantic Ocean, where it could strengthen again and affect another part of the US.\n\nPrior to nearing Florida, Hurricane Ian pummeled Cuba on Tuesday, leaving at least two dead and an islandwide blackout. The US Coast Guard said it has rescued at least three people off the Florida coast, about 2 miles south of Boca Chica.\n\n“They were brought to the local hospital for symptoms of exhaustion and dehydration. Air crews are still searching,” the Coast Guard said in a tweet.\n\nAccording to US Border Patrol Chief for the Miami Sector, the agency has been searching for more than 20 migrants after the arrival of Cubans who swam to shore after their boat sank due to Ian.\n\nAfter the devastation in Cuba, more than 2.5 million people in Florida were advised to flee, including 1.75 million under mandatory evacuation orders – no small ask in a state with a large elderly population.\n\nOfficials prepare for post-storm rescue\n\nSarasota County Sheriff Deputies block the access to a downtown bridge over to the barrier islands as Hurricane Ian approaches Florida's Gulf Coast on September 28. Steve Nesius/Reuters\n\nLaw enforcement officials around the state warned that people who stayed behind in evacuation areas cannot expect rescuers to respond to calls for help during the storm when winds are high.\n\n“If you call for help, once we pull (officers) off the road … we’re not coming. … We’re not putting people in peril when (others) didn’t heed the mandatory evacuation order,” Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said Wednesday.\n\nNot everyone moved. Chelsye Napier, of Fort Myers, stayed home with her fiance and cats despite being in an evacuation zone, she told CNN Wednesday. They waited “because we don’t know anyone down here,” and ultimately decided to stay put, she said.\n\nIan's winds could be catastrophic Category 4: 130-156 mph • Most of the area is uninhabitable for weeks or months. • Power outages last weeks to months. • Fallen trees and power poles isolate residential areas. + Well-built framed homes sustain severe damage. Category 5: 157+ mph + A high percentage of framed homes are destroyed. Source: National Hurricane Center\n\n“If anything happens, we have everything that we need here. We’ve got food, we got water. We have everything that we need here,” she said. “So it’s all OK for right now. We’ll see, though, later on.”\n\nAs millions were told evacuate, 176 shelters opened statewide and hotels and Airbnbs opened to people leaving evacuation zones, DeSantis said.\n\nLocal governments and state agencies also prepared those living in nursing homes and other senior care facilities to evacuate. Florida has around 6 million residents over the age of 60, according to the state’s Department of Elder Affairs – nearly 30% of its total population.\n\nHeather Danenhower, with Duke Energy, walks around utility trucks that are staged in a rural lot in The Villages of Sumter County on Wednesday. Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel via AP\n\nAuthorities also readied services to fan out and respond to calls for rescue and then, in the aftermath of the hurricane, for recovery and repair efforts.\n\nNearly 400 ambulances, buses and support vehicles were responding to areas where the hurricane was expected to make landfall, according to the governor’s office.\n\nDeSantis activated 5,000 Florida National Guard members for Ian’s response operations, and 2,000 more guardsmen from Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina were being activated to assist.\n\nFlorida urban search and rescue teams also were prepping.\n\n“We have five state teams that are activated with additional five FEMA teams that are in play,” Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis said at a news conference Tuesday night. “We have over 600 resources to bear in addition to these out-of-town teams.”\n\nHelp is coming from out of state, too. At least 26 states have answered the call for assistance by Florida, DeSantis said Wednesday evening, including Alabama and Louisiana.\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards tweeted Wedensday his state has already sent “significant resources” to Florida.\n\n“We are also prepared to send additional help once damage assessment begins,” Edwards’ tweet read.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey tweeted her state sent Blackhawk helicopters to help. Tennessee and Louisiana also sent resources to aid in search and rescue.\n\n“If they need it and we’ve got it, then we’re going to send it,” Ivey tweeted.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Eric Levenson Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Eric Levenson", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/10/weather/weekend-atmospheric-river-storm-tornadoes-snow-flooding/index.html", "title": "Major storm to bring feet of snow, heavy rain and possible tornadoes ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn atmospheric river event, bringing ample amounts of moisture to the West this weekend, will gradually move across the country and bring hazardous weather to millions.\n\nThe blockbuster storm will begin in the West with heavy snow, gusty winds, and coastal flooding, then move eastward, threatening potential blizzard conditions in the Midwest and tornadoes in the South.\n\nWinter weather alerts are in place for more than 10 million people across nearly a dozen states from California to Minnesota Sunday.\n\nSnow could top out at 1 to 2 feet in the Rockies, and 3 to 5 feet in the Sierras by the end of the weekend. Heavy rain will also be notable in the West, particularly in California, where flooding concerns exist through Sunday.\n\nAn atmospheric river is a plume of moisture which streams in off the Pacific Ocean. Similar to a fire hose, it shoots moisture into one area for an extended period of time, resulting in very heavy rain or snow.\n\nMost coastal communities will pick up 1 to 3 inches of rain through the weekend, and some areas of northern and central California could receive 3 to 5 inches of rain in total. Coastal erosion and flooded roadways will be the main concerns.\n\n“Additional heavy rains may result in isolated runoff issues, especially across recent burn scars,” the Weather Prediction Center said.\n\nWind advisories and high wind warnings are also in places across several western states as gusts of 45 to 55 mph are possible.\n\nThis same storm system is forecast to track into the Rockies by Monday morning, bringing with it heavy mountain snow, before heading into the eastern half of the country.\n\n“As the system moves into the Plains early next week, a springlike storm system develops,” Chad Myers, CNN Meteorologist said. “Significant severe weather will occur in the warm air across the South and a major snow and ice event will happen in the western Great Lakes and northern Plains.”\n\nPotential blizzard conditions for the Plains and Midwest\n\nFor the northern Plains and Midwest, the threat for blizzard conditions is increasing, as significant snow, strong winds, ice and freezing rain will all be possible early next week from Colorado through Wisconsin.\n\nCNN Weather\n\n“A winter storm is expected to impact the Northern Plains Monday night through Thursday,” the National Weather Service office in Bismarck, North Dakota said. “Difficult travel conditions are expected Monday night through Wednesday night from heavy snow, reduced visibility, and drifting snow.”\n\nHeavy snow and strong winds will be the main concerns, but freezing rain and ice are also possible.\n\nIf winds are at least 35 mph and visibility is less than one quarter of a mile for at least three hours, it could result in a full-blown blizzard across the region.\n\nWidespread snow accumulations across the northern Plains and Midwest will be 4 to 8 inches, and some locations could pick up in excess of one foot through Friday of next week.\n\n“While some uncertainty persists, confidence is increasing that strong winds and significant snows will produce hazardous impacts across much of the Central/Northern Plains and into the Upper Midwest,” the prediction center said.\n\nSlick roadways and near-whiteout conditions will make travel very difficult if not impossible at times for some of these areas. Power outages will also be possible due to very strong winds.\n\nSevere storms for the South next week\n\nThe threat for severe storms is also increasing across the southern Plains and Gulf Coast region including tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds.\n\n“While tornadoes in December are relatively uncommon when compared to the springtime, they are often more likely across portions of the Southeast and Lower Mississippi Valley, where there is often a secondary peak in the fall and winter,” Matthew Elliott, a meteorologist at the Storm Prediction Center, told CNN.\n\nCNN Weather\n\nThe severe storm potential begins Monday night across Oklahoma and northern Texas, gradually spreading into Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi on Tuesday.\n\nSevere storms will likely continue Tuesday overnight across the Gulf Coast region. Nocturnal tornadoes are more dangerous because many people are asleep and unaware they need to be seeking a safe location.\n\nWhile the greater tornado threat exists during the day, there is still the possibility for a few rotating storms through the evening hours.\n\nBy Wednesday, the greatest threat exists for an area from New Orleans to Panama City, Florida.\n\n“The details regarding the areas most at risk from tornadoes will become clearer as the event approaches and smaller-scale trends become more evident,” Elliott said.\n\nBecause the forecast can change it is important to pay attention to developments in the coming days.", "authors": ["Allison Chinchar"], "publish_date": "2022/12/10"}]}

The existing lifeline uses a 10-digit number, 1-800-273-8255.\n\n\"On July 16, our country enters a new era of crisis services,\" said Maureen Iselin, a spokesperson for the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, at a news conference Thursday on how states can prepare.\n\nThe rollout has been in the works for years, and many mental health professionals say it will help expand much-needed services and make them more accessible to people seeking help. But some experts have said their states aren't ready for the launch.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nHow does 988 work?\n\nWhat to know: After dialing or texting 988, you'll be connected with a trained mental health professional at a local or regional crisis center. If your local center cannot connect you to a counselor, national backup centers can pick up the call. The lifeline is administered by the nonprofit Vibrant Emotional Health.\n\nThat's how it has worked for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number, and the setup will continue after 988 is launched.\n\nWhat experts say: The shortened, more accessible lifeline marks \"a transformative moment in terms of thinking about approaching crisis care,\" said Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, an assistant secretary at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, on Thursday.\n\nThe launch also comes amid what experts have called a mental health crisis in the U.S. amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE SHIFTS TO 988:LGBTQ advocates hope for 'culturally competent' training\n\nAre states prepared?\n\nWhat to know: For many advocates, 988 represents an opportunity to expand services but also a challenge because of possible added pressure on already strained mental health crisis response systems. Some advocates have questioned whether states will be ready for the increased call volume projected after the switch to the 988 model.\n\nIn the first year of 988's implementation, the number of contacts for the lifeline is expected to increase to 7.6 million – a twofold increase compared with the 3.3 million calls, texts or chats in 2020, according to a report in December 2021 from SAHMSA.\n\nWhat experts say: Delphin-Rittmon acknowledged that some crisis response centers are worried about the size of workforces in their states and about resources for this launch. She said she has been working with state representatives on funding and to \"assess their overall readiness.\" .\n\nThe launch of 988 provides \"an opportunity to expose gaps and weaknesses in our system,\" which would allow centers to see where additional investments may be needed, said Angela Kimball, national director of advocacy and public policy at the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\n\"Will it work perfectly?\" she said. \"No. Because changing crisis response won't happen overnight.\"\n\nARE STATES PREPARED? A closer look at whether states are prepared for 988\n\nWhat does funding look like?\n\nWhat to know: President Joe Biden's administration has \"significantly increased funds towards the lifeline,\" Delphin-Rittmon said, with a $432 million initial investment into the 988 transition.\n\nSince then, $177 million from the federal government has gone to \"strengthen and expand the lifeline infrastructure,\" and nearly $105 million has gone to grant funding directly to states and territories, she said.\n\nWhat experts say: Kimball said funding is still an obstacle for many states.\n\n\"This is really a struggle across the country,\" she said. \"While Congress has allocated some one-time funding and funds for the national lifeline, they have not financed 988 as an entire crisis response system across the country. And so really, it is up to states to step up to the plate and create the funding streams.\"\n\nKimball said some states have passed significant budget increases for mental health initiatives, but \"a lot of states have allocated insufficient resources.\"\n\n\"That's going to take people standing up and demanding that elected officials invest.\"\n\nContributing: Ryan Miller, USA TODAY\n\nContact News Now Reporter Christine Fernando at cfernando@usatoday.com or follow her on Twitter at @christinetfern.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/weather/us-extreme-heat-thursday/index.html", "title": "US heat wave: Dangerously high temperatures will last through the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMore than 85% of Americans are bracing for temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit through the weekend, with millions in the south-central US expected to experience readings in the triple digits.\n\nMore than 100 million people are under various heat alerts Thursday in more than two dozen states from parts of the American West to New England, a suffocating cocoon that experts believe will become increasingly common due to the effects of climate change.\n\n“Widespread high temperatures in the mid-to-upper 90s and low 100s will encompass a majority of the country on Thursday and Friday,” the National Weather Service warned Wednesday.\n\nThe areas at the highest risk for the dangerously hot temperatures span the Southwest, central and south-central US along with the coastal mid-Atlantic region and the Northeast, the weather service noted.\n\nDallas County, Texas, reported its first heat-related death of the year – a 66-year-old woman – according to a Thursday news release from Dallas County Health and Human Services. The agency is not identifying the woman, but did say she had underlying health conditions.\n\nThe distressing heat wave – which has exacerbated a flash drought in the southern and central Plains – has pushed state and local leaders to issue heat emergencies and offer resources to residents to mitigate the high temperatures.\n\nThe mayor of Washington, DC, on Thursday announced a heat emergency – triggered when the district sees a temperature of 95 degrees or higher – that will last until Monday morning.\n\n“Stay hydrated, limit sun exposure, and check on seniors, neighbors & pets,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said on Twitter.\n\nPhiladelphia declared a heat health emergency for Thursday due to the expected oppressive heat, activating emergency programs likes special field teams that conduct home visits and outreach for people experiencing homelessness, the department of health said in a news release.\n\nSimilarly in New York, residents are encouraged to stay indoors in the upcoming days as the heat continues to sweep across the state to avoid “dangerous conditions that can lead to heat stress and illness,” according to Jackie Bray, the commissioner of the state’s homeland security and emergency services division.\n\nTemperatures over 90 degrees are expected to remain in New York City, Philadelphia and Boston through the weekend – if not longer.\n\nThe excessive heat across the US has been matched by deadly conditions in Europe, where records have been smashed and the European Forest Fire Information System put 19 European countries on “extreme danger” alerts for wildfires.\n\nA construction worker drinks water in temperatures that have reached well above triple digits in Palm Springs, California, on Wednesday. David Swanson/Reuters\n\nHeat index values indicate danger\n\nMeanwhile, triple-digit heat will continue to bake parts of California, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Tennessee on Thursday – meaning 1 in 5 Americans will endure dangerous conditions after what has already been a historic week in terms of topping heat records, said CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford.\n\nThe heat is expected to persist through the weekend in many places, and more than 85% of the population – or 275 million Americans – could see high temperatures above 90 degrees over the next week. More than 60 million people could see high temperatures at or above 100 degrees over the next seven days.\n\nHeat index values – the temperature it feels like when heat is combined with humidity – could top 100 degrees in a number of states through this weekend, particularly in the Midwest, the Southeast and on the East Coast.\n\nLarge swaths of the South – including parts of eastern Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama – and the central East Coast from South Carolina to New Jersey will see some of the most pronounced danger (seen in these maps in dark orange) from the heat on Thursday.\n\nCNN CNN CNN CNN CNN Heat index forecasts indicate danger for large parts of US Prev Next\n\nThat danger becomes more apparent in parts of the Midwest this weekend, in parts of southern Illinois, Missouri and Iowa, before shifting back to the East Coast on Sunday.\n\nForecast heat index values indicate much of the rest of the US should exercise extreme caution.\n\nTriple-digit heat records across multiple states\n\nWhile much of the western US has been gripped by an extended, unrelenting drought, the recent heat and lack of adequate rain has catalyzed a “flash drought” in other parts of the country.\n\nThe US Drought Monitor last week announced states including Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri and Massachusetts were experiencing a flash drought, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines as the “rapid onset or intensification of drought.”\n\nIt grew even worse this week in the central and southern Plains, the Drought Monitor said in its weekly update Thursday: More than 84% of Texas is in severe or worse drought conditions, the highest percentage in over a decade, while the area of Oklahoma experiencing drought doubled in size.\n\nArkansas went from less than 1% of the state seeing severe drought to more than a quarter of the state. Missouri similarly went from 2% to a third of the state experiencing severe drought.\n\nMeanwhile, triple-digit records were set Tuesday and Wednesday in multiple locations across Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma, where Tulsa EMS reported responding to nearly 250 heat-related emergency calls so far this year.\n\n“Those numbers are what we would expect to see in mid- to late-August,” Adam Paluka, spokesperson for the Emergency Medical Services Authority, said Wednesday. “So we’re four to six weeks ahead of where we would normally see those mid-200 call numbers.”\n\n“It’s very concerning,” he added, “especially because the amount of patients that are being transported indicates that some of those calls are heatstroke, which can be deadly.”\n\nIn Abilene, Texas, temperatures on Wednesday reached 110 degrees, breaking a 1936 record on that date. Another record of 104 degrees was set in San Antonio, Texas, surpassing the 101 degrees last experienced in 1996.\n\nAnd as of Tuesday, the Austin area reached at least 100 degrees on 38 out of the last 44 days, according to the weather service.\n\n“We’re asking people to conserve power so that the systems continue to operate,” Austin Mayor Steve Adler said Wednesday. “We’re asking everybody to do that so that we can get through this together.”\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates about 90% of Texas’ power grid, said it set another record Wednesday for power demand – surpassing a record set a day prior.\n\nAlso, Wednesday, a record high of 103 degrees in Fayetteville, Arkansas, topped the 102 degrees seen on that date in 2012.\n\nAnother Arkansas city, Mountain Home, saw 107 degrees Wednesday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“This would shatter the old record high of 102 degrees for this date set back in 2012. Official record reports are not sent out until midnight but it sure looks like a new record high,” the weather service wrote Wednesday evening.\n\nSeveral US communities set or tied new daily records for high low temperatures this week, according to the National Weather Service. In Needles, California, the low temperature never got below 95 degrees Wednesday, tying a record set in 1901.\n\nIn Texas, the low temperature was 86 degrees Tuesday in Galveston, and Wichita Falls never got below 84 degrees on the same day. Elsewhere in the state, Houston and Laredo both had low temperatures of 81 degrees Wednesday. All of these were new daily records.\n\nIn Arkansas, the cities of Little Rock and Pine Bluff set low temperature records at 82 degrees Wednesday.\n\nExtreme heat causes businesses to alter operations\n\nThe extreme heat is causing Texas farmers to sell off their cattle at a rate not seen in more than a decade, according to a livestock economist.\n\n“A lot of ranchers rely on ponds and tanks that capture rainfall,” said David Anderson with Texas A&M University. “I’ve heard a lot of stories about ranchers running out of water.”\n\nThe weather conditions also are causing grass to die off, severely thinning the pastures where cattle graze. That leaves many ranchers no choice but to send cattle they can’t feed to slaughter, which has a ripple effect on the beef supply in future years.\n\nIt’s so hot in Oklahoma that the Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden postponed a Thursday event “due to extreme temperatures,” the zoo posted on its Facebook page.\n\nThe zoo’s after hours Sip and Stroll event would not have a significant impact on the animals, but the zoo postponed the event to protect guests and team members from the extreme temperatures, zoo spokesperson Candice Rennels told CNN.\n\nConfronting the heat\n\nTo help residents brace through the heat, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu announced that at least 12 community centers will open to anyone who wants to cool off. Additionally, more than 50 splash pads will be available at city parks and playgrounds, she said, as she declared a heat emergency through Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, some local officials have taken the step to hire chief heat officers to help navigate the response to the extreme heat.\n\nJane Gilbert, chief heat officer for Miami-Dade County, told CNN’s Don Lemon on Tuesday that Miami now has nearly double the days with a heat index – what the air feels like – over 90 degrees than it did in the 1970s.\n\n“That is not only concerning to people’s health but their pocketbooks. Our outdoor workers can’t work as long, they lose work time. People can’t afford this AC, the higher electricity cost. It’s both a health and an economic crisis.”\n\nDavid Hondula, director of the Office of Heat Response and Mitigation for Phoenix, echoed that sentiment, saying, “The heat can affect everyone, we’re all at risk.”\n\nHigh temperatures are one of the top weather-related causes of death in the US, according to Kimberly McMahon, public weather services program manager with the National Weather Service.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Dakin Andone Amir Vera", "Aya Elamroussi", "Dakin Andone", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2019/02/07/no-more-robocalls-how-block-unwanted-calls-iphone-android/2778059002/", "title": "How to block phone numbers, robocalls from iPhone, Android, landline", "text": "Kim Komando\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this column neglected to note that calling *77 on your mobile phone may instead connect you with law enforcement.\n\n“Hello! Please don’t hang up… did you know that you could save a bundle on…?\n\nIt's a robocall, another automated telemarketer. Nowadays, robocalls make up 50 percent of all phone calls. In 2018 alone, robocallers spammed us with 26.3 billion calls. And it’s only going to get worse: Robocalls are going to become more constant in coming years.\n\nThe moment you hear that electronic voice, everything stops. Your pulse quickens; your blood pressure rises. It doesn't matter what you were doing before. Maybe you were laughing at a joke. Maybe you were enjoying lunch. Perhaps you were watching your kid's Little League game.\n\nNone of that matters now. You picked up that call, and you regret it. You want to shriek: Don’t call me again. I don’t care who you are. Just go away! Your words would fall on deaf ears. There is no one on the other end, and if you breathe a word, your voice may be recorded for future use.\n\nIt’s time to end those robocalls for good. Luckily, you have a whole arsenal of smartphone tools at your disposal. You block numbers, turn on Do Not Disturb mode, use your carrier's tools, or use third–party apps to end this telephonic pestilence.\n\nHere are seven pointers for minimizing, or eradicating those unwanted calls.\n\n1. Reject Anonymous Calls Automatically\n\nMany robocalls come up as “anonymous” on your caller ID, while most businesses and human beings come up as identifiable phone numbers. Chances are, you could terminate all anonymous calls without missing anything important.\n\nDepending on your service, you may have access to Anonymous Call Rejection. Try this on your landline. Make sure your caller ID is activated. Enter the magic number *77, and you will hear three beeps. Hang up, and any call that hides its number will be rejected.\n\nThis service varies by carrier, and some carriers charge extra. But it’s a helpful tool for scammers or robocallers who slip through the Do Not Call Registry.\n\nNote: In some jurisdictions, dialing *77 on your mobile phone may connect you with law enforcement. Tap or click here for a list, or check with local or state law enforcement before trying *77.\n\nMORE TIPS YOU NEED FOR YOUR PHONE:\n\n2. Join the National Do Not Call Registry List\n\nMillions rejoiced when the FTC created the National Do Not Call Registry – and in a perfect world, signing up would stop telemarketers from calling you. Technically, it's illegal for telemarketers to call you if you are on this list.\n\nBut the world isn’t perfect. Scammers don't follow the rules, nor do they care about this list. It's still smart to register your number as an added layer of protection against unwanted calls. Just go to the website donotcall.gov and enter the landline or cellphone number you want on the list.\n\nYou can also call 1-888-382-1222 from any phone you want on the list. That's all it takes, and your number stays on the list until you ask for it to be removed or you give up the number.\n\nOnce you sign up, the Do Not Call list takes you off for-profit business call lists, but it isn't immediate. Telemarketers update their listings only periodically, so the FTC says it can take up to 31 days.\n\nAlso, political organizations, charities and survey takers are still permitted to call you. Businesses you've bought something from or made a payment to in the last 18 months have a right to call. When they call, however, firmly tell them to take you off their list and they have to honor your request, although they might still try to talk you into reconsidering.\n\nMisdialing on mobile:Dialing *77 on mobile may reach 911 instead\n\n3. Use Carrier Tools to Block Unwanted Calls\n\nThe four major carriers have tools to identify, filter and prevent suspected nuisance numbers from calling or texting your phone. Most require an extra monthly fee to activate the caller ID service, but network-level blocking is free of charge across all the carriers.\n\nAT&T\n\nAT&T subscribers can use a free iOS and Android app called AT&T Call Protect. It has automatic fraud blocking and suspected spam warnings. You can manually block unwanted calls.\n\nVerizon\n\nVerizon recently announced a free call-blocking service that debuts in March. Verizon previously offered a \"Caller Filter\" service for $2.99 per month per line.\n\nVerizon also has identified 300 million spam and scam phone numbers that it will block through free spam alerting and call-blocking tools also coming in March.\n\nT-Mobile\n\nT-Mobile provides two free ways to combat robocallers and spam calls.\n\nFirst is Scam ID, an automatic system that identifies spam numbers when your phone rings. T-Mobile automatically does this on its network, and there's no app to install or service to turn on.\n\nThe second free method is Scam Block. Unlike Scam ID, which simply identifies known spam numbers, Scam Block gives you an option to block those numbers. To turn this on, dial #662# on your T-Mobile handset. To turn it off, dial #632#.\n\nSimilar to Verizon's Caller Name ID, T-Mobile has its own paid \"Name ID\" service, which identifies and provides caller information like the name, location and type of organization. You can block them as needed. This is included in T-Mobile ONE Plus plans. For other T-Mobile plans, it costs $4 a month per line.\n\nSprint\n\nSprint customers can sign up for its \"Premium Caller ID\" service to protect themselves from robocalls and caller ID spoofers.\n\nThis service is $2.99 a month, and it provides a threat level indicator to give customers an idea of how suspicious a call is. It does this by flagging calls with real-time data trends gathered across the U.S.\n\nThis service doesn't automatically block known spam calls. Based on the threat level, you can choose to answer the call, block the number or report it to prevent future calls.\n\nThey're everywhere:Robocalls aren't stopping and this time they're in Chinese\n\n4. Use the Best Apps to Block Robocalls\n\nAnother way to stop nuisance calls on your smartphone is via call–blocking apps. These apps can identify who is calling you and block unwanted calls that show up on a crowd-sourced spam and robocaller list.\n\nHere are the top call blocking apps:\n\nNomorobo\n\nNomorobo is an iOS and Android app that offers real–time protection from a growing list of robocallers, telemarketers and phone scammers.\n\nNomorobo lets the phone ring once, then tries to identify the caller. If the number is on the app’s robocaller list, the app will automatically block the call for you.\n\nNomorobo is free to use for 30 days, and then it costs $1.99 per month or $19.99 for an entire year. To sign up, you will need to provide Nomorobo with information. List the type of phone you have – wireless or landline – and select your carrier. Note: Not all major cell carriers support Nomorobo.\n\nTruecaller\n\nThe Truecaller app for iOS and Android lets you find out who's behind that unknown number. Copy and paste the number into the app’s search bar. Truecaller will search the unknown number to find out who it is. With a community-based spam list from over 250 million users, it's a great resource to avoid answering an unwanted robocall.\n\nAnother great feature of Truecaller is its ability to block spam calls. When a pesky telemarketer calls, there will be a big warning in red, telling you that it's a spam call. Just swipe up when this happens to automatically block that caller and add them to the spam list.\n\nThe Truecaller app is free for both download and use. However, there is a professional version that can be bought as an in-app purchase for $1.99 per month.\n\nHiya – Caller ID & Block\n\nThe Hiya – Caller ID & Block app is perfect for identifying calls that you want to accept and blocking calls and texts you want to avoid. The Hiya app is available for free on both Apple and Android gadgets with no ads, and it is simple to use. If you had to choose one, this is the best choice, in my opinion.\n\nIt allows you to block calls, blacklist unwanted phone numbers and text messages, reverse phone search incoming call information and receive spam alerts. The app is powered by a database of hundreds of millions of phone numbers confirmed to be spam by other users.\n\nCall Control – Call Blocker\n\nThe Call Control – Call Blocker app automatically blocks spam calls and calls from other numbers you don't want to hear from. You can block entire area codes (like 888) if you're getting tons of calls you don't want from a particular location. The Call Control app is free and available for both Apple and Android gadgets.\n\nWorried about missing out on important calls? Call Control gives you your own personal Whitelist and Contacts Protection to make sure people you know get through.\n\nThe app's users actively report their spammers so its catalog is always up to date.\n\nCall Control will automatically block active spammers, and the reverse lookup allows you to track them to their source. You can add numbers to the Community Blacklist and choose to block specific numbers that won't leave you alone.\n\nWhat you need to know:How to keep from getting scammed by robocalls\n\n5. Some Phones Block Robocalls Automatically\n\nDid you know that some smartphones already have built–in spam and robocall protection in place? Samsung's flagship Galaxy and Note smartphones have a native feature called Smart Call that automatically screens and flags suspicious numbers.\n\nGoogle's Android smartphones like the Pixels and the old Nexus and Android One have built-in spam call protection. With this feature, users with Caller ID enabled will get a warning if a suspected spam call or robocall is received.\n\nAside from ignoring the call, the user has the option to either block the number or whitelist it if the spam flagging is deemed an error. Any blocked number can be unblocked at any time. An option to report the call to Google is available.\n\nDon't pick up:The one thing you should do to stop robocalls\n\n6. Block Individual Phone Numbers\n\nHere's a feature that's available on any iPhone and Android – the ability to block specific numbers. Although this cannot possibly stop every robocall and spammer number, you can at least block the recurring ones.\n\niPhone\n\nOn an iPhone, open your Phone app, go to your Recents tab, then tap the circular information icon on the right side of the number you want to block. On the next page, tap \"Block this Caller\" to put the number on your block list.\n\nAndroid\n\nOn Android, you can likewise open your Phone app, navigate to the Recents section, do a long press on the suspicious number then select \"Block/report spam.\" (This may vary, depending on the manufacturer and model of your Android phone.)\n\nOut of control:98 million robocalls hit Americans every day. The FCC's fines aren't stopping them.\n\n7. Set Your Phone on Do Not Disturb\n\nTo block every number except your most trusted contacts or favorites, you can turn on your iPhone or Android phone's built-in Do Not Disturb Mode. It's an extreme solution but it will definitely stop all unwanted calls, including robocalls, telemarketing calls and spam calls.\n\nKeep in mind that you will undoubtedly miss some legitimate calls when this mode is on, but unknown callers will always have the option to leave a voice message. You can add any number to your contacts list to let them through in the future.\n\niPhone\n\nTo customize your Do Not Disturb preferences on an iPhone, go to Settings >> Do Not Disturb. Here, you can turn the mode on, set a Do Not Disturb schedule and set your allowed calls to either all your saved contacts or just your Favorites list. To quickly activate Do Not Disturb, go to your iPhone's Control Center (swipe down from the upper-right corner on iPhone X, swipe up from the bottom for other iPhones) and toggle the Do Not Disturb switch (the icon looks like a moon).\n\nAndroid\n\nOn Android, go to Settings >> Sound (or Sound & Notification in other phones) >> then Tap Do Not Disturb to customize your Do Not Disturb settings.\n\nTo activate Do Not Disturb, simply swipe down from the top of your display to access the Quick Menu then tap the Do Not Disturb icon to turn it on. (This may vary, depending on the manufacturer and model of your Android phone.)\n\n8. Common Sense Prevails\n\nThis is the simplest solution, and many people try this low–tech approach to robocalls. If you receive a call from an unknown number or one that doesn't show up on caller ID, don't answer. If it's an important call, the person will leave a message and you can get back to them. Millions of people are unencumbered by robocalls, and they don’t give these pests a second thought.\n\nBut be advised: If you answer the phone and the caller (often a recording) asks you to hit a button to stop receiving calls, just hang up. Scammers often use these tricks to identify and target live respondents. Once they know the number is active, you may receive more calls in the future.\n\nWhat digital lifestyle questions do you have?

That number routes callers to one of 163 crisis centers, where counselors answered 2.2 million calls last year.\n\n“The three-digit number is really going to be a breakthrough in terms of reaching people in a crisis,” said Dwight Holton, CEO of Lines for Life, a suicide prevention nonprofit. “No one is embarrassed to call 911 for a fire or an emergency.

The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.\n\nAs of May, at least 13 states – Alabama, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Texas, Virginia and Washington – have enacted legislation to fund and implement 988; lawmakers in many others remain in legislative sessions, so “that will likely increase,” Manz said.\n\nAt least 11 states – California, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Vermont and Washington – have introduced new or additional legislation, according to data from the group.\n\n“Since states are in different places in terms of their current crisis systems, they may not need major change that would require legislation, and/or they may be using federal dollars for initial investments,” Manz wrote.\n\n“The back end routing to the suicide hotline when someone dials 988, no matter where that person is, will happen with or without state legislative action,” she wrote, adding that states and the federal government recognize that the ongoing infrastructure components needed to support 988 “will take time to build,” similar to how 911 was built out over time.\n\nSo, “many states are taking time to study how to do this as well,” Manz wrote.\n\n‘States must transition to 988 as a universal number’\n\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline has been in operation since 2005 and is funded by the HHS’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Callers currently reach the critical 24/7 national hotline by phoning the 10-digit number: 1-800-273-8255 (TALK).\n\nIn 2020, the US Federal Communications Commission’s five leaders unanimously voted to finalize 988 as the three-digit number Americans can dial to be connected to the existing lifeline’s network of trained counselors.\n\nThat year, the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 became law, amending the Communications Act of 1934 to designate 988 as “the universal telephone number for the purpose of the national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system operating through the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and through the Veterans Crisis Line, and for other purposes.”\n\nStarting July 16, the FCC will establish 988 as an easy-to-remember three-digit dialing code for suicide prevention and mental health crises. Calls to that number will be redirected to 1-800-273-8255, which will stay operational during and after the 988 transition.\n\n“We want you to know that if you are suffering severe stress and emotional trauma, if you aren’t sure where to go, even if it’s not at a point of suicide, we want you to call. We want you to reach out. That is the purpose of the 988 lifeline that is hopefully going to go live mid-July across the country,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in Washington state Friday.\n\n“No longer will people have to call a 10-digit phone number to try to get help. What 911 is for local emergencies, we hope 988 will become people under emotional and mental stress,” Becerra said. “And it is important that we launch right.”\n\nLast year, the FCC unanimously voted to require text messages sent to 988 be routed to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline as part of the launch, as well.\n\n“States must transition to 988 as a universal number for mental health crisis, and Congress has provided support to states to do so by allowing them to implement state mechanisms for funding and by providing technical assistance opportunities and direct funding to states,” Manz wrote.\n\n“Because this number is universal across the nation, states must adjust their existing call center systems to align to 988,” Manz wrote. “The lift is different in different states, though it’s important to note that states have been developing crisis services across a continuum for years. The call centers represent the beginning of that continuum.”\n\nSAMHSA has awarded nearly $105 million in grants to states and territories for the transition to 988 and to support call centers. Last year, SAMHSA also announced $177 million to support strengthening and expanding the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline network operations and infrastructure, administered by the organization Vibrant Emotional Health.\n\nThe intersection of opioid crisis and mental health\n\nAs the launch approaches, local health departments appear to welcome the three-digit number, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n“I think it’ll be welcomed by our state and local health departments,” Freeman said, adding that many of the states that have made early preparations for the transition to 988, such as West Virginia and Massachusetts, have seen increases in mental health concerns tied to the opioid epidemic.\n\nSome of the states that have been the hardest hit by drug overdoses – which also include Indiana, Kentucky and New York – were among the earliest to introduce legislation to implement and fund 988 in preparation for the July rollout or to receive a federal grant for the transition to 988.\n\n“West Virginia is interesting coming out of the gate. They’ve just been so hard-hit by the opioid crisis, which, of course, leads to mental health challenges but that also can be a precursor to the opioid epidemic itself,” Freeman said. “So it makes sense that they will be one of the first ones to step forward. I think we’ll see other states do it quickly, as well.”\n\nSuicide is the second leading cause of death in the United States for people ages 10 to 34, according to the American Psychiatric Association, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes it as a “serious public health problem.” The intersection of the opioid epidemic and the nation’s mental health crisis has also become a grim and growing public health concern.\n\nAmong high school students, for instance, the misuse of prescription opioid drugs is associated with increases in the risk for suicide-related behaviors.\n\nA study published last year found that about 1 of every 3 high school students who said they were misusing prescription opioids reported that they had attempted suicide. The study used data from more than 13,600 US high schoolers’ responses to the CDC’s 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey.\n\nOverall, suicide rates in the United States increased 30% between 2000 and 2018, according to the CDC, and then declined in 2019 and 2020. Nearly 46,000 people died by suicide in 2020.\n\nTo lower those numbers, the launch of 988 serves as “a first step towards a transformed crisis care system in much the same way as emergency medical services have expanded” in the United States, John Draper, executive director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and executive vice president of national networks for Vibrant Emotional Health, wrote in an email Monday.\n\n“SAMHSA is first focused on strengthening and expanding the existing Lifeline network, providing life-saving service to all who call, text or chat via 988,” Draper said. “Longer-term, SAMHSA recognizes that linking those in crisis to community-based providers – who can deliver a full range of crisis care services – is essential to meeting behavioral health crisis needs across the nation.”\n\nCall centers seek more counselors\n\nThe National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is looking to hire more counselors in its call centers as it rolls out 988.\n\n“This is a great time to be a crisis counselor,” Draper said Tuesday.\n\n“Our centers are looking for people who are willing to step up and do this work, and our training programs are excellent in terms of preparing people to do this important work. So we’ve been working with both our states and our centers to prepare for this big day for actually quite some time,” Draper said.\n\nPeople who are interested in learning more can visit the SAMHSA website.\n\nCall centers “are looking for empathetic volunteers, employees, and interns to serve as crisis counselors answering phone, chats and texts, as well as managers with advanced degrees,” the website says.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nStaff hired as part of the expansion could be offered remote work options and do not necessarily have to be licensed mental health professionals. They can have bachelor’s degrees or previous experience as peer support workers, and some might consider apprenticeship opportunities, Dr. John Palmieri, acting director of 988 at the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said Tuesday.\n\n“This is not a situation where we’re only looking for licensed mental health professionals,” he said.\n\nPalmieri and his colleagues have been “looking at some of those ways that we can increase pipeline development, career engagement, for individuals,” he said, adding that they are also thinking about the importance of retention of current staff and decreasing burnout because providing crisis care can be “challenging work.”\n\nMany crisis centers have operated with volunteers for many years, and they can convert volunteers to paid staff, Draper said.\n\n“So already, there’s a work force ready to be paid and actually do full-time work,” Draper said. “We can really start to build career pathways for people in crisis care that we’ve never had before.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/10/31/powerball-jackpot-halloween-drawing-winners/10657700002/", "title": "Winning Powerball numbers for Monday, Oct. 31, 2022.

The Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention still must sign off on the authorization.\n\n“Hopefully this will be not just a call for people to go get their booster shot,” but for the tens of millions of unvaccinated Americans to rethink that choice, FDA vaccine chief Peter Marks said. “It’s not too late to start to get vaccinated.”\n\nHealth care systems are reporting record hospitalizations among children amid a coronavirus surge driven by the highly transmissible omicron variant. During the week of Dec. 22 to Dec. 28, an average of 378 children age 17 and under were admitted per day to hospitals with the coronavirus, a 66% increase from the week before, the CDC reported Thursday. The previous high over the course of the pandemic was in early September when child hospitalizations averaged 342 per day, the CDC said.\n\nThe FDA also authorized a third dose at least 28 days following the second one for kids ages 5-11 who have certain kinds of immunocompromise.\n\nPhysician urges 'maximal telework' for Congress because of rising infections\n\nCongress’ top doctor urged lawmakers on Monday to move to a “maximal telework posture,” citing surging numbers of COVID-19 cases at the Capitol that he said are mostly breakthrough infections. The seven-day average rate of infection at the Capitol’s testing center has risen from less than 1% to more than 13%, Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician, wrote in a letter to congressional leaders obtained by The Associated Press. Monahan cited “an unprecedented number of cases in the Capitol community affecting hundreds of individuals.”\n\n\"While some view the ... coronavirus disease as 'endemic,' the 'new normal,' and 'inevitable,' these views are premature,\" Monahan wrote. \"The entire community must continue to take every measure to suppress the rapid spread of this disease.\"\n\nPuerto Rico slammed by infections, but vaccines still offer a measure of protection\n\nHigh vaccination rates have not spared Puerto Rico from the wrath of omicron.\n\nThe U.S. territory, which ranks among the nation's most vaccinated jurisdictions with 86% of the population getting at least one dose and 75% the full regimen, has seen infections multiply exponentially because of the new variant.\n\nAccording to Harvard statistician Rafael Irizarry, one-third of all the island's cases during the entire pandemic were recorded in December, when infections skyrocketed from 3 to 225 per 100,000 residents.\n\nHospitalizations have surged from a daily average of about 50 on Dec. 1 to more than 300, according to New York Times data, but Irizarry points out vaccines still offer considerable protection in the face of omicron. \"Puerto Rico is observing 800 cases per 100K per day among the unvaccinated, but only 100 among those with boosters,'' he tweeted.\n\nGermany promoting vaaa-xinations\n\nWhen it comes to vaccinations, maybe people following commands like sheep is not such a bad thing.\n\nA group of about 700 sheep and goats were arranged to form the shape of a 330-foot syringe Monday in a field at Schneverdingen, south of Hamburg, as part of Germany's drive to encourage more people to get vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nThe omicron variant has been fueling coronavirus infections across the world, and the German government is promoting vaccinations as the most effective means of countering the latest wave. More than 71.2% of the population has received at least two vaccine doses, and 39% have gotten a booster.\n\nHanspeter Etzold, organizer of the syringe display, said he hoped to reach people who are still hesitating to get vaccinated. \"Sheep are such likeable animals — maybe they can get the message over better,\" he said.\n\nNew York City battles surge, opens schools for 1 million students\n\nNew York City schoolchildren returned to the classroom Monday despite a surge in infections over the holiday break. David Banks, the new schools chancellor, said the city has shored up its pool of substitute teachers and had administrative staffers available to pinch hit for teachers who are absent because of the virus. The district has more than 1 million students; eight out of 1,700 schools were reportedly closed because of the virus Monday.\n\nMayor Eric Adams, sworn in Saturday, vowed Monday to keep schools safe and power the city through the rise in coronavirus cases. Adams said his office is studying whether the city can mandate testing in schools if there are sufficient supplies and if Gov. Kathy Hochul needs to sign off on such a move.\n\n“We’re going to pivot. We’re going to shift. We’re going to adjust. We’re going to get it done,\" Adams said. \"That’s the bottom line. We’re going to keep schools open.\"\n\nWHO official eyes 2022: Progress will depend on effectiveness of vaccines\n\nHow well vaccines hold up as the coronavirus mutates will determine the world's ability to tamp down the pandemic in 2022, the head of the health emergencies program at the World Health Organization says.\n\nThe health website STAT asked Dr. Mike Ryan for a prediction of what challenges public health officials will face in 2022. He said a lot will hinge on the level of protection current vaccines provide. It’s a big decision to switch production, but might be necessary if vaccines are no longer effective, he said.\n\n\"If there’s a need to switch vaccine composition, how quickly that can be done?\" Ryan said. \"You can only think in scenarios. There’s so many variables that affect the outcome in extreme ways.\"\n\nCDC could add negative test to latest isolation guidance\n\nThe CDC is considering amending its new, five-day isolation guidance for asymptomatic patients to include testing as soon as today, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday. Last week, the CDC cut in half the amount of time it recommends asymptomatic people should isolate after testing positive. The recommendation does call for wearing masks in public for the next five days but dropped any requirement of a negative test.\n\nFauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, told ABC News' \"This Week\" the CDC is aware of \"pushback\" against dropping a requirement that the patients also test negative. The new rules involve isolation – for people who have tested positive – but do not involve quarantine rules for those exposed to infected people.\n\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin tests positive for COVID-19\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has tested positive for COVID-19 after exhibiting symptoms while at home on leave, he announced Sunday on Twitter. \"I will quarantine myself at home for the next five days,\" said Austin, adding: \"I plan to attend virtually this coming week those key meetings and discussions required to inform my situational awareness and decision making.\"\n\nHis last meeting with President Joe Biden was Dec. 21, Austin said, and he tested negative that morning. Austin said he hasn't been in the Pentagon since Thursday. Austin, 68, said he's fully vaccinated and received a booster in October.\n\n“The vaccines work and will remain a military medical requirement for our workforce. I continue to encourage everyone eligible for a booster shot to get one. This remains a readiness issue,” he said.\n\nTested positive for COVID? Do you need to isolate or quarantine?\n\nTesting positive for COVID-19 starts a confusing, disruptive and at times frightening process – one that millions of Americans will likely go through in the coming weeks.\n\nThere is a difference between isolation and quarantine. Quarantine means keeping someone who was in close contact with someone who has COVID away from others. Isolation means keeping someone who is sick or tested positive for COVID-19 without symptoms away from others, even in their own home, according to the CDC.\n\nIf you are fully vaccinated you do not need to quarantine unless you have symptoms. But the CDC says isolating is a necessary step if you test positive whether you’re vaccinated or unvaccinated, and whether you have symptoms or feel fine.\n\nThe CDC in late December shortened the time it recommends people isolate, saying: \"People with COVID-19 should isolate for 5 days and if they are asymptomatic or their symptoms are resolving (without fever for 24 hours), follow that by 5 days of wearing a mask when around others.\"\n\nRead the CDC's updated guidance on isolating and quarantining.\n\nContributing: Adrianna Rodriguez and Mike Stucka, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}]}

They also demonstrate how he played a key role in the attempts to stop Biden’s certification on January 6.\n\nThe never-before-seen texts include messages from Trump’s family – daughter Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner and son Donald Trump Jr. – as well as White House and campaign officials, Cabinet members, Republican Party leaders, January 6 rally organizers, Rudy Giuliani, My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, Sean Hannity and other Fox hosts. There are also text exchanges with more than 40 current and former Republican members of Congress, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nThe texts include everything from plans to fight the election results to surprising and unexpected reactions on January 6 from some of Trump’s staunchest allies. At 2:28 p.m., Greene, the conservative firebrand who had helped to plan the congressional objections that day, texted Meadows with an urgent plea for help as the violence was unfolding at the Capitol.\n\n“Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn’t the way to solve anything,” Greene wrote. Meadows does not appear to reply.\n\nMore messages flooded in.\n\n“Mark: he needs to stop this, now. Can I do anything to help?” Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former acting White House chief of staff, texted Meadows.\n\n“It’s really bad up here on the hill. They have breached the Capitol,” Georgia Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk wrote.\n\n“The president needs to stop this ASAP,” texted GOP Rep. William Timmons of South Carolina.\n\n“POTUS is engaging,” Meadows sent in response to Loudermilk. “We are doing it,” he texted to Timmons.\n\n“Thanks. This doesn’t help our cause,” Loudermilk replied.\n\nShortly after, Donald Trump Jr. weighed in: “This his(sic) one you go to the mattresses on. They will try to fuck his entire legacy on this if it gets worse.”\n\n“TELL THEM TO GO HOME !!!” texted Trump’s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus.\n\nHeated rhetoric and conspiracy theories\n\nThe text messages CNN obtained begin on Election Day, November 3, 2020. Even before the election was called, Meadows was inundated with conspiracy theories about election fraud, strategies to challenge the results and pleas for Trump to keep fighting. The messages – from GOP activists, donors, Republican members of Congress and state party officials – appear to act as an echo chamber affirming Trump’s false claims that the election was stolen. For months leading up to Election Day, Trump had claimed the only way he could lose was if the election was rigged.\n\nPreviously disclosed text messages showed that former Trump administration Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., each texted Meadows on November 4 and 5 with ideas for overturning the election.\n\nOn November 7, hours before the election was called, Perry texted Meadows again: “We have the data driven program that can clearly show where the fraud was committed. This is the silver bullet.”\n\nWhile Perry has previously denied CNN reporting about his text messages to Meadows, CNN has confirmed it’s his cell phone and he signed this text, “Rick Perry,” including his number.\n\nOther texts, however, include hints of doubt expressed by members of Trump’s team and even Meadows himself about the veracity of conspiracy theories being spread by Trump’s “kraken” team – outside attorneys working for Trump that included Giuliani and Sidney Powell.\n\nSome key congressional allies who worked with Trump’s campaign initially in its efforts to overturn the election, such as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, ultimately soured on the approach as the January 6 congressional certification neared, CNN previously reported.\n\nThe texts also show how Trump allies were quick to deflect responsibility for the January 6 attack. Shortly after pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol, one of his top aides began crafting a counter-narrative.\n\nAt 3:45 p.m., Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller suggested to Meadows and Trump aide Dan Scavino that Trump should tweet: “Call me crazy, but ideas for two tweets from POTUS: 1) Bad apples, likely ANTIFA or other crazed leftists, infiltrated today s peaceful protest over the fraudulent vote count. Violence is never acceptable! MAGA supporters embrace our police and the rule of law and should leave the Capitol now! 2) The fake news media who encouraged this summer s violent and radical riots are now trying to blame peaceful and innocent MAGA supporters for violent actions. This isn’t who we are! Our people should head home and let the criminals suffer the consequences!”\n\nTrump’s allies in Congress appeared to get the message. At 3:52 p.m., Greene told Meadows: “Mark we don’t think these attackers are our people. We think they are Antifa. Dressed like Trump supporters.”\n\nFive minutes later, Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, texted Meadows: “Cap Police told me last night they’d been warned that today there’d be a lot of Antifa dressed in red Trump shirts & hats & would likely get violent.”\n\nIn the 16 months since January 6, hundreds of indictments have shown nearly all of those who breached the Capitol were in fact pro-Trump supporters.\n\nWhile Greene was alarmed on January 6, by the next day she was apologizing that the efforts to block Biden’s certification had failed.\n\n“Yesterday was a terrible day. We tried everything we could in our objection to the 6 states. I’m sorry nothing worked. I don’t think that President Trump caused the attack on the Capitol. It’s not his fault,” she wrote the morning of January 7. “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.”\n\nMeadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) wears a \"Trump Won\" face mask as she arrives on the floor of the House to take her oath of office as a newly elected member of the 117th House of Representatives in Washington, U.S., January 3, 2021. Erin Scott/Reuters\n\nGreene is currently facing a legal challenge to disqualify her from running for Congress because of her alleged role in January 6. In court testimony Friday, the Georgia Republican repeatedly deflected or said she didn’t remember what she had said around the events of January 6. The Meadows text logs offer a new glimpse into what she was telling the White House chief of staff in real time.\n\nOn December 31, Greene reached out to Meadows for advice about how to prepare for objections to certifying the election on January 6.\n\n“Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,” Greene wrote. “I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board. And we need to lay out the best case for each state.”\n\nMeadows does not appear to respond.\n\nBy January 17, Greene was suggesting ways to keep Trump in office, telling Meadows there were several Republicans in Congress who still wanted the then-President to declare martial law, which had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month earlier.\n\nGreene texted: “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law. I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!”\n\nAgain, Meadows does not appear to respond.\n\nWhat Meadows turned over\n\nMeadows provided the cache of 2,319 messages to the January 6 committee in December 2021. But soon after, he stopped cooperating and refused to appear for a deposition. Ultimately, the House voted to hold the former White House chief of staff in contempt of Congress. The Justice Department has not yet announced whether it will charge Meadows.\n\nMeadows has sued the House committee in an attempt to block the congressional subpoenas. And in a late-night court filing on Friday, the committee responded with new details revealing Meadows was warned ahead of time that January 6 could turn violent, according to testimony from Cassidy Hutchison, one of Meadows’ former White House aides.\n\nIn addition, the committee released text messages Meadows exchanged with Republican members of Congress, including texts with Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania about a scheme to replace Justice Department leaders who opposed Trump’s claims of election fraud.\n\nIn late December, Perry reached out to Meadows, connecting him to then-DOJ official Jeffrey Clark, who was pushing unfounded claims of voter fraud inside the Justice Department. Trump was considering firing the acting attorney general and installing Clark instead. Clark invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 100 times when he spoke to the January 6 committee in February.\n\nOn December 26, Perry texted Meadows, “Mark, just checking in as time continues to count down. 11 days to 1/6 and 25 days to inauguration. We gotta get going!”\n\n“Mark, you should call Jeff,” he continued. “I just got off the phone with him and he explained to me why the principal deputy won’t work especially with the FBI. They will view it as as (sic) not having the authority to enforce what needs to be done.”\n\n“I got it,” Meadows responded. “I think I understand. Let me work on the deputy position.”\n\nOn December 28, Perry reached out again: “Did you call Jeff Clark?” Meadows does not appear to respond.\n\nMeadows withheld more than 1,000 messages from the committee on claims of privilege, the panel said in Friday’s court filing. In his lawsuit, Meadows’ attorney argued the former White House chief of staff “has been put in the untenable position of choosing between conflicting privilege claims.”\n\nHannity to Meadows: ‘Yes sir’\n\nIn addition to the texts the committee has released, CNN and other news organizations have previously published selections of text messages Meadows received from Lee, Roy, Trump Jr., Perry and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife, Ginni Thomas.\n\nThe logs obtained by CNN include numerous messages from official White House cell phone numbers. Some have been identified by CNN, others are unknown.\n\nThere are also numerous group texts with Trump’s inner circle. The various group chats include Meadows, Ivanka Trump, Trump Jr. and Kushner, as well as top advisers such as Hope Hicks, campaign manager Bill Stepien, Miller and Scavino, among others.\n\nSome texts only include links to news reports and social media. Others appear to contain content that was cut-and-pasted and forwarded. The logs do not contain images or attachments.\n\nSupporters of U.S. President Donald Trump watch a video featuring Fox host Sean Hannity ahead of Trump's arrival to a campaign rally in Michigan on October 30, 2020. John Moore/Getty Images\n\nMeadows’ messages also include dozens of exchanges with Fox hosts, as well as journalists from the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, Politico, Bloomberg, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN.\n\nAmong Meadows’ most frequent interactions were those with Fox’s Sean Hannity, a well-known friend of Trump. Throughout the logs, Hannity both gives advice and asks for direction.\n\nOn the afternoon of Election Day, Hannity texted Meadows to ask about turnout in North Carolina.\n\nMeadows responded: “Stress every vote matters. Get out and vote.”\n\n“Yes sir,” Hannity replied. “On it. Any place in particular we need a push.”\n\n“Pennsylvania. NC AZ,” Meadows wrote. “Nevada.”\n\n“Got it. Everywhere,” Hannity said.\n\nFor the most part, Meadows’ texts are short, and frequently he does not appear to reply at all. Some conversations include non sequiturs. It’s unclear whether Meadows did not respond to the messages or if the logs are incomplete, because texts could also have been deleted or withheld for claims of privilege.\n\nCNN reached out for comment to all individuals who sent text messages quoted in this story. Meadows and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the January 6 committee declined to comment.\n\nThe fight to ‘stop the steal’\n\nThe text messages provide a timeline showing how Trump’s team searched all corners for evidence of election fraud and tried to overturn the election. Beginning on Election Day, Meadows was in the middle of it all, from connecting activists pushing conspiracy theories to strategizing with GOP lawmakers and rally organizers preparing for January 6.\n\nThe texts also show Meadows was dealing with everything from mediating a fight over who would be on the speaker’s list for the January 6 rally to fielding requests to pay Giuliani’s bills.\n\n“Sir, we are airborne on the way to Michigan from Arizona. We’re going to need a hotel for the team and two vehicles to pick us up,” Bernie Kerik, a Giuliani associate, texted Meadows on December 1.\n\nReached for comment by CNN, Kerik confirmed the text was his and said that he never received a credit card for those travel expenses, paid for it himself and was later reimbursed.\n\nOther texts show Meadows coordinating with GOP activists in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\n“Pls get 4 or 5 killers in remaining counts. Need outsiders who will torch the place. Local folks won’t do it. Lawyers and operators. Get us in these states,” American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp texted Meadows on November 4.\n\n“I may need to get you and mercy (sic) to go to PA,” Meadows responded, referring to Schlapp’s wife, Mercedes, who is a former Trump White House aide.\n\nOn a few occasions, Trump family members weighed in. Ivanka Trump sent a note on November 5 to a group that included Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Miller and Meadows: “You are all WARRIORS of epic proportions! Keep the faith and the fight.”\n\nDozens of Republicans also offered support and advice to Meadows – as well as perpetuated conspiracy theories that were gaining traction in right-wing media.\n\nFor instance, Rep. Ted Budd, a North Carolina Republican now running for Senate, suggested in a text on November 7 that Dominion Voting Systems could be connected to George Soros’ company. Dominion has no corporate ties to Soros, a billionaire and frequent target of baseless conspiracy theories, according to a CNN fact check.\n\nOn November 6, Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, appeared to suggest that state legislatures should appoint electors “in the various states where there’s been shenanigans,” a move he acknowledged would be “highly controversial.” In his text, he wrote the legislatures could appoint “a look doors,” which is phonetically similar to electors.\n\nOn December 1, then-Attorney General William Barr infuriated Trump when he publicly stated that the Justice Department did not find widespread evidence of voter fraud. Nevertheless, Meadows received multiple texts pushing back, including from Schlapp later that day: “Happy to walk ag through our evidence. Its (sic) overwhelming.”\n\nThe texts also show Meadows reached out to GOP officials in multiple states to lobby for Trump’s cause. On two occasions, Meadows attempted to contact Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was under attack from Trump for certifying Georgia’s election for Biden.\n\n“mr Secretary. Can you call the White House switchboard,” Meadows wrote on December 5. “Your voicemail is full.”\n\nRaffensperger does not appear to reply to the messages.\n\nTrump’s efforts to overturn the election results in Georgia are under investigation by a district attorney in the Atlanta area.\n\nMeadows also received text messages from GOP activists and local officials making outlandish claims, including allegations that “traitors inside our intel agencies” were committing election fraud, as well as baseless charges that voting equipment companies Dominion and Smartmatic had manipulated votes – the same false claims being pushed by Giuliani and Powell.\n\nBoth companies have filed billion-dollar lawsuits over the false election claims, including against Fox News, right-wing media organizations, Giuliani, Powell and Lindell.\n\nThroughout the two months, Meadows received dozens of messages from Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, who offered what she claimed were examples and sources of voter fraud.\n\nOn December 9, she sent a text to Meadows letting him know she’d already reached out to Trump’s executive assistant: “This guy says he’s cracked the whole election fraud and wants to speak to someone. I sent his info to Molly Michael a few days ago, but I’m not sure it went anywhere.”\n\n“I will call him,” Meadows responded.\n\nMyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, speaks to reporters outside federal court in Washington, Thursday, June 24, 2021. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nAnother frequent texter was Lindell, one of the most vocal proponents of baseless election conspiracy theories. Even after courts had dismissed dozens of Trump’s legal challenges, the My Pillow CEO was still pressing the White House.\n\n“Everything Sidney has said is true! We have to get the machines and everything we already have proves the President won by millions of votes!” Lindell texted Meadows on December 20. “This is the biggest cover up of one of the worst crimes in history! I have spent over a million$ to help uncover this fraud and used my platform so people can get the word not to give up!”\n\nMeadows replied, “Thanks brother. Pray for a miracle.”\n\n\n\nReached for comment by CNN, Lindell confirmed the text was his. He told CNN that he has not spoken to Meadows since before January 20, 2021, and that at the time he was “just trying to get an appointment with the President.”\n\nDoubts about election fraud\n\nWhile Trump and his allies publicly stuck by their claims that the election had been stolen, behind the scenes, Trump’s inner circle – including Meadows – expressed some doubts. Trump’s aides also questioned whether lawyers like Giuliani and Powell were doing more harm than good.\n\nOn November 6, Miller, Trump’s campaign spokesman, texted a group, which included Ivanka Trump, Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Scavino and Meadows, suggesting that the numbers in Philadelphia didn’t back up claims about alleged election fraud there.\n\n“One other key data point: In 2016, POTUS received 15.5% of the vote in Philadelphia County. Today he is currently at 18.3%. So he increased from his performance in 2016. In 2016, Philadelphia County made up 11.3% of the total vote in the state. As it currently stands, Philadelphia County only makes up 10.2% of the statewide vote tally. So POTUS performed better in a smaller share. Sen. (Rick) Santorum was just making this point on CNN - cuts hard against the urban vote stealing narrative,” Miller wrote.\n\nJason Miller talks on the phone in a meeting room for lawyers of former President Donald Trump during his Senate Impeachment trial on Capitol Hill, February 12, 2021 Jabin Botsford/AFP/Pool/Getty Images\n\nA week later, Miller wrote to Meadows again, this time saying that campaign research did not find any evidence of a conspiracy involving Soros, the Democratic donor. Miller also said he was concerned about sharing the findings with Trump.\n\n“Lots there re: functionality problems, not much there on Dem/Soros conspiracy connections,” Miller wrote on November 13. “Will defer to you on whether or not to share full report with POTUS. POTUS is clearly hyped up on them, not just from his tweets, but he also called me and Justin separately last night to complain. JM.”\n\nOn November 20, Meadows was asked by a Florida contact how confident he was about fraud related to Dominion. Meadows texted back: “Dominion, not that confident. Other fraud. Very confident.”\n\nTwo days later, Ginni Thomas messaged Meadows with apparent concerns, asking, “Trying to understand the Sidney Powell distancing…”\n\nMeadows responded: “She doesn’t have anything or at least she won’t share it if she does.”\n\n“Wow!” Ginni Thomas wrote back.\n\nIn one of the few messages Meadows received from Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law shared a fact check on December 4 debunking one of the most prominent election fraud claims from Georgia. The article showed that despite inflammatory claims of poll workers stashing suitcases filled with ballots under a table, that did not, in fact, occur.\n\n‘Hoping the VP sticks with us’\n\nAfter the Electoral College affirmed Biden’s win on December 14, Trump’s allies turned their attention to January 6: the congressional certification of the electors and the rally that Trump said on Twitter “will be wild!”\n\nOn December 21, Brooks, the Alabama congressman, wrote to Meadows and others in a group text asking whether he should engage with the media about the “formulation of our January 6 strategies.”\n\n“Does the White House want me to reply or be mum?” Brooks wrote. A staunch Trump ally running for Senate this year, Brooks gave an incendiary speech on January 6 but recently fell out of favor with Trump after suggesting Republicans should move on from 2020.\n\n\n\nIn response to CNN’s request for comment, Brooks said he had “no regrets” about his speech on January 6 and that he was “shocked” by the violence. “I had no inkling,” Brooks added.\n\nCruz, a Texas Republican who pushed a plan inside the Senate that would have delayed certification of the election, exchanged just a few messages with Meadows – links to his statements posted to social media.\n\nOn January 2, the senator sent Meadows his tweet proposing a 10-day audit of the election results.\n\n“Here’s the statement,” Cruz wrote.\n\n“Perfect,” Meadows responded.\n\nThe texts also make frequent reference to then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to go along with Trump’s plan to try to block the certification on January 6. On December 30, Rep. Brian Babin of Texas expressed concern that congressional leaders might try to short circuit their objections – and that Pence was not on board.\n\n“Dems and some Republicans may well try to shortstop our objection efforts. Hoping the VP sticks with us,” Babin wrote.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, Miller shared a news article with Meadows that Pence opposed a lawsuit intended to help overturn the election. Miller warned that it could be used “to drive a massive wedge between POTUS and everybody else in the party.”\n\n“He’s absolutely going to blow his stack on this if he isn’t already aware,” Miller said of Trump. “Oh boy I don’t understand what the VP was thinking here.”\n\nOn January 5, Jordan, the Ohio congressman and close GOP ally of Meadows, weighed in.\n\n“On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all – in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence,” Jordan wrote.\n\nMeadows responded the morning of January 6: “I have pushed for this. Not sure it is going to happen.”\n\nThe January 6 committee included the text exchange in its Friday court filing as evidence of Meadows’ alleged involvement in the effort to overturn the election.\n\nThe logs also show Meadows was involved with planning the rally on January 6, helping to mediate a fight over the speakers list. Trump adviser Katrina Pierson was alarmed at some of the proposed fringe figures who wanted to speak.\n\nCrowds arrive for the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nOn January 2 and 3, Pierson wrote to Meadows looking for help.\n\n“Good afternoon, would you mind giving me a call re: this Jan 6th event. Things have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction. Please,” she asked on January 2.\n\nThe next day, she reached out again: “Scratch that, Caroline Wren has decided to move forward with the original psycho list. Apparently Dan Scavino approved??”\n\nShe continued: “So, I’m done. I can’t be a part of embarrassing POTUS any further.”\n\nWren was a fundraiser for the Trump campaign and helped organize the January 6 rally. She has been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee.\n\nLess than an hour later, Pierson wrote Meadows that she told Wren she was talking to the White House in order to get her to back down.\n\n“I let her know that I was going to reach out to WH and her tone changed,” Pierson wrote. “So, I’ll continue to build a proper event.”\n\n“Thank you,” Meadows responded.\n\n‘As bad as this can get’\n\nIn the aftermath of the violence at the Capitol on January 6, Trump’s inner circle discussed in a group text how to deal with the fallout – and Trump’s suspension from Twitter. At 10:10 p.m. on January 6, Kushner texted the group: “Why don’t we post on his Facebook page since he isn’t locked out there.”\n\nIn the final days of Trump’s term, as he faced impeachment for a second time, Meadows received words of encouragement from staunch allies, as well as caution from advisers.\n\n“I would like to pass to POTUS that we are still with him, I believe in him and I want to encourage him,” Rep. Andrew Clyde, a freshman Georgia Republican, wrote on January 9. “I truly hope he does create a new platform to complete (sic) with Twitter and I hope he calls it ‘Trumpet’ and then we can send out ‘notes’ to each other!”\n\n“I will share it with him. Thanks Andrew,” Meadows responded.\n\nOn January 13, the day the House voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol – with 10 Republicans joining Democrats – Miller shared polling data in a group text with Meadows, Scavino and Kushner that showed “2/3 of the MAGA base wants us to move on.”\n\n“I tried to walk the President through this earlier but he won’t have any of it,” Miller said.\n\nAs Trump prepared to leave power, he appeared to be a pariah in the Republican Party. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy had said during the House’s January 13 impeachment debate that the outgoing President “bears responsibility” for the riot. Six days later, on January 19, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell denounced Trump from the floor of the Senate, saying the mob that attacked the Capitol was “provoked by the President and other powerful people.”\n\nNevertheless, Trump’s standing in the Republican Party quickly recovered, especially after McCarthy’s January 28 visit to Mar-a-Lago and the February 2021 acquittal of Trump in the Senate impeachment trial.\n\nBut before Trump left office, the Meadows text logs show some of Trump’s staunchest allies were dejected. On January 19, in one of the final texts Meadows received as chief of staff, Fox’s Sean Hannity shared a video of McConnell’s floor speech.\n\nHannity texted Meadows: “Well this is as bad as this can get.”", "authors": ["Jamie Gangel Jeremy Herb Elizabeth Stuart", "Jamie Gangel", "Jeremy Herb", "Elizabeth Stuart"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/11/coal-miners-crawfish-offer-full-capacity-opry-news-around-states/116104458/", "title": "Coal miners, crawfish offer: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Public health officials are urging people to get COVID-19 shots as soon as possible, after the White House informed governors last week that it might reallocate supply from states with decreasing demand. Distribution has been in steady decline for several weeks, according to Alabama Department of Public Health data. “Y’all, we want shots in the arms and off the shelf,” Gov. Kay Ivey said. “If you have not made it a priority to schedule a vaccine, I encourage you to go get the shot as soon as you are able. If you are hesitant to get the COVID-19 vaccine, please speak to a physician you trust and ask if he or she would recommend it for you. If we don’t use it, we could lose it. This is our ticket back to normal. The vaccine is free and could possibly save your life.” In the early stages of the vaccine rollout, the Alabama Department of Public Health heavily targeted vulnerable areas, particularly those with large minority populations that have been historically underserved medically and seen disproportionately severe, deadly COVID-19 outcomes. The strategy paid off, with Alabama outperforming its neighbors earlier this year at reaching its most vulnerable citizens. The state’s highest county vaccination rates are in the Black Belt. But Alabama is now running into serious “vaccine hesitancy.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Officials have reported that the city’s sewer system is clogging up because people are flushing wipes and other items – a problem worsened by the pandemic as people continue to spend more time at home. Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility spokesperson Sandy Baker said up to 6,000 pounds of wipes have entered the sewer system daily since the coronavirus pandemic started, Alaska’s News Source reports. “We saw a small uptick in wipes when the pandemic started,” Baker said. “But this is a year-round problem for us.” The wipes combine with grease, oils and fats, which can block pipes if not removed and even cause sewage to back up into residential neighborhoods and homes. Baker said the problem, in part, is that many brands of wipes claim to be flushable on their packaging but for practical purposes are not because they “don’t break down” after flushing. Crews have also retrieved masks, gloves, dental floss, hair and other items from sewer pipes, Baker said. “We had a surprising number of people doing extensive cleaning with toothbrushes and then flushing toothbrushes,” she said. “We had a lot of that showing up … and those are horrible for our system.” Baker urged people to be mindful of what they flush down toilets and remember the three P’s – “pee, poo and toilet paper.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An elected utility regulator has shared discredited conspiracy theories while trying to persuade energy and power providers not to require their employees to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Arizona Corporation Commission member Jim O’Connor said the government and news media are covering up the shots causing numerous deaths and people becoming “human vegetables,” but there’s no evidence of such problems. O’Connor, a Republican, was elected last November to his statewide office as one of five commission members. He served as a presidential elector for then-GOP nominee Donald Trump during his successful campaign in 2016. O’Connor said one source of his information was Ryan Cole, an Idaho physician who has made false and controversial statements about COVID-19. The Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania debunked several of Cole’s claims about COVID-19 vaccines on its website. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the vaccines are safe. Besides mild side effects such as soreness and fever, the only serious side effects so far are very rare blood clots associated with one of the three vaccines and even rarer allergic reactions.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Sluggish COVID-19 vaccination rates for prison workers are raising concerns about the state prison system’s ability to ward off disease during the pandemic’s next phase and against more-contagious variants, according to public health and incarceration experts. About 42% of the more than 4,700 employees of the Arkansas Department of Corrections have received at least one shot, an agency spokeswoman said. The corrections department set a goal of vaccinating 80% of employees after shots were offered Jan. 5, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. More than 11,300 people in Arkansas’ custody have contracted the coronavirus, and at least 49 have died, according to Department of Health data. As of May 1, Arkansas’ infection rate among prisoners was the third-highest among states, according to data compiled by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit criminal-justice news outlet. State prisons continue to see new virus cases, with five sites reporting new cases since April 15. Department of Corrections communications director Cindy Murphy didn’t answer questions from the newspaper about why officials think COVID-19 vaccinations lag among workers. In a statement, she said the agency has been affected “more than most” institutions in the state, and workers had “stepped up once again” to get shots.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Residents will no longer need an appointment for COVID-19 shots at city-run inoculation sites, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Sunday. The city is prepared to administer over a quarter-million vaccinations for the second week in a row, the mayor’s office said. Last week, Los Angeles stopped requiring appointments for some walk-up and mobile locations. As of Monday, appointment-free options are available at all vaccination sites. People can still sign up ahead of time if they prefer. “We stand at a critical juncture in our fight to end this pandemic, and our City will keep doing everything possible to knock down barriers to vaccine access and deliver doses directly to all Angelenos,” Garcetti said in a statement. In addition, the city will provide nighttime appointments at three locations so residents can get vaccinated after work, officials said. At the city’s first night clinic last week, 62% of first doses were given out after 2 p.m., Garcetti’s office said. So far, 48.4% of Los Angeles County residents have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and 34.8% are fully vaccinated, according to the Los Angeles Times’ vaccination tracker.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A former Amazon warehouse worker has filed a complaint with the state Department of Labor and Employment against Amazon over its COVID-19 policies and allegations that her firing was retaliatory. Linda Rodriguez alleged in her complaint filed Thursday that Amazon fired her in 2020 because she raised concerns about the company’s policies and practices. She said they put Thornton, Colorado, warehouse workers at risk amid the spread of the coronavirus, according to the complaint sent to the agency’s Division of Labor Standards and Statistics. The complaint said Rodriguez was fired “for speaking out” after she raised concerns that Amazon was providing health information only in English even though many workers in the facility only speak Spanish and “felt extraordinary pressure to continue coming to work every day, even if they were sick.” In response to the complaint, an Amazon spokesperson said Rodriguez was not fired for speaking publicly but for “timecard fraud” or “time theft,” which they said was confirmed by time records and video footage. Amazon also said that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a federal agency that regulates companies to ensure safe working conditions, confirmed Rodriguez withdrew a complaint filed with the federal agency in early December 2020.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Of the more than 1.4 million residents who are now fully vaccinated, 242 later became infected with COVID-19, according to data released Friday by the state Department of Public Health. Among the 242 so-called vaccine breakthrough cases, 109 people had no symptoms of the disease. DPH reported three deaths among vaccinated individuals who were confirmed to have had underlying medical conditions. All were over 55 years old. Nationally, there have been 132 vaccine breakthrough deaths, DPH said. “The main takeaway is that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective and cases of infection after a person is fully vaccinated are very rare,” Dr. Deidre Gifford, the state’s acting public health commissioner, said in a statement. The percentage of cases of COVID-19 in fully vaccinated individuals in Connecticut is less than 0.1%, according to the DPH data. “The best protection against severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19 is vaccination, and I strongly urge all eligible Connecticut residents who have not yet gotten vaccinated to do so,” Gifford said. Release of the breakthrough case data comes as more than 50% of Connecticut residents age 16 and older are now fully vaccinated.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: As demand returns for activities that were put on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses say they are struggling to hire workers. “What we are hearing, of course, are a need for workers to fill unfilled jobs,” said Rachel Turney, deputy secretary at the Delaware Department of Labor. The pandemic-era unemployment system could be contributing to the lack of job-seekers for lower-paying positions thanks to Congress extending extra federal unemployment benefits and the state labor department halting the requirement that beneficiaries actively look for work. Office of Occupational and Labor Market Information Chief Thomas Dougherty said businesses struggling to hire could raise wages in order to compete with unemployment benefits. “When you have the wage going up, you also attract more workers to either enter the labor market or ... attract them from another industry, or maybe attract them from another state,” he said. “If I’m making such and such money from unemployment insurance, I’m reluctant to take a job that pays the same or less.” Democrats in the General Assembly are trying to pass a $15 minimum wage, gradually raising it from the current $9.25 over the course of several years. But many business representatives oppose the measure.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. will lift most COVID-19 restrictions and capacity limits starting May 21 following “dramatic” improvements in health metrics in the city, WUSA-TV reports. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Monday that restrictions on public and commercial activities – including capacity limits, types of activities and time restrictions – will be lifted across the city May 21. But the loosening of restrictions excludes bars, nightclubs, and large sports or music venues, which will operate at 50% capacity. Bowser said starting June 11, restrictions will be lifted for all establishments and venues in the district. D.C. will continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s mask guidance. That means wearing masks will still be required, Bowser said. City health officials said community spread of the coronavirus is decreasing after peaking in January. She said the district is going in the right direction when it comes to COVID-19 cases and vaccinations., and residents and businesses have outperformed the metrics. “I am proud of D.C. residents who have followed health guidance, and we see it in the numbers,” Bowser said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Local vaccination clinics have noticed a slowdown in demand for COVID-19 shots. “People who were eager to get vaccinated have been vaccinated,” said Dr. Temple Robinson, CEO of the Bond Community Health Center. “Now we really need to turn our attention to (the) people who are still deciding when or if they want to get vaccinated.” Leon County health officials say the observed vaccination fatigue is concerning and concentrated among young adults. Included in that demographic are nearly 70,000 students who attend local colleges. Despite students residing in Tallahassee for school, they are counted among Leon County’s population for COVID-19 statistics, according to the Florida Department of Health. This pattern holds true across the state. Florida has fully vaccinated about 31% of its adult population, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “My concern is the 18-35 population is showing a little more hesitancy than I would have expected early on,” Robinson said, adding that the 65-and-older population has been more eager to get vaccinated. Of the more than 93,000 locals vaccinated, state data shows that only about 8,240 are between the ages of 16 and 24.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s elected labor commissioner said he intends to reinstate the requirement that people must actively search for work to receive unemployment benefits “in the next few months.” Republican Mark Butler didn’t say exactly when the job-search requirement would return. Butler said last week that those getting benefits would get notice of the change. Georgia and most other states suspended job-search requirements to cut down on COVID-19 exposure. Butler said his department is shifting its focus from paying benefits to encouraging recipients to find new jobs. He said employers have 240,000 jobs listed with the state, and the department provides job-search assistance, career counseling and skills testing. “I hear every day from employers who have been forced to reduce business hours, refuse large deliveries, and turn down economic opportunities due to the simple fact that they did not have the staff to support them,” Butler said in a statement. He said hotels and restaurants have particularly critical labor needs. Some officials and business owners have called for ending a $300-a-week federal unemployment supplement, saying it allows too many workers to afford to stay home. However, defenders of the measure say the labor market is still disrupted by COVID-19, particularly among those with children.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state is leading the nation in vaccinating its adult population against COVID-19, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Lt. Gov. Josh Green told the outlet that with 70% of residents 18 and up having received at least one dose of a vaccine, Hawaii is ahead of the rest of the United States, taking the No. 1 spot. The state has been seeing daily new coronavirus cases in the high double-digits but expects to see that number drop further as the Aloha State pushes further toward herd immunity, Green said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Department of Health and Welfare is offering funding to groups to establish and operate mobile, off-site, walk-in and special COVID-19 vaccination clinics in underserved populations. That includes communities of high social vulnerabilities, racial and ethnic minority populations, and rural communities, among others. A total of $9 million is available on a first-come, first-served basis to enrolled vaccine providers, who can apply for funding online. Grant money can be used for any COVID-19 vaccine services the recipient provides outside their usual, appointment-based clinics. Examples include, but are not limited to, in-home vaccination for homebound individuals; clinics joined with community and job fairs; and walk-up sites at pharmacies, shopping centers, places of worship, colleges and universities, salons, and other locations. An initial funding cap of $500,000 per applicant will apply for the funding opportunity. Eligible applicants must either be currently enrolled as an Idaho COVID-19 vaccine provider or partner with an enrolled Idaho COVID-19 vaccine provider to administer the clinic.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State public health officials on Sunday reported 1,741 new confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 30 additional deaths. The Illinois Department of Public Health is reporting a total of 1.35 million coronavirus cases in Illinois, including 22,223 deaths, since the start of the pandemic. As of late Saturday, 1,870 people were hospitalized in the state due to COVID-19. Of those, 452 were in intensive care units, and 232 were on ventilators. The preliminary seven-day statewide test positivity rate is 3.4%. A total of 9,908,489 vaccines have been injected into the arms of Illinois residents since mid-December, and 35% of the state’s population, about 4.5 million, is fully vaccinated, according to the public health department.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Advocates for nursing home residents say they worry a new state law expanding COVID-19 liability protections for health care providers will effectively block many lawsuits over neglect and substandard treatment that weren’t caused by the pandemic. The law, which applies retroactively to when Indiana’s first COVID-19 infections were reported in March 2020, was sought by the nursing home industry, which argues it will keep facilities financially viable by shielding them from a potential flood of coronavirus-related lawsuits. Critics of the law, however, maintain it lets nursing homes escape responsibility for deaths and injuries caused by problems that preceded the pandemic, such as inadequate staffing. The new law protects health care providers against any claims “arising from COVID-19.” The definition of that phrase includes the reallocation of staff, delaying or modifying nonemergency medical services, and reasonable nonperformance of medical services due to COVID-19. The measure doesn’t prevent lawsuits over “gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct,” but trial lawyers warn those are virtually impossible to prove. Jody Madeira, a professor who teaches medical law at Indiana University, said the law provides a way for nursing homes to make mistreatment claims go away.\n\nIowa\n\nMarshalltown: Gov. Kim Reynolds has removed the chief executive of the state’s nursing home for veterans and their spouses, months after praising his response to the coronavirus pandemic, her office said Monday. Reynolds’ spokesman, Pat Garrett, said Timon Oujiri was “relieved of his duties” as commandant of the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown last week. He offered no additional information on the leadership change at the facility, which is Iowa’s largest nursing home. Reynolds appointed Oujiri as commandant in 2017, and the Iowa Senate confirmed him in 2018. In his role, he oversaw one of the nation’s largest state-owned nursing homes for veterans, with about 500 residents and 900 employees. In December, the governor appeared with Oujiri at one of her news conferences and praised the work he had done protecting the home’s staff and residents during the pandemic. “You and your team have done such an outstanding job,” Reynolds said. “Job well done.” Oujiri, 63, returned the support, saying the governor had ensured the home had adequate personal protective equipment and testing supplies. He said then that 21 of the home’s residents tested positive for the coronavirus in 2020 and that five of them died.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Identity theft rose sharply last year during the COVID-19 pandemic, and no place was hit harder than the Sunflower State. The Wichita Eagle reports that 43,211 Kansans alerted the Federal Trade Commission in 2020 that someone had stolen or tried to steal their identity. That was 2,272 more cases than in 2019. Kansas’ 1,802% year-over-year increase was the highest among the states and more than three times the national average. Rhode Island was next, with an increase of 1,002%. Of all the 2020 identity theft reports in Kansas, 88% were classified as government documents or benefits fraud. The Kansas Department of Labor has cited a barrage of fraudulent unemployment claims since the coronavirus pandemic began.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Those who get a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at a Kroger or Walmart may be able to get in on a major cash prize. The Kentucky Lottery announced Monday that, starting immediately, people 18 or older who get a first or second dose of the vaccine at more than 170 Kroger and Walmart locations across the state will receive a coupon for a free CashBall 225 ticket. The top prize in the nightly CashBall game is $225,000, according to the Kentucky Lottery. This announcement comes as public officials in the Bluegrass State continue to urge Kentuckians to receive a COVID-19 shot. As of Sunday, 1,867,037 Kentuckians – or 42% of the commonwealth’s population – have been vaccinated. At recent press briefings, Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, has said that he will be announcing incentives to encourage people to get the vaccine.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A pound of crawfish is being promised to lure people to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The city is partnering with the local nonprofit Go Propeller to give the vaccines and crawfish from The Original Cajun Seafood on Thursday, WVUE-TV reports. The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines will be available during the event, along with food, music and gift card giveaways, officials said. The crawfish giveaway is one of many different ways health officials and businesses have been encouraging people to get vaccinated. In recent weeks various bars have held “shots for shots” events where people who get vaccinated can get a free shot of booze, while other events have featured music or fish fry giveaways.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A proposal from a group of Republicans to ban mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for five years is up for consideration by a legislative committee this week. The lawmakers, led by Rep. Tracy Quint, R-Hodgdon, have based their proposal in part on the theory that the vaccines cause reproductive harm. Numerous medical authorities have said the claim lacks merit, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said there is “no evidence that any of the COVID-19 vaccines affect future fertility.” The proposal is slated for a work session before the Legislature’s Committee on Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services on Tuesday. The bill says it “prohibits mandatory vaccinations for coronavirus disease 2019 for 5 years from the date of a vaccine’s first emergency use authorization by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration in order to allow for safety testing and investigations into reproductive harm.” Maine authorities are not currently considering any proposals that would make COVID-19 vaccines mandatory for residents. More than 52% of the eligible people in the state have been fully vaccinated, state officials said Monday. Maine was one of the first states in the country to surpass the 50% threshold.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: While taking note of current health threats, a bit of the past will roll through Washington County next weekend. After missing last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Pike Festival and James Shaull Wagon Train will return. “This year, obviously, is going to be different,” said Chad Walker, the organization’s secretary and treasurer. Even though it’s an outdoor event, face coverings will be required because of ongoing COVID-19 concerns. Visitors will be able to pet horses at the stops, Walker said, but they should wear masks. “As well, we’re going to practice social distancing where possible,” he said. The event celebrates the past and tries to educate people about what life was like when it took an hour or so just to hitch up a buggy and prepare for a trip to town. The National Pike Festival commemorates what was once the major route west. Different communities celebrate in different ways. The James Shaull Wagon Train is a nod to Shaull, who farmed with Belgian horses and participated in annual wagon trains and parades. He died in a tractor accident. “He thought it was important to educate the public on how it was to live back then,” Walker said. The wagon train will set off Friday afternoon from Plumb Grove and end Sunday morning in Boonsboro.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city’s famous Swan Boats are again offering rides after being sidelined last year because of the pandemic. Acting Mayor Kim Janey took her family on one of the foot-powered boats Saturday to celebrate their reopening at the Boston Public Garden. Janey called it “a great way to celebrate our recovery from the pandemic.” “We welcome Bostonians and visitors back to our historic park to enjoy this joyful attraction in keeping with current health guidelines for a safe ride with family and friends,” she said in a statement. Masks are required on the boats, and passengers are being spaced apart in line and on the vessels. The Paget family, which has run the iconic Boston tradition since 1877, said last summer was the first time the entire season had been canceled. The oldest boat in the fleet just celebrated its 111th season. Each Swan Boat weighs 3 tons fully laden and is powered by the driver using a foot-propelled paddle wheel.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state said late Friday that 54% of residents ages 16 and up have gotten at least one COVID-19 shot, a roughly 2.5 percentage point jump after factoring in people who were vaccinated outside the state or at federal facilities. The addition of nearly 227,000 residents to the state’s count put Michigan close to a 55% benchmark Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has said is needed to allow in-person work in all sectors, including offices. The reopening step will occur two weeks after the milestone is reached. State officials said a new tracker uses data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which can access data from out-of-state providers and federal entities like veterans hospitals. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive and chief deputy for health, said the “Vacc to Normal” tracker provides the most complete vaccination estimate. Nearly 4.4 million Michiganders, 53.9%, ages 16 and older have received one dose. That is higher than 51.5% that was shown on the state’s regular vaccine dashboard Friday. The state health department urged people who were vaccinated in another state to bring their card to their next doctor’s appointment or to their local health department so that their immunization information is updated in the Michigan Care Improvement Registry.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Health officials are trying a range of strategies in an attempt to get people vaccinated and slow the spread of the coronavirus. Volunteer physicians are working with a brewery in St. Paul on a pop-up event that rewards those who get shots with a free beer. Vaccinations are being offered in the downtown bus depot in Duluth. An Elk River clinic is offering shots to patients who are seeking help for other health care needs. Officials are hoping the creativity pays off. Since early April, the statewide average for first COVID-19 vaccine doses administered has fallen from about 40,000 per day to fewer than 14,000 at the end of last week, the Star Tribune reports. “We’re seeing a shift now from the earlier phases of vaccination, where there were folks very eager to get the vaccine and able to go to, sometimes, pretty extraordinary lengths to go find the vaccine wherever it was,” said Jan Malcolm, the state health commissioner. “Now we’re in a situation where we’ve got plenty of vaccine supply, and we need to reach those folks and make it more convenient for them.” Gov. Tim Walz has announced the state’s indoor mask mandate will end July 1 but said it could be lifted sooner if 70% of those age 16 and older receive first doses. That would equal more than 3 million people.\n\nMississippi\n\nBay St. Louis: A hospice care center is working to brighten patients’ pandemic-darkened days with good deeds. Wishing Well Project was started at SouthernCare Hospice in Picayune. “If there’s something specific that will just brighten their day, cheer them up and give them a couple of good memories is what we try to do,” Coordinator Rebecca Silvia told WLOX. The TV outlet reports Nola King of Bay St. Louis just had her garden restored. When she was younger, she used to spend all her time in the garden. “I got garden of the month twice,” King told WLOX. “I’ve had a lawnmower; I weeded my flower beds; I made my flower beds. I’ve done it all.” But lately, King said she has not been able to work in her garden at the house where she’s lived for more than 70 years due to her health. “I miss it so much,” King told the television station. “Gardening helps you grow. I’ve read that plants are the best thing you could do when you’re older.” Silvia said the organization relies on volunteers to complete patients’ wishes, and they’re always looking for more. “I’m always a little surprised at the turnout,” she said. “When you reach out to the need of folks, especially in Bay St. Louis, they just turn up. Especially after a tough year of COVID, it’s nice to see people being nice.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Springfield Public Schools’ summer program is finding a new balance this year. Explore’s offerings for elementary and middle school will largely resemble the courses before the pandemic, with a few changes and extra precautions. High school courses will be almost entirely online. Dana Hubbard, director of summer learning and student experiences, said seated or in-person learning will be an option for kindergarten through eighth grade. “We are really hopeful that we can get our families reengaged in that way,” she said. In a nod to the pandemic, there will also be a virtual learning option for elementary and middle school students. “The new thing we bring with us, after a year of COVID and shifting, is we will also have – starting with first grade all the way through eighth grade – online options for courses,” she said. Elementary courses, in-person and virtual, include “Route 66 Road Trip” and the Earth Explorers. The seated-only courses include Explore Diversity, Life Lab, and the STEAM Works. Hubbard said Central High School will have in-person classes for students with special needs, students with limited English skills, and individuals significantly lagging behind their peers academically. The district will offer two sessions of Explore, one June 7-30 and the second July 7-30.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A nonprofit plans to open a slaughterhouse that will kill and process cattle donated for food banks. The $2.5 million Producer Partnership plant outside Livingston will be able to process 300 animals per month by next year, the Billings Gazette reports. Ranchers who donate cattle for food banks will have access to the processing plant for their own retail sales. The Producer Partnership formed last year to help struggling communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The partnership has donated 80,000 pounds of hamburger in the past year and is shooting for 140,000 pounds a year. The group has struggled to secure space at slaughterhouses, however, limiting how many donated animals it can accept. “We’ve been trying to get kill dates at different plants. That proved to be hard to find a kill date in the first place, and then we wound up with so many animals donated that we couldn’t find enough dates,” said Mayzie Purviance, Producer Partnership program administrator. The processing plant will be federally inspected, meaning ranchers who choose to use the facility for direct retail sales will be able to ship meat out of state, Purviance said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state will issue emergency payments Tuesday to residents who received food stamp benefits in April as part of the federal pandemic assistance law, state officials said. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services said it will issue the payments through Sept. 30 to comply with the American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law earlier this year by President Joe Biden. Recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will not have to take any action to get the extra support because the increased benefits will go directly to their EBT cards. Under the law, all SNAP households must receive a minimum of $95 in emergency allotments.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Casino giant Caesars Entertainment Inc. is postponing plans to sell one of its eight Las Vegas Strip resorts until the market further rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic, perhaps next year, the Las Vegas Sun reports. Caesars officials have said since the company’s merger with Eldorado Resorts that they plan to sell a Strip asset. “We remain convinced that it does not make sense for us to market an asset until we can market it off the cash flow that we’re doing with it, not off a bridge to what we think we can do with it,” Caesars CEO Tom Reeg said. He said it’s possible a sale could happen in 2022. A potential buyer, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, looked at a Strip property before coming to terms on a $650 million deal announced last week to buy the Palms, according to its CEO, Laurens Vosloo, who declined to say which Strip property the band was considering. Caesars posted a net loss of $423 million for the first quarter of the year after collecting $1.7 billion in net revenues for the three months that ended March 31. The company recorded a net loss of $173 million during the first quarter of 2020. Caesars officials said they expect business in Las Vegas will continue to improve as the year goes on.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State officials expect spending on summer tourism to rebound to near 2019 levels. The state Division of Travel and Tourism Development is predicting there will be nearly 3.5 million visitors to New Hampshire this summer, with spending reaching $1.8 billion. Summer is typically the busiest season for tourism in the state. Last summer, visitation dropped 15% because of the pandemic. But officials expect a rebound based on pent-up demand for travel and the state’s high vaccination rate, strong economy and tourism assets. The state is launching a summer advertising campaign targeting Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio, said Lori Harnois, state tourism director. She said the emphasis will be on hiking, boating, camping and family fun. “We expect this to be a summer of discovery and rediscovery for visitors,” Harnois said. “Our message is to come, explore everything we have to offer, and Discover Your New in New Hampshire.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy will set aside $275million to help small businesses and individuals affected by COVID-19, including $40 million in federal funds for undocumented immigrants and others left out of previous pandemic relief. Murphy announced the funding in a statement Friday and said much of the $235 million in small-business assistance would go toward bars and restaurants, child care centers and others hard hit by a year of coronavirus lockdowns. State lawmakers would still have to approve that pot, but Murphy said legislative leaders are already on board. Cash payments for individuals, meanwhile, would come out of federal stimulus funds over which Murphy has control, the administration said. The money would help New Jerseyans who suffered relatively short periods of unemployment as well as undocumented immigrants, who’ve been largely ineligible for trillions of dollars in federal relief payments as well as state unemployment over the past year. “COVID-19 has created unimaginable challenges for our economy over the past year,” Murphy said. “As we emerge from this pandemic, we need to make targeted investments in both our small businesses and our workforce to lay the foundation for a stronger and fairer future that works for everyone.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state has set a record for the highest monthly royalty earnings from oil and gas leases, according to state officials. The State Land Office reported that nearly $110 million was earned in April – more than any month in state history. The previous record was nearly $109 million in February 2020, just before a global price war and pandemic market forces disrupted the oil industry. Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard said the revenue boon will benefit public schools, hospitals and other programs that are funded by drilling and other development on state trust land. Revenue from activities on trust land on average saves the typical New Mexico household an estimated $1,500 per year in taxes that would otherwise be needed to fund state operations, Garcia Richard said. “This is a huge monetary relief for hard working New Mexico families, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic,” she said in a statement. While oil and gas is a driving force of New Mexico’s economy and the state budget, the Democratic land commissioner said the resources are finite and aren’t a stable long-term budgeting tool for the state.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A political candidate who led protests against coronavirus restrictions in Brooklyn last fall will avoid jail time after pleading guilty Friday to a charge of inciting a riot. Harold “Heshy” Tischler was sentenced to 10 days of community service for egging on a crowd of men that chased and trapped a journalist during the Oct. 7 protest in the Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Borough Park. Video showed the men surrounding, jostling and taunting Jacob Kornbluh, who had been reporting on resistance to social distancing in the neighborhood. Tischler, not wearing a mask, could be seen screaming in Kornbluh’s face. Kornbluh, who is also an Orthodox Jew, said he was struck and kicked during the incident. Kornbluh was reporting for Jewish Insider at the time and now writes for the Jewish newspaper The Forward. Tischler, an activist and City Council candidate, posted a video on Twitter after his court appearance praising his lawyers who “saved me” and showing himself behind the counter with supporters at a local pizza parlor. Kornbluh tweeted that he welcomed Tischler’s acknowledgment in court “that he incited a riot against me and has been held accountable for his actions. I am looking forward to continuing my work in journalism undeterred.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Lawmakers are pressing to ensure that patients at health care facilities can receive visits from family member and clergy, especially during future emergencies. Last week the state Senate and House approved separate measures designed to address situations where patients lacked access to a minister or visits from family during last year’s COVID-19 restrictions and later died. The Senate’s “No Patient Left Behind” bill, approved on a 40-9 vote, tells hospitals and hospice care, nursing home and residential treatment facilities to allow patients to receive visitors to the fullest extent permitted by federal Medicaid and Medicare rules and regulations. If they don’t, the health care facilities will receive a warning. Those who don’t allow visitors within 24 hours of the warning will face minimum daily fines of $500 per incident. Similar rules apply to adult care homes. The House voted 98-19 for a measure directing state-licensed hospitals to allow a clergy member to visit any patient who requests one. A cleric may be subject to health screenings and could be turned away if he or she fails to pass that screening or tests positive for an infectious disease. Each bill still must pass the opposite chamber before being sent to Gov. Roy Cooper’s desk.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An annual report using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the state’s rate of workplace deaths remains among the highest in the country. The annual report released by the AFL-CIO shows that 37 North Dakota workers died in 2019 due to on-the-job injuries. The rate of 9.7 deaths per 100,000 workers was the third-highest in the nation, behind Alaska and Wyoming, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “This year’s report is yet another reminder of the dangers facing working people in North Dakota every single day,” North Dakota AFL-CIO President Landis Larson said in a statement. “Now with COVID-19, it’s more important than ever to protect working people.” Nationally in 2019, 5,333 workers were killed on the job, and an estimated 90,000 died from occupational diseases. The overall rate of fatal job injuries was 2.8 per 100,000. according to the labor union federation. It’s the the 30th year the AFL-CIO has released the findings on the state of safety and health protections for workers across the country. North Dakota’s ranking has changed little in recent years. In 2016, the state had 28 workplace deaths and ranked fifth in the nation; in 2017, the state had 38 deaths and ranked second; and in 2018, it had 35 deaths and ranked third.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The state will take only 20% of the COVID-19 vaccine doses allocated to it this week amid slumping demand. Ohio was allocated 324,960 first doses this week. The state has ordered just 65,370 first doses to arrive this week, an Ohio Department of Health spokeswoman said Monday. More could be used this week: The state is banking 139,230 doses of the Pfizer vaccine for use in children ages 12 to 15, once the vaccine receives emergency approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration. That’s expected as soon as this week. Those doses will be stored with the rest of Ohio’s stockpile at the federal level. As of last week, Ohio had stockpiled 480,180 first COVID-19 vaccine doses – about 10% of the total number of first doses administered statewide. “Vaccine is precious,” health department spokeswoman Alicia Shoults wrote in an email. “Many providers in Ohio have adequate vaccine supply on hand and requested that additional doses not be shipped to them the week of May 10.” Last week, White House officials said states could request a smaller or larger number of doses than what was allocated to them. Unordered doses could be contributed to a national pool to divert to states and programs in need of more vaccine.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The latest flu season has been especially mild, and experts say COVID-19 precautions likely played a role in keeping the numbers down. Across the state, 221 flu-associated hospitalizations and 10 deaths were reported so far during the 2020-21 season – the lowest numbers in years, aligning with trends across the country. During the previous flu season, 3,580 hospitalizations and 85 deaths were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. Masks and social distancing were likely a major factor in keeping the flu at bay this year, said Dr. David Chansolme, medical director of infection prevention with Integris Health. “As people have really questioned the science behind masks, to me, the lack of a significant flu season is the most verification that you need,” Chansolme said. During a presentation at a recent Healthier Oklahoma Coalition news conference, MyHealth Access Network founder and CEO Dr. David Kendrick said there was a significant difference in flu positivity rates in communities where masks were required versus where they weren’t. There are likely other factors, too, Chansolme said: a relative lack of crowds, more people working from home than usual – even fist-bumps versus handshakes.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city’s mass vaccination site is expected to close June 19 after giving hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 shots, organizers said Monday. The All4Oregon site, which was set up by four of Portland’s major hospitals in a joint vaccination effort, has been running since Jan. 20 at the Oregon Convention Center. The site began offering self-scheduling and walk-in appointments for the first time last week, but organizers said a drop in volume made it clear that demand for a mass vaccination site is waning as shots become more widely available elsewhere. Many retail pharmacies now offer walk-in appointments, and health providers are shifting their focus to smaller neighborhood- and community-targeted vaccination efforts as supply begins to outstrip demand for the doses. All4Oregon will offer stop offering first doses of the two-dose Pfizer vaccine May 27 and will offer second doses only in June. It expects to close completely June 19. The clinic only offers Pfizer. As of Friday, the site had administered 465,000 shots. Oregon has now administered more than 3.3 million doses of the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines statewide, and nearly 2 million Oregonians have received at least one dose, according to the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As federal agencies stand poised to approve COVID-19 vaccines for children 12 to 15, a Montgomery County state legislator is planning to introduce a bill that would allow those 14 and older to consent to receiving federally recommended immunizations without parental approval. Democratic state Sen. Amanda Cappelletti said in a co-sponsorship memo circulated that the legislation would mirror the state’s mental health law that allows minors 14 and older to consent to inpatient mental health treatment. Cappelletti wrote that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended immunizations for children and adolescents that include “vaccines that have been proven to be safe, effective, and necessary to protect and promote public health” and that minors should be able to consent to receive them. According to the CDC, everyone 16 and over is now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Cappelletti offered statistics from the World Health Organization that showed vaccinations prevent 2 million to 3 million deaths annually, and 1.5 million more deaths could be prevented if vaccination numbers are improved.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The mental health and education of the state’s children suffered greatly last year during the coronavirus pandemic, and children of color were the hardest-hit, according to data released Monday by Kids Count, the national child advocacy nonprofit. “Unacceptable gaps continue to exist between children of color and white children in nearly every Factbook indicator,” Rhode Island Kids Count executive director Elizabeth Burke Bryant said. “These gaps have persisted because of systemic racism and barriers to opportunity that must be addressed and dismantled to ensure that every child can succeed. The COVID-19 pandemic shined a spotlight on stark economic, education, and other disparities and challenges to children’s success.” The number of calls to Kids Link RI, a 24-hour emergency mental health and behavioral referral network, was up 22% in 2020 from the previous year, the organization said. The number of children enrolled in kindergarten, considered a critical first step toward fluency in reading and writing, dropped 11% in 2020 from the previous year, similar to national trends as families kept their youngest home or waited for schools to open in person.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nPickens: Pickens County is planning to pay charities and civic groups $250 a mile for cleaning up litter. The county has set aside $75,000 in COVID-19 relief funding for the program, enough to clean up 300 miles, said County Councilman Roy Costner III. The program is designed to help struggling groups that have been unable to do their usual fundraising during the pandemic, Costner said. It would also be a way to use relief money aimed at helping communities, without having officials pick and choose which organizations get the relief, he said. The program aims to clean up at least 25% of the county’s roads while supporting local organizations and businesses, said Jamie Burns, a spokeswoman for the county. It’s a big step in a years­long effort to fight litter, said Chris Bowers, council chairman. Pick Up Pickens is believed to be the first program of its kind in the state, and using pandemic money for this could be a first in the nation, Burns said. Political groups and candidates aren’t eligible, before-and-after photos must show that the area was cleaned, and there would be a limit on how many miles each group handles. The plan is promising and could serve as a model for other counties in the state, said Sarah Lyles, executive director of Palmetto Pride, the state’s anti-litter organization.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two state agencies, the Department of Labor and Regulation and the Department of Tourism, are partnering together to help fill jobs in the tourism industry. Businesses are encouraged to post their job openings on SDWORKS, according to a news release. The database has more than 23,000 job openings. “The success of our tourism industry is a major factor in South Dakota’s economic health,” Gov. Kristi Noem said in the release. “South Dakota’s economic success has led to the lowest unemployment rate in America. While that is excellent news, we have more job openings than workers to fill them – especially in travel and tourism.” Noem initially announced the tourism workforce recruitment campaign at a press conference at Mount Rushmore on May 3 to kick off National Travel & Tourism Week. In 2020, a total of 49,500 jobs were supported by the tourism industry, representing 1 in 12 jobs in South Dakota, the release said. Those jobs include full-time, part-time and seasonal positions. South Dakota expects an increased amount of visitation to the state in 2021 due to a demand for travel and the state remaining open for business amid the pandemic, the release said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two major venues will soon lift capacity restrictions as the city continues to reopen from limitations implemented on businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. News outlets report that Nashville Soccer Club will open at near capacity for its May 23 match. Face coverings will still be encouraged but not required for outdoors. Meanwhile, Grand Ole Opry will begin weekly performances at full capacity Friday for the first time in more than a year. The indoor mask mandate will remain in place. That night’s show will include Opry members Lorrie Morgan and the Oak Ridge Boys. Earlier this year, Nashville officials announced that on May 14 the city would lift all COVID-19 restrictions, except for an indoor mask mandate. The city decided to ease the limits after the COVID-19 vaccine had been available to all adults for several weeks.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Republican Don Huffines, a former state senator from Dallas who has sharply criticized the state’s handling of the pandemic, said Monday that he will challenge Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022. Huffines is a wealthy businessman who has spent the past year rallying with conservative activists around Texas, including outside the governor’s mansion in October. Abbott, who did not have a serious primary challenger in his first two campaigns for governor, has faced pressure from within his party over COVID-19 closures and a statewide mask mandate. Huffines, who served one term in the Senate before losing his seat in 2018 to Democrat Nathan Johnson, did not mention Abbott in his announcement. “Plain and simple, our politicians aren’t getting things done, and Texans have rightfully run out of patience,” Huffines said. Abbott reported having nearly $38 million in his campaign account in January, and his prolific fundraising has been a major obstacle for previous challengers. A Democratic challenger to Abbott next year has yet to emerge, although former congressman Beto O’Rourke has not ruled out running. Actor Matthew McConaughey is also flirting with a run for governor.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state reported 2,340 new coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, down 9.3% from the previous week. Utah ranked 31st among the states where the virus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Across Utah, cases fell in five counties, with the best declines in Salt Lake, Utah and Tooele counties. Meanwhile, the state ranked 34th in the nation in share of people receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 40.9% of its residents at least partially inoculated. The national rate is 45.8%, a USA TODAY analysis of CDC data shows. In the week ending Sunday, Utah reported administering another 95,682 vaccine doses, including 37,389 first doses. In the previous week, the state administered 132,249 vaccine doses, including 56,176 first doses. In all, Utah reported it has administered 2,263,595 total doses. Within Utah, the worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in San Juan, Davis and Summit counties. Adding the most new cases overall were Salt Lake County, with 855 cases; Utah County, with 460 cases; and Davis County, with 296. Across the state, 20 people were reported dead of COVID-19 in the week ending Sunday. In the week before that, 22 people were reported dead.\n\nVermont\n\nVernon: The town is planning to hold its annual town meeting outdoors this year. Earlier this year the Vernon select board moved the community’s town meeting, which is usually held in March, to May 23 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The whole process will be new, but as far as what they’re voting on, should be pretty much the same,” said interim town administrator Wendy Harrison. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the meeting is scheduled for 2 p.m. on May 23 on the lawn outside the town hall. In addition to masking, participants will answer health-related questions upon checking in. Social distancing rules also will be applied. No food sales or table leafletting will be allowed. At the meeting, townspeople will decide a number of economic issues for the community.\n\nVirginia\n\nPetersburg: Petersburg Area Transit riders can expect free fares for at least the next year, officials say. The influx of federal funding from the coronavirus relief package passed in March 2020 and other federal dollars allow PAT to ensure free rides until the end of the 2021-22 fiscal year. “We’ve already balanced our budget without the revenue from free fares,” said Charles Koonce Jr., transit general manager for PAT. Free bus fares have been offered since March 2020. Ridership has decreased about 40% since the start of the pandemic, according to Koonce. Nearby localities have followed suit in providing free fares for riders in efforts to protect everyone on board. Greater Richmond Transit Company will operate under free fares until the end of the next fiscal year and hold a board meeting to see whether to continue the free fares the following year. Charlottesville promised its residents zero fares for the next three years. The Commonwealth Transportation Board allocated $3.5 million of the $456 million it received from the first pandemic relief package passed by Congress. A portion of the funds went into purchasing personal protective equipment for all employees and increasing custodial operations.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: More people in the state died of drug overdoses in 2020 than any other year in at least the last decade, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Health. The effects of the coronavirus pandemic likely led to a surge in drug use, the department said. The Seattle Times reports fatal drug overdoses increased more than 30% last year compared to 2019, according to the data, marking an increase more than twice as large as any other year in the past decade. Deadly opioid overdoses – from prescription painkillers, heroin, fentanyl and other similar substances – increased even faster, by nearly 40%, according to the data. That represented more than triple the rate of any other increase in the past decade. The Department of Health is still analyzing the preliminary data and causes of death in specific cases, and state health officials expect the number of overdose deaths to grow even higher. “It is reasonable to believe the psychological, social and economic impacts of COVID-19 led to an increase in drug use,” said Kristen Maki, a spokesperson for the state Department of Health. In 2020 the health department reported 1,649 drug overdose deaths, compared with 1,259 the previous year. Many more people reached out for help with drug or alcohol problems during 2020, according to state data.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nKanawha County: A clinic formed in 1973 to care for and serve families in the region’s mining communities has been working to vaccinate coal miners against COVID-19. Dr. Jessica McColley, head of medical services at Cabin Creek Health Systems, said she and her colleagues show up at the mines between shifts and catch workers coming and going, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. McColley called the working environment for coal miners “great for an airborne virus.” Underground miners often work in small, low-airflow areas with several other people for extended periods of time. Researchers are learning more about the coronavirus and its variant strains every day, but they agree the lungs are often the main organs affected. “That’s one of the most significant effects we’ve seen from COVID-19,” said Dr. Rayan Ihle, a critical care pulmonologist with Charleston Area Medical Center. Many coal miners already suffer from preexisting lung conditions, such as black lung disease or COPD, Ihle said. COVID-19 poses a serious health risk to miners, Ihle said, and the best protection is a vaccine. “Coal miners ... should really be on the forefront and standing in the front of the line to protect themselves,” Ihle said. “But vaccination not only helps that individual patient not contract (the virus); it protects others. It’s almost a civic duty.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nAppleton: The Fox Cities Exhibition Center vaccine clinic is partnering with three local breweries – Appleton Beer Factory, McFleshman’s and Stone Arch Brewpub – to launch a “Shot and a Beer” campaign to encourage people to get immunized against COVID-19. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the clinic will administer the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine. People who get their shot will also get a coupon for a free beer at one of the breweries. The coupon may not be redeemed until June, as it takes about 15 days after the J&J vaccine for people to build full immunity to the disease caused by the coronavirus. Those who are under 21 can redeem the coupon for a free root beer or other soda. Residents can make an appointment online at foxcitiescovidvaccine.com or walk in to the clinic without an appointment. The exhibition center clinic will close at the end of May.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state is reopening nine rest stops that were closed last year due to budget cuts, Gov. Mark Gordon said. The state plans to open the locations before the Memorial Day holiday weekend and keep them open at least through this year’s tourism season, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. “With the summer season just around the corner, I’m glad we will be able to reopen these facilities to travelers,” Gordon said in a statement Thursday. “We are glad to have this chance to find a temporary solution.” The rest stops were closed last June in the first budget cuts enacted amid declining revenues caused by the energy slowdown and the COVID-19 pandemic. The closures were expected to save the state more than $700,000. Gordon said he would work to get federal money to reopen the rest areas. The rest stops that are reopening are near Lusk, Guernsey, Greybull, Moorcroft, Star Valley, Sundance, Upton, Orin Junction and Chugwater. Wyoming has 37 rest stops.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/11"}]}

Like, yesterday.\n\nPerformers again electrified the Grammys stage with passion and poise. The jovial Batiste. Queer artists Lil Nas X, Brandi Carlile and T.J. Osborne, half of the Brothers Osborne. Spanish-language singers J. Balvin and Maria Becerra. K-Pop sensation BTS. The soulful, swoon-worthy John Legend, joined by Ukrainian performers in a gut-wrenching tribute to the country, now under attack by Russia.\n\nOur Grammys live blog:John Legend performs tribute to Ukraine, President Zelenskyy appears virtually\n\nViewers also glimpsed snippets of performances from lesser-known artists from the MGM Grand's rooftop across many genres, including Cuban singer Aymée Nuviola and contemporary worship group Maverick City Music.\n\nThis year's show even made an effort to recognize those who rarely receive any attention at all: behind-the-scenes tour staff introduced their bosses, including Billie Eilish, Chris Stapleton and H.E.R.\n\nEven E!'s red-carpet coverage joined in on the spirit of inclusion, with sign language interpreters occasionally accompanying artists during host Laverne Cox's interviews for the benefit of deaf or hard-of-hearing viewers.\n\nWhat if the Oscars tamped down its attempts at relevance – like cutting eight categories from the live show and replacing that time with cringeworthy gags – and instead elevated more behind-the-scenes support staff that help make movies happen?\n\nInstead of Amy Schumer jokingly calling Kirsten Dunst a seat filler, for example, why not recognize lower-profile Oscar nominees in the short film or makeup and hairstyling categories? And a film's assistant director could introduce a montage for best picture of the year.\n\nIn case you missed:Brutally honest reviews of every Grammys 2022 performance, including BTS and Billie Eilish\n\nOne reminder from this year's Grammys: It's not just the biggest categories that make for the most compelling acceptance speeches.\n\nTake Jazmine Sullivan's for best R&B album. She says she wrote the project to deal with her own shame over choices she made in her 20s. But \"Heaux Tales\" blossomed into \"a safe space for Black women to tell their stories, for us to learn from each other, laugh with each other, and not be exploited at the same time,\" she said. \"And that's what I'm most grateful for. So shout-out to all Black women who are just living their lives.\" (Sullivan finally won her first two Grammys this year after receiving more than a dozen nominations since 2009.)\n\nOf course, the Grammys remain imperfect. Music's biggest night has been far from immune to controversies – particularly when it comes to diversity and inclusion in its nominees and winners.\n\nImportant:Marilyn Manson, Louis C.K. both won Grammys. Is this cancel culture?\n\nThe past few years have brought the #GrammysSoMale hashtag, protesting the scarcity of female winners, and in response, former Recording Academy president Neil Portnow suggesting that women need to \"step up\" to be recognized; artists lamenting the awards' treatment of Black music; and K-Pop groups failing to make significant headway in major categories.\n\nThe academy has made sweeping efforts to diversify its ranks, developing a task force months after its January 2018 ceremony celebrated mostly men and pop music.\n\nSee all the Grammys winners:Which stars have already won tonight\n\nIt made headway last year by awarding Grammys to Beyoncé, Megan Thee Stallion and H.E.R., and it featured performances from artists like Mickey Guyton, Bad Bunny and Cardi B.\n\nThe organization has also worked to diversify membership, created inclusive initiatives and eliminated its controversial nomination review committees – panels that chose nominees from a list of those who received the most votes. Nominees are now based purely on votes cast by the academy’s more than 11,000 voting members.\n\nQuestions have loomed for years around the nominations process as music industry players called for more transparency.\n\nAnd the academy's goal is to double the number of female members by 2025, and it is more than halfway there.\n\nThe awards show has also built more inclusion into its broadcast behind the scenes: The Grammys announced last fall that it had adopted an inclusion rider for the 2022 ceremony, an agreement requiring producers to audition, interview and hire people from groups that have been historically and systematically excluded from the industry. CBS also included audio description for the live telecast for the first time.\n\n\"From a 'front of camera' perspective, the Grammys appear to have been quite diverse and inclusive – from race to gender and other elements of diversity, song selections and artist performances,\" says Angela Reddock-Wright, an employment lawyer and mediator who works with the entertainment industry. \"The real question is what is happening behind the scenes and whether the Grammy organization is honoring its commitment to require an inclusion rider for the 2022 Grammys.\" She notes the success of this rider has not been made public.\n\nStill, \"it appears the organization, like the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, has made great strides,\" she says.\n\nOverall the Grammys bested the Oscars this year in terms of inclusion, beyond just winners. But every awards show should sing the Grammys' tune.\n\nContributing: Melissa Ruggieri, USA TODAY, and The Associated Press\n\n'We welcome the feedback':Recording Academy exec teases Grammy night, talks Drake controversy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/02/15/maren-morris-rissi-palmer-talk-racism-country-music/6750461002/", "title": "Maren Morris, Rissi Palmer talk racism in country music", "text": "The country music industry is ripe for change when it comes to diversity and inclusion – and it's been a long time coming.\n\nRissi Palmer hosted a special virtual roundtable episode of her radio show \"Color Me Country\" on Sunday with country singers Maren Morris and Cam as well as author Andrea Williams. The episode, which aired on Apple Music Country, touched on country music's issues with race and gender, as well as how to diversify the industry moving forward.\n\nMorris reflected during the roundtable on her tribute to Black women in country music at the CMA Awards last November. \"I certainly was not trying to be performative at all,\" she said. \"I genuinely was thinking about the people that kind of kicked the door in for me and gave my name a platform like that, some recognition ...

I hope you know that we see you.\"\n\nThe group talked during the radio show about the roadblocks still in the way for progress – Palmer said the industry curbs the voices of artists whenever they want.\n\n\"I think that in this business we're a dime a dozen,\" Palmer said. \"And if you're too much trouble, or if you cost too much, or if you're not making them enough money, it all has to do with the bottom line and if you're not meeting that, I think that you're disposable.\"\n\nWilliams, for her part, pointed out Nashville's liberal white hypocrisy. \"Since what happened at the Capitol, (there are) so many people in this Nashville space that are doing all of this stuff, that are calling out the Confederate flags that were traipsed through the Capitol building, that have been to billions of shows with Confederate flags, that don't care that Black people can't work in this town,\" she said.\n\nCMA Awards 2020:Maren Morris dedicates win to 'amazing Black women' who pioneered country music\n\nThe special comes on the heels of the Morgan Wallen racism scandal, which shook the country music world – and the country. A recent video surfaced of the singer using a racist slur. In the video, he told a friend, \"take care of this (expletive) N-word,\" referring to another person he was with.\n\n\"I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back,\" Wallen said in a statement after the video was posted by TMZ. \"There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologize for using the word. I promise to do better.\" He has since released a more detailed apology, met with Black organizations and asked followers to stop defending him.\n\nHow did we get here? Morgan Wallen used a racist slur but his popularity is skyrocketing\n\nCam discussed how to tackle diversity in the industry. \"We can't play this game anymore of pretending everything's fine,\" she said. \"Even if you're trying, you have to be okay being uncomfortable.\"\n\nMorris added: \"I feel like we all should be uncomfortable. The nature of it is change, is being uncomfortable. It's breaking out of something that has worked for very few for far too long, and for the many stopped so short.\"\n\nShe said \"the best way to validate someone is to pay them.\"\n\n\"Everything going from writing songs in the room with someone, production, instrumentation, your crew people that you bring out on the road, I feel like there are so many,\" Morris said. \"So it's just such an insular bubble that we have to burst, and I am absolutely aware of it.

But nothing comes close to the rise in egg prices.\n\nIn the year through November, not adjusted for seasonal swings, egg prices jumped 49%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSince early this year, a deadly avian flu has been reducing poultry flocks — specifically turkeys and egg-laying hens. That’s one reason for the unrelenting increase in prices. But the situation has been exacerbated by elevated feed and energy costs for producers, in addition to high demand in the supermarket.\n\nExperts think that the peak has passed, but until these conditions improve, expect to pay more for eggs in the grocery store.\n\nWholesale prices hit a record\n\nAvian flu has been a problem in the US for several months now, but in recent weeks wholesale prices have been hitting records.\n\nAs of last week, “prices have been escalating for nine consecutive weeks… setting new record highs on a daily basis since the week of Thanksgiving,” said Karyn Rispoli, editor of the Egg Price Current for Urner Barry, which offers food market data.\n\nOn Friday, Midwest large eggs, the benchmark for eggs sold in their shells, hit $5.46 per dozen, Rispoli said, citing Urner Barry’s data. This time last year, Urner Berry’s data shows, that price was around $1.70.\n\nEggs have gotten much more expensive this year. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nOne reason for the increase? Not enough supply.\n\n“There’s simply not been enough production to support the incredibly strong retail demand we’ve seen this year,” Rispoli said. Supply has been constrained by the deadly bird flu.\n\nThe current outbreak of Highly-Pathogenic Avian Influenza started in the US around February, and has persisted throughout the year. The last major bird flu outbreak in the United States was in 2015. But that one was contained by June of that year, noted Brian Earnest, lead economist for animal protein in CoBank.\n\n“This year, we’ve continued to see flock depopulations throughout the entire year, and there’s an expectation that we’ll continue to see it into 2023,” he said, noting that he expects “we’re going to see a tight supply situation and elevated pricing environment moving forward.”\n\nAbout 60 million birds are gone because of the disease so far, according to the USDA. Of those, about 43 million are egg-laying hens, according to USDA data provided by the American Egg Board, a farmer-funded group which markets eggs.\n\nStill, farmers have been able to moderate the losses. “Our producers learned a lot of hard lessons from 2015,” said Emily Metz, CEO of the American Egg Board. Some farmers have been able to repopulate their flocks, decreasing the net impact on flock sizes and egg supplies. As of early December, there were about 308 million hens laying eggs for consumption, down from about 328 million in December 2021, according to the USDA.\n\nThe supply squeeze isn’t the only thing contributing to higher egg prices, said Metz. Higher fuel, feed and other producer cost are also driving up wholesale prices, she said. And then there’s that high demand for eggs, which spikes this time of year.\n\nEgg demand remains high\n\nPeople buy more eggs around the holidays, when they’re baking and cooking more, and eating breakfast at home more often.\n\nWholesale prices tend to go up in the winter because of those habits, noted Earnest. That has “brought about a very strong market condition.”\n\nYear-round demand for eggs has also also been strong.\n\nEven while prices have soared, sales of eggs have only ticked down about 2% by unit in retail in the year through December 4th, according to data from IRI, a market research firm.\n\nShoppers have been accepting high prices at the grocery store as they pull back on restaurant visits. And even though eggs have gotten more expensive, they still cost less than other proteins.\n\nA deadly avian flu has led to the death of millions of poultry this year. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nAs that peak holiday demand passes, wholesale prices are expected to fall.\n\n“Based on current trade values and market conditions, it appears that the market may have finally reached its peak,” said Rispoli. Friday’s wholesale prices were the same as Thursday’s, the first time pricing held steady since October, she said.\n\n“Several suppliers have reported to us… that they are seeing their orders slow,” in the week leading up to Christmas, she added. By then, “most grocers have pulled in whatever inventory they’ll need for the holidays.”\n\nIt might take another three to six months for prices to moderate in retail, said KK Davey, president of thought leadership at IRI and NPD, and even longer for prices to come down to what they were last year.\n\n“It may take some more time,” he said.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/business-food/grocery-store-prices-food/index.html", "title": "Grocery store prices aren't coming down anytime soon | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSome sobering news for US shoppers: There’s little relief in sight on grocery store bills.\n\nGrocery prices climbed 13.5% in August from the year before, the highest annual increase since March 1979, according to government data.\n\nExecutives at large food manufacturers and analysts expect inflation to hover around this level for the rest of 2022.\n\nNext year, the rate of food inflation is expected to moderate — but that doesn’t mean prices are going to drop. Once prices hit a certain level, they tend to stay there or go up, but rarely down.\n\nA number of factors have contributed to the surge in prices. Producers say they’re paying higher prices for labor and packaging materials. Extreme weather, like drought or flooding, and disease, like the deadly avian flu, have been hurting crops and killing egg-laying hens, squeezing supplies.\n\nEven if some of these situations stabilize, it will take a while for those changes to reach consumers.\n\n“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” said David Ortega, food economist and associate professor at Michigan State University. It’s not clear when the war in Ukraine will end, or how weather will impact crops in the future. “That’s one of the reasons why prices take longer to come down.”\n\nProducers aren’t “seeing any end to inflation in terms of their labor and commodities cost,” said KK Davey, the president of client engagement at market research company IRI. The firm expects food inflation to rise between 5% and 10% next year.\n\nMeanwhile, demand is high. Consumers may be able to pull back on some discretionary items, but they have to eat. And paying higher grocery prices may still be cheaper than dining out at restaurants, where menu prices are also rising (though at a slower clip). And many people are still working from home and consuming more of their meals there.\n\nThis imbalance means companies can pass along higher prices to shoppers without sales plunging.\n\n“The cycle will break when supply is high and demand moderates,” said Davey.\n\nCompanies continue to raise prices\n\n“We do expect the near-term inflation to remain high,” Mondelez (MDLZ) CEO Dirk Van de Put said on an earnings call this summer. The maker of Oreo and Ritz said that its energy, transportation, packaging and raw materials costs remain elevated, and it announced further price increases to offset those increases.\n\nGeneral Mills (GIS), which makes everything from Cheerios to Blue Buffalo pet food, expects that its costs will increase by 14% to 15% for its 2023 fiscal year, led by a rise in prices of ingredients such as nuts, fruits and flavors. The company is planning additional price hikes for its retail customers.\n\nFor now, consumers haven’t balked at the higher prices, noted CEO Jeff Harmening during a September earnings call.\n\nCereal maker General Mills is predicting higher cost inflation next year. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\n“So far, we haven’t seen really any change in elasticities, which for us was a positive in the quarter,” he said. Elasticity refers to how easily customers change their shopping behavior in response to higher prices. Consumers accepted the higher prices more than General Mills would have expected, Harmening noted.\n\nBetween costs continuing to rise and people continuing to buy, there’s little reason for companies to discount their products.\n\n“We think the risk of promotions ramping up significantly over the next couple of quarters is quite low,” Harmening said during the call.\n\nFor manufacturers to increase promotions, supply chain disruptions would have to end and costs would have to fall significantly, he said. “We don’t see any of those things.”\n\nWhy grocery prices are so sticky\n\nIn general, prices tend to go up over time. Government data shows that from 1974 to 2021, grocery prices dropped only during two years. Every other year, they went up, though some years the increase was very slight.\n\n“There’s always a general increase in prices overall,” said Ortega, the food economist. “That’s just the nature of the economy.”\n\nTypically, however, grocery prices go up about 2% or 3% a year, he said — far slower a pace than the increase happening now.\n\nIn the past, consumers may not have noticed higher prices because their wages kept pace with the increases. Right now, that’s not the case.\n\n“Consumer prices are increasing faster than wages are increasing,” he said. “What we’re seeing now is really a cost of living crisis.”\n\nGrocery prices in particular are sticky also because of how much of a hassle it is to change them.\n\nWhen food manufacturers raise prices for retailers, those retailers don’t necessarily pass prices along to consumers. Some may opt to keep prices low — if they can afford it — to attract customers into the store.\n\nRetailers also don’t like to raise prices little by little because it frustrates consumers, said Andy Harig, vice president of tax, trade, sustainability and policy development at FMI, a food industry association.\n\n“A lot of people shop every week … and there’s lots of consistency in what they buy,” he said. So when prices change, even slightly, “they really notice that, and feel those changes.”\n\nWhen retailers do switch prices in stores, they have to print out new labels and enter the new values into their sales systems. Stores carry tens of thousands of different items, so when prices go up across different categories, making adjustments becomes a ton of work.\n\nThat means that “when you do see increases happen, they tend to stay in place,” Harig said.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner Nathaniel Meyersohn", "Danielle Wiener-Bronner", "Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/business/grocery-prices/index.html", "title": "Food prices are skyrocketing, and it's not just because of inflation ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nInflation may be slowing overall, but food prices are still sky-high.\n\nOver the last 12 months, grocery prices soared 13.1% — the largest annual increase since the year ending in March 1979, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday.\n\nThe prices of nearly every grocery item have ballooned over the past year.\n\nThe cost of eggs has soared 38%, and prices for other goods have also jumped: Flour is up 22.7%, chicken 17.6%, milk 15.6%, ground beef 9.7% and bacon 9.2%. Fruits and vegetables got 9.3% more expensive.\n\nGrocery items are still going up. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nA number of factors have contributed to the rise in food costs: A deadly avian flu has meant fewer eggs in the United States, a severe drought in Brazil slashed coffee crops and the war in Ukraine led to a spike in wheat prices in the spring.\n\nWhile commodity prices are falling, it will take time before those lower costs pass through to consumers. Plus, plenty of other costs for producers — such as fuel, labor and packaging — have also been high.\n\nAnd as supply has been disrupted, demand has grown.\n\nDemand for groceries grows\n\nUnlike discretionary items, consumers can’t simply stop buying food when prices rise. They may, however, opt for less expensive options. Producers, grocers and restaurant operators have noted that consumers are indeed trading down — swapping out higher-priced items for more affordable ones.\n\nEarlier this week, Tyson (TSN) said demand for steak is falling while interest in chicken is rising. Wendy’s (WEN) traffic has been hit because some customers are deciding to pack lunches or eat breakfast at home, CEO Todd Penegor said during a post-earnings analyst call Wednesday.\n\nPenegor added that about 82% of meals were eaten at home pre-pandemic, but that figure jumped three percentage points since then and has stayed there.\n\n“The consumer has been a little more strapped, so there’s a few more meals prepared at home,” Penegor said. “Inflation has been high, so net disposable income has been a little bit pinched.”\n\nRestaurants have also been raising prices, but at a slower clip: In the 12-month period through July, menu prices rose 7.6%, less than overall inflation.\n\nPlus, food prices are largely unaffected by current government efforts to curtail spiraling costs.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged as much during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in June, saying that raising interest rates to fight inflation wouldn’t lower food prices.\n\nThe Fed believes that “food and energy are influenced by global commodity prices in a way that tells them, ‘Hey, these items aren’t really directly under your control,’” noted Michael Gapen, head of US economics at Bank of America Global Research.\n\nEssentially, the thinking is this: Because the US can’t control international factors such as the war in Ukraine and higher shipping costs, it can’t fully control domestic food prices.\n\nWhat’s more, the US government doesn’t have a stockpile of food as it does of oil, noted Rob Fox, director of the knowledge exchange division at CoBank, which provides financial services to agribusinesses.\n\n“There’s no ability for the government to release extra stalks of wheat and corn and cheese and so on,” Fox said.\n\nWhat got more expensive in June\n\nThe result has been steadily higher prices in the grocery aisle, with some items seeing larger month over month spikes than others.\n\nIn July, adjusted for seasonal swings, egg prices popped 4.3% compared to June. Coffee and peanut butter each got 3.5% more expensive. Flour rose 3.2% and bread prices went up 2.8%. Cheese jumped 2%, while chicken got 1.4% pricier.\n\nThere was some relief, however. Citrus fell 3.2%, and whole milk dropped 1.4%. Uncooked beef roasts fell 1.3%, and uncooked steaks fell 1.1%. Ham got 1% cheaper.\n\nThe biggest decline was in hot dog prices, which dropped 6.1%.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/economy/us-inflation-consumer-behavior/index.html", "title": "When will people get fed up with high prices? | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAmericans have watched prices for everything from diapers to gas go up over the past year. So far, they have kept reaching for their wallets. But what happens when they reach their breaking point?\n\nThe pandemic and the supply chain crisis have pushed the cost of virtually everything higher. Food and cars are more expensive, as are transport and labor costs, making inflation the buzzword of the moment.\n\nIn February, consumer prices increased at a level not seen since the start of 1982. And odds are it won’t stop there.\n\n“A month ago, we were generally looking at inflation that was primarily in areas that you were spending more on because of the pandemic,” such as cars, housing and home renovations, said Frances Donald, global chief economist and strategist at Manulife Investment Management. “These were more optional types of inflation.”\n\nAfter a year of soaring costs, the Ukraine-Russia conflict is pushing prices for more essential categories, like food and energy, up even more.\n\nThe price hikes Americans are likely to experience in the coming months will be much harder to get around, Donald said.\n\n“We don’t see a lot of what economists call elasticity when it comes to demand for fuel and food. We don’t have a choice. You can’t not eat. You can’t not drive to work,” she said.\n\nGas and food prices on the rise\n\nThe cost of cooking dinner and fueling the car have already shot up over the past year. Gasoline prices rose 38% in the 12 months ended February, while prices for meats, poultry, fish and eggs jumped 13% over the same period, according to Labor Department data.\n\nNow gas prices are rising even further and people are struggling to keep up.\n\n“I try to catch the weekend sales and freeze meat,” Kathy LeGoux, who lives in Palm Coast, Florida, with her husband, told CNN Business. “[I] can’t buy a lot of fish because it’s too expensive now.”\n\nLeGoux, who is in her 60s, is retired, as is her husband. A high cost of living made them move from Nevada to Florida before the pandemic. But the high prices have followed them, she said.\n\nRetirees and others who live on fixed incomes get hit especially hard when prices go up like they have recently.\n\nLeGoux and her husband have postponed home improvement projects and no longer go on road trips, due to the cost of fuel.\n\n“And the gas price rolls into food prices,” she said. “We’re not even talking about inflation any more here. It’s more.”\n\nSoaring food prices are a difficult problem to solve, according to Donald, especially when it’s really a problem of global supply. Russia and Ukraine are huge exporters of grain and fertilizer. With trade hamstrung by the conflict, the global food supply chain has already started to feel the pain.\n\n“The greatest risk facing global supply chains has shifted from the pandemic to the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and the geopolitical and economic uncertainties it has created,” Moody’s Analytics economist Tim Uy wrote in a report Thursday.\n\nFor governments and central banks around the world, this is a new challenge for which typical policy changes that were used to fight inflation in the past might not prove as useful. The Federal Reserve’s plan to raise interest rates and combat pandemic inflation, for example, will do little to change the dynamics of the global food supply. That also means it won’t help the financial pain many Americans will feel as prices keep going up.\n\nConsumers’ breaking point\n\nThere is some good news: American households are better funded than in previous crises, which should help them absorb some of the price increases. During the pandemic, stimulus checks and altered spending patterns helped many households shore up their savings.\n\nBut the more price spikes affect necessary products and services, people will need to reach deeper into their wallets, putting a strain on household finances. This will be particularly hard for lower-income Americans, who don’t have excess savings as a result of the pandemic and for whom gas and energy costs generally make up a larger portion of their spending.\n\n“A 10% increase in oil prices would shave 0.2% from discretionary spending,” assuming a one-for-one response from consumers, said Jefferies chief economist Aneta Markowska.\n\nSince the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, US oil prices have risen more than 11%.\n\nThat matters because consumer spending is the single most important driver of US economic growth. If people have less money to spend outside of necessities, that could weigh on economic growth this year.\n\nEven though the pandemic recession is firmly in the rearview mirror by now, economists are growing concerned the US could be heading toward a period of stagflation, during which low economic growth and high prices limit consumer spending.\n\nIn short, the inflation situation is a headache for lawmakers and the American people alike.\n\nMeanwhile, questions are arising about the record profits companies have been reeling in during this time of high prices. Last week, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the matter, showing some lawmakers are clearly concerned about corporate profiteering at the expense of working people who are seeing their hard earned money afford less and less.\n\nSo far surging prices haven’t driven customers away from their favorite stores, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in the future.\n\nCoca-Cola (COKE) CEO James Quincey said in February that consumers will only accept higher prices for so long. And rising gas prices could push people to their breaking point – if they’re not already there. When household finances become strained, nonessential items and big-name brands with a cheaper alternative are the first to go.\n\n“It’s easier to do pricing in a stimulus environment where everyone else is going up,” he said at the time. “It’s much harder when there’s a real squeeze on income.”", "authors": ["Anneken Tappe"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/11/economy/grocery-prices/index.html", "title": "Here's what's getting more expensive at the grocery store | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nInflation may be slowing just a bit, but food prices are on fire.\n\nFood prices were 9.4% higher in April 2022 than in April 2021 – the largest annual increase in 41 years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday. Grocery prices jumped 10.8% for the year. (The prices do not reflect seasonal swings.)\n\nA number of factors have squeezed food prices recently, ranging from bad weather to the war in Ukraine. Weather has lowered crop yields and Russia’s invasion has increased wheat and other prices.\n\nIndividual items, too, are facing unique challenges. Avocado prices soared after the US briefly suspended imports in February from Mexico’s western state of Michoacan. A few months later, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott required “enhanced safety inspections” of commercial vehicles entering Texas for a week, slowing down deliveries from across the border.\n\nAnd, notably, a deadly and highly infectious avian flu has forced US farmers to kill millions of egg-laying hens, reducing the country’s egg supply and driving up prices. The damage to the egg industry hit consumers hard in April, when egg prices soared 10.3%, adjusted for seasonal changes. Without those adjustments, egg prices spiked 22.6% over the 12 months ending in April.\n\nAnd those aren’t the only items that saw big increases this year.\n\nMeat and dairy products got much pricier.

David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty images\n\nWhen it comes to food, a number of far-flung factors are disrupting supply.\n\nExtreme heat and drought and a deadly avian flu are hurting some crops, as well as squeezing the supply of turkeys and egg-laying hens. Volatility in the grain market caused by the war in Ukraine as well as high energy prices, which impact fertilizer and transportation costs, are also raising food prices.\n\n“Those things are still problematic,” said Tom Bailey, senior analyst of consumer foods with Rabobank.\n\nIssues like these have led to soaring prices throughout the grocery store.\n\nWhat’s getting more expensive, and what’s getting cheaper\n\nIn the year through October, eggs got a whopping 43% more expensive.

Well, yes, but you have to look carefully.\n\nWhile 90% of grocery items right now cost more than they did last year because of high inflation, there are some deals to be had, though you may have to hunt them down. Market research firm Nielsen IQ recently looked at more than 2,500 fresh and packaged foods to find bargains.\n\nFor most consumers, price breaks on their groceries come as welcome relief given that store food prices overall have surged 12.4% through October versus a year ago. For shoppers on fixed budgets, the extra cost of food is especially hard to absorb.\n\nSo, what’s getting cheaper?\n\nIn fresh produce, the average unit price for prepared mixed vegetables from July to September (the latest data available) dropped 68% versus the same period last year. In fruits, the average unit price is down 1.8% for tangerines and has declined 7% for dates in the same three-month period.\n\nSome packaged baked goods such as assorted bagels fell 48%. Bakery sweet goods, such as fruit cobbler and honey buns, are also seeing declining prices.\n\nElsewhere, bulk dried beans prices are 5.1% cheaper. Prices for cranberry and apple sauce have also eased. In beverages, kombucha drinks have dropped 22.7%.\n\nA lot of fresh seafood options are cheaper as well: the average unit price for striped bass fell 41.8% (July through September) over the prior year. The cost of lobster is down 7.2%, mackerel dropped 6% while crab prices fell 9.5% and conch is down 13.2%.\n\nStew Leonard Jr., CEO of the Stew Leonard’s supermarket chain, told CNN’s Alison Kosik on Wednesday that he’s noticed prices are easing on some meats, including chicken and beef.\n\n“You’re are seeing a little bit of an increase in turkey [prices] but you are also seeing a little bit of reduction in chicken. Our filet mignon is going to be $2 a pound less than it was last year,” he said.\n\n“Meat prices seem to be easing, chicken prices easing. Lobster, which was off the charts last year, has come down to half the price. You’re starting to see a little bit of a heartbeat out there in pricing,” he said.\n\nOverall, spending on groceries will increase as more families cut back on eating out and cook more at home to curb their discretionary spending, said Carman Allison, vice president of consumer insights for NielsenIQ, which tracks point-of-sale data from retailers\n\nEven so, there’s a bigger reset going on: budget shoppers are fundamentally changing how and where they buy food, Allison said. “They are shifting from brand names to private label alternatives that cost less. They are also shifting to value and discount food shopping to score better deals.”\n\nAnd most consumers are not buying in bulk. “If a family is a heavy user of an item, they will buy larger sizes,” he said. “But if it’s a smaller household or they want to experiment with some foods, they are opting for smaller sizes.”\n\nAs shoppers try to control their spending on groceries, they will likely gravitate to what Allison called “higher yield,” options like dried beans, rice and pasta. “These items can produce many servings. A can of soup is another example. You can add more water and have more servings,” he said.", "authors": ["Parija Kavilanz"], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/09/business/self-checkout-retail/index.html", "title": "Nobody likes self-checkout.

Errors at the kiosks are so common that they have even spawned dozens of memes and TikTok videos.\n\n“We’re in 2022. One would expect the self-checkout experience to be flawless. We’re not there at all,” said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who has researched self-checkout.\n\nCustomers aren’t the only ones frustrated with the self-checkout experience. Stores have challenges with it, too.\n\nSelf-checkout is everywhere, despite its issues. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe machines are expensive to install, often break down and can lead to customers purchasing fewer items. Stores also incur higher losses and more shoplifting at self-checkouts than at traditional checkout lanes with human cashiers.\n\nDespite the headaches, self-checkout is growing.\n\nIn 2020, 29% of transactions at food retailers were processed through self-checkout, up from 23% the year prior, according to the latest data from food industry association FMI.\n\nThis raises the question: why is this often problematic, unloved technology taking over retail?\n\nMaking customers do the work\n\nThe introduction of self-checkout machines in 1986 was part of a long history of stores transferring work from paid employees to unpaid customers, a practice that dates all the way back to Piggly Wiggly — the first self-service supermarket — in the early 1900s.\n\nInstead of clerks behind a counter gathering products for customers, Piggly Wiggly allowed shoppers to roam the aisles, pick items off the shelves and pay at the register. In exchange for doing more work, the model promised lower prices.\n\nShoppers at Piggly Wiggly, the first self-service supermarket, in 1918. Library of Congress/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nSelf-checkout, however, was designed primarily to lower stores’ labor expenses. The system reduced cashier costs by as much as 66%, according to a 1988 article in the Miami Herald.\n\nThe first modern self-checkout system, which was patented by Florida company CheckRobot and installed at several Kroger stores, would be almost unrecognizable to shoppers today.\n\nCustomers scanned their items and put them on a conveyor belt. An employee at the other end of the belt bagged the groceries. Customers then took them to a central cashier area to pay.\n\nThe technology was heralded as a “revolution in the supermarket.” Shoppers “turn into their own grocery clerks as automated checkout machines shorten those long lines of carts and reduce markets’ personnel costs,” the Los Angeles Times said in 1987 review.\n\nBut self-checkout did not revolutionize the grocery store. Many customers balked at having to do more work in exchange for benefits that weren’t entirely clear.\n\nIt took a decade for Walmart (WMT) to test self checkout. Only in the early 2000s did the trend pick up more widely at supermarkets, which were looking to cut costs during the 2001 recession and faced stiff competition from emergent superstores and warehouse clubs.\n\nWalmart first tested self-checkout in the late 1990s. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“The rationale was economics based, and not focused on the customer,” Charlebois said. “From the get go, customers detested them.”\n\nA 2003 Nielsen survey found that 52% of shoppers considered self checkout lanes to be “okay,” while 16% said they were “frustrating.” Thirty-two percent of shoppers called them “great.”\n\nThe mixed response led some grocery chains, including Costco (COST), Albertsons and others, to pull out the self-checkout machines they had installed in the mid-2000s.\n\n“Self-checkout lines get clogged as the customers needed to wait for store staff to assist with problems with bar codes, coupons, payment problems and other issues that invariably arise with many transactions,” grocery chain Big Y said in 2011 when it removed its machines.\n\nWalkaways\n\nThe move to self-checkout has created unintended consequences for stores as well.\n\nRetailers found that self-checkout stations were not autonomous and required regular maintenance and supervision, said Christopher Andrews, a sociologist at Drew University and author of “The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.”\n\nStores have challenges with self-checkout, including higher levels of theft. John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough self-checkout counters eliminated some of the tasks of traditional cashiers, they still needed to be staffed and created a need for higher wage IT jobs, he said.\n\nSelf-checkout, Andrews added, “delivers none of what it promises.”\n\nIn the biggest headache for store owners, self-checkout leads to more losses due to error or theft than traditional cashiers.\n\n“If you had a retail store where 50% of transactions were through self checkout, losses would be 77% higher” than average, according to Adrian Beck, an emeritus professor at the University of Leicester in the UK who studies retail losses.\n\nCustomers make honest errors as well as intentionally steal at self-checkout machines.\n\nSome products have multiple barcodes or barcodes that don’t scan properly. Produce, including fruit and meat, typically needs to be weighed and manually entered into the system using a code. Customers may type in the wrong code by accident. Other times shoppers won’t hear the “beep” confirming an item has been scanned properly.\n\n“Consumers are not very good at scanning reliably,” Beck said. “Why should they be? They’re not trained.”\n\nOther customers take advantage of the lax oversight at self checkout aisles and have developed techniques for stealing. Common tactics include not scanning an item, swapping a cheaper item (bananas) for a more expensive one (steak), scanning counterfeit barcodes attached to their wrists or properly scanning everything and then walking out without paying.\n\nStores have tried to limit losses by tightening self-checkout security features, such as adding weight sensors. But additional anti-theft measures also lead to more frustrating “unexpected item in the bagging area” errors, requiring store employees to intervene.\n\n“There’s a delicate balance between security and customer convenience,” Beck said.\n\nSelf-checkout is here to stay\n\nDespite self-checkout’s many shortcomings for customers and store owners, the trend is only growing.\n\nWalmart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and Dollar General (DG) are piloting exclusively self-checkout stores. Costco and Albertsons have brought self-checkout back after removing it years ago. Amazon (AMZN) has taken the concept a step further with cashier-less Amazon (AMZN) Go stores.\n\nIt may simply be too late for stores to turn their back on self-checkout.\n\nAmazon has developed cashier-less Go stores. Other retailers are trying to jump in on the trend. Chona Kasinger/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nStores today are catering to shoppers who perceive self-checkout to be faster than traditional cashiers, even though there’s little evidence to support that. But, because customers are doing the work, rather than waiting in line, the experience can feel like it’s moving more quickly.\n\nStore owners have also seen competitors installing self-checkout and determined they don’t want to miss out.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This AI technology lets you skip the checkout line 02:22 - Source: CNN Business\n\n“It’s an arms race. If everyone else is doing it, you look like an idiot if you don’t have it,” said David D’Arezzo, a former executive at Dollar General, Wegmans and other retailers. “Once you let it out of the bag, it’s pretty difficult not to offer it anymore.”\n\nCovid-19 has also hastened the spread of self-checkout.\n\nDuring the pandemic, many customers opted for self-service to avoid close interactions with cashiers and baggers.

Recently, they’ve been relying mostly on one income. Their reduced earnings, coupled with inflation, have dealt a blow to their finances.\n\nAnd that has changed, radically, the way they eat. Altman is not alone in making big changes.\n\nWe asked CNN readers how inflation has impacted their eating habits, and many mentioned dining out less often, buying less meat and giving up splurges. Some said they are very worried about the future.\n\nFood prices have spiked 11.4% over the past year, the largest annual increase since May 1979, according to data released in mid-September by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Grocery prices jumped 13.5% and restaurant menu prices increased 8% in that period.\n\nWith food prices soaring, people are changing how they shop and eat. Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nConsumers are responding by looking for deals and switching to generic brands, according to July data from the market research firm IRI. Companies like Tyson (TSN) have noticed customers are switching from beef to chicken, and Applebee’s and IHOP have reported an uptick in higher-income customers who are likely trading down from pricier restaurants. Some people may be dining out less often, or avoiding restaurants altogether.\n\nFor those who struggled to buy food even before prices shot up, rising costs could mean falling into food insecurity, a state of unreliable access to affordable food.\n\n“If food prices continue to increase at a rate that outpaces increases in wages, that is the inevitable consequence,” said Jayson Lusk, head of the agricultural economics department at Purdue University. “The last time we had a big run up in food insecurity rates was in the wake of the Great Recession.” Last year, about 10.2% of US households were food insecure, according to the USDA, slightly below the 10.5% rate in 2020 and 2019.\n\nEven for those not at risk of hunger, the surges in food prices are jarring.\n\nFood “matters a lot to our self esteem, our mood,” said William Masters, a professor at Tufts University’ school of nutrition science and policy who is also a member of the economics department faculty. “Not being able to buy the foods that people are used to — that your children are asking for, that your family wants — that’s a really hard thing,” he said. “Any disruption of habit is very, very hard.”\n\nGiving up on simple pleasures\n\nCarol Ehrman taking a Thai cooking class over Zoom during the pandemic. Courtesy Carol and Tommy Ehrman\n\nFor Carol Ehrman, cooking is a joyful experience.\n\n“I love to cook, it’s my favorite thing to do,” she said. She especially likes to cook Indian and Thai food, but stocking the spices and ingredients she needs for those dishes is no longer feasible. “When every ingredient has gone up, that adds up on the total bill,” she said.\n\n“What used to cost us $250 to $300 … is now $400.” Ehrman, 60, and her husband, 65, rely on his social security income, and the increase was stretching their budget. “We just couldn’t do that.”\n\nAbout six months ago, she realized she had to change the way she shops for groceries.\n\nIn an effort to bring their immediate costs down, Ehrman stopped shopping in bulk as often as she used to. Now, she hunts for sales, avoids buying beef, and opts for boxed wine instead of nice bottles when she buys wine at all. She’s also cooking simpler meals, and saying goodbye to dinner parties.\n\nEhrman haș even given up preparing basic items, like tomato sauce, because of the expense, opting instead for a pre-packaged version.\n\n“I know that I can make it much healthier,” she said. And “it always tastes so much better.” Those fresh ingredients are just too pricey now.\n\nEhrman’s husband is retired due to chronic health problems, and it’s been difficult for her to work because of her own health issues — she recently had pacemaker and heart catheterization procedures. The couple, who live in Billings, Montana, were frugal before the current spike in prices, enjoying simple pleasures. But now, even those are out of reach.\n\n“Before, we at least found joy in being home and having friends over and family over, cooking and sitting around the table and just being content,” she said. Now, “I’m not entertaining at all. It’s really sad.”\n\nFrom Coke to Pepsi\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Local markets, generic brands help family save money on groceries 01:25 - Source: CNN Business\n\nRick Wichmann, 64, and his wife have been dining out less often in recent years, due to the pandemic and in an effort to eat healthier. With menu prices rising because of inflation, they see no reason to change their habits.\n\n“Eating out is expensive,” he said, noting that he’s often happier with home-cooked meals than restaurant food anyway.\n\nBut grocery shopping is also more expensive. Over the past year, Wichmann noticed that he had been spending about 25% more shopping for groceries for himself, his wife and their son than he used to.\n\nTo help mitigate those costs, Wichmann, who lives in Brookline, Massachusetts, started going to different grocers. He avoids Whole Foods and Stop & Shop, opting instead for Costco and the local chain Market Basket.\n\nHe’s also switched to store brands, if he feels the quality is the same, and will sometimes choose products based on price rather than brand loyalty — like, for example, buying Pepsi when it’s cheaper, when he’d otherwise choose Coke.\n\nWichmann also pays attention to events like weather, and how they might affect prices. When he saw reports of a possible tomato shortage due to droughts in California, he took notice. The next time he saw tomato sauce on sale he stocked up on enough to last for months.\n\nA vegetable garden in the front lawn\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Turning to gardening to save money on food 01:33 - Source: CNN Business\n\nLike Wichmann, Jenni Wells, 38, pays attention to weather patterns and food systems. A former chef and rancher, she noticed price increases well before the current bout of inflation.\n\n“My alarm bells started going off for prices going up in 2019,” she said, when devastating floods in the midwest drowned livestock and destroyed grain stocks. Wells decided back then that she’d like to be more self sufficient.\n\n“I saw the food prices going up, and I realized that it was going to quickly overwhelm our budget,” she said. So in February, she ripped up the grass in the front lawn of her home in Fort Worth, Texas, which she shares with her husband and best friend, and planted a vegetable garden.\n\n“I just wanted to see what I could grow for myself,” she said. This year, she’s managed to grow broccoli, cauliflower, okra, tomatoes, peppers, squashes and more in her garden.\n\nThere are upfront and maintenance costs for the garden, of course. And it’s not easy to grow vegetables. But the household’s weekly grocery spending, excluding meat, has fallen from about $200 to $50, she said.\n\nWith the money left over, Wells and her household have been able to eat at restaurants, something that would have been “too much of a luxury” had they still been spending $200 a week on groceries. And there’s the satisfaction of growing your own food.\n\n“There’s a huge sense of reward,” she said. “I feel pride in every meal that I make with it.”\n\nChanging for good\n\nA recent weekly grocery haul for Lisa Altman. Courtesy Lisa Altman\n\nSome consumers have made changes because of current circumstances that they plan to hold onto.\n\nNow, Altman, the Austin parent of three, aims to keep her grocery bill to about $100 to $125 per week by buying store brands, lots of pasta and a limited amount of protein each week.\n\nInstead of ordering in or grilling steaks or ribs, Altman’s family eats more basic meals with smaller portions. “Now our meals consist of one primary dish, and that’s it, maybe some bread on the side, or a salad.” If they go out to eat, they’ll pick up a fast food meal with a few sides, like one burger and two fries, split the items and have beverages at home.\n\nWhen Altman is able to afford it, she’ll go back to buying more fruits and veggies. But she’s hoping some habits, like encouraging her children to avoid mindless eating and reducing food waste, will stick.\n\n“I’m not going to be spending $1,200 a month on groceries,” she said. “This has taught us that that’s not necessary.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}]}

Green has swapped her go-go boots for sneakers. Brown is sporting lower, more sensible heels. Red and Yellow’s shoes now have laces. Orange’s shoes laces are no longer untied. And Blue’s shoes, while little changed, resemble what Anton Vincent, president of Mars Wrigley North America, described as “a bad version of Uggs.”\n\nM&Ms old logo and characters are shown on the left, and the new versions on the right. Changes include new footwear for the six characters and a straightened-out logo emphasizing the ampersand. M&Ms\n\nMars Wrigley, which owns M&Ms, is trying to make the characters — particularly the female ones — more “current” and “representative of our consumer,” Vincent said. The revamped footwear is “a subtle cue, but it’s a cue people really pick up on,” he added, noting that Mars gets a lot of feedback on the characters’ shoes.\n\nThe logo adjustment is also slight: Instead of resting on its side, it’s set up straight. The new orientation is designed to emphasize the ampersand. The logo was last tweaked in 2019.\n\nThe changes are rolling out online this week and they’ll be incorporated into M&Ms’ packaging and other marketing materials this year.\n\nThe changes may be subtle, but even small shifts can help brands avoid falling out of fashion, said David Camp, co-founder and managing partner of Metaforce, a marketing company. “Every brand has to continuously reinvent itself to remain relevant.”\n\nM&Ms were introduced in 1941. M&Ms\n\nBetter gender representation\n\nM&Ms were first sold in 1941, and the characters arrived on the scene in 1954.

Brown, the most recent addition, joined the crew in 2012.\n\nOver the years the brand has switched between highlighting its characters more heavily or less frequently, Vincent noted. Now, it’s putting them front and center.\n\nM&M's packaging circa 2004. Stephen Chernin/Getty Images\n\nCurrently, there are two female characters and four male ones. Adding another couple of female characters to balance out the ratio is possible, said Vincent, but there are “implications” for the product itself. Namely, M&Ms would have to add new permanent colors to its mix.\n\nThe solution, then, was to give the female Green and Brown a promotion. They’ll have more prominent placement in ads, with the aim of “a little bit more gender balance,” said Vincent.\n\nM&Ms is using these changes to try to signal its brand identity to customers, who are increasingly drawn to brands they feel align with their own values. “It gives us a good platform to talk about the whole idea around belonging,” Vincent said.\n\nThe company is also is placing more “focus on the characters as it relates to the total brand, and then building ourselves a platform to be able to advocate and talk about this idea,” he added.\n\nOther brands have made adjustments to their logos or mascots to keep them up-to-date. One example is Quaker, which in 2012 altered the face of its mascot like a discreet plastic surgeon. (Quaker is owned by Pepsico (PEP)). Changes included “remov[ing] his double chin and smooth[ing] the rolls and plumpness in his face and neck,” The Wall Street Journal reported at the time. The new character’s shoulders are also more visible and his hair shorter, to make him seem more fit, and elongating his neck, the Journal noted.\n\nSome brands like Uncle Ben’s and Aunt Jemima recently have revised their logos, mascots or brand names because of problematic and racist origins.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/25/health/pfas-chemicals-fast-food-groceries-wellness/index.html", "title": "Food packaging contains dangerous chemicals, report says | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nAlarming levels of dangerous chemicals known as PFAS were discovered in food packaging at a number of well-known fast-food and fast-casual restaurants and grocery store chains, a new report found.\n\nThe highest levels of indicators for PFAS were found in food packaging from Nathan’s Famous, Cava, Arby’s, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Stop & Shop and Sweetgreen, according to an investigation released Thursday by Consumer Reports.\n\nOften called “forever chemicals” because they do not break down in the environment, PFAS are used in food packaging to prevent grease and water from soaking through food wrappers and beverage cups. PFAS can also be found in the ink used to print logos and instructions on food containers.\n\nThe new report comes more than two years into the Covid-19 pandemic, when the public has relied heavily on takeout and grocery deliveries.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls exposure to PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) a “public health concern,” citing studies that found the human-made chemicals can harm the immune system and reduce a person’s resistance to infectious diseases.\n\n“There is evidence from human and animal studies that PFAS exposure may reduce antibody responses to vaccines,” stated the CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. “More research is needed to understand how PFAS exposure may affect illness from COVID-19.”\n\nMore than 100 food products tested\n\nThe Consumer Reports investigation collected 118 food packaging products sold by 24 companies in the tristate area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It tested those products for organic fluorine – a marker for PFAS. Researchers then sent samples of products with the highest levels to an independent laboratory that could perform more specific tests, said Michael Hansen, senior staff scientist for advocacy at Consumer Reports.\n\nRegulatory limits for how much PFAS food packaging should contain can vary greatly. In the US, there are no federal limits, leaving action up to the states. Connecticut, Maine, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Washington have passed bills banning intentional use of PFAS in food packaging, but haven’t yet specified a limit, according to Consumer Reports. In January 2023, a new law in California will set the limit at less than 100 ppm (parts per million).\n\nHowever, Denmark set a much lower regulatory limit of 20 ppm with great success, said Xenia Trier, a chemicals, environment and human health expert at the European Environment Agency.\n\n“In Denmark we’ve seen both a decrease in noncompliance by industry from 60% to about 30% and a decrease in levels of PFAS in packaging products over the past 10 years,” Trier told CNN. “It does work to set limits and enforce them. It is possible to find alternative solutions and if one manufacturer can make packaging without PFAS, then it should be possible for everybody to do it.”\n\nThe Consumer Reports investigation found the highest indicators for PFAS – 876 ppm and 618 ppm – in two types of bags for sides at Nathan’s Famous restaurants.\n\nHigh indicators of PFAS (in the 500s) were also found in a Chick-fil-A sandwich wrapper and in fiber bowls at Cava, a Mediterranean restaurant chain.\n\nIndicator levels in the 300s and 400s were found in a bag of cookies at Arby’s, bamboo paper plates at Stop & Shop, and in a bag for both cookies and French toast sticks at Burger King.\n\nLevels of PFAS indicators in the 200s were found in a Sweetgreen paper bag for focaccia, additional items at Cava, and in bags for french fries, cookies and Chicken McNuggets at McDonald’s.\n\nHowever, all of the companies listed had additional food packaging that tested at levels below 200 ppm. Four companies – Arby’s, Nathan’s Famous, McDonald’s and Stop & Shop – also sold food in packaging that had no detectable levels of PFAS, the report said.\n\nThe Consumer Reports investigation did not test packaging from every food product sold at each company.\n\n“I would not urge consumers to take these brand names and only go to this one or that one, as this investigation only looked at just over 100 products,” said Graham Peaslee, a professor of physics, chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.\n\n“However, this will hold industry’s toes to the fire, so in that sense, I think it’s a valuable report,” he added. “Measuring and saying PFAS is there and it’s dangerous gets people’s attention, and companies tend to avoid attention like that.”\n\nHealth impact of PFAS\n\nPFAS chemicals are in many products: nonstick cookware, infection-resistant surgical gowns and drapes, cell phones, semiconductors, commercial aircraft and low-emission vehicles. The chemicals also are used to make carpeting, clothing, and furniture resistant to stains, water and grease damage.\n\nIn use since the 1950s, PFAS are chemicals most Americans have “in their blood,” especially perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA),” according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which is charged with protecting the public from hazardous substances.\n\nIn the Consumer Reports investigation, the most common chemical found in the food packaging that was tested was PFOA, with PFOS coming in fifth, according to the report.\n\nIn addition to impacts on the immune system, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry said studies in humans and lab animals have found links between certain PFAS chemicals and an increase in cholesterol levels, alterations in liver enzymes, a higher risk of developing kidney or testicular cancer, small reductions in infant birth weights and an additional risk of high blood pressure in pregnant women.\n\n“PFAS have also caused birth defects, delayed development, and newborn deaths in lab animals,” the agency stated, while adding “not all effects observed in animals may occur in humans.”\n\nAs environmental groups and the public began to take notice of the health impacts of the chemicals, manufacturers started to voluntarily phase out the use of PFOS and PFOA in the US. Between 1999 and 2014, blood levels of PFOS in Americans had declined by more than 80% and blood levels of PFOA had declined by more than 60%, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry stated.\n\nHowever, “as PFOS and PFOA are phased out and replaced, people may be exposed to other PFAS,” the agency continued. Newer versions of PFAS in food packaging appear to be absorbed by food more readily than the older versions, according to a 2016 study.\n\nStudies in Denmark have shown that PFAS do “migrate from the paper into the food,” Trier said. “Even though it was not 100%, we still saw substantial transmission. In general, transmission from packaging to food is increased as the temperature of the food rises and the time spent in wrapping materials increases.”\n\nIndustry response\n\nThe Consumer Reports investigation mirrored results of reports in 2018 and 2020 by Toxic-Free Future and Safer Chemicals Healthy Families. Those reports found “harmful” levels of PFAS in fast-food packaging and in nearly two-thirds of takeout containers made of paper, like those used at self-serve salad buffets and hot bars.\n\nIn response to the 2018 report, Whole Foods became the first grocery chain in North America to publicly commit to remove PFAS from takeout containers and deli and bakery paper. Other companies have followed suit, including Ahold Delhaize, Albertsons, Amazon.com, Cava, Chipotle, Freshii, McDonald’s, Panera Bread, Sweetgreen, Trader Joe’s and Wendy’s, according to Toxic-Free Future.\n\nIn the new investigation, Consumer Reports tested 13 food packaging products from retailers that had previously committed to phasing out PFAS. Seven of the 13 had levels of PFAS above 20 ppm, the report said.\n\nBurger King, which had high levels of PFAS in three of six products tested, had not made a public commitment to phase out PFAS, according to Consumer Reports. Early Thursday, parent company Restaurant Brands International announced it will globally phase out any “added” PFAS from “guest-facing packaging materials” at the Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes brands “by the end of 2025 or sooner.”\n\nNathan’s Famous, which Consumer Reports said also has not made a public commitment to reducing PFAS, told CNN the company had begun phasing out the bags. “One of our goals in this complete package redesign is to reduce PFAS,” said Phil McCann, vice president of marketing at Nathan’s Famous. “Full transition will be complete by December 2022.”\n\nChick-fil-A told CNN it had been on a four-year journey to phase out PFAS: “Chick-fil-A has eliminated intentionally added PFAS from all newly produced packaging going forward in our supply chain. While some legacy packaging may still be in restaurants, it is expected to be phased out by the end of this summer,” the company tweeted Wednesday.\n\nCava, which had previously pledged to reduce PFAS but had five out of six products with indicators between 200 ppm and 548 ppm, told CNN that “due to a multitude of factors related to the pandemic, and especially global supply chain shortages, the transition to eliminating added PFAS, which began in August of 2021, is taking longer than planned. Our teams are working with our suppliers to complete the transition within the year.”\n\nA McDonald’s spokesperson said less than 7.5% of the company’s global food packaging contained added PFAS at the end of 2020 and said the company was continuing its search for alternative materials that offered proper grease-resistant barriers, with a goal of reducing deliberately added PFAS by the end of 2025.\n\nSweetgreen told CNN the company was “proud to share that we are currently in the process of rolling out new PFAS-free focaccia bags that will be available in all Sweetgreen locations by the end of Q2.”\n\nJennifer Brogan, director of external communications and community relations for Stop & Shop, told CNN the company could “confirm that these Nature’s Promise brand plates have been removed from all store locations.”\n\nA spokesperson from Arby’s told CNN in an email that the company has “minimal packaging materials containing PFAs and is on track to have PFAs removed from all packaging products by the end of 2022.”\n\nActions the public can take\n\nExperts say people who want to avoid PFAS in their takeout and food delivery packaging should favor companies that have pledged to remove the chemicals.\n\nTake food out of the container as soon as you receive it, and never reheat food in its original container. Instead, remove your food and heat it in ceramic or glass containers, Trier said.\n\nThe Consumer Reports investigation found some of the highest levels of PFAS were in paper bags (192.2 ppm) and molded fiber bowls and trays (156.8 ppm). Paper plates tested at 149 ppm, and food wrappers and liners came in at 59.2 ppm.\n\nDon’t be fooled by “environmentally friendly” claims – they don’t guarantee a product is PFAS-free. When Consumer Reports tested those products, some had levels of PFAS above 100 ppm, and most had some detectable levels, the report said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nExperts also suggest reducing the frequency of takeout meals to once a week or less, and recommend that people instead make food at home.\n\nYou can also reach out to your congressional representative and senators and support the bipartisan bill Keep Food Containers Safe from PFAS Act, experts said.

Colorful pills drive new warnings about ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new wave of concern has spread across the United States over multi-colored “rainbow fentanyl” pills, powders and blocks – that look similar to candy or sidewalk chalk – being sold and used in several states, and potentially posing a threat to young people.\n\nBut parents of young children should not overly panic, and the emergence of this new product is one small part of the larger ongoing opioid crisis.\n\nRainbow fentanyl comes in bright colors and can be used in the form of pills or powder that contain illicit fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, making them extremely addictive and potentially deadly if someone overdoses while trying to achieve a high off of the drugs.\n\nThis multi-colored fentanyl may appeal to young people or fool them into thinking it’s safe, but experts say illicit fentanyl has been hiding in what appears to be other products for a long time, and fentanyl is fentanyl – it’s all dangerous, rainbow or not.\n\n“Colored fentanyl pills have been around for a few years. Typically, they’ve been blue pills labeled ‘M30’ to counterfeit oxycodone, which is a much weaker opioid,” Joseph Palamar, an associate professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone Health, who has studied trends in illicit fentanyl, said in an email to CNN.\n\n“I think the big difference people are concerned about is with regard to accidental ingestion. People are worried that their kids will take one of these pills thinking they’re another drug or even thinking they’re some sort of candy,” Palamar said. “I don’t think the color of the pills greatly increases danger to people who don’t use fentanyl, but there is always a possibility of someone who uses fentanyl leaving their pills around in the reach of children.”\n\nHe added, “We need to keep in mind that these pills cost money so people aren’t going to be throwing them on the ground for kids to find. I don’t think people will be giving these pills out as Halloween candy.”\n\nWhere rainbow fentanyl warning originated\n\nThe US Drug Enforcement Administration released a warning in August advising the public of this “alarming emerging trend” of “colorful fentanyl available across the United States.”\n\nAt the time, the agency said that it and its law enforcement partners seized the brightly colored fentanyl and fentanyl pills across 18 states. Fentanyl remains the deadliest drug threat facing the nation, according to the DEA.\n\nBut the DEA did not specify in its announcement whether rainbow fentanyl had led to overdoses or deaths among young people.\n\n“Rainbow fentanyl – fentanyl pills and powder that come in a variety of bright colors, shapes, and sizes – is a deliberate effort by drug traffickers to drive addiction amongst kids and young adults,” DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in the August announcement.\n\nSince then, some colleges and universities are cautioning students about the presence and dangers of rainbow fentanyl, and the California Department of Public Health has alerted K-12 school administrators in the state about rainbow fentanyl being “a new trend.”\n\nAt Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, physicians have been seeing more fentanyl exposures among both young children and adolescents, Dr. Sam Wang, the hospital’s pediatric toxicologist, told CNN on Friday. While he and his colleagues are aware of rainbow fentanyl warnings, he hasn’t heard any patients or parents mention it.\n\nAfter all, the bottom line, he said, is that fentanyl is fentanyl, whether it comes in the form of rainbow-colored pills or simply a white powder.\n\n“It’s just coming out in a different form to potentially be more attractive, more quote unquote ‘fun’ to use because it looks potentially fun to take,” said Wang, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\nAnd when young people use illicit drugs, they sometimes don’t know what they really contain, or how dangerous those substances might be.\n\nWhen it comes to rainbow fentanyl, “the fentanyl itself is going to be the same issue as the counterfeit pharmaceutical fentanyl. We don’t know how much is in it – it can vary. We don’t know the type of fentanyl,” Wang said. “And so those concerns transmit, still, over to this product. It’s just now this looks like it has a potential danger for young children and then also, it’s going to be more attractive for people to use and have consequences from that.”\n\nThe rise of fentanyl\n\nThe United States has been facing an opioid overdose epidemic – and waves of opioid overdose deaths – for decades, starting with a rise in prescription opioid overdose deaths in the early 2000s, followed by a rise in heroin overdose deaths beginning in 2010 and, most recently, a rise in synthetic opioid overdose deaths that started in 2013, fueled by potent fentanyl.\n\nPharmaceutical fentanyl is a synthetic opioid intended to help patients, such as those with cancer, manage severe pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and typically prescribed in the form of skin patches or lozenges. But most recent cases of fentanyl-related harm, overdose, and death in the United States are linked to illegally made fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe latest data suggest that annual drug overdose deaths have jumped 44% from before the Covid-19 pandemic. There were about 76,000 deaths reported in the 12-month period ending March 2020. The CDC’s latest provisional data show that more than 109,000 people in the United States died of a drug overdose in the 12-month period ending March 2022.\n\nSynthetic opioids, including fentanyl, were involved in more than two-thirds of overdose deaths in the year ending March 2022. Deaths involving synthetic opioids increased by a staggering 80% over the past two years, CDC data shows.\n\nRainbow fentanyl has been receiving attention due to the bright colors of the products, but the illicit fentanyl that the products contain represents a continuation of the ongoing opioid epidemic. The only difference between rainbow fentanyl and the fentanyl products of the past appears to be the coloring.\n\n“The reason it’s colored is just to differentiate products. If we had a regulated market, they would be differentiated in different ways – we do not. It has nothing to do with marketing to kids at all, period, whatsoever,” said Maya Doe Simkins, co-founder of the Opioid Safety and Naloxone Network and co-director of Remedy Alliance, a collection of harm reduction groups that work to make naloxone more accessible.\n\nSimkins likened the different colors of rainbow fentanyl to how people used food coloring in heroin in the past, and she said the colors are sometimes used to differentiate batches.\n\n“It’s just a differentiation between your product, my product or this batch and the next batch,” she said.\n\nIncreasing fentanyl seizures\n\nIllicit fentanyl has long been hiding in drugs, and its presence appears to be on the rise.\n\nA study, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence in May, found that the number of fentanyl-containing powder and pills seized by law enforcement in the United States rose between 2018 and 2021.\n\nThe weight of powder fentanyl seizures increased from 298.2 kilograms in 2018 to 2,416 kilograms in 2021, and the number of pills seized increased from 42,202 in 2018 to 2,089,186 in 2021, according to the study, of which Palamar was the lead author.\n\n“We found that not only has fentanyl seizures been increasing, but the proportion of pills seized to overall fentanyl seizures has been increasing. The proportion of pill seizures increased from 14% in early 2018 to 29% in late 2021,” Palamar wrote in his email to CNN.\n\n“We don’t have information regarding what these seized pills were purported to be, but we think many were disguised as oxycodone or even Xanax,” he wrote. “Seizures of these counterfeit pills have been increasing at a rapid rate, suggesting increasing availability, and availability is going to continue to increase.”\n\nWith this increase, counterfeit pills have been more difficult to identify, but Palamar said that people can use test strips to detect traces of illicit fentanyl if they have concerns.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“People can purchase fentanyl test strips for as little as a dollar. Most of these strips are meant for urine testing but they can detect the presence of fentanyl if used correctly,” Palamar wrote.\n\n“I highly recommend that anyone who plans to use an illegally purchased pill or an illegal powder like cocaine test the drug before using,” he added. “There are also hundreds of newer fentanyl analogs and other opioids that can be very dangerous that test strips can’t detect. I do worry that test strips will give some people a false sense of security, but they’re something.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/11/business/baskin-robbins-new-logo/index.html", "title": "This 77-year old ice cream chain is getting a makeover", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nBaskin-Robbins is making some changes.\n\nThe 77-year old ice cream shop is tweaking its logo, employee uniforms and packaging to update the brand. It’s the first major update for Baskin-Robbins since 2006, according to the company. It will also sell merchandise, including bikes and bucket hats, from a dedicated online store for the first time. And Baskin-Robbins will unveil new flavors as part of the refresh.\n\nFor years, the Baskin-Robbins logo has been pink and blue. “BR” and the words “Baskin Robbins” were printed in a blocky, childish font.\n\nIn the new logo that playful font is gone, replaced by a crisper version. The new branding comes in brown and pink, brown and blue, and pink and white.\n\nIn other words, the new Baskin-Robbins is all grown up. The makeover has been a long time coming.\n\n“When we really think about the journey … it started four years ago,” said Jason Maceda, Baskin-Robbins president. That included “really listening to our guests.”\n\nOld (L) and new versions of the Baskin-Robbins logo. Baskin-Robbins\n\nBaskin-Robbins’ leadership team heard that some customers felt very attached to the brand, which they associated with childhood trips with parents or grandparents. But they also heard that there were “some opportunities in being more relevant,” Maceda said.\n\nIt’s important for brands like Baskin-Robbins to gain traction with younger consumers -— not just people who remember it from their youth -— so they have new customers coming in.\n\nThe company’s leadership has been addressing the feedback in a few ways. In late 2018, for example, Baskin-Robbins introduced a new layout and design for some stores. These so-called “Moments” stores feature a more modern design, digital menu boards, more ice cream display cases and more toppings and offerings.\n\nSo far, there are about 70 of these stores altogether, Maceda said. That’s still just a small portion of the over 7,700 Baskin-Robbins stores open globally.\n\nThe rollout of the “Moments’ stores slowed during the pandemic, Maceda noted, adding that he’s “excited to get that going again.”\n\nStill, the pandemic was good for ice cream sales. Baskin-Robbins was taken private in 2020 and doesn’t publicly disclose sales figures. But Maceda said sales grew 3.5% in 2020, and 10.9% last year. Overall, ice cream sales at US scoop shops grew 4.4% from 2019 to 2021, according to Euromonitor International.\n\nTo help keep that momentum going, Baskin-Robbins hopes to make a splash with its new look, flavors and merchandise.\n\nBikes, bucket hats and ube ice cream\n\nSome examples of Baskin-Robbins' merchandise. Baskin-Robbins\n\nThe new branding draws on the company’s history, noted Jerid Grandinetti, VP of marketing and culinary at Baskin-Robbins.\n\nBrothers-in-law Irvine “Irv” Robbins and Burton “Burt” Baskin founded the ice cream company in 1945. But they didn’t brand it as “Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream” until 1953.\n\n“The original advertising campaign in 1953 was built around circus iconography,” said Grandinetti. That campaign used the pink and brown that Baskin-Robbins is reviving today.\n\nThat was also the year that Baskin-Robbins introduced the idea of 31 flavors, one for every day of the month. Both the new and old logos have “31” hidden between the B and the R when the letters are placed together.\n\nToday, Baskin-Robbins has hundreds of flavors in its portfolio. But it still has room for more.\n\nPart of the refresh includes three new limited-time flavors: One is Non-Dairy Mint Chocochunk, another is Totally Unwrapped, made with peanut butter and chocolate ice creams, caramel swirls, fudge-covered pretzels, and fudge and caramel covered peanuts. Grandinetti refers to that one as a “deconstructed candy bar.”\n\nThe third flavor, Ube Coconut Swirl, is made with coconut and ube (a purple yam commonly used in Filipino desserts) ice creams with ube-flavored swirls.\n\nTotally Unwrapped is the April flavor of the month, while the other two will be available through the spring, and could stick around for longer depending on how customers react.\n\nIn addition to the new flavors and its new look, the company is rolling out some swag, including branded scrunchies, sweatshirts, bucket hats and even bicycles.\n\nBikes may seem like an odd choice of swag for an ice cream company. But the brand’s new tagline, “Seize the Yay,” is about celebrating small, joyous moments. And nothing says “yay” like a ride on an ice-cream themed bike.\n\n“We want to make sure that we celebrate along with our guests,” said Grandinetti. “What better way to do that than to provide some fun buzzworthy” items, like a bicycle, as well as clothing that can be “part of their everyday lifestyle.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/23/business/diwali-products-marketing-us-mainstream-cec/index.html", "title": "Diwali is having a mainstream moment in the US | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nDiwali seems to be everywhere this year.\n\nMore and more major brands are recognizing the festival of lights, running ad campaigns and stocking products related to the holiday in the US. South Asian Americans who celebrate Diwali can now pick up fireworks from Costco, greeting cards from Hallmark and party decorations from Target.\n\nDiwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the most important festivals in Hinduism. The holiday also has significance for Sikhs and Jains, and is celebrated not just in India, but in Nepal, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries with South Asian diasporas.\n\nThe growing acknowledgment of the holiday in the US is a marked shift for many first- and second-generation South Asian Americans who grew up celebrating the festival at home but rarely saw it acknowledged outside of their communities, says Soni Satpathy-Singh, who runs the meal delivery review website Meal Matchmaker.\n\nEight years ago, Satpathy-Singh wrote a piece for Brown Girl Magazine lamenting that Diwali hadn’t caught the attention of mass market retailers, despite the Indian American population’s growing numbers and high incomes. Today, the landscape looks much different.\n\n“It’s interesting to see how much has developed over the last eight years just in terms of things you can buy to celebrate Diwali,” she told CNN. “Growing up, we would buy diyas from India or [use] things that my parents already had at home. There was no venturing out to buy stuff for a party, partly because it wasn’t even available.”\n\nThe proliferation of Diwali ad campaigns and products, marketing strategists and business owners say, reflects just how much the South Asian population in the US has grown in recent years.\n\nConsumers are looking for meaning\n\nIt’s not hard to understand why more businesses are taking notice of Diwali, says Dhatri Navanayagam, a senior strategy director at the marketing agency Essence Global.\n\nAsian Americans are the fastest growing racial or ethnic group in the US, and are projected to become the country’s largest immigrant group by the middle of the century, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. At 4.6 million people, Indian Americans account for about 21% of that group, more than doubling in population from 2000 to 2019.\n\nIndian Americans also have a median household income of $119,000 – well above that of the overall population.\n\nDiwali, then, presents a significant commercial opportunity for businesses, given that it’s tradition to give gifts, ignite firecrackers and feast with friends and family. But it’s not enough to just slap “Happy Diwali” branding on a product – consumers are looking for products and marketing campaigns that feel genuine and meaningful, according to Navanayagam.\n\n“Brands are increasingly leaning into understanding what consumers need from them during this festival and how they can actually step up and help,” she says.\n\nLego stands out as a notable example, says Navanayagam. In addition to highlighting Diwali gift ideas, the company’s website features instructions for creating a rangoli using Lego pieces that people already have at home – an initiative that feels particularly relevant given the financial pressures that many consumers are currently facing, she adds.\n\nSatpathy-Singh, too, has noticed some companies making more of an effort. The cookware brand Our Place, which makes the cult favorite Always Pan, is selling a Diwali fry set for consumers making samosas, jalebis or murukku as part of their celebrations. And the party supplier Big Dot of Happiness makes Diwali decorations that she’s bought in years past.\n\nBut she’s also seen efforts that don’t feel particularly thoughtful, such as Edible Arrangements’ Diwali-themed platter. Though the brand acknowledged Diwali, its assortment was made up of chocolate-covered strawberries and mini cheesecakes with sprinkles, which she felt had little relevance to the festival.\n\n“There was no Indian flavor profile or anything reminiscent of Diwali mithai (sweets),” she adds. “It was just something commercially slapped on.”\n\nSouth Asian entrepreneurs have been doing this longer\n\nThough big brands have only recently begun to acknowledge Diwali, South Asian entrepreneurs and small business owners have been developing unique offerings around the holiday for a while, says Malai founder Pooja Bavishi.\n\nMalai, a Brooklyn-based ice cream business inspired by South Asian flavors and ingredients, started selling its Diwali Celebration Box in 2019. The items in the collection – which in past years have included gulab jamun ice cream cake and Parle-G masala chai ice cream sandwiches – cater to a new generation of Indian Americans who are looking for an updated twist on familiar flavors, Bavishi says. And it’s proved immensely popular with customers.\n\n“One of the main goals of Malai is to show that these flavors and these products are part of American culture and they should not be exoticized at all,” she adds.\n\nBrooklyn-based Malai started selling a Diwali Celebration Box in 2019. From Malai\n\nEtsy has been another mainstay for Diwali products, with candles, craft kits and other gifts, Satpathy-Singh says. Navanayagam points to South Asian-owned small businesses Madhu Chocolate and TAGMO Treats, both of whom cater to a younger generation of conscious consumers. Austin-based Madhu Chocolate, which prides itself on being sustainably sourced, introduced a Diwali chocolate bar that is masala chai flavored with Parle-G crumbles. New York-based TAGMO Treats, meanwhile, offers Diwali mithai that pays homage to home cooks.\n\n“These local chocolate companies are using familiarity in the style of Indian flavors with modern sustainable relevance for the younger South Asian generation,” Navanayagam says. “It shows more understanding of how a different generation is celebrating Diwali and what it means to them.”\n\nIs the festival getting over-commercialized?\n\nAs Diwali becomes more widely acknowledged and celebrated in the US, there are also concerns about whether the holiday might become over-commercialized, as some critics in India have long bemoaned, or whether mainstream brands are merely capitalizing on the holiday for their own ends.\n\nSome of that is inevitable, says Satpathy-Singh.\n\n“When anything in any culture becomes mainstream, you do run the risk of appropriation,” she says. “Sometimes I wonder if that just comes hand in hand with visibility.”\n\nBavishi is encouraged by the recent abundance of Diwali products, both from small businesses and mainstream retailers. Her family didn’t have many traditions around Diwali when she was growing up in Charlotte, North Carolina, partly because it wasn’t very accessible at the time. That’s no longer the case.\n\n“It is really great that there is acknowledgment for these holidays. For a really long time there wasn’t even that acknowledgment,” she adds. “But it has to be done carefully.”\n\nThere are, of course, deeper questions that merit exploration. Does it matter whether the person or company behind a Diwali product is South Asian or not? What is the line between celebration and appropriation? For Satpathy-Singh, the fact that these conversations are even being had is progress in itself.\n\n“Is that good? Is that bad? Does that mean we’ve arrived? I don’t know yet what the answer is,” Satpathy-Singh says, referring to mainstream retailers selling Diwali products. “But I just think it’s powerful that we’ve arrived at this point where we can think through these things.”", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2022/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/14/entertainment/jessica-biel-candy-plc/index.html", "title": "Analysis: As 'Candy,' Jessica Biel is the ultimate frenemy | CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in Pop Life Chronicles, CNN’s weekly entertainment newsletter.

Boom! Roasted!\n\nAt the time, the attack worked. Obama cast himself as the candidate who understood the current threats – led by al Qaeda. Romney was the candidate still stuck in the Cold War age, a black-and-white figure in a colorful – and complex – world.\n\nBut today, after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into eastern Ukraine, Romney’s comments look very, very different. And by “different,” I mean “right,” as even some Democrats are now acknowledging.\n\n“This action by Putin further confirms that Mitt Romney was right when he called Russia the number one geopolitical foe,” California Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu said on CNN Monday night.\n\nGiven that, it’s worth revisiting the context around what Romney said and why.\n\nHe was reacting to a hot-mic moment between Obama and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev earlier in 2012. In that exchange, Obama told Medvedev: “This is my last election. And after my election, I have more flexibility.”\n\nRepublicans were up in arms, insisting that Obama was taking a hard line with Russia publicly while, apparently, making clear to the country’s leader that he was open to compromise.\n\nIn his original interview, Blitzer was asking Romney about Russia in the context of that Obama hot-mic moment. And while his comment about Russia as America’s “number one geopolitical foe” is what drew the most attention and derision, it was far from the only comment Romney made about that subject in his interview with Blitzer.\n\n“Russia is not a friendly character on the world stage,” Romney said at one point. “And for this President to be looking for greater flexibility, where he doesn’t have to answer to the American people in his relations with Russia, is very, very troubling, very alarming.”\n\nPressed by Blitzer on his assertion about the threat posed by Russia, Romney added this:\n\n“Well, I’m saying in terms of a geopolitical opponent, the nation that lines up with the world’s worst actors. Of course, the greatest threat that the world faces is a nuclear Iran. A nuclear North Korea is already troubling enough.\n\n“But when these – these terrible actors pursue their course in the world and we go to the United Nations looking for ways to stop them, when – when Assad, for instance, is murdering his own people, we go – we go to the United Nations, and who is it that always stands up for the world’s worst actors?\n\n“It is always Russia, typically with China alongside.”\n\nWhat looked like a major flub during the 2012 campaign – and was used as a political cudgel by Obama – now looks very, very different. It should serve as a reminder that history is not written in the moment – and that what something looks like in that moment is not a guarantee of what it will always look like.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/27/business-food/arizona-tea-name-origin/index.html", "title": "The surprising backstory of AriZona Iced Tea's name | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nWhen Don Vultaggio was considering names for his new iced tea business three decades ago, he wanted something that connoted a “warm and healthy environment.”\n\nThat meant getting far away from Brooklyn, where Vultaggio grew up. But not too far away: His friends called his New York home the Santa Fe house, because of its adobe-style design, filled with pink, yellow and turquoise colors. So he settled on “Santa Fe” for the name of the drink.\n\nIt didn’t stick.\n\n“When I put Santa Fe on the package, it didn’t look right,” Vultaggio told CNN Business. “I thought it looked like a train.”\n\nThinking of places that were close to Santa Fe that would look better on a can, Vultaggio settled on Arizona – where he’d never been. In fact, Vultaggio hadn’t even traveled west of the Mississippi.\n\n“I always associated Arizona with a healthy, clean and dry feel that was different from the Brooklyn feel,” he said. “Having a name associated with a lifestyle, which is an environment and climate that made you want to grab a refreshing iced tea. That’s why the name seemed to make sense to me.”\n\nAriZona was almost called Santa Fe. Adobe Stock\n\nAriZona Beverages, which makes the famous 99-cent iced teas, began in New York City in the early 1990s. Vultaggio, the company’s cofounder, said he was inspired by Snapple, which was founded in 1972 and became a cultural phenomenon. The “Snapple Lady” commercials turned the juice and iced tea company into a huge success, as sales boomed throughout the 90s.\n\nHaving had his own success with a malt liquor business, Vultaggio and his partners pivoted to selling iced tea in the same-sized 23-ounce cans as their malt liquor. That helped AriZona stand out against Snapple’s 16-ounce can.\n\nThey wanted to keep it the same price, too. And give the logo a stylized capital Z that he said just looks better on its cans.\n\nThe vibrant can, with its eye-catching checkerboard patterns and colors, was inspired by his Santa Fe house, because of the “continuous feedback and accolades we would receive from everyone” for his home’s design.\n\nAriZona’s design is a “great point of differentiation with its competitors,” according to Andres Nicholls, global executive creative director at consultancy and design firm Prophet. “It’s been an excellent tool and place to express their personality and quickly say to the market ‘we are not like everybody else.’”\n\nNicholls said the brand has “been pretty fearless and consistent in their approach and have created a very distinctive design.”\n\nAriZona Iced Tea made its debut in 1992 and became an immediate hit. Its product line has blossomed beyond tea and now encompasses hundreds of products that include snacks, candy, coffee and alcohol. One of its most popular drinks is the Arnold Palmer, a half-tea, half-lemonade beverage based off the golf great’s drink of choice.\n\nBut just as eye-catching as the design is the 99-cent price for its tall boy iced teas, is its cost, which should be adjusted to more than $2 according to US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ price calculator. But that 1992 price is staying put.\n\n“Our customers don’t need another price increase,” he told CNN International anchor Richard Quest in June. “We maintain that price to give customers a reason to buy us.”\n\nManufacturing costs have risen everywhere, but Vultaggio credits actions “behind the scenes” that keep the tea’s profit margins robust. “We’ve been able to do it by light-weighting the can, run the cans faster on the line, have more facilities in America so we get closer to market,” he said.\n\nThe eye-catching design also helps maintain its market dominance, because AriZona doesn’t advertise as much as competitors like Snapple. Rather, the brand relies on its creativity to grab customers’ attention.\n\n“We use packaging and a value story, then a great product inside,” Vultaggio said. “The first time a person buys us is because of the package. And forever more, they’re buying it because it tastes great.”", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/entertainment/candace-cameron-bure-jojo-siwa/index.html", "title": "Candace Cameron Bure criticized by JoJo Siwa and others over ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMonths after they had a public back and forth, JoJo Siwa is voicing her disappointment with Candace Cameron Bure.\n\nThe singer/dancer, 19, posted on her verified Instagram about Cameron Bure after the former “Full House” star talked to the Wall Street Journal about her work with the faith-based channel, Great American Family.\n\nWhen asked if the Great American Family will include LGBTQ storylines in their projects, Cameron Bure said, “I think that Great American Family will keep traditional marriage at the core.”\n\nSiwa identifies as queer and shared a screen grab of a headline which read, “Candace Cameron Bure’s plans for new cable channel: No gays.”\n\n“Honestly, I can’t believe after everything that went down just a few months ago, that she would not only create a movie with intention of excluding LGBTQIA+, but then also talk about it in the press,” Siwa wrote. “This is rude and hurtful to a whole community of people.”\n\nIn July Siwa posted a video on TikTok that went viral in which she shared a photo of Cameron Bure as the “rudest celebrity” she had ever met, later revealing she had felt ignored by the star at an event when she was a child and tried to meet her.\n\nCameron Bure responded in a video on her verified Instagram account, explaining that she was “shocked” by the designation and said everything was “all good” after the pair connected and discussed it.\n\nSiwa wasn’t the only one upset by Cameron Bure’s recent comment.\n\nActress Hilarie Burton slammed her and Bill Abbott, chief executive of Great American Media, for “bigotry.”\n\n“That guy and his network are disgusting,” Burton tweeted. “You too Candy.

Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSome shoppers have started derisively calling the chain “$1.25 Tree” and say it should change its name.\n\nThe criticism highlights the risks that Dollar Tree — the last of the big dollar store chains to actually sell nearly everything for a dollar — took when it abandoned its $1 brand identity.\n\n“I wish they wouldn’t have done that because most of their shoppers are people who are not getting paid a lot of money,” said Leniza Costa, a beauty influencer in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, who is “known for always going” to Dollar Tree.\n\nCosta won’t shop at Dollar Tree (DLTR) as often and instead will look to purchase $1 items at Walmart (WMT).\n\n“This is the worst time to increase the price, when everything else is so much,” she said.\n\nWe won’t know for certain whether customers are turning their backs on Dollar Tree’s new prices until it reports its quarterly results in the coming weeks. But there are signs the move may be alienating some shoppers.\n\nA weekly online survey of around 500 consumers by Coresight Research, a retail research and advisory firm, found a 6.2% drop from December 27 to January 3 in the number of customers who said they had bought non-food items at Dollar Tree compared to the prior two weeks. A steeper decline of 12.2% was recorded among shoppers ages 45 to 60. Other chains, including Walmart and Dollar General, did not see similar drops in the surveys.\n\nDollar Tree added the $1.25 prices to more than 2,000 stores in December (it has around 8,700 US stores), and Coresight said in a report that its “decline in shopper numbers appears to coincide with its price hike.” The firm cautioned against an “overreliance on a single week’s data point,” but said the latest figures “may reflect a shopper exodus on the back” of the price change.\n\n“We have had a very positive response from the overwhelming majority of our customers around the $1.25 price point and the extreme value and broader product selection it has enabled, especially in these inflationary times,” a Dollar Tree spokesperson said in an email. “We look forward to providing more details on this initiative during our next earnings call.”\n\n‘Our niche’\n\nThe $1 price was almost sacrosanct to Dollar Tree, which sells toys, home furnishings, kitchenware, holiday decorations, stationary, party supplies, arts and crafts, books, food, household essentials and other items.\n\nMacon Brock, a Dollar Tree founder, said in his 2017 autobiography that “I viewed the dollar-only concept as sacred. It was everything. Without it, we’d be just another discount retailer.”\n\n“Ditch the dollar, I believed, and we’d surrender our niche,” he wrote.\n\nAs recently as August, Dollar Tree chief executive Michael Witynski said the company was committed to $1. “This dollar price point is going to be more important than ever,” he said on an analyst call.\n\nSelling everything for $1 was also easy on Dollar Tree store operations. Workers didn’t have to constantly spend time changing price displays in aisles or tags on shelves, and it was simple for customers on tight budgets to keep track as they shopped.\n\nDollar Tree raised prices because its business was pressured by having to keep everything under $1. Labor, transportation, fuel, merchandise and shipping costs have surged, squeezing the company’s profits.\n\nSome merchandise also suffered as a result of the $1 strategy. The chain had to discontinue several “customer favorites,” the company said in November, particularly in packaged and frozen foods. Raising prices will give Dollar Tree flexibility to reintroduce those items, expand its selection and bring in new products to draw customers, according to the company.\n\nDollar Tree's move to $1.25 comes with risks for the brand. Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDollar Tree had started selling items at $1.25 and $1.50 at some stores and said it got positive positive customer feedback on the test, leading the company to announce in November that it will move to $1.25 at all of its stores.\n\nOn December 12, in response to an activist investor pushing for broader changes at the company, including nominating an entirely new board of directors, Dollar Tree’s board said the price hike has been successful thus far.\n\nThe performance of stores with $1.25 prices “continues to validate our earlier tests and demonstrates the success of the Company’s strategy and execution,” the board said in a statement. The board said the move to $1.25 “was not a decision the Company took lightly, and required careful planning, including to ensure that it continues to provide a meaningful assortment with extreme value” to shoppers.\n\nBut some retail analysts have said the decision was rushed, jeopardizes the brand’s image and will lead shoppers to turn to competitors such as Dollar General (DG), which sells around 20% of its products for $1.\n\nThe price change “saddened” the Scent Maven, a video blogger who posts about her hauls at Dollar Tree and other stores, and will lead her to shop there less often. (She spoke under the condition that her name be withheld from the story to protect her identity.)\n\n“We all, in the Dollar Tree community, hoped it wouldn’t happen,” she said, adding that $1 was a price “you could count on.”\n\n“There was no doing math in your head or anything like that,” she said. “You know you could go to the Dollar Tree with $10 and walk out with 10 items.”\n\nAlthough Dollar Tree has put up new signs at stores that say it will offer new items and “more thrills” at $1.25, she has yet to see the change.\n\n“It’s like they’re promising you something more for 25 cents. But it’s not. It’s all the same quality and types of products.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/01/14"}]}

Georgia shrugged off the Gators' third-quarter uprising and cruised home.\n\nThe second-ranked Buckeyes faced a tougher test at No. 13 Penn State and found themselves down in the fourth quarter — for about 35 seconds. Ohio State ripped off 28 points in a little more than six minutes to leave Happy Valley with its best win of the season.\n\nBuckeyes coach Ryan Day called it a “matchup” game, his way of saying Penn State is one of the few teams with the talent and athleticism to line up with Ohio State.\n\n“When you play these types of of games you have to look at the entire body of work for four quarters,” Day said.\n\nDay probably wasn't talking directly to the CFP selection committee, but it did seem notable he was speaking their language with “body of work.”\n\nThe selection committee weighs in for the first time this season on Tuesday night with the first of six top 25s. The only one that really matters is the last on Dec. 4, of course.\n\nThe first rankings are frequently filled with teams that never come all that close to entering the postseason with a chance to play of the national title. Famously, the very first CFP No. 1 in 2014 was Mississippi State. The Bulldogs did not make the playoff.\n\nBut that was the only team to be No. 1 in the first CFP rankings of the season and not reach the final four.\n\nSo starting first seems to have its benefits.\n\nThe Bulldogs, the defending national champions, seem like a good bet to be on top Tuesday night. Georgia's had one tight spot to get out of against Missouri this season, but has otherwise done a pretty good impression of last season's dominant team.\n\nThe Bulldogs' victory against No. 8 Oregon to start the season is aging nicely a s the Ducks have been rolling ever since leaving Atlanta.\n\nThe Buckeyes have rarely been tested this season, too, though the competition hasn't been particularly daunting.\n\nNotre Dame gave them a good game for about three quarters and Penn State did the same. But when C.J. Stroud and Ohio State get rolling they seem impossible to stop.\n\nOhio State has scored at least 40 points in seven straight games, the most by a Big Ten school since 1936, according to ESPN Stats & Info.\n\nNo. 3 Tennessee was playing Saturday night against No. 19 Kentucky with a chance to make its case to be No. 1. The Volunteers are already in possession of maybe the season's best victory, a 52-49 win against No. 6 Alabama.\n\nNo. 4 Michigan was playing Michigan State.\n\nNo. 5 Clemson and No. 6 Alabama were off this week.\n\nDon't forget about No. 7 TCU. The Horned Frogs stayed unbeaten in yet another wild Big 12 game at West Virginia.\n\n“Some crazy stuff happened in this game today,” TCU coach Sonny Dykes said.\n\nAs the season heads into its final month, we'll see if the crazy keeps up or if the playoff contenders fall into place.\n\nAROUND THE COUNTRY\n\nThe back end of the top 10 was blown out in surprising fashion. No. 9 Oklahoma State was shut out by No. 22 Kansas State and No. 10 Wake Forest turned it over eight times — six (!) in the third quarter — against Louisville. It was the first time since 2009 that Oklahoma State was blanked. As for Wake, this was only the second time it has played as a top-10 team. The Demon Deacons are now 0-2. ... Maybe Notre Dame is better off playing away from home. The Fighting Irish (5-3) are 3-1 outside of South Bend, Indiana, after beating No. 16 Syracuse and have looked far more functional in almost every way ... UCF snapped No. 20 Cincinnati's 19-game American Athletic Conference winning streak at the Bounce House, leaving No. 23 Tulane as the lone unbeaten team in conference play. ... Break up that Iowa offense. The Hawkeyes broke out of a season-long fog against Northwestern, with season highs of 33 points and 393 yards. Northwestern still hasn't won a game in the United States after starting the season with a win over Nebraska in Ireland. ... This week's offensive debacle was brought to you by Miami and Virginia, which needed four overtime periods to reach 26 points. The Hurricanes (4-4) avoided yet another embarrassing loss. ...

I don’t know anyone who went there. Nothing really.”\n\nEichenberg's ignorance is understandable.\n\nOn New Year's Day in 1993, the Bulldogs completed the best season of the mostly forgettable Ray Goff era with a 21-14 Citrus Bowl victory over the John Cooper-led Buckeyes. It was a smash-mouth game that featured Georgia's Garrison Hearst and Ohio State's Robert Smith each rushing for more than 100 yards and two TDs.\n\nFortunately for the Bulldogs, they had a quarterback (Eric Zeier) who could throw the ball, too. The Buckeyes, with now-ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit taking the snaps, completed just 8 of 24 passes for 110 yards with an interception.\n\n“It was a good win for the Dawgs,” recalled Will Muschamp, Georgia's co-defensive coordinator who played in that game for his alma mater. “We had a luncheon, and Herbstreit got up and threw a pass across the room.\n\n\"I knew we had a shot to win.\"\n\nJoking aside, there are no Herbstreits in this one. But both teams feature Heisman Trophy finalists at quarterback — Georgia's Stetson Bennett vs. Ohio State C.J. Stroud — and plenty of firepower.\n\nThe Buckeyes rank second in the nation at 44.5 points a game, while Georgia checks in at No. 10 with a 39.2-point average.\n\nThe big question for Ohio State: Can they match up physically with the bruising Bulldogs?\n\nGeorgia is just as comfortable pounding an opponent into submission with its deep group of running backs as it is opening things up for Bennett and a talented collection of pass catchers led by tight end Brock Bowers.\n\nOhio State faced such a test against Michigan — and failed miserably. Now, the Buckeyes get the reigning national champs.\n\n“It’s football, and you have to play physical,” Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. “Certainly it’s going to be the most physical game you’ve played all season.”\n\nQUARTERBACK DUEL\n\nBennett, a former walk-on, could go down as one of the best big-game quarterbacks in college football history.\n\nHe has earned offensive MVP honors in his last three postseason contests, completing a cumulative 60 of 85 passes for 811 yards and nine touchdowns with no interceptions in this year's SEC championship game and last season's two playoff victories.\n\nStroud, who was heavily recruited by Georgia before landing at Ohio State, will be facing a Bulldogs defense that gave up 502 yards passing in a 50-30 victory over LSU for the SEC title.\n\nHe views that as nothing more than an anomaly in a game that Georgia led comfortably most of the way.\n\n“I’m pretty sure they’re not going to let us drop back and do what we want to do,” Stroud said. “I’m pretty sure they’ve been watching film on us and make sure that’s something they stop.”\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nAfter being a no-show much of the week, Ohio State running back Miyan Williams finally turned up at practice Thursday.\n\nDay said his player has been dealing with a stomach bug but would be ready to go Saturday.\n\nIt remains to be seen how effective Williams will be after sustaining an ankle injury against Indiana last month. He missed one game and had only eight carries for 34 yards in the loss to Michigan.\n\nThe Buckeyes sure could use him against Georgia, which has allowed a nation-low 77 yards rushing per game.\n\nSpeaking of injuries, the Bulldogs could be missing a couple of key players.\n\nIn the SEC title game, offensive lineman Warren McClendon sustained a knee injury, while Ladd McConkey (51 catches, 675 yards, five TDs) had to come out because of knee tendinitis.\n\nSmart played it coy all week, merely saying he hopes both can play after four weeks to recover.\n\nEYE ON THE TIGHT ENDS\n\nGeorgia has two huge weapons at tight end, and the Buckeyes aren't too shabby at that position, either.\n\nBowers is the Bulldogs' top receiver with 52 catches for 726 yards and six TDs, while 6-foot-7, 270-pound Darnell Washington presents an imposing physical challenge.\n\nOhio State counters with Cade Stover, who has 35 catches for 399 yards and five scores. He calls the tight end position “a very key piece to a good offense.”\n\nDAWG FRONT\n\nA deep defensive front — even after losing three players in the first round of the NFL draft — has allowed Georgia to keep the heat on opposing quarterbacks without the need for a lot of blitzing.\n\nThat will be a key against Stroud and the Buckeyes, who feature a pair of 1,000-yard receivers (Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka Egbuka).\n\nHOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE\n\nIt figures to be a pro-Bulldogs crowd at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which is about 75 miles from Georgia's Athens campus.\n\nThis is Georgia's third appearance of the season at the stadium that is home to the NFL's Atlanta Falcons. The Bulldogs opened with a 49-3 rout of Oregon and romped again in the conference title game.\n\n___\n\nPaul Newberry is a national sports writer for The Associated Press.

(AP) — Jameis Winston drove top-ranked Florida State 66 yards to put Roberto Aguayo in position for a 26-yard field goal with 3 seconds remaining, and the Seminoles remained perfect with a 20-17 victory over Boston College on Saturday.\n\nFlorida State (11-0, 8-0 ACC, No. 3 CFP) has been plagued by slow starts throughout the season and the Seminoles went into the fourth quarter tied 17-all with the Eagles (6-5, 3-4). But with less than five minutes left, Winston helped engineer another game-winning drive.\n\nThe Seminoles have won a school-record 27 consecutive games.\n\nFlorida State took over on its own 26-yard line after Boston College missed a 43-yard field goal with 4:37 left, and the Seminoles drove to the Eagles 8-yard line. Rashad Greene caught back-to-back passes for 11 and 15 yards to move the Seminoles within field-goal range.\n\nWinston had 281 yards passing with a touchdown and an interception. He has thrown at least one touchdown in 24 consecutive games.\n\nNo. 2 ALABAMA 48, WESTERN CAROLINA 14\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Derrick Henry rushed for two touchdowns and scored a third on a catch, all in the first half, to lead Alabama over Western Carolina.\n\nThe Crimson Tide (10-1) recovered from a slow start to score the final 31 points in its first game since rising to No. 1 in the College Football Playoff rankings. FCS member Western Carolina (7-5) scored a touchdown on the opening drive and trailed just 17-14 early in the second quarter.\n\nBlake Sims was 17 of 25 passing for 222 yards and two touchdowns. He also threw an interception in the end zone to snap a 158-pass streak without one. Henry had touchdown runs of 10 and 23 yards, and a 9-yard scoring reception.\n\nNeither played in the second half.\n\nThe Tide can clinch a spot in the SEC championship game with a victory next weekend at home over No. 16 Auburn.\n\nNo. 3 OREGON 44, COLORADO 10\n\nEUGENE, Ore. (AP) — Marcus Mariota threw for 323 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 73 yards and another score as Oregon beat Colorado in perhaps his last game at Autzen Stadium.\n\nFreshman Royce Freeman ran for 105 yards and two scores for the Ducks (10-1, 7-1 Pac-12, CFP No. 2). Oregon has already clinched the North Division's berth in the conference championship game on Dec. 5.\n\nIt was the seventh straight loss for Colorado (2-9, 0-8).\n\nMariota, a Heisman Trophy front-runner who has thrown a touchdown pass in every game of his career at Oregon, has not yet said whether he will forgo his final year of eligibility next season and declare for the NFL draft, although most expect him to.\n\nMariota has thrown 32 touchdown passes this season with just two interceptions and leads the nation in quarterback rating. With 42 total touchdowns this season (32 passing, 9 rushing and 1 TD catch), he passed former USC quarterback Matt Barkley (41) for the Pac-12 single-season record.\n\nNo. 4 MISSISSIPPI STATE 51, VANDERBILT 0\n\nSTARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) — Dak Prescott threw three touchdown passes and ran for another to lead Mississippi State over Vanderbilt.\n\nIt was a dominant performance by the Bulldogs (10-1, 6-1 Southeastern Conference, No. 4 CFP), who finished undefeated at Davis Wade Stadium for the first time since 1999.\n\nPrescott threw touchdown passes of 9, 27 and 14 yards, and Christian Holmes ripped the ball out of Vanderbilt receiver Latevius Rayford's hands before returning it 51 yards for a touchdown as the Bulldogs built a 37-0 lead by halftime.\n\nIt was the largest halftime lead for Mississippi State against an SEC opponent in program history. The Bulldogs have 10 wins in the regular season for the first time.\n\nVanderbilt (3-8, 0-7) had three turnovers in the first half.\n\nNo. 6 BAYLOR 49, OKLAHOMA STATE 28\n\nWACO, Texas (AP) — Bryce Petty threw touchdown passes on Baylor's first two drives that took a minute combined, putting the Bears ahead to stay in a comfortable victory over Oklahoma State.\n\nPlayoff-contending Baylor (9-1, 6-1 Big 12, No. 7 CFP) won its 15th consecutive home game on a dreary and rainy night along the banks of the Brazos River, staying in a three-way tie with No. 5 TCU and No. 12 Kansas State for the Big 12 lead with two games left.\n\nDevin Chafin ran for 106 yards and three touchdowns, while Shock Linwood had 113 yards rushing with a score for Baylor. Corey Coleman extended his nation's best streak with a TD catch in his seventh consecutive game.\n\nOklahoma State (5-6, 3-5) has lost five in a row.\n\nNo. 7 OHIO ST. 42, INDIANA 27\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Jalin Marshall returned a punt 54 yards for a touchdown to give Ohio State the lead late in the third quarter and added three late insurance scores to lead the Buckeyes past Indiana, the Hoosiers' sixth loss in a row.\n\nThe surprisingly tight game for most of the day could impact the playoff hopes of the Buckeyes (10-1, 7-0 Big Ten, No. 6 CFP), who clinched the East Division title and a berth in the conference title game.\n\nThey trailed the 34-point underdogs 20-14 after Tevin Coleman sped 90 yards for a TD midway through the third quarter. A week after rushing for 307 yards, Coleman went for 228 yards on 27 carries for three scores for the Hoosiers (3-8, 0-7).\n\nMarshall caught fourth-quarter scoring passes of 6, 15 and 54 yards to put the game out of reach.\n\nThe Hoosiers' last chance at a tying score ended with Tyvis Powell picking off a pass from Zander Diamont with 4:25 left, deep in Indiana territory.\n\nARKANSAS 30, No. 8 MISSISSIPPI 0\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) — Rohan Gaines returned an interception 100 yards for a touchdown, and Arkansas' defense forced six turnovers against Mississippi.\n\nThe win earned the Razorbacks (6-5, 2-5 Southeastern Conference), losers of 17 straight SEC games until a victory over LSU last week, bowl eligibility for the first time in three seasons.\n\nLed by Martrell Spaight's 11 tackles, Arkansas also earned back-to-back conference shutouts for the first time since joining the SEC in 1992.\n\nBo Wallace led the Rebels (8-3, 4-3) with 235 yards passing — but he also threw two interceptions as Ole Miss lost its third straight SEC game.\n\nNo. 9 GEORGIA 55, CHARLESTON SOUTHERN 9\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) — Georgia scored two touchdowns on its first three snaps, including an 83-yard touchdown run by Nick Chubb, and the Bulldogs rolled past Charleston Southern.\n\nHutson Mason played only the first half and threw three touchdown passes, including two to Chris Conley. Mason's 35-yard scoring pass to Conley came on Georgia's first play following a fumble recovery by Ramik Wilson. Mason added touchdown passes of 19 yards to Justin Scott-Wesley and 23 yards to Conley.\n\nChubb recorded his sixth straight 100-yard game, with 113 yards rushing and two touchdowns on only nine carries in the first half for Georgia (9-2). The Bulldogs, who have completed their Southeastern Conference schedule, would land in the SEC championship game if Missouri loses one of its final two games.\n\nCharleston Southern (8-4), hoping for a spot in the FCS playoffs, was held to 211 total yards.\n\nNo. 10 MICHIGAN STATE 45, RUTGERS 3\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Jeremy Langford and Tony Lippett celebrated senior day in style as Michigan State smashed Rutgers for its 40th win in four seasons and 51st in five.\n\nLangford, who played cornerback and wide receiver before returning to running back, rushed for 126 yards and two touchdowns. That stretched his streak of 100-yard games in conference play to 15, the longest in the Football Bowl Subdivision in the last 10 years.\n\nLippett, another fifth-year player who switched positions multiple times, had five catches for 72 yards and his 10th score this season. He became the eighth receiver in school history to pass the 1,000-yard mark and also played well in a surprising stint at cornerback.\n\nThe Spartans (9-2, 6-1 Big Ten) scored on five on their first six possessions and finished with a 520-234 edge in total offense, including 254 through the air from Connor Cook.\n\nGary Nova threw for just 108 yards on 11-for-26 passing for the Scarlet Knights (6-5, 2-5).\n\nNo. 11 UCLA 38, No. 24 USC 20\n\nPASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Brett Hundley passed for 326 yards and three touchdowns and rushed for another score, leading UCLA past Southern California for the Bruins' third straight victory in the annual crosstown showdown.\n\nDevin Lucien, Thomas Duarte and Eldridge Massington caught scoring passes as the Bruins (9-2, 6-2 Pac-12) confirmed their Los Angeles supremacy and closed in on the Pac-12 South title with a one-sided romp over their biggest rivals at a festive Rose Bowl.\n\nPaul Perkins rushed for 93 yards and a score for UCLA, which hadn't won three straight over USC since 1998.\n\nAfter five consecutive wins down the stretch of a slow-starting season, UCLA can advance to the Pac-12 title game against No. 3 Oregon with a victory over Stanford on Friday.\n\nCody Kessler passed for 214 yards for the Trojans (7-4, 6-3), who struggled mightily against UCLA's inspired defense.\n\nNo. 13 ARIZONA ST. 52, WASHINGTON ST. 31\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Taylor Kelly threw for four touchdowns in his last home game and Arizona State dominated the second half against Washington State.\n\nD.J. Foster rushed for three scores and the Sun Devils converted all five Cougars turnovers into touchdowns.\n\nCameron Smith caught six passes for a career-best 131 yards and two touchdowns for the Sun Devils (9-2, 6-2 Pac-12), who can still win the Pac-12 South title with some help.\n\nRedshirt freshman Luke Falk, in his second start after Connor Halliday went down with a season-ending injury, passed for 601 yards for Washington State (3-8, 2-6) but was intercepted four times and fumbled the ball away once. Vince Mayle caught 15 for 265 yards.\n\nSun Devils defensive end Marcus Hardison had an interception, forced fumble and sack.\n\nNo. 14 WISCONSIN 26, IOWA 24\n\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Melvin Gordon surpassed 2,000 yards rushing with 200 yards and two touchdowns, and Wisconsin held off Iowa for its sixth straight win.\n\nGordon became the 17th FBS player with a 2,000-yard rushing season. The Badgers (9-2, 6-1 Big Ten) still have to beat Minnesota in Madison next weekend to earn a shot at Ohio State in the Big Ten title game.\n\nGordon's performance came only hours after Oklahoma's Samaje Perine broke his week-old FBS record with 427 yards rushing in a win over Kansas. But Gordon was sensational in his own right, cracking the 2,000-yard mark on an 88-yard run midway through the third quarter.\n\nJake Rudock had 311 yards passing and two TDs for the Hawkeyes (7-4, 4-3), who rallied from 16 down to get to 26-24 with just more than 5 minutes left.\n\nNo. 15 ARIZONA 42, No. 20 UTAH 10\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Freshman Nick Wilson ran for 218 yards and three touchdowns as Arizona overcame an injury to quarterback Anu Solomon and pulled away from Utah.\n\nIn heavy rain at times, Wilson topped the 1,000-yard mark this season. Arizona led 21-10 in the fourth quarter before Wilson scored on a 75-yard run.\n\nArizona (9-2, 6-2 Pac-12) reached nine wins for the first time since its 1998 Holiday Bowl team went 12-1 and was ranked No. 4. The Wildcats retain slim hopes for a berth in the conference championship game as a matchup with rival Arizona State looms next week.\n\nThe Wildcats ran for 298 yards, the most allowed by Utah (7-4, 4-4) this season.\n\nNo. 16 AUBURN 31, SAMFORD 7\n\nAUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Cameron Artis-Payne ran for 129 yards and a touchdown, Nick Marshall passed for 171 yards and a score, and Auburn snapped a two-game skid with a victory over Samford.\n\nAuburn (8-3) used the game against an FCS opponent to tune up for next week's Iron Bowl showdown at No. 2 Alabama.\n\nThe Tigers, who upset Alabama last year before narrowly losing the national title game to Florida State, needed a morale boost after dropping from third to 14th in the College Football Playoff rankings with consecutive losses to Texas A&M and Georgia.\n\nSamford (7-4), coached by former Auburn quarterback and 1971 Heisman Trophy winner Pat Sullivan, had its four-game winning streak snapped.\n\nNo. 18 MARSHALL 23, UAB 18\n\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Defensive lineman Ra'shawde Myers recovered a fumble in the end zone for a go-ahead touchdown with 8:20 left, and Marshall stayed unbeaten by rallying past UAB.\n\nMarshall (11-0, 7-0 Conference USA) had its closest game yet and was held to its fewest points all season. Still, the Thundering Herd held off the Blazers (5-6, 3-4) in the final minute and took another step toward a possible New Year's Day bowl.\n\nUAB drove to the Marshall 10 with time running down, but Jermaine Holmes tackled Jordan Howard for a loss to end the threat and preserve the win.\n\nMarshall led 17-6 at halftime after Rakeem Cato's 28-yard touchdown pass to Tommy Shuler and a 43-yard scoring pass to Angelo Jean-Louis. UAB came back on TD runs of 1 and 10 yards by Howard to lead 18-17 in the fourth quarter. It was the first time all season that Marshall had trailed so late.\n\nNo. 19 MISSOURI 29, TENNESSEE 21\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Maty Mauk threw a pair of touchdown passes and Marcus Murphy ran for two scores as Missouri defeated Tennessee to maintain control of the SEC East race.\n\nThe Tigers (9-2, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) set a school record with their 10th straight road win.\n\nMissouri can clinch the East Division and earn a second straight trip to the SEC championship game by winning at home Friday over Arkansas. A loss would send No. 9 Georgia to Atlanta instead. Georgia is 10th and Missouri 20th in the College Football Playoff standings.\n\nAndrew Baggett's 43-yard field goal broke a 13-all tie midway through the third quarter. Mauk threw a 73-yard touchdown pass to Jimmie Hunt and a 13-yard scoring strike to Bud Sasser in the fourth quarter.\n\nTennessee (5-6, 2-5) must win next week at Vanderbilt to become bowl-eligible for the first time since 2010.\n\nMINNESOTA 28, No. 21 NEBRASKA 24\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Briean Boddy-Calhoun ripped the ball out of Nebraska receiver De'Mornay Pierson-El's hands at the Minnesota 2-yard line after Mitch Leidner scored the go-ahead touchdown, and the Golden Gophers overcame a 14-point halftime deficit to defeat Nebraska.\n\nThe Gophers (8-3, 5-2) can win the Big Ten West and go to the conference championship game on Dec. 6 with a victory at Wisconsin next week.\n\nThe Cornhuskers (8-3, 4-3), humiliated at Wisconsin a week ago, lost back-to-back conference games for the first time since 2009 and were eliminated from the West race.\n\nNebraska started its final possession with 3:25 to play and drove to the Minnesota 30. Pierson-El caught Tommy Armstrong's third-and-9 pass at the 2, but Boddy-Calhoun stripped him of the ball with 1:19 left.\n\nMinnesota ran out the clock and secured its first road win against a Top 25 opponent in 21 games since 2000. It also was the Gophers' second straight win over the Huskers and their first in Lincoln after seven straight losses since 1960.\n\nLeidner ran 22 times for a season-high 110 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nNo. 22 COLORADO STATE 58, NEW MEXICO 20\n\nFORT COLLINS, Colo.

Hart led the way against New Mexico (3-8, 1-6) by rushing for 230 yards and five TDs. He also hauled in a TD pass to tie Kapri Bibbs' school mark of six scores set last season against the Lobos.\n\nGarrett Grayson threw for 389 yards to become the school's all-time offensive leader. The senior threw two of his TD passes to Rashard Higgins, who was back after missing a game with a sore shoulder.\n\nNo. 23 OKLAHOMA 44, KANSAS 7\n\nNORMAN, Okla. (AP) — Oklahoma freshman Samaje Perine set a major college record by running for 427 yards in a driving rainstorm, scoring five touchdowns and leading the Sooners over Kansas.\n\nA week after Wisconsin's Melvin Gordon set the mark by rushing for 408 yards against Nebraska, Perine ran past him. He broke the 7-day-old record on his 34th and final carry, a 42-yard run with 12:16 left.\n\nPerine got off a fast start, running for a 49-yard TD on his first carry. He added TD runs of 33 and 34 yards in the second quarter and scored on runs of 66 and 27 yards in the third.\n\nIn a game that started 90 minutes late because of lightning, Perine shattered the school rushing record of 294 yards set by Greg Pruitt in 1971.\n\nThe Sooners (8-3, 5-3 Big 12) held Kansas to 103 yards to win their second straight.

Now, Alabama heads to No. 6 Auburn with the winner of the Iron Bowl facing No. 7 Georgia in the Southeastern Conference championship game in Atlanta.\n\nThe Bears (5-6) also lost to Auburn 24-10 early in the season, when the Tigers committed five turnovers.\n\nHurts led Alabama to touchdowns on each of his four possessions, completing all seven of his attempts and running for 30 yards.

(AP) — Oklahoma's Baker Mayfield threw for 257 yards and three touchdowns after getting dissed by the Kansas captains before kickoff.\n\nMayfield had tried shaking hands with Daniel Wise, Dorance Armstrong Jr. and Joe Dineen Jr. after the coin toss, but they stared stoically back at him. Mayfield quickly pulled his hand away, clapped a couple of times and set about burnishing his Heisman Trophy candidacy.\n\nHe threw TD passes to Rodney Anderson and Marquise Brown in the first half, then founded Mark Andrews late in the third quarter, which prompted more insults between Mayfield and the Jayhawks.\n\nAt one point, Mayfield lewdly grabbed his crotch while cursing across the field, and another time he yelled to fans behind his bench: \"You have one win! Go cheer on basketball!\"\n\nThe histrionics added at least some interest to a game that figured to be a blowout. The Sooners (10-1, 7-1) are fourth in the College Football Playoff ranking and clinched a spot in the revived Big 12 title game, while the Jayhawks (1-10, 0-8) have yet to beat a Football Bowl Subdivision foe.\n\nMayfield got most of the fourth quarter off as the defensive-minded Sooners won their 17th straight road game and 15th in a row in the Big 12, setting a league record.

Michel rambled for 87 yards and three scores of his own, most notably a 37-yard TD that sent the Bulldogs into the half with a 21-6 lead.\n\nGeorgia (10-1, 7-1 Southeastern Conference, No. 7 CFP) returned to form after getting stuffed on the ground in a 40-17 loss to Auburn, a dismal performance that knocked the Bulldogs out of the top spot they held for two weeks in the College Football Playoff standings.\n\nGeorgia finished with 381 yards rushing against the Wildcats (7-4, 4-4).\n\nNO. 8 OHIO STATE 52, ILLINOIS 14\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — No. 8 Ohio State scored on its first six possessions — including J.T. Barrett's 100th career touchdown pass — and the Buckeyes wrapped up the Big Ten East title.\n\nBarrett, playing in his last game at Ohio Stadium, threw for two touchdowns and ran for another score to help the Buckeyes (9-2, 7-1, CFP No. 9) dominate from the opening kick.\n\nBarrett became the Ohio State leader in rushing yards among quarterbacks (3,070), eclipsing Braxton Miller. He holds 35 Big Ten and school records.\n\nOhio State's defense limited the Illini (2-9, 0-9) to a season-low 105 yards in handing them a ninth straight loss. They didn't record a first down until near the end of the first half.\n\nBarrett was 11 for 19 for 141 yards, with backups Dwayne Haskins and Joe Burrow playing most of the second half.

The senior didn't even make the trip to Lubbock because of an unspecified injury.\n\nWhile Robinson was only 6-of-17 passing for 85 yards, his 12-yard TD to Jalen Reagor came late in the third quarter as the Horned Frogs (9-2, 6-2 Big 12, No. 12 CFP) took a 17-3 lead. The Red Raiders (5-6, 2-6) got their only score on their opening drive of the game.\n\nNO. 12 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 28, UCLA 23\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Sam Darnold passed for 264 yards and ran for a touchdown and Southern California persevered for its third consecutive victory over crosstown rival UCLA.\n\nRonald Jones II rushed for 111 yards and two touchdowns, and Michael Pittman Jr. returned a punt 72 yards for a touchdown on a spectacular trick play in the first quarter of the regular-season finale for the Pac-12 South champion Trojans (10-2, 8-1).\n\nJosh Rosen passed for 421 yards and hit Jordan Lasley for three touchdowns in the first — and probably only — collegiate meeting between Los Angeles' star quarterbacks.\n\nRosen found Lasley for a 27-yard score with 2:43 to play for UCLA (5-6, 3-5), but his 2-point conversion pass was too high for Lasley.\n\nUSC recovered an onside kick and ran out the clock with gutsy carries by Jones, setting off a celebration on the Coliseum field. USC retained the Victory Bell in the final home game for the Trojans' seniors — and possibly for their NFL-caliber underclassmen including Darnold and Jones.\n\nNO. 13 PENN STATE 56, NEBRASKA 44\n\nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa.

After Utah punted, Washington got the ball back with 29 seconds at its own 28. Washington QB Jake Browning hit Dante Pettis for 18 yards to near midfield, and then the big play was a 31-yard strike to Andre Baccellia to the Utah 22 with 8 seconds left.

Costello completed 17 of 26 passes for 185 yards and a touchdown, Ben Edwards made a key interception in the fourth quarter and Cameron Scarlett rushed for 49 yards on the final drive in place of Love to help the Cardinal (8-3, 7-2 Pac-12) milk the clock and win its eighth straight Big Game.\n\nStanford can earn a spot in the Pac-12 championship game against USC but needs some help.\n\nPatrick Laird ran for 153 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries while Ross Bowers passed for 182 yards and a touchdown for California (5-6, 2-6).\n\nNO. 21 LSU 30, TENNESSEE 10\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn.

The Tigers also began a touchdown drive after making a fourth-down stop at Tennessee's 21.\n\nTennessee (4-7, 0-7) was playing its first game under interim head coach Brady Hoke after the firing of Butch Jones. The Volunteers must beat Vanderbilt next week to avoid their first eight-loss season in school history.\n\nNO. 22 MICHIGAN STATE 17, MARYLAND 7\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — LJ Scott ran for 147 yards and a touchdown to lead Michigan State to a snowy victory over Maryland.\n\nThe Spartans (8-3, 6-2 Big Ten, No. 17 CFP) rushed for 271 yards, and that was about the only way they could move the ball in yet another Michigan State game affected by the elements. Quarterback Brian Lewerke was 2 of 14 for 20 yards, and one of his completions was a shovel pass late in the third quarter.\n\nMaryland (4-7, 2-6) wasn't much better through the air until the fourth quarter. Max Bortenschlager finished 13 of 25 for 121 yards.\n\nTEXAS 28, NO. 24 WEST VIRGINIA 14\n\nMORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) — Sam Ehlinger threw two touchdown passes and Texas became bowl eligible under first-year coach Tom Herman with victory over West Virginia.\n\nThe Longhorns (6-5, 5-3 Big 12) qualified for a bowl for the first time since 2014, which was former coach Charlie Strong's first season.\n\nTexas entered the game with 13 touchdown passes all season, and Ehlinger got two in the second quarter. His 50-yard pass to Reggie Hemphill set up Ehlinger's 4-yard TD toss to Kendall Moore.\n\nThe Mountaineers (7-4, 5-3) lost quarterback Will Grier to a broken finger on his throwing hand, He left the game in the first quarter after landing awkwardly as he dove for the end-zone pylon on a run.\n\nWAKE FOREST 30, NO. 25 N.C. STATE 24\n\nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) — John Wolford threw his third touchdown of the game to Tabari Hines with 8:03 remaining, and Wake Forest held on to upset North Carolina State.\n\nWolford finished 19 of 28 for 247 yards for the Demon Deacons (7-4, 4-3 Atlantic Coast Conference). They have won three of four and had their first regular-season victory over a Top 25 opponent since 2011.\n\nWolford hit Hines for scores covering 21 and 4 yards before they connected for the go-ahead 18-yarder.\n\nRyan Finley drove the Wolfpack (7-4, 5-2) inside the Wake Forest 20 in the final minutes and hit Emeka Emezie inside the 5. Emezie made a move on Ja'Sir Taylor but was hit by Demetrius Kemp and fumbled inside the 1. The ball squirted into the end zone and Kemp recovered it with 1:51 remaining for a touchback. The call stood after a brief review by the replay official.\n\nN.C. State got the ball back with 41 seconds left but Finley's deep throw to Harmon in the end zone was intercepted by Essang Bassey with a second left.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2019/11/30/saturdays-best/40733421/", "title": "Saturday's best", "text": "AP\n\nSTARS\n\n—J.K.

(AP) — Stetson Bennett grimaced when told the news.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves were knocked out of the Major League Baseball playoffs Saturday.\n\nAfter No. 1 Georgia romped to a 55-0 victory over Vanderbilt, the Bulldogs' veteran quarterback pointed to his favorite baseball team — the reigning World Series champions — as an example of how fleeting a title can be.\n\n“Are we gonna cash our chips in after so-and-so games, or are we gonna keep going, keep going, and know this isn't over until its over?” asked Bennett, whose team is seeking its second straight national championship.\n\nUnlike the Braves, the Bulldogs are still on track.\n\nBennett threw for 289 yards and two touchdowns — his first scoring passes in nearly a month — and Georgia stamped its return to the No. 1 ranking with a blowout of the lowly Commodores.\n\nGeorgia (7-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) led 28-0 at halftime and shook off three straight weeks of rather lackluster performances.\n\nThose games provided a valuable lesson in what it takes to repeat as a champion.\n\n“It's tough,” Bennett said. \"We are not King Kong standing atop the Empire State Building. We've gotta work and execute each week, go out there and expect a dog fight until it's not one.\"\n\nBennett was nearly perfect in the first half, completing 18 of 20 for 211 yards. Darnell Washington, the 6-foot-7 tight end who usually plays a supporting role to Brock Bowers, came up big with four catches for 78 yards, including a one-handed dazzler.\n\n“It's like throwing to the Pacific Ocean,” Bennett quipped.\n\nBennett hooked up with Kenny McIntosh on an 11-yard scoring play — the quarterback's first TD pass in four weeks — and followed with a 10-yard scoring toss to Dominick Blaylock.\n\n“It was good to get in the end zone,\" Bennett said. \"But it was better to score 55.\"\n\nMcIntosh added a 7-yard scoring run, while Daijun Edwards powered in from the 1 to spark a second-half exodus of red-clad Georgia fans looking to beat the traffic.\n\nCarson Beck took over for Bennett in the final quarter, throwing two more touchdown passes that merely added to Vandy's pain.\n\nThe Commodores (3-4, 0-3) dropped their 24th straight game in the SEC. They last won a conference game on Oct 19, 2019, beating Missouri 21-14.\n\nAt the halftime break, Georgia held a commanding 296-72 edge in total yards and 16-4 advantage in first downs.\n\n“A very frustrating afternoon,” coach Clark Lea said. “We were never able to get a drive going. For us, it's been this way all year It's just where we are. It's a recipe for disaster.”\n\nThe Bulldogs defense posted its second shutout of the season, limiting Vandy to just 45 yards rushing and 150 overall.\n\nGeorgia piled up 579 total yards.\n\nThe Bulldogs moved back to No. 1 in The Associated Press rankings this week, having spent a single week in the second spot behind Alabama.\n\nAfter starting the season with three dominant victories, which led some to speculate that this team was better than last season's national champions, the Bulldogs had a tougher time against Kent State, Missouri and Auburn.\n\nGeorgia returned to early season form in its homecoming game against the overmatched Commodores.\n\nThat was nothing new in this series. Georgia won 62-0 last year and has outscored Vandy 233-33 over the last four meetings.\n\nThe Commodores last scored a TD against Georgia in 2018. They have gone three full games since then without reaching the end zone.\n\nBECK IMPRESSES\n\nBeck usually gets in the game during garbage time, but there's every reason to believe he can step into the starting role next season.\n\nBeck completed 8 of 11 for 98 yards against the Commodores. For the season, the third-year backup is 23 of 30 for 276 yards, with four TDs and no interceptions.\n\n“He keeps getting better,” Bennett said “He's been in this offense the same amount of time I have. He knows it just as well as I do.\"\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nGeorgia certainly did nothing to endanger its No. 1 ranking, but the schedule looks a lot tougher the rest of the way. Three of the last five regular-season opponents are ranked in the Top 25.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nVanderbilt: Lea keeps talking optimistically about the improvement of his downtrodden program. He's apparently the only one who can see it. The Commodores went three-and-out on six of their 11 possessions and crossed midfield only two times. One drive ended with a fumble, the other a missed field goal.\n\nGeorgia: Sure, the blowout came against the SEC's worst program, but there wasn't much for coach Kirby Smart to complain about. All three phases of the game were highly efficient, especially an offense that got off to a much-needed quick start. “I was really impressed with the performance early,” Smart said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nVanderbilt: Hits the road again next Saturday to face Missouri, the last SEC team to lose to the Commodores.\n\nGeorgia: Heads into an off week that will give the Bulldogs extra time to prepare for their “Cocktail Party” game in Jacksonville against the Florida Gators on Oct. 29.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at https://twitter.com/pnewberry1963\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25.

Saturday's 49-3 win in the season opener against No. 12 Oregon saw last year's dominance continue, only reinforcing the widely held belief that Georgia will be one of the teams to beat in the race for the College Football Playoff.\n\nNew Oregon quarterback Bo Nix averaged just 4.7 yards per attempt and the Ducks' defense did just about nothing right under first-year head coach Dan Lanning, formerly Georgia's defensive coordinator.\n\nFacing off against Lanning's defense, the Bulldogs ripped off 5.3 yards per carry and scored four rushing touchdowns spread across four different players: running backs Kendall Milton and Kenny McIntosh, wide receiver Ladd McConkey and quarterback Stetson Bennett. McIntosh also led the Bulldogs with 117 receiving yards, nearly tripling his previous career high.\n\nBennett should appear on some early-season Heisman Trophy lists after completing 25 of 31 attempts for 368 yards and three total scores before exiting in the third quarter with the Bulldogs ahead 42-3.\n\nWEEK 1 OBSERVATIONS:Impressive starts for Oklahoma, Arkansas\n\nROUGH DEBUT:Kelly's first game with LSU is spectacular flameout\n\nSATURDAY RUNDOWN:Scores and details from all the Top 25 games\n\nFor the Ducks, getting bullied is less than an embarrassment than a sign of reality: Oregon is in the fourth tier of championship contenders, a couple thousand miles off from the top group of the Bulldogs, Alabama and Ohio State.\n\nWould it have been nice not to be run out of the building by the midpoint of the second quarter? Yeah, but Georgia's going to put more opponents than not into a blender and hit puree — Oregon's just the first of many to get this sort of treatment.\n\nThe Bulldogs and Ducks lead the list of college football's biggest winners and losers from the Week 1 of the 2022 season:\n\nWinners\n\nOhio State\n\nBogged down by No. 5 Notre Dame's defense, the No. 2 Buckeyes finally relied on the running game to key a strong second half and secure a very important 21-10 win. While the Irish were able to keep quarterback C.J. Stroud in check — he averaged a career-low 6.6 yards per attempt — running backs Miyan Williams and TreVeyon Henderson took over, combining for 175 yards and a score to avoid the upset. While the Buckeyes' offense will search for some answers, the defense delivered behind new coordinator Jim Knowles. In his first game since coming over from Oklahoma State, Knowles' unit gave up just 253 yards overall and 2.5 yards per carry.\n\nArkansas\n\nThe No. 23 Razorbacks justified the preseason ranking and made a case for second place in the early SEC West projections by handing No. 22 Cincinnati its first regular-season loss since Dec. 7, 2019. While Arkansas never trailed in the 31-24 win, the Bearcats did overcome a 14-0 halftime deficit and a 21-7 hole in the second half to draw within as few as four points, 21-17, in the third quarter. Arkansas quarterback KJ Jefferson threw for 223 yards, ran for 59 yards and had four touchdowns; if he keeps this up, the biggest secret in the SEC won't stay under wraps for long.\n\nHouston\n\nDown 21-7 heading into the fourth, No. 25 Houston surged back to take a 24-21 lead on upset-minded Texas-San Antonio before the Roadrunners forced overtime with a 37-yard field goal with no time in regulation. After the two teams traded field goals and touchdowns in the first two extra frames, Houston quarterback Clayton Tune converted the two-point attempt in the third overtime to lift the Cougars to a 37-35 win. While a closer shave than expected, the win keeps UH on track to become this year's Cincinnati — a Group of Five team that makes a run at an undefeated regular season and a place in the top four of the final playoff rankings.\n\nOklahoma\n\nThe Brent Venables era kicked off with a 45-13 win against overmatched Texas-El Paso that doubled as the debut for former Central Florida quarterback Dillon Gabriel, who hit on 15 of 23 throws for 233 yards and three combined scores. Defensively, the No. 9 Sooners held the Miners to just 3.8 yards per play and 28 rushing yards, the fewest Oklahoma has allowed in a game since giving up 25 yards to Baylor in 2020.\n\nSouthern California\n\nMeanwhile, former Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley's debut went almost perfectly: USC beat Rice 66-19 behind big efforts from former OU quarterback Caleb Williams, who hit on all but three of his 22 attempts for 249 yards, and former Pittsburgh wide receiver Jordan Addison, who had two touchdown grabs. Williams added a team-leading 68 rushing yards and showed a grasp of Riley's system that could lift the Trojans and their rebuilt roster to the top of the conference.\n\nFlorida\n\nAnd for good measure, one last first-year head coach hit the ground running in a major way: Florida's Billy Napier led the Gators to a 29-26 upset of No. 8 Utah behind a Heisman-level show from quarterback Anthony Richardson — 168 yards passing, 104 rushing and three scores — and a bend-but-don't-break defense that gave up 446 yards of offense but delivered the game-clinching interception with less than a minute left. If you're doing the math at home: Utah, the preseason favorite in the Pac-12 and a playoff contender, lost to a team picked to finish fourth in the SEC East. Fourth! In the weaker of the league's two divisions!\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nUNC scored 34 straight points in the second and third quarters to take a 41-21 lead on Appalachian State, and then things went crazy. The two teams combined for 62 points in the fourth, one off the FBS record of 63 points in one quarter, with the Tar Heels only surviving after stopping the Mountaineers' two-point attempt with nine seconds left to win 63-61. There's plenty to worry about over the state of the Tar Heels' defense but reason for optimism at quarterback: Drake Maye went for 352 yards and five total scores, giving Sam Howell's replacement nine touchdowns without an interception through two weeks.\n\nJ.J. McCarthy\n\nJim Harbaugh announced a unique plan for his quarterbacks heading into No. 6 Michigan's season opener: Cade McNamara, the incumbent starter, would get the nod on Saturday against Colorado State, while J.J. McCarthy would draw the starting assignment next week against Hawaii. While McNamara threw for 136 yards and a score in the Wolverines' easy 51-7 win against the Rams, McCarthy managed to steal the show by completing all four of his attempts for 30 yards with another 50 yards on the ground, including a 20-yard touchdown run. Will Harbaugh give McNamara snaps next week?\n\nJames Madison\n\nJMU made its debut as a member of the FBS with an easy 44-7 romp of Middle Tennessee State, foreshadowing the Dukes' potential to win way more games than most expect as members of the Sun Belt. One thing that stood out was the Dukes' play at the line of scrimmage: MTSU managed just 12 rushing yards on 28 carries but gave up 261 rushing yards. JMU quarterback Todd Centeio had 397 yards of total offense, 110 coming on the ground, and tossed six touchdowns.\n\nLosers\n\nNotre Dame\n\nThe energy and defensive game plan were there. The offense was not. What they need is more on the ground to help quarterback Tyler Buchner, who averaged 9.8 yards per throw and had three completions of at least 30 yards. But if OSU really is one of the top three teams in the country, shouldn't the Irish stay inside the top five? Down the road, hanging tight with the Buckeyes could factor into how the playoff field is decided. Whether the Irish are in the top four depends on what happens from here: Notre Dame now needs to run the table to have a good shot.\n\nOregon\n\nNot even sniffing Georgia doesn't say too much about Oregon's odds of winning the Pac-12, since the Ducks won't run into any team even remotely resembling the Bulldogs in the nation's weakest Power Five league. Getting run out of the building by Georgia is going to leave a mark, though, and could color a season-long national perception of Oregon and, to a lesser extent, the Pac-12 at large. (The perception of that league already stinks.)\n\nThe Pac-12\n\nIt took one week to reinforce how the Pac-12 is a nonfactor. Oregon was walloped. Preseason favorite Utah couldn't get past Florida. With both preseason frontrunners already holding a loss, who will carry the flag for the conference? USC? UCLA, which beat Bowling Green? Arizona? The Wildcats pulled off one of the shocking results of the day by beating San Diego State 38-20. Oregon State, Stanford, Washington? Just like with Georgia, it's a new year and the same story for the Pac-12.\n\nEast Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina State was lucky to escape with a 21-20 win against the upset-minded Pirates. Beyond playing the Wolfpack to a draw at the line of scrimmage and keeping N.C. State quarterback Devin Leary under wraps, ECU kicker Owen Daffer missed an extra point try that would've knotted the game at 21-21 with three minutes left and then pushed wide the potential game-winning field goal wide right in the final seconds.\n\nBoston College\n\nUp 21-12 late in the third quarter and 21-15 midway through the fourth, Boston College allowed Rutgers to march 92 yards across 12 plays and notch the go-ahead score with three minutes left in a 22-21 loss. With at least four games to come against ranked opponents, the loss deals a major blow to the Eagles' path back to bowl eligibility under third-year coach Jeff Hafley; the program has won at least six games but not more than seven in eight of the past nine seasons, illustrating the small room for error.\n\nIowa's offense\n\nThere's one easy path to seven points: the touchdown. Another way to seven, as Iowa showed against South Dakota State: one field goal (three), one safety (five) and then another safety (seven). Of course, Iowa still won 7-3. Only the Hawkeyes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2022/11/26/ohio-state-michigan-clemson-college-football-week-13-winners-losers/10780252002/", "title": "Ohio State, Michigan, Clemson top college football Week 13 winners ...", "text": "No. 3 Michigan pounded away at No. 2 Ohio State until the Buckeyes crumbled.\n\nFor the second straight season, the rivalry game painted the Wolverines as the tougher, stronger, better coached and more consistent team and program — and if once could be pitched as a fluke, two blowouts in a row strongly suggests a trend has developed.\n\nAhead 31-23 midway through the fourth quarter, Michigan scored on a 75-yard touchdown run by Donovan Edwards, who ran for a career-best 216 yards. After intercepting Ohio State quarterback C.J. Stroud, the Wolverines added an 85-yard run by Edwards to win 45-23.\n\nFor Michigan, another win in this series and the high possibility of another conference championship and College Football Playoff berth means it's time to redraw the Big Ten power structure. Until proven otherwise, the Wolverines are the league's best.\n\nFor the first time in decades, the Buckeyes and everyone else in the Big Ten is chasing Michigan. Eight seasons into his tenure and just two years after facing a very uncertain future at his alma mater, Jim Harbaugh has delivered on the lofty expectations placed onto the program upon his arrival in 2015.\n\nROLE REVERSAL:Harbaugh owns the Big Ten after Michigan transformation\n\nBIG BONUS:Michigan's Harbaugh earns payday of $500,000 for Ohio State win\n\nTIGERS FALL:Clemson's payoff hopes end with surprise loss to South Carolina\n\nAnd for Ohio State, this loss opens up serious doubts about the program's place in the broader Bowl Subdivision. While the Wolverines spent most of this season under scrutiny for feasting on an unimpressive schedule, the Buckeyes escaped that spotlight and were celebrated as the team most capable of beating Georgia.\n\nThe final score matters for the Buckeyes, which might've pitched the playoff selection committee on making the semifinals with one competitive loss. The 22-point defeat ends those postseason hopes and opens up a series of questions about the state of the program, the play of both lines and, maybe most of all, whether coach Ryan Day has what it takes to wrestle back control of this rivalry.\n\nIf not, pencil in more of the same from the Buckeyes until Michigan says otherwise. With the victory, the Wolverines paint themselves as the top-ranked Bulldogs' biggest threat and top the list of winners and losers from rivalry weekend:\n\nWinners\n\nSouthern California\n\nThe Trojans were not supposed to be this good, this soon — the thought that this team would be a win away from the playoff entering the Pac-12 championship game would've been laughed away in August, September and even early October. What's behind this smashing debut for coach Lincoln Riley? Don't look much farther than Caleb Williams, who continued one of the top runs by a quarterback in Pac-12 history and probably locked down the Heisman Trophy with 267 yards total offense and four touchdowns as No. 5 USC beat No. 15 Notre Dame 38-27. Instead of being tested physically by the Fighting Irish, the Trojans got into an early rhythm and controlled the pace of play with a balanced offense — 232 yards passing, 204 running — and some terrific work on third down. And as always, USC won the turnover battle. The Trojans were plus-two against Notre Dame and now a ridiculous plus-22 on the season.\n\nJ.J. McCarthy\n\nEdwards delivered Michigan's knockout blow, but not until McCarthy loosened up the Ohio State defense. In the face of heavy criticism after a dreadful game last weekend against Illinois, the sophomore threw for 278 yards and three scores on 11.1 yards per attempt, delivering multiple explosive plays and avoiding any costly turnovers as the Wolverines racked up 530 yards of offense. McCarthy had three completions of 45 or more yards, including two long touchdowns to Cornelius Johnson, and ran for a touchdown to give Michigan a 31-20 lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nTCU\n\nAfter a regular season full of close calls and razor-thin wins, No. 4 TCU was able to stretch out and relax in a 62-14 win against Iowa State that concludes a perfect run into the Big 12 championship game. How rare is a 48-point win? That gap matches the combined margin of victory from the Horned Frogs' past seven wins. Up next is No. 13 Kansas State and the possibility of locking down a playoff berth, though the odds have risen dramatically that TCU could lose that game and still reach the semifinals.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nRanked among the middling also-rans of the SEC as recently as two weeks ago, South Carolina has spent the last seven days as the Bowl Subdivision's ultimate giant slayer. Last weekend, the Gamecocks poured 63 points on No. 11 Tennessee to knock the Volunteers out of the playoff. And against No. 8 Clemson, they climbed out of a 14-0 disadvantage in the first quarter and three different nine-point deficits — at 16-7, 23-14 and 30-21 — to beat the Tigers 31-30 and earn the program's first win in this series since 2013. This is how you win rivalry week: not just by beating your hated rival but by destroying your rival's season.\n\nKansas State\n\nRunning away from Kansas for a 47-27 win in this unpredictably meaningful rivalry sends Kansas State to the Big 12 championship game for the first time since 2003 — there was no such game when the Wildcats won the Big 12 in 2012 — and essentially locks down a spot in the New Year's Six. That's because the Wildcats will either beat TCU and earn the league's bid as the conference winner or lose to TCU and still land the league's automatic spot in the Sugar Bowl by virtue of the Horned Frogs reaching the playoff. No matter how you cut it, this has been the program's best year in a decade and a sign of the Wildcats' ultimate potential under coach Chris Klieman.\n\nCentral Florida\n\nRivalry games are unpredictable. Case in point: UCF needed a miraculous touchdown grab by tight end Alec Holler with 20 seconds left to beat South Florida 46-39. The Knights had to win to earn a spot in the American Athletic championship game; the Bulls were playing out the string in a one-win that had already cost third-year coach Jeff Scott his job. By escaping the USF upset attempt, the Knights earn bragging rights and a second game in a month against Tulane, with the winner heading to the New Year's Six.\n\nOther rivalry winners\n\nIf not at the same level as Ohio State and Michigan nor with the same national impact as Clemson and South Carolina, Saturday's slate included a run of meaningful rivalry games beginning with No. 1 Georgia's 37-13 win against Georgia Tech. And there's more. Take a deep breath ... Kentucky beat Louisville 26-13, No. 7 Alabama rolled Auburn 49-27 in the Iron Bowl, Minnesota defeated Wisconsin 23-16 to tie the all-time series at 62-62-8, Purdue topped Indiana 30-16 to win the Old Oaken Bucket and the Big Ten West, No. 10 Penn State got past Michigan State 35-16 to maybe book a New Year's Six bowl, UNLV held off Nevada 27-22 and No. 25 Texas-San Antonio sneaked in a late field goal to beat Texas-El Paso 34-31.\n\nNebraska\n\nThe program's most successful 24-hour stretch in years began with a win Friday afternoon against rival Iowa, snapping a seven-game losing streak in the series, and continued with Saturday morning's official hiring of former Temple and Baylor coach Matt Rhule. Since being fired by the Carolina Panthers in early October, Rhule had been the top coach on the open market and a contender for several current and projected FBS openings. The hire gives Nebraska a proven rebuilder with the recruiting connections and overall blueprint to bring the program back to respectability.\n\nLosers\n\nLSU\n\nWith a win against Texas A&M, the No. 6 Tigers would've entered the SEC championship game with a clear road to the playoff: win against the Bulldogs, go to the semifinals. But that equation changes after the 38-23 loss, which makes it difficult to see any realistic scenario where the committee can sell a three-loss team ahead of multiple one-loss or two-loss candidates from the Power Five. While the defeat doesn't change the sense of accomplishment in Brian Kelly's debut — this team did win the SEC West, after all — there is a sense of a missed opportunity. Luckily, similar opportunities almost certainly await LSU in the next few years.\n\nClemson\n\nA bad day for Clemson doubles as a bad day for the ACC, which has been eliminated from playoff contention with the Tigers' second loss. What was on display against South Carolina has been lurking for most of this season, including ineffectiveness at wide receiver, unpredictability at quarterback and an unstoppable rash of turnovers. Another three giveaways against the Gamecocks gave the Tigers 15 in the past five games, compared to just five in the year's first seven. Worse yet was the play on defense: Clemson gave up 414 yards of offense, 360 through the air to Spencer Rattler. The only quarterbacks to throw for more yards on Clemson in the past decade are Justin Fields in 2020 (385 yards), Joe Burrow in 2019 (463), former South Carolina quarterback Jake Bentley (510) in 2018, Jameis Winston in 2013 (444), former North Carolina State quarterback Mike Glennon in 2012 (493) and former Florida State quarterback E.J. Manuel in 2012 (380).\n\nOregon\n\nGiven the chance to get back on the playoff map against No. 22 Oregon State, the No. 9 Ducks blew a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter and lost 38-34 in what ranks easily among the most painful losses in program history. Oregon outgained the Beavers by 142 yards, were plus-three in turnovers, held the ball for nearly 35 minutes but were guilty of legendarily bad game management: OSU had fourth-quarter touchdown drives spanning 36, 2 and 28 yards thanks to the Ducks' failures on special teams and two unsuccessful fourth-down tries deep in their own territory. Those baffling decisions to not punt the ball away will leave a stink on coach Dan Lanning well into the offseason.\n\nMiami (Fla.)\n\nThe Hurricanes' season ended with a disaster worthy of Mario Cristobal's disastrous debut: Pittsburgh ran for 237 yards on 7.2 per carry, forced three turnovers and led 28-0 at halftime in a 42-16 romp. That drops Miami to 5-7 and out of bowl play for reasons unrelated to NCAA probation for the first time since 2007, and brings up a number of concerns about the state of the program and whether next season will yield a drastically different result. In Cristobal's defense, he's been given the job security to carefully build the Hurricanes back into an ACC contender; his track record as a head coach also says this year is an aberration. But he and Miami will be under pressure to deliver in 2023.\n\nOther big disappointments\n\nMercifully, the regular season is over for some of college football's biggest disappointments. That includes Michigan State, which will fall short of bowl eligibility after competing for the Big Ten crown in 2021, and Wisconsin, which tried to jumpstart a new era under interim coach Jim Leonard but sputtered into a six-win finish. Also of note: Oklahoma State was crippled by injuries and fell from 5-0 to 7-5, Iowa State finished with a losing record for the first time since 2016 and Arkansas went 6-6 after beginning the year ranked No. 22 in the USA TODAY Sports AFCA Coaches Poll. And you can't discuss this year's disappointments without mentioning Texas A&M, which despite the win against LSU ranks among the biggest flops in recent Power Five history.\n\nLiberty\n\nAfter popping onto the national radar with an 8-1 start and wins against Brigham Young and Arkansas, the Flames will limp into the postseason with losses to Connecticut, Virginia Tech and New Mexico State. Facing off against the Aggies, Liberty fell down 28-7 at halftime and eventually gave up 214 rushing yards in a 49-14 loss. And it gets worse: Hugh Freeze is expected to become the next coach at Auburn, ending an extremely successful run that included at least eight wins in each of his four years.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/11/23/ga-tech-looks-to-mess-up-no-5-georgias-postseason-plans/38590669/", "title": "Ga Tech looks to mess up No. 5 Georgia's postseason plans", "text": "AP\n\nATLANTA (AP) — Georgia has a looming showdown against the nation's top-ranked team, a game that seems destined to determine if the No. 5 Bulldogs get another shot at the College Football Playoff.\n\nGeorgia Tech would love nothing more than to mess up those plans.\n\nThe state rivals close out the regular season Saturday between the hedges, where Georgia (10-1) is a 17-point favorite to clear its final hurdle before the Dec. 1 Southeastern Conference championship game against No. 1 Alabama.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets (7-4) are sure playing up their role as underdog, even though they are in the midst of a four-game winning streak . With an ample amount of awe in his voice, coach Paul Johnson pointed to Georgia's 701-yard outburst last week in a 66-27 rout of UMass .\n\n\"I'm not sure we could do that to our scout team,\" Johnson said. \"They looked unstoppable. Maybe they'll let us play with 12 on defense.\"\n\nWhile it might be easy to look ahead, the Bulldogs insist their focus is firmly on this game.\n\n\"The other team calls themselves a Georgia team as well,\" receiver Terry Godwin said. \"We've just got to let them know who the real Georgia team is around here.\"\n\nGeorgia is also driven by the memory of what happened in the Yellow Jackets' last two appearances at Sanford Stadium.\n\nIn 2014, the Yellow Jackets prevailed 30-24 after tying the game with a 53-yard field goal on the final play of regulation and preserving the victory with an overtime interception near the goal line. In 2016, the Bulldogs squandered a 13-point lead in the fourth quarter and lost 28-27 .\n\nBoth times, Georgia Tech's players celebrated by gleefully snapping off branches of the famed hedges that surround the field.\n\n\"I definitely don't want them to win here ever again — especially while I'm here,\" Georgia tight end Isaac Nauta said. \"I'm excited to attack this one and make sure those hedges don't get touched.\"\n\nSome things to watch for when Georgia hosts Georgia Tech in the \"Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate\" rivalry:\n\nSWIFT'S EMERGENCE\n\nGeorgia's running game has gotten a huge boost from sophomore D'Andre Swift.\n\nPlagued by injuries much of the season, Swift finally got healthy and ripped off three straight 100-yard games to help Georgia clinch the SEC East title — including a career-best, 186-yard performance against Auburn two weeks ago . He was able to rest up a bit last week, playing sparingly against UMass.\n\nSwift gives the Bulldogs a solid 1-2 punch out of the backfield. He leads the team with 857 yards rushing, averaging 6.9 yards per carry, while Elijah Holyfield has 817 yards and a 6.6-yard average.\n\nBALANCED RECEIVING CORPS\n\nNo Georgia receiver has eye-popping numbers, but the Bulldogs have plenty of potential targets for quarterback Jake Fromm and his backup, touted freshman Justin Fields, who has played in all but one game.\n\nRiley Ridley leads with 32 receptions, Mercole Hardman has 31 and Nauta is a frequent target with 21 catches. Godwin (15 receptions) has overcome injuries to give the Bulldogs another weapon in the passing game.\n\nIn all, Georgia has six players with double-figure receptions and 12 more players with at least one catch.\n\n\"You don't have to have a guy,\" coach Kirby Smart said. \"You can do it by committee.\"\n\nTECH'S QUARTERBACK DUO\n\nThe Yellow Jackets have two capable quarterbacks to run the triple-option — \"run\" being the operative word.\n\nSenior TaQuon Marshall paces the Yellow Jackets in rushing with 857 yards while scoring 11 touchdowns, while redshirt freshman Tobias Oliver has come off the bench to run for 808 yards and lead the team with 12 touchdowns.\n\nNeither has much of an arm, and the Yellow Jackets have largely abandoned the passing game during their current winning streak. But that part of the offense can't be totally ignored; Georgia Tech has averaged nearly 36 yards on its six completions in that span.\n\nHOME FIELD DISADVANTAGE\n\nGeorgia Tech has won five of its last 10 games at Sanford Stadium.\n\nConversely, Georgia hasn't lost to its state rival in Atlanta since 1999. Last season, the Bulldogs romped to a 38-7 victory at Bobby Dodd Stadium.\n\nACCURATE KICKERS\n\nBoth teams feature extremely accurate kickers.\n\nRicardo Blankenship has been a huge weapon for Georgia over the last two seasons, connecting on 38 of 43 field-goal attempts and all 115 extra points.\n\nGeorgia Tech has gotten a boost from walk-on freshman Wesley Wells, who only took over the job heading into the fifth game of the season after two other kickers flopped. He is 8 for 8 on field goals and perfect on 35 extra-point attempts. Last week, he made four field goals against Virginia , including a career-best 48-yarder and a game-winning 40-yarder in overtime.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

(AP) — Amari Cooper tied his own school record with 224 yards receiving and caught three touchdown passes in No. 2 Alabama's 55-44 comeback victory over No. 15 Auburn on Saturday night in the highest-scoring Iron Bowl.\n\nQuarterback Blake Sims and the Crimson Tide (11-1, 7-1 Southeastern Conference) turned to the Heisman Trophy contender for touchdown strikes of 39 and 75 yards in the third quarter.\n\nAlabama had already clinched a spot in the SEC championship game against No. 17 Missouri, and the top team in the College Football Playoff rankings scored 28 consecutive points heading into the final seconds.\n\nAuburn (8-4, 4-4) surged ahead 36-27 before losing its third straight SEC game in a season that once also carried playoff hopes.\n\nSims passed for 312 yards and four touchdowns but was threw three interceptions.

(AP) — Dalvin Cook ran for a career-high 144 yards and Florida State survived Jameis Winston's struggles to beat Florida in Will Muschamp's final game as the Gators' coach.\n\nThe defending national champion Seminoles have won 28 games in a row, and completed consecutive undefeated regular seasons for the first time in school history. Florida State is the 16th team to accomplish the feat since 1950.\n\nThe Seminoles (12-0, No. 3 CFP) will face Georgia Tech in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game Dec. 6.\n\nWinston threw a career-high four interceptions, including three in the first quarter.

(AP) — Jaylen Walton had a 91-yard touchdown run and running back Jordan Wilkins threw a 31-yard scoring pass to lead Mississippi past Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl.\n\nBo Wallace threw for 296 yards despite completing just 13 of 30 passes.\n\nOle Miss (9-3, 5-3 Southeastern Conference) led 7-3 at halftime before its offense got going in the second half. It's the 10th time in 11 seasons the home team has won the Egg Bowl.\n\nWilkins' touchdown pass to Cody Core — with 9:14 remaining — came on the second throw of his career after a pitch from Wallace, pushing the Rebels ahead by two touchdowns.\n\nThe loss by Mississippi State (10-2, 6-2, No. 4 CFP) gave Alabama the SEC Western Division title. Dak Prescott threw for 282 yards and a touchdown.\n\nIt's the first time both teams came into the Egg Bowl ranked since 1999.\n\nNO. 5 BAYLOR 48, TEXAS TECH 46\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Bryce Petty threw for 210 yards and two touchdowns before getting knocked out of the game with a concussion and playoff hopeful Baylor held off Texas Tech.\n\nShock Linwood ran for 158 yards and two touchdowns for the Bears (10-1, 7-1 Big 12, No. 7 CFP), who are guaranteed at least a share of their second consecutive conference title if they win at home over No. 11 Kansas State next Saturday.\n\nThe Bears are also hoping for a much bigger prize, but the close game against Texas Tech (4-8, 2-7) likely won't help in that quest. They were already two playoff ranking spots behind Big 12 co-leader TCU, which is coming off an impressive 48-10 Thanksgiving night romp at Texas.\n\nTexas Tech's Patrick Mahomes set a Big 12 freshman record with his 598 yards passing that included six touchdowns, the last with 1:42 left before getting sacked on a two-point try.\n\nNO. 7 OHIO STATE 42, MICHIGAN 28\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ezekiel Elliott scored untouched on a 44-yard run on fourth-and-1 with 4:58 left to help Ohio State, without injured star quarterback J.T. Barrett, beat Michigan.\n\nWith no postseason, the only thing left to be decided for Michigan (5-7, 3-5 Big Ten) is the future of coach Brady Hoke. Interim athletic director Jim Hackett will make the call on whether the coach stays or goes.\n\nBarrett threw for a score and ran for two before his right leg crumpled underneath him when he was tackled on a run on the first play of the fourth quarter. He broke his right ankle and will have surgery Sunday.\n\nCardale Jones came in for the Buckeyes (11-1, 8-0, CFP No. 6) to lead the drive that culminated in Elliott's long run. Darron Lee returned a fumble 33 yards late to add to the lead.\n\nOhio State will face Wisconsin in the Big Ten title game.\n\nHoke's job status has been in question as the Wolverines have sagged since his 11-2 start at Michigan in 2011. The Wolverines have gone 8-5, 7-6 and 5-7 to give him a 31-20 record.\n\nBefore the game, walk-on defensive lineman Kosta Karageorge, who has been missing since earlier in the week, was recognized along with 23 other Buckeyes scheduled to appear at their final game in Ohio Stadium. A police poster showing Karageorge, with the word MISSING stamped across it in vivid color, was shown on the large video board at the south end of the field.\n\nNO. 10 MICHIGAN STATE 34, PENN STATE 10\n\nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa.

The Spartans have four of their six 10-plus win seasons in school history under Dantonio.\n\nShelton doused the enthusiasm of the emotional senior day festivities at Beaver Stadium when he used all of 14 seconds to dart through defenders for the score.\n\nFrom there, the Spartans never really dazzled against the Nittany Lions (6-6, 2-6). Connor Cook threw a 10-yard TD pass and Langford chipped in with a 3-yard score in the third quarter to methodically put it away.\n\nNO. 11 KANSAS STATE 51, KANSAS 13\n\nMANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) — Jake Waters threw for 294 yards and four touchdowns, two of them to record-setting wide receiver Tyler Lockett, and Kansas State routed Kansas to move into a tie atop the Big 12 standings.\n\nLockett caught nine passes for 119 yards, passing father Kevin Lockett for the school record in career catches and matching his mark for touchdown receptions. Lockett has 222 catches and 26 TD grabs heading into next week's showdown at fifth-ranked Baylor.\n\nKansas State (9-2, No. 12 CFP) moved into a tie with TCU and Baylor at 7-1 in the conference.\n\nCurry Sexton added nine catches for 141 yards and a score, and Waters and Charles Jones each had touchdown runs as the Wildcats beat the Jayhawks (3-9, 1-8) for the sixth straight time.\n\nNO. 14 WISCONSIN 34, NO. 22 MINNESOTA 24\n\nMADISON, Wis.

Stave's 17-yard touchdown pass to Robert Wheelwright with 4:41 left gave the Badgers (10-2, 7-1, CFP No. 14) a 10-point lead.\n\nIt was not easy. Physical Minnesota (8-4, 5-3) let a 17-3 lead early in the second quarter slip away. David Cobb ran for 118 yards on 25 carries, including a 40-yard score.\n\nNO. 16 GEORGIA TECH 30, NO. 8 GEORGIA 24, OT\n\nATHENS, Ga. (AP) — Harrison Butker kicked a career-long 53-yard field goal on the final play of regulation, and D.J. White picked off a pass in overtime to preserve Georgia Tech's victory over Georgia.\n\nGeorgia Tech (10-2, CFP No. 16) trailed 24-21 after Hutson Mason threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Malcolm Mitchell on fourth down with 18 seconds left. But the Yellow Jackets wound up with good field position after a squib kickoff, Justin Thomas scrambled 21 yards into field goal range, and Butker's kick barely cleared the crossbar.\n\nZach Laskey put Georgia Tech ahead with his third touchdown run of the game in overtime, but Butker's extra point was blocked. The Bulldogs (9-3, CFP No. 9) had a chance to win it as they faced second-and-goal at the 9.\n\nMason again tried to hit Mitchell on a quick slant. This time, White stepped in to make the interception, ending a game that featured a bit of everything.\n\nNO. 23 CLEMSON 35, SOUTH CAROLINA 17\n\nCLEMSON, S.C. (AP) — Artavis Scott had two long touchdown catches, Wayne Gallman ran for 191 yards and Clemson ended a five-game losing streak to rival South Carolina.\n\nThe Tigers (9-3) hadn't beaten the Gamecocks (6-6) since 2008, an unprecedented run of failure that overshadowed their 32-8 record the past three seasons. This time, Clemson showed off a perked up offense bolstered by the return of freshman starter Deshaun Watson at quarterback.\n\nWatson threw two inside flip passes that Scott turned into touchdowns of 53 and 70 yards. The second one gave the Tigers a 28-10 lead that South Carolina couldn't overcome.\n\nWatson finished 14 of 19 for 269 yards and two rushing TDs in first significant action since defeating North Carolina State on Oct. 4. Scott had seven catches for 185 yards.\n\nNO. 24 LOUISVILLE 44, KENTUCKY 40\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Brandon Radcliff ran 4 yards for a touchdown with 2:47 remaining and safety Gerod Holliman had an NCAA record-tying 14th interception with 35 seconds left, helping Louisville beat Kentucky.\n\nNo lead was safe in a back-and-forth game between rivals that got physical before kickoff. Louisville coach Bobby Petrino grabbed the jacket of Wildcats assistant Daniel Berezowitz during one pregame scuffle.\n\nThe game was equally as charged. There were four fourth-quarter lead changes alone. The Cardinals (9-3) ultimately got the last word by driving 81 yards for the winning score that capped their fourth and final comeback against the Wildcats (5-7).\n\nKentucky's last possession ended with Holliman picking off Patrick Towles and returning it 65 yards to the 2 before Louisville ran out the clock and sparked a celebration.\n\nNo. 25 BOISE STATE 50, UTAH STATE 19\n\nBOISE, Idaho (AP) — Jay Ajayi ran for a career-high 229 yards and five touchdowns, and Boise State rolled past Utah State and secured a spot in the Mountain West title game.\n\nThe Broncos (10-2, 7-1), who kept alive their hopes of playing in a New Year's Day bowl game, won their 13th straight home game. They will host Fresno State for the conference championship on Saturday.\n\nUtah State (9-4, 6-2) dropped its first November road game since 2009 and failed to return to the conference title game after representing the Mountain Division last year.\n\nWith the division title on the line in a game that boasted the Mountain West's top offense in Boise State and top defense in Utah State, the matchup was decisively one-sided.\n\nBoise State racked up 498 total yards and scored touchdowns on its first five possessions against the nation's fifth-best scoring defense.\n\nAjayi, who eclipsed 100 yards rushing for the seventh consecutive game, ran for the most yards of any single runner this season against the Aggies' 17th-ranked run defense.\n\nBoise State's Grant Hedrick turned in an 18-of-24 passing performance for 191 yards and two touchdowns.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/30"}]}

I’m very much looking forward to it,” he added, during a recent interview in The Club at the Cultural Center at 205 S. Main St., where he’ll headline a music show Saturday, Aug. 7.\n\nAmong the more recognizable TV series in which Bowe has played minor but regular roles were \"Murphy Brown,\" \"China Beach\" and \"The West Wing.\"\n\nHe played a Portuguese cook in the latter series.\n\nMore:'The West Wing' cast reunites on HBO Max in sweet, emotional special to get out the vote\n\nTyler Bowe's Fall River roots\n\nBorn Tyler V. Botelho on the Azorean island of Sao Miguel, Bowe, 62, said he knew as a young boy that he was destined to lead a life that would incorporate some level of creativity and entertainment.\n\nHis late mother worked two jobs as she put herself through college, earning a master’s degree from Brown University to become a teacher, while his late father worked as a head machine mechanic at the former Anderson-Little clothing manufacturer.\n\nLike her mother, Bowe’s sister, who is now retired, became a school teacher.\n\n“I was the black sheep of the family,” he laughed. “I wanted to go to Hollywood.”\n\nMore:Celebrity sightings in Spindle City\n\nBowe said when he was 12 and working as a delivery boy for the former Rego’s Market on Bedford Street, he saved his $3 weekly salary to buy an 8mm film camera, projector and screen.\n\n“I made at least 20 movies with kids in the neighborhood,” he said, including one that he says featured a harrowing death scene on the roof of the Anderson-Little building.\n\nBowe notes that when he was a child he had five uncles who were all professional photographers.\n\n“I grew up with it. Even in the Azores, I had my own darkroom,” he said.\n\nAfter arriving in Fall River in 1968, Bowe says he spent a total of three months learning English at the Espirito Santo School, a private Catholic school.\n\nBut it wasn’t long before he was writing song lyrics in class, an obsessive habit that got him into trouble during his sophomore year at Bishop Connolly High School.\n\nOne day, after having been repeatedly warned by teachers and the principal to pay attention in class, Bowe said he asked his biology teacher about a galactic reference in a Deep Purple song called “Space Truckin’.”\n\n“Brother Leo told me to get out and go to the office,” he said.\n\nBowe says his parents got the bad news that he was being expelled, which led to his attending B.M.C. Durfee High School for the rest of the year.\n\nBut Bowe said he didn’t like the atmosphere at Durfee and dropped out at the end of the semester.\n\n“I hated it. It was too rough,” he said. “It wasn’t for me.”\n\nBowe said his mother urged him to earn a GED equivalency degree at Bristol Community College, which he did. He then took a liberal arts course at the college while playing rock music in clubs five nights a week.\n\n“We were making good money,” he said.\n\nBowe said as music became a full-time job he and his fellow band members first rented a house on Highland Avenue and then a house in Westport.\n\nHeaded to Hollywood\n\nBowe was 24 in 1983 when he loaded up his car and for the next five days and nights drove cross-country to Hollywood, California, where he hoped to establish a career in acting.\n\nHis previous performance experience had been as a frontman and guitar player for the “new wave” rock band The Moderns — which opened shows for the likes of The B-52s, The Romantics and The Ramones — and the more traditional classic rock band Sayne, both of which played gigs throughout New England.\n\nMore:Fall River strong: From Rhodes scholars to MMA fighters, 10 notable city natives\n\nAfter arriving in Los Angeles, Bowe, who immigrated at age 9 to Fall River with his parents and sister, signed up for acting classes at Beverly Hills Playhouse.\n\nTo make ends meet, and in addition to knocking on doors to get auditions, Bowe began working for an old Teamsters Union friend from Rhode Island, setting up booths for events and trade shows.\n\nHe eventually formed a production company called Bowe Productions and began booking rock bands, such as the up-and-coming Guns N’ Roses, in California and Arizona.\n\nOne of the investors in his booking business was his Teamsters friend, who Bowe says had previously been general manager of the Providence Civic Center (now known as the Dunkin’ Donuts Center) and had worked with heavyweight concert promoter Frank J. Russo.\n\nFirst big acting break\n\nBowe’s big break in terms of a steady acting assignment came in 1988, when he said a casting director friend suggested he audition for the role of an office worker known only as Dave on a new TV show called \"Murphy Brown.\"\n\nBowe says he passed the audition and was included in the show’s first episode, although it would be a while before he actually spoke lines.\n\n“I was hired as a day player to work three to four days a week,” he said. “It was like an actor’s dream come true.”\n\nThe recurring role as Dave, he said, lasted a total of eight years.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in March 2020, Bowe, who lives in the same Hollywood Hills condo he bought more than 35 years ago, says that the phone stopped ringing.\n\n“There was no work for a year and two months,” he said.\n\nLuckily for him, he had just finished working on an independent action yarn called “Unchained,” about a group of kidnapped women forced to fight each other in an underground mixed martial arts ring.\n\nThe movie, which features a cameo appearance by Eric Roberts, is available via Amazon Prime Video and opened July 2.\n\nHollywood crowd\n\nLiving in Hollywood Hills, he said, means that you never know who you’ll run into on the street or in a restaurant or store.\n\nSome of the celebrity names he drops include Mark Wahlberg, Mike Tyson, Gene Simmons, Ringo Starr and Mickey Rourke.\n\nBowe says he also stays in touch with Fall River native and Grammy Award-winning recording engineer and producer David Reitzas, who also lives in Los Angeles.\n\nMore:Fall River strong: 10 more local legends, from musicians to soccer stars\n\n“He’s one of my best friends from when I went to Connolly, and he produced my song 'I’m Sorry' at the Record Plant (L.A. recording studio),” Bowe said.\n\nHe says he shortened and anglicized his name to Bowe after he realized that no one calling out his name at West Coast auditions would ever figure out the correct Portuguese pronunciation of Botelho.\n\n“It was a nightmare,” Bowe said. “They got as far as 'Bo' but couldn’t say the rest, so I figured let’s just make it Bowe.”\n\nFall River show will be grand opening of The Club\n\nBowe, who is divorced and has no children, has been back in Fall River and staying at his sister’s house since February.\n\nAnd although he’s managed to make his financial bread and butter in the world of TV and video — including providing photo body doubles for well-known actors and even hand modeling — Bowe has never stopped making music.\n\nHe said he’s got a professional recording studio in the Hollywood Hills condo he shares with a roommate who is a musician.\n\nHalf the songs Bowe said he’ll perform at The Club at the Cultural Center will be originals.\n\nThe Khourys, a Fall River sister duo, are scheduled to appear as opening act.\n\nBowe’s old Fall River buddy Marc Dennis will join him on stage for at least one song toward the end of the concert, which will mark the grand opening of The Club at the Cultural Center.\n\nMore:Why this popular Portuguese pop/rock singer opened a new restaurant in downtown Fall River\n\nBowe said he’s also proud of the fact that he and his longtime friend and music producer Mir Wave — who will be on stage with him in Fall River — won an award in 2016 at the International Portuguese Music Awards, held at the Zeiterion Performing Arts Center in New Bedford, for a song called “Soul.”\n\nDennis — who spent 30 years as a Fall River public school bilingual teacher, dabbled in real estate and has had a career as a professional Portuguese-language pop singer — signed a purchase and sale agreement for the Cultural Center commercial building in March 2021 with former owner Liberal Silva.\n\nIn addition to the basement-level The Club at Cultural Center — which has a maximum capacity of 200 people — the two-story structure includes a main banquet hall that can handle up to 300 people and a ground floor restaurant at 201 S. Main St. that serves dinner Thursday through Saturday.\n\nDennis says after the Aug. 7 concert he’s going to feature either live or DJ music with room to dance every Friday and Saturday in the basement-level venue with no cover charge.\n\nHe also says that because of a growing demand for private parties and functions he might end up closing the restaurant in order to use all available space for that purpose.\n\nDennis says all $45 VIP seating with complimentary hors d’oeuvres is sold out, but there are still plenty of $30 general admission tickets available.\n\nCharles Winokoor may be reached at cwinokoor@heraldnews.com.

Some customers aren’t happy because several specialty drinks cost a lot more points.\n\nThe new system comes with a number of changes. Members will receive 10 points for every $1 spent, up from 5 points for every $1 in the old program. And they can start redeeming rewards after 150 points instead of 200 and use those points toward food for the first time. Plus members who visit a Dunkin’ at least 12 times within a calendar month can unlock more points and have access to new benefits for three months.\n\nBut another big change is causing a backlash: Under the new system, members need 700 points to get a free cold brew, cold brew with cold foam, Dunkin’ refresher or hot or iced espresso drink, and 900 points for a frozen drink or hot or iced signature latte. With DD Perks, members were able to get a free drink, without those limitations, for just 200 points.\n\n“We consistently heard members ask for three things: flexibility, variety, and recognition,” said Scott Murphy, Dunkin’ president. “We’re excited to deliver this to them through the new program.”\n\nMurphy added that Dunkin’ hopes to attract loyal customers who weren’t part of DD Perks with the new program, “while introducing new and expansive ways to continue to thank our longstanding loyalty members.” The new program should help improve customer experience overall, he said.\n\nDunkin' is making changes to its rewards program. Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDunkin’ ran a limited pilot of the program this summer. Now, Dunkin’ Rewards is replacing DD Perks entirely — those with DD Perks memberships will become Rewards members automatically. It will start rolling out the new program Thursday. Dunkin’ unveiled changes on its website, and Insider shared details of the program earlier this week.\n\nAlready, some are expressing dismay about the new program, especially because of the amount of points required to earn free drinks.\n\n“Please keep DD Perks — it’s a million times better,” one person wrote on Twitter, adding “why do you have to try and fix things that aren’t broken???” Another said “I hate the new dunkin rewards,” adding a cry face emoji.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Murphy noted that “change is always going to be an adjustment.” But, he said “in the long run, Dunkin’ loyalists will benefit even more,” because of the added flexibility. He also said that with special perks for the most loyal members and other targeted offers, “members will get many of our coffee beverages at a better value than with DD Perks.”\n\nRewards programs are an important way for companies to learn more about their customers’ preferences and promote loyalty in a competitive sector. Recently, many chains have been making tweaks to their programs or launching new ones.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) said during its September investor day that it is planning improvements to its loyalty program, including showing real-time order updates in the app. The coffee chain also teased a joint rewards program with other companies such as retailers and airlines.

Maybe we’ll start a trend.”\n\nDunkin’ was still open for regular business as the nuptials took place. At 1 p.m. Friday, invited guests were on one side, waiting for the bride to arrive as cameras clicked and a couple of TV crews lined up shots. Regular customers got their orders at the counter as coffeemakers whirled.\n\nSneade sang part of the song “Marry Me” as part of her vows before she and Roy were pronounced man and wife.\n\nA French vanilla coffee in March 1992\n\nThe high spirits were a stark contrast to misunderstandings and words that didn’t come out right after Roy bought Sneade a French vanilla coffee at Dunkin’ a few days before Sneade’s 21st birthday in March 1992.\n\nThe couple met at a party at the house of one of Sneade’s friends, where she grew up. Roy, who grew up in Worcester, came to the party with a mutual friend. “He walked into the room, and he said to me, ‘You have the most beautiful eyes,’ ” Sneade recalled.\n\n“We were madly in love,” she said.\n\nRoy is “very old school,” Sneade said. He asked her to meet at Dunkin’ because he wanted to talk about a plan he had for them. Sneade was going to college. Roy was supportive of Sneade pursuing a career in the performing arts. “The most important thing for me, I wanted to provide for her,” he said.\n\n“He felt the best best way for him to do this on our behalf was to join the service – the Navy – since his father and grandfather had previously served,” Sneade said. “He would acquire skills and provide a good life for us with many opportunities.\n\n“I felt like I didn’t know what to make of his decision,” Sneade said. “I was flattered and overwhelmed by his commitment, but equally felt he was placing a burden on himself in taking care of me. I said the wrong things. ‘Why are you putting so much pressure on yourself?’ I kind of crushed him. I felt awful.”\n\nAfterward, they talked on the phone and agreed to take a step back. Except for a couple of chance encounters, they didn't see each other for more than 25 years.\n\nRoy joined the Navy and married and is the father of three children. Sneade appeared in local musicals and developed her own cabaret shows, which she performed in Boston, New York and Florida. She also had a first marriage and moved to Florida.\n\n“We led two very different lives,” Sneade said. “I wouldn’t want to change a thing that happened. Jason has three beautiful children who he adores. I had a different way to give to the world through music.”\n\n“Everything happens for a reason,” Roy noted.\n\nThey were gone from each other’s lives, but not forgotten.\n\nSneade put on a musical, Roy showed up\n\nSneade returned to perform in the area, often accompanied on the piano by Jim Rice, a pianist, musical arranger and music director who has known Sneade for years.\n\nSneade and Rice put on four performances of her Valentine’s Day musical revue “A Hollywood Valentine” in February 2018. Roy’s mother read a story in the Telegram & Gazette about the upcoming shows and told her son. Roy showed up.\n\n“I saw him sitting on the front row. I looked out almost like a deer in the headlights. I thought ‘Oh my goodness,’ ” Sneade said.\n\n“When I got there, I was shaking, I was so nervous,” Roy said.\n\n“Jim Rice said, ‘Who’s that?’ I said, ‘That’s my ex-boyfriend from 25 years ago,’ ” Sneade recalled.\n\nThree months later, she packed her bags and moved back from Florida. Roy proposed to Sneade on New Year’s Eve 2018.\n\nJim Rice, a minister, officiated at Friday’s wedding.\n\n“When you’re 18 or 19 years old you don’t understand love until you’ve lived,” Valerie Roy said. “I think we’re going to appreciate each other more so much later in life because every day is a blessing. I can’t imagine my life without him.

Starting in 1973, the name was shortened to \"IHOP\" for marketing purposes, using a cartoon kangaroo in commercials.\n\nOn June 11, 2018, IHOP fliped the “P” to a “B” and became known as IHOB, to show they’re as serious about burgers as they are about pancakes. ihop.com\n\nMore IHOP:Fake name change to IHOb to boost burger business was risk worth taking\n\nPopeyes Louisiana Kitchen\n\nPopeyes was founded in 1972 in Arabi, Louisiana as Chicken on the Run when owner Al Copeland wanted to compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken. Because of lackluster sales, Copeland renamed his restaurant to Popeyes after Popeye Doyle from the Oscar-winning movie “French Connection.” Shortly after, the restaurant became known as Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits and in 1975, it became known as Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken.\n\nIn February 2017, they became known as Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen to highlight their Louisiana roots and to show the Cajun state is more than just chicken and biscuits. popeyes.com\n\nApplebee’s Neighborhood Grill & Bar\n\nApplebee's was started by Bill and T. J. Palmer, who opened their first restaurant, T.J. Applebee's Rx for Edibles & Elixirs, in Decatur, Georgia, on November 19, 1980.\n\nIn 1986 the name was changed to Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar to reflect the Palmers' original concept of a place where everybody knows your name. applebees.com\n\nBoston Market Rotisserie Kitchen\n\nFounded in 1984 in Newton, Massachusetts as Boston Chicken and known for their rotisserie chicken and a variety of side dishes.\n\nIn 1995 they became known as Boston Market Rotisserie Kitchen after expanding their menu to include turkey, meatloaf and ham, which the change now reflected. bostonmarket.com\n\nTake our poll!

Known simply as The Pizzeria, lines began forming almost immediately for Sewell’s deep-dish pizza.\n\nIn 1997, Pizzeria Uno changed its name to Pizzeria Uno, Chicago Bar & Grill before simplifying it to Uno Chicago Grill to show they were more than just pizza. Realizing they were too similar to other casual dining chains, they later changed the name to Uno Pizzeria & Grill. unos.com\n\nKFC\n\nKFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders in 1930 as Sanders Court & Café in North Corbin, Kentucky. An entrepreneur who learned to cook from his mother at age 7, Sanders began selling his trademark chicken from his roadside restaurant. In 1950, he was officially named a colonel and began dressing the part, growing a goatee and wearing a white suit with a string tie and calling himself “Colonel Sanders.” Sanders franchised his first restaurant in 1952 to his friend Pete Harman, who coined the name Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n\nIn 1991, the KFC name was officially adopted since it was already widely known by this moniker. In 2015, KFC was struggling as the leading chicken retailer and began a new series of advertisements featuring a rotating cast of characters as Colonel Sanders before Reba McEntire was chosen as the first female Colonel Sanders in January 2018. kfc.com\n\nDomino’s Pizza restaurant\n\nDomino’s started out as DomiNick's in 1960 by brothers Tom and James Monaghan, who bought the Ypsilanti, Michigan pizza restaurant for $500.\n\nIn 1965, Tom Monaghan purchased two other pizzerias but was unable to retain the DomiNick's name.

After seeing how well the Mexican restaurant across the street, the Mitla Café was doing, he learned how to make tacos and opened a new stand called Taco-Tia in late 1951. Opening a string of El Taco restaurants in the next few years, Bell built the first Taco Bell in 1962 in Downey, California. tacobell.com\n\nBurger King\n\nBurger King started out as Insta-Burger King in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida by Keith J. Kramer and Matthew Burns, after the two opened the restaurant based around a cooking device called an Insta-Broiler.\n\nWhen the business began failing, the two sold their enterprise to James McLamore and David R. Edgerton in Miami, Florida, who renamed it Burger King in 1959. bk.com\n\nDunkin’ Donuts\n\nDunkin’ Donuts began in 1948 as the Open Kettle, a restaurant owned by William Rosenberg that sold coffee and doughnuts in Quincy, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1950, Rosenberg changed the name to Dunkin’ Donuts after discussing it with company executives. Rosenberg decided to focus on coffee and doughnuts after his experiences selling food at construction sites and factories and saw these were always the most popular items.

Pinskiy said shops would gradually reopen throughout August and September.\n\nWider trend\n\nPeople are seen inside the newly-opened Stars Coffee cafe in Moscow Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGlobal franchise operator Alshaya, established in Kuwait, had lost interest in doing business after Starbucks pulled its brand from Russia, Timati told Reuters. Alshaya did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“We won the tender - there were a lot of participants - acquired it and made our own brand,” he said.\n\nThe deal mirrors a wider trend among Western brands, which has been changing the country’s retail and corporate landscapes as the conflict in Ukraine enters its sixth month.\n\nRenault sold its majority stake in carmaker Avtovaz to a Russian player for just one rouble, while McDonald’s, whose restaurants have now become Vkusno & tochka, did not disclose a figure.\n\nBoth of those deals included buyback options, but Pinskiy said that didn’t apply to Starbucks due to the franchise model it operated under in Russia.\n\nHe declined to disclose figures concerning the deal with Alshaya. “We have invested as much as we paid them,” Pinskiy said. “This is (an) expensive pleasure.”\n\nThe pair said they were interested in more acquisitions, but gave no further details.\n\nWhile the partnership may appear unlikely, Timati, one of Russia’s most famous rappers, co-founded the Black Star Burger chain in Russia, which sells a “Timati Burger.”\n\nHe is also known for his support of the Kremlin and in 2015 released a track containing the lyrics “President Putin is my best friend.”\n\nPinskiy, who earlier this month told Russian reporter and political activist Ksenia Sobchak that he had never tried coffee in his life, has a string of restaurants in his portfolio, including a joint project with Timati, REDBOX, which serves Pan-Asian cuisine.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/06/02/wonder-woman-soars-into-theaters-and-more-5-things-you-need-know-friday/102286650/", "title": "'Wonder Woman' soars into theaters and more: 5 things to know Friday", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n'Wonder Woman' soars into theaters\n\nDC Comics' Wonder Woman is to the rescue Friday as the superhero flick hits theaters. Although female superhero movies have a history of flopping, Wonder Woman is looking to break the trend. The film has received high praise leading up to its premiere, and Gal Gadot's performance as the lead has many audience members, especially women, welling up as she plunges into battle. The movie's debut has not been without controversy, though.Female-only showings at certain theaters sparked some outrage last week, and the film has been banned in Lebanon.\n\nEx-Penn State president faces sentencing over Sandusky case\n\nFormer Penn State President Graham Spanier could face jail time when he is sentenced Friday for his conviction in hushing up suspected child sex abuse in 2001 by former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. In a court filing, prosecutors asserted that Spanier, 68, should get up to a year in jail. Spanier was convicted of child endangerment in March in a case that revolved around a complaint by a graduate coaching assistant that he saw Sandusky sexually molesting a boy in a team shower in 2001. Sandusky was not arrested until 2011. He was convicted the following year of sexually abusing 10 boys and is serving a decades-long prison sentence.\n\nViolence at a casino resort triggers security alert in the Philippines\n\nPhilippine authorities ruled out terrorism Friday after at least 36 people died after a lone gunman stormed into Resorts World Manila — a casino resort on Manila Bay — before opening fire and setting gaming tables alight. Videos posted on social media showed people fleeing in terror amid several loud bangs. Ernesto Abella, a spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said there was no evidence to link the attack with fighting between Islamist extremists and government forces in the south of the county. Manila Police chief Oscar Albayalde said the victims died from suffocation and smoke inhalation and none had gunshot wounds.\n\nLabor Department to release jobs report\n\nEconomists are hoping to see solid growth numbers when the Labor Department releases its May jobs report Friday. Expectations were raised after payroll processor ADP on Thursday estimated that businesses added a whopping 253,000 jobs last month, well above economists’ median estimate of 180,000. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Labor Department to tally 180,000 new positions in the public and private sectors. So far this year, job growth has averaged 185,000 in the monthly report, with April recording 211,000 jobs added. .\n\nSweet!

Some, such as Dunkin' Donuts and Cumberland Farms, require the purchase of a beverage to get the freebie.

Parker and played by Robert Urich in ABC's TV series \"Spenser: For Hire\" from 1985 to 1988. This requires showing he can still take the blows that come with the gig, including from rapper Post Malone, who makes his acting debut and gets a few licks in during a prison brawl.\n\nWahlberg, 48, talked to USA TODAY about some of his greatest hits and one painful kick:\n\nQuestion: Who knew you and Post Malone were friends? How did he get the part?\n\nMark Wahlberg: We were hanging out at my house and he was like, \"You know, I'd really love to be in a movie.\" And then he was like, \"I want to die in a movie.\" He just wanted to get killed in a movie. I said, \"I got this other idea, but you wouldn't die. But you guys could beat me up. And then ultimately, I'll beat the (expletive) out of you.\" Peter had never met him, had never seen him act. I didn't know if it was going to be good. But I kept telling Pete, 'It's going to be good.'\n\nQ: He has prison-worthy face tattoos, but how was Post Malone as an actor?\n\nWahlberg: The day came where he was supposed to shoot his scene, but they didn't even know if he was in town. So everybody's panicking because musicians move to the beat of their own drum. They don't adhere to schedules. But he was in his trailer, pounding Bud Lights. We were heading over to the real jail to shoot and Post is trying to bring his 12-pack inside. I was like, \"You can't bring a 12-pack of Bud Light into the jail, bro. It's not going to happen.\" I said, \"I could probably get one beer for you in a Dunkin' Donuts cup.\"\n\nHe was also a little nervous. It was his first time. But after the first take, Peter was happy and Post had a great time. The sky is the limit for his acting career.\n\nQ: And this ends with you getting punched by Post Malone?\n\nWahlberg: And Cowboy Cerrone, the winningest fighter in the history of the UFC. He doesn’t know how to pull a kick, either. I got kicked in the ribs.\n\nQ: One of the greatest hits you ever took on camera was a crushing blow that made it into the 2006 football film \"Invincible.\" Do you remember that?\n\nWahlberg: Yeah, of course. That was a very memorable hit. I remember specifically because it's called an ear hole, when a guy hits you so hard, your ear touches your shoulder on the other side. You're really getting racked. And it's a slow-mo shot of me running down the sideline on a kickoff. The guy was a former NFL Broncos player and he just was coming as fast as he could from the opposite direction. I didn't know what was coming and I got hit. It's funny because, on that football movie with all the hits, I had a bad neck, bad shoulders, bad back, bad knees, bad hips. Everything was hurting me. So as soon as that hit came, it's like, he's done for the day. They said, take an ice bath and go home. But the hit kind of realigned me and actually fixed everything. It lit me up and loosened me up. I took a five-minute ice bath, jumped on my scooter and played golf.\n\nQ: How was it brawling Joaquin Phoenix in 2000's \"The Yards\"? It's intense.\n\nWahlberg: It became one of the better fights that I have a been a part of. He didn't know what I was going to do. I didn’t know what he was going to do. I think he wished he knew what I was going to do after the first night of shooting because it got pretty aggressive. He's a gamer, he's a method guy. Between him and Ben Foster, they’ll beat their heads off the side of a tree to get into character.\n\nQ. It's been 25 years since you brawled alongside and played basketball with young Leonardo DiCaprio in \"The Basketball Diaries.\" How was his basketball game?\n\nWahlberg: He was playing Jim Carroll, no easy feat since the guy would go on to play Division I basketball. But it was more important to have a great actor than a great basketball player.\n\nQ: How's your game these days?\n\nWahlberg: I don't play anymore. I don't want to roll an ankle. I was playing my kids the other day and started firing off NBA threes and tweaked my elbow. I was like, \"Damn.\" My kids were like, \"Dad, you're so old. You can’t even take a shot.\" They were dying laughing.\n\nQ: Cue the \"We can rebuild him\" question. What's up with your bionic \"Six Billion Dollar Man\" movie now that director Travis Knight is onboard?\n\nWahlberg: I’m hoping to get the script any day now. We've got a great idea and a great take on it. Hopefully, we'll be making it soon because I'm not getting any younger. I just feel there is a ticking clock. Like \"The Fighter,\" I knew that I had a certain window to be able to make that movie in my own head, being able to pull off the physicality, Did you watch \"The Irishman\"? They were able to do the technology with the face. But when (Robert De Niro) is kicking the guy, it looked a little older.

During the Jan. 6 riot, though, the Capitol and its visitors center were closed to the public, including tours led by members of Congress and their staff, according to a security notice sent to all members of Congress.\n\nThe six photos used in the viral post are cropped and sourced from Reuters, the Associated Press and Getty Images, which covered the events.\n\nFact check:What's true about the Capitol riot, from antifa to BLM to Chuck Norris\n\nCapitol riot turns violent\n\nAlthough both demonstrations brought thousands of people to the Capitol, the Jan. 6 insurrection that followed a speech from then-President Donald Trump left both demonstrators and police injured or, in some cases, dead.\n\nVideo and images from the riot show demonstrators beating a police officer with objects, including a hockey stick; assaulting a photographer; carrying zip-tie handcuffs, and breaking out windows in the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police also reported that two pipe bombs were discovered nearby during the demonstrations.\n\n“These individuals actively attacked United States Capitol Police Officers and other uniformed law enforcement officers with metal pipes, discharged chemical irritants, and took up other weapons against our officers. They were determined to enter into the Capitol Building by causing great damage,” now-former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said in a prepared statement.\n\nA Capitol police officer died from injuries sustained during the riot, according to the department, and a Capitol police officer shot and killed a woman who was trying to enter the Speaker’s Lobby through a broken window.\n\nThree other people died from medical emergencies during the demonstration.\n\nAs of Feb. 1, the Department of Justice has announced federal charges related to the Jan. 6 insurrection against 160 people from across the country. Charges include assault of a federal officer, carrying a gun or ammunition on Capitol grounds, violent entry on Capitol grounds and theft of government property, among others.\n\nOur ruling: Missing context\n\nA post equating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol to 2018 demonstrations against the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is MISSING CONTEXT, based on our research, because without additional information it could be misleading. Photos in the post authentically represent the 2018 protests, but the text leaves out key differences between the demonstrations, including violence during the Jan. 6 riot that resulted in the death of a U.S. Capitol Police officer and a demonstrator. Protesters also did not enter the Supreme Court in 2018, as the post claims. The Capitol was open to the public in 2018, but closed during the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Protesters seized some oil installations and the state oil company, Petroecuador, warned that production losses could reach 165,000 barrels a day, or nearly one-third of total production, if insecurity continues.\n\nThe government declared an overnight curfew around key state installations and government buildings as well as vital infrastructure such as airports and oil refineries.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, protesters broke through police barriers and some entered the empty congress building in Quito. Police fired tear gas and forced them to retreat.\n\nIndigenous protesters occupied two water treatment plants in the city of Ambato, south of the capital, raising concern about supply to residents, according to municipal authorities.\n\nOn Monday night, hundreds of people rampaged through the Duran area near the port city of Guayaquil, looting pharmacies, electronic appliance stores and other buildings.\n\nIn another part of Ecuador, police abandoned an armored vehicle to protesters who set it on fire. In multiple areas, rioters smashed car windows, broke into shops and confronted security forces.\n\nSome video footage has shown police beating protesters on the ground. Opponents have accused Moreno’s government of human rights abuses in its attempts to quell disturbances.\n\nMoreno met with Cabinet ministers in Guayaquil on Tuesday after moving government operations there from Quito because of security problems. In comments broadcast by the Ecuavisa television network, he said he had the support of Ecuador’s institutions and thanked them “for their defense of the democratic system.”\n\nIn a televised address late Monday, the president said he was the target of a coup attempt, but would not back down from his decision to cut subsidies contributing to huge public debt that soared before he took office. The cuts were among measures announced as part of a $4.2 billion funding plan with the International Monetary Fund, which said the package will help the poor by strengthening Ecuador’s economy and generating jobs.\n\nIndigenous groups have condemned what they call the government’s “closed-door agreement” with the IMF, saying in a statement that austerity measures would deepen economic inequality.\n\nThe groups said they were carrying out “civil disobedience” and had detained some soldiers and police encroaching on indigenous territories. But they criticized vandalism and looting “by external actors who are not affiliated with our movement or goals.”\n\nSeveral military commanders stood behind Moreno during his address Monday night, underscoring the armed forces’ support.\n\nMoreno called for dialogue to resolve the crisis. At the same time, he said his leftist predecessor and former ally, Rafael Correa, is trying to destabilize Ecuador with the help of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Ecuador is among dozens of nations calling for Maduro’s ouster.\n\nMaduro dismissed the claim in a Tuesday evening television appearance. He jokingly called himself “Super Maduro” and wiggled his dark mustache in a mocking suggestion that he can summon superpowers to topple governments.\n\n“If you, Mr. Lenín Moreno, want to see the reality of what’s happening, take that economic package back and engage in a dialogue with the people of Ecuador,” Maduro added. “Open a dialogue with the peasants, workers and indigenous people.”\n\nCorrea and Moreno have traded allegations of corruption in recent months, and Correa says he and his allies are victims of political persecution. Correa, who has been living in Belgium, faces an arrest warrant issued last year in Ecuador for alleged corruption.\n\nSeven Latin American countries – Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru and Paraguay – expressed support for Moreno and denounced Maduro for allegedly trying to “destabilize our democracies.” Colombia has said previously that Venezuela is providing refuge to Colombian guerrillas, an allegation that the Venezuelan government denies.\n\nThe Organization of American States called for talks to end the unrest in Ecuador and said Moreno was constitutionally elected.\n\n“The kidnapping of police and military personnel is totally unacceptable, as is the destruction and looting of public goods, the burning of patrol cars and attacks on ambulances,” the regional bloc’s general secretariat said.\n\nSome 570 people have been arrested in Ecuador for crimes including attacks on people and property, according to Juan Sebastián Roldán, the president’s private secretary.\n\n“What we’re going through is not a peaceful mobilization, it’s delinquency and vandalism,” Roldán said on Twitter.\n\nThe government last week declared a state of emergency, allowing it to curb some civil liberties as it tries to restore order.\n\nThe disturbances have spread from transport workers to students and then to indigenous demonstrators, an ominous turn for the government. Indigenous protesters played a major role in the 2005 resignation of Ecuador’s president at the time, Lucio Gutiérrez, though the military’s tacit approval was key to his removal.\n\nThe country’s biggest indigenous group, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, said Moreno’s government had failed to alleviate the welfare of Ecuador’s “most vulnerable” people. The group made similar complaints about Correa, his predecessor.\n\n“We have shown throughout Ecuador’s history that indigenous peoples have the power to shut down the country when our rights are put at risk and power is abused,” the indigenous groups said in their statement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/05/politics/doj-investigation-jan-6-insurrection/index.html", "title": "Inside the DOJ investigation of the Jan. 6 insurrection | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nA year after the January 6 insurrection, the Justice Department continues to press forward on the biggest investigation in FBI history, with 700 people already arrested and hundreds more offenders still at large and several more years of prosecutions ahead.\n\nBut the expansive investigation has yet to shed light on how vigorously the former President and political allies could be investigated for inciting rioters by spreading a lie that the election was stolen and asking them to march to the Capitol.\n\nAfter opening aggressively, with prosecutors raising the prospect of using a rarely used seditious conspiracy law to charge some Capitol attackers, the Justice Department since Attorney General Merrick Garland took office in March 2021 has settled into a less headline-grabbing approach that Justice officials say is intended to keep the probe away from the political maelstrom.\n\nGarland, a former appeals court judge, has made restoring institutional norms a top focus of his tenure, after a Trump era that regularly injected politics at the department. That includes a reminder to prosecutors that they should only speak in indictments and other court proceedings.\n\n“The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law – whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Garland said in a speech Wednesday. “We will follow the facts wherever they lead.”\n\nHis quiet approach has not satisfied Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans who openly discuss their interest in identifying crimes they believe the Justice Department should prosecute. It’s also opened Garland to criticism that he hasn’t been as publicly dynamic or aggressive as the nation needs to counter a threat to democracy.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland has been extremely weak and I think there should be a lot more of the organizers of January 6 that should be arrested by now,” Rep. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said on CNN this week.\n\nJustice Department spokesman Anthony Coley defended the agency’s efforts. “We are proud of the men and women of the Justice Department, who are undertaking the largest investigation in the department’s history,” Coley said in a statement. “They are following the facts and the law and the Constitution while working at impressive speed and scale to hold accountable all those responsible for the attack on the Capitol, and will continue to do so.”\n\nFor the FBI, which came under criticism for failing to do more to prevent the attack, the January 6 anniversary is also a moment to urge the public to help with more tips to solve notable unsolved crimes, including the police assaults and the pipe bombs found that day near the offices of the Democratic and Republican parties just steps from the Capitol.\n\nSteven D’Antuono, assistant director for the FBI’s Washington field office, said those inquiries are priorities as part of the broader complex investigation.\n\n“In this area where the bombs were placed, if they did go off they could have caused some serious harm or death,” D’Antuono said in an interview with CNN.\n\n“On that day, over 100 police officers were assaulted that day multiple times,” D’Antuono said. “And we’re not just talking about one assault, multiple assaults and by multiple people. We’re still looking for about 250 people individuals that assaulted police officers that day.”\n\nThe Justice Department hired a contractor to help it process hundreds of thousands of hours of video in order to do the painstaking work to identify assailants, CNN previously reported. “We’re going to be at this as long as it takes,” he said.\n\nAccountability beyond the rioters\n\nThe January 6 attack reframed the face of a domestic terrorism threat that the FBI, Homeland Security Department and other agencies say has grown rapidly. And the January 6 investigation has led to several arrests of what appear to be political extremists on the far right, and extensive investigations into militarized organizations that affiliated themselves with Trump and had members participating in the Capitol violence.\n\nBut in many ways, the role of the former President, whose rhetoric fueled the mob and continues to animate supporters, is the elephant in the room that Justice Department officials try to not talk about.\n\nIn one of the first moves under Garland, the Justice Department turned over thousands of pages of internal documents to congressional committees investigating the Capitol attack.\n\nThe move, which departed from precedent, was aimed at providing lawmakers with information that they could use more quickly to expose the conduct among people in the former administration who inspired the attack. That includes former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who according to testimony by former Trump officials, sought to engineer a coup of department leadership before January 6 and wanted to use the department to support Trump’s false election fraud claims.\n\nThe tacit acknowledgment in the move, however, was an indication that it was unlikely that the former president and top officials would face criminal prosecution for actions that incited the attack.\n\nSome Justice officials say that providing the documents to Congress will help provide Americans answers that the Justice Department perhaps may never expose, since the department can only provide a narrative of events when it brings charges.\n\nJustice officials note that prosecutors generally have five years of statute of limitations for most crimes that occurred January 6 and they haven’t foreclosed on the possibility of targeting higher-level figures.\n\nIf the release of troves of records to Congress was intended to relieve pressure on the department, in some ways it has done the opposite. Members of the House select committee investigating the attack, have highlighted information they’ve uncovered so far to build a steady drumbeat of pressure for the department to make sure there’s accountability beyond the hundreds of people who illegally entered the Capitol.\n\nFast start to the largest investigation in FBI history\n\nThe investigation began with a burst of activity, with 70 people being charged in the first week and a hundred case files opened, prosecutors said in a briefing. The swiftness was motivated in part because of concerns that a repeat of violence could disrupt the inauguration of President Joe Biden just weeks later.\n\n“No US attorney’s office has charged that many cases, executed this many subpoenas and search warrants in such a short period of time,” Michael Sherwin, the former acting District of Columbia US attorney who helped oversee the investigation, said in an interview. “Speed was critical. We had the Inauguration coming up. We had to instill in the public a sense of order and the rule of law, to mitigate the damage that happened that day.”\n\nBut those early news conferences from Sherwin and D’Antuono, who together presented a tough New York-style voice to the law enforcement work, quickly gave way as Garland ushered in a lower-profile style. Sherwin left the Justice Department after he was reprimanded for not getting permission to do an interview with CBS News’ 60 Minutes, in which he said, among other things, that he believed the Department could charge seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe crime scene at the Capitol was unusual and unprecedented in size, in many ways because of how surveillance and police cameras captured dozens of angles of the attack of the Capitol, and because the bragging online posts from the riot’s participants gave prosecutors multiple terabytes of evidence.\n\nEarly on, the FBI opened its tip lines and published photos of high profile attackers, immediately ushering a flood of tips from average citizens turning in family, friends and strangers. A loose group of online sleuths, nicknamed Sedition Hunters, organized themselves to cull through publicly released images to help identify dozens of suspected rioters. Their work, which sometimes has been faster than the FBI’s, has been hailed by prosecutors who credited their work in criminal charging documents.\n\nPlodding pace of riot court\n\nGarland’s approach to the January 6 probe appears to mimic the plodding pace of court – what may seem sensible to the long-time federal judge but what largely keeps the wider public from witnessing much of the investigative action outside of court proceedings and documents. So far, more than 160 federal defendants have pleaded guilty, with all but 20 so far pleading guilty to lower-level misdemeanor charges – leaving the bulk of the felony cases to move forward in court in 2022.\n\nAbout 70 defendants have been sentenced, to either probation or stints in home confinement or jail. Many of the felony defendants are looking at potentially years in prison if found guilty.\n\nThe first January 6 criminal trials are set to begin in February. In those days-long proceedings, prosecutors will have to give more of a window into the breadth of communications data, video and other evidence they’ve collected in what has become the largest federal investigation in American history.\n\nAt times, the pursuits in court have already connected January 6 investigators to the phone logs of members of Congress and a vast web of MAGA celebrities, such as Roger Stone and Sidney Powell, in touch with people around Trump’s White House leading up to January 6.\n\nBut the Justice Department turning the screws on Trump’s closest contacts may be a long way off, if pursued at all. Prosecutors won’t take to trial for months major conspiracy indictments against alleged leaders of the right-wing Proud Boys that broke into the Capitol through a window, and participants in a group of Oath Keepers. In the latter case, with 17 defendants heading to trial, some are accused of stationing guns outside the city on January 6, others say they were acting as security for VIPs, and other defendants zoomed a golf cart to Capitol Hill while coordinating their group during the attack, prosecutors say.\n\nSo far, four Oath Keepers defendants have pleaded guilty and appear to be cooperating with prosecutors. And while the Proud Boys’ lawyers have murmured about cooperating witnesses for months and how prosecutors pressured some of them to cooperate, the first known Proud Boys member to be charged with conspiracy flipped only in the last weeks of 2021.", "authors": ["Evan Perez Katelyn Polantz", "Evan Perez", "Katelyn Polantz"], "publish_date": "2022/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/us/power-outage-moore-county-investigation-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Moore County power: Investigators are zeroing in on 2 possible ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nInvestigators – who have found nearly two dozen shell casings from a high-powered rifle – are zeroing in on two threads of possible motives centered around extremist behavior for the weekend assault on two North Carolina electric substations, according to law-enforcement sources briefed on the investigation.\n\nThe news comes as the primary utility company in Moore County restored electricity to the final customers of the 45,000 homes and businesses that initially lost power.\n\nOfficials on Wednesday also announced a total of $75,000 in reward money for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for Saturday’s attacks.\n\nOne thread involves the writings by extremists on online forums encouraging attacks on critical infrastructure. The second thread looks at a series of recent disruptions of LGBTQ+ events across the nation by domestic extremists.\n\nThe FBI and the NC State Bureau are assisting in the investigation.\n\ninvestigators have no evidence connecting the North Carolina attacks to a drag event at the theater in the same county, but the timing of two events are being considered in context with the growing tensions and armed confrontations around similar LBGTQ+ events across the country, the sources told CNN.\n\nIn the past two years, anti-government groups began using online forums to urge followers to attack critical infrastructure, including the power grid. They have posted documents and even instructions outlining vulnerabilities and suggesting the use of high-powered rifles.\n\nOne 14-page guide obtained by CNN cited as an example the 2013 sniper attack on a high voltage substation at the edge of Silicon Valley that destroyed 17 transformers and cost Pacific Gas and Electric $15 million in repairs.\n\nIn that case, the shooter fired more than 100 bullets in about 20 minutes, disappearing a minute before police arrived. The case remains unsolved.\n\nWhile investigators haven’t found a rifle in the North Carolina shootings, the casings still could offer critical evidence. A law enforcement source told CNN that the caliber of the bullets in the California incident is different from those used in North Carolina.\n\nInvestigators are taking into consideration that the timing of Moore County shootings – 7 p.m. on a Saturday night – coincided with the time a drag performance sponsored by the local LBGTQ+ community began, according to the sources. Audience members used their phone flashlights to light the stage for one last song, but after that the performance couldn’t continue due to the power outage, according to Sandhills PRIDE.\n\nOfficials have said the gunfire, which left much of the county without electricity for days, were a “malicious” and “intentional” attack. The two substations are about 10 miles apart.\n\nNo suspects in the outages have been announced.\n\nSheriff Ronnie Fields has said whoever fired at the substations “knew exactly what they were doing.” No group “has stepped up to acknowledge or accept they’re the ones who (did) it,” the sheriff said Sunday.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning there were 35,000 customers without power, but that number had decreased to 1,200 by the time a 4 p.m. news conference began, according to Duke Energy spokesperson Jeff Brooks. A few hours later the company’s website showed zero outages in the area.\n\nGiven the information, county officials said a nightly curfew will end for good at 5 a.m. Thursday.\n\nShell casings and bullets offer clues\n\nBullets recovered from the sites, and the brass shell casings found a short distance away, are the few pieces of physical evidence that investigators have.\n\nBecause of the heat generated in a high-powered rifle’s chamber during rapid fire, fingerprints are burned away – and nearly impossible to recover from spent casings. Still, the brass may offer valuable clues.\n\nInvestigators can enter the casings into the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, a database from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The database records three-dimensional images of shell casings and can match them to any other shell casings that may have been fired by the same gun at another crime scene or to the gun if the weapon is recovered.\n\nThe spot where the casings were found can give investigators a way to pinpoint the firing positions. Knowing where the shooter fired from could lead to discoveries such as shoe prints and tire tracks.\n\nResidents head to shelter for hot food and showers\n\nFor now, schools are closed through Thursday, many stores and restaurants are shut, homes are without heating or running refrigerators, drivers are traversing intersections with no traffic lights.\n\nNakasha Jackson, who came to the shelter to pick up some hot food, said the outage has been difficult with her 1-year-old child. CNN\n\nA Red Cross-run emergency shelter was set up at the Moore County Sports Complex to help provide shelter, food, showers and other services to people impacted. It will remain as a shelter through noon on Thursday, officials said.\n\nNakasha Jackson, who came to the shelter to pick up some hot food, said the outage has been difficult for her 1-year-old child.\n\n“No lights, no power, can’t really do nothing. The kid is scared of the dark,” she told CNN.\n\nJackson said sometimes she has to travel up to an hour one way to buy food. “It’s ridiculous. It should never have been done,” Jackson said.\n\nResidents who rely on electricity-powered medical equipment have also seen their lives upended. One woman told CNN she came to the shelter because she had no power for her CPAP machine at night.\n\nAfter two days of sleeping without it, she said she began to feel ill and came into the shelter for help.\n\nOthers have sought shelter fearing for their safety as they struggled to keep their homes warm.\n\n“It’s different. It’s kind of hard to sleep, you know. But at the end of the day, I’d rather be somewhere where it’s warm, where we have food, where we’re taken care of than to be somewhere it’s freezing cold,” said Amber Sampson.\n\nOn top of having to stay at the shelter, Sampson hasn’t been able to work since Sunday after her employer also lost power – an issue that could end up costing her hundreds of dollars.\n\nAuthorities have expressed anger over the attack, with Carol Haney, mayor of Southern Pines – a town of about 15,900 residents that completely lost power – calling it a cruel and selfish act.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper voiced concern over businesses and residents in nursing homes.\n\n“When we look at all the money that’s being lost by businesses here at Christmastime, when we look at threats to people in nursing homes having lost power, hospitals having to run off generators and not being able to do certain kinds of operations at this point – all of those are deep concerns here, and we can’t let this happen,” the Democrat told CNN on Tuesday.\n\n“This was a malicious, criminal attack on the entire community.”", "authors": ["John Miller Steve Almasy Whitney Wild", "John Miller", "Steve Almasy", "Whitney Wild"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/05/30/george-floyd-death-nashville-tennessee-protest-may-john-cooper/5286837002/", "title": "Protests in downtown Nashville: Arrests made for those out after ...", "text": "12:06 a.m., Sunday, May 31\n\nNashville Mayor John Cooper released a video late Saturday, condemning the vandalism from people rioting downtown after a peaceful protest earlier in the day.\n\n\"Our Metro Courthouse, iconic for its role in the Civil Rights movement, was the site of much of tonight's reprehensible vandalism,\" Cooper said in part of his video address.\n\nWatch his entire announcement, including information about the current curfew in place, below.\n\n11:07 p.m.\n\nNashville police say no police officers were injured.

The officers rounded the building and moved on.\n\nIn another area of the downtown protests, a woman began yelling at the line of police in ballistic gear about Daniel Hambrick being wrongly killed, yelling that officer Andrew Delke should be brought to justice.\n\nIn January Nashville grand jury indicted Delke on a first-degree murder charge in the fatal shooting of Hambrick, moving the unprecedented case closer to a criminal trial.\n\n5:55 p.m. update:\n\nA series of officers in riot gear with masks, helmets and batons just arrived at the front of the Central Precinct in downtown Nashville.\n\nThe crowd has converged around them.

They didn’t interact with the demonstrators.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nNashville Mayor John Cooper said he would attend a Saturday afternoon rally protesting police brutality and racism following the death of George Floyd.\n\nCooper encouraged members of the city council to join him at the 3 p.m. rally at Legislative Plaza, which follows a wave of protests in other cities. The mayor said it was \"an especially critical time for all of us, as Metro’s leaders, to show up and listen to black voices speaking out from across Davidson County.\"\n\nFloyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer kept a knee pressed into his neck for more than eight minutes. The officer, Derek Michael Chauvin, 44, was arrested and charged with murder.\n\nFloyd's death intensified anger and frustration for many who say it is an example of pervasive racism among law enforcement nationwide. Protests have swept through many major cities.\n\nFriday night protests in Memphis and Knoxville were peaceful, but violence has erupted during protests in Minneapolis, Louisville and Atlanta.\n\nOrganizers of the Nashville rally said they wanted to create a peaceful and safe space for people to express their grief and call for change.\n\nOrganizer Hamid Abdullah said Floyd's death had become a tipping point within the movement against racism and police brutality.\n\n\"More people are coming together. More people are listening. More people are paying attention,\" Abdullah said. \"People are fed up with brutality and they want to do something.\"\n\nAbdullah said he welcomed \"all people of good will\" to the rally. He said he hoped Cooper would understand the need to make changes to prevent similar deaths in the future.\n\n\"We are looking to have a peaceful rally,\" he said. \"We want to make sure that our people are heard. We want to make sure our people are respected.\"\n\nThe ongoing debate over policing and racial bias has been a prominent part of life in Nashville for years. In 2018, local activists spurred a citywide vote that created the Community Oversight Board, a civilian panel that investigates allegations of police misconduct.\n\nThe vote came after a white police officer shot Daniel Hambrick, 25, a black man, while he was running away during a foot pursuit. That officer, Andrew Delke, 26, was arrested and charged with murder. The case is pending.\n\nReach Adam Tamburin at 615-726-5986 and atamburin@tennessean.com.

The protests, colloquially known as the \"Freedom Convoy,\" began in late January after the Canadian government started requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for drivers crossing the U.S. border.

However, the post is wrong to claim protesters saw no consequences – in fact, over 10,000 protesters were arrested, most for low-level offenses.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Wright and The Right View of the United States for comment.\n\nProtest-related damages cost about $2 billion, according to estimate\n\nDamages caused by the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests were estimated to cost $2 billion, a number that could \"still go higher,\" according to a February 2021 report published on the World Economic Forum's website.\n\nThe report was authored by the head of Property Claim Services, which has tracked protest-related insurance claims for decades. The group found that 2020 protests cost more than any other period of unrest in American history, as the average cost of demonstrations since 1950 has been about $90 million annually.\n\nOther cost estimates support Property Claim Services' $2 billion figure.\n\nFact check:Posts mislead about crowd size, peacefulness at Canada ‘Freedom Convoy’ protest\n\nAxios reported in September 2020 that the Insurance Information Institute, which collects data from Property Claim Services and related firms, estimated that damages could total “as much as 2 billion and possibly more.”\n\nThousands of protesters arrested in 2020\n\nContrary to the claim in the post, many Black Lives Matter protesters did face consequences. Estimates vary, but news outlets reported thousands of protesters were arrested in the months following Floyd’s death in May 2020.\n\nA June 22, 2020, article from The Washington Post tallied over 14,000 arrests made since May 27. The Hill reported over 17,000 arrests had been made in the first two weeks of protests.\n\nDespite the large number of arrests, The Hill reported most of those protesters were booked not for violent crimes, but for low-level offenses such as violating curfews. Obstructing roadways and carrying open containers were other reasons for the arrests, as well as “failure to disperse.”\n\nSome more serious charges were filed as well, however. The Associated Press reported hundreds were charged with burglary and looting as of June 4, 2020.\n\nIn October 2020, researchers writing for The Washington Post analyzed 7,305 protest events and found police made arrests at 5% of them.

The city recorded a 41% increase in overall major crime through the first months of 2022 compared to the same period last year, including a nearly 54% increase in robberies, a 56% increase in grand larceny incidents and a 22% increase in rape reports, the data shows.\n\n“We’ve got to get it right,” Adams said Friday. “Two months in, we’re executing our plan and we’re going to defeat crime. I’m clear on that.”\n\nMurders increased by 10%, while citywide shooting incidents decreased by 1.3%, with 77 incidents in February 2021 and 76 incidents last month, NYPD data shows.\n\nAs the violent crime wave continues, most of the incidents are occurring in a small fraction of the city’s neighborhoods, according to Christopher Herrmann, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former crime analyst supervisor with the NYPD.\n\n“The violent crime problem isn’t spreading much,” Herrmann said. “The huge increase in hate crimes and subway crimes are all really just an increase of more people being outside.”\n\nThe city reported 85 hate crimes through the first two months of 2022, a significant increase from the 35 hate crimes reported during the same period last year, NYPD data shows.\n\n“The men and women of the New York City Police Department are proactively addressing the deep-rooted causes of criminal behavior,” said Police Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell in a statement. “The NYPD will never relent, and the department has made far too much progress over the decades – and invested far too much in the communities it serves – to fall back by any measure. New Yorkers deserve better.”\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams and New York Governor Kathy Hochul leave the funeral for fallen NYPD officer Wilbert Mora at St. Patrick's Cathedral on February 02, 2022 in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty\n\nAdams unveiled his ‘Blueprint to End Gun Violence’ in January, which includes long-term goals to grow economic opportunities, improve child education and provide more access to mental health resources while addressing the gun crisis.\n\nHerrmann said the mayor and the police commissioner are tasked with driving “this really fine line between proactive policing, precision policing and not marginalizing people that are already marginalized.” He emphasized that high crime areas have already suffered the most – both in economic opportunity and increases in crime – during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNYPD officials, including Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz, held a press conference earlier this week to discuss the ongoing efforts to stop the proliferation of privately made ghost guns, which are not branded with a serial number. The department recovered 85 ghost guns so far this year compared to 20 recovered during the same period in 2021, the city said.\n\nNYPD Inspector Courtney Nilan said that the increase in ghost guns is “alarming” as they become a daily encounter for police. Officers are recovering ghost guns in responding to domestic violence incidents, robberies involving a firearm and car stops, Nilan said.\n\nTransit crimes increase as mayor rolls out safety plan\n\nCrime in New York reached historic lows over the past three decades before numbers started to go up in 2020, a spate that has continued over the last two years and mirrors what is being felt in big cities around the country. The number of major crimes reported in February 2022 – 9,138 – represents a 19.7% from 2020 and a nearly 47% increase from 2019, city data shows.\n\nSince the beginning of 2022, there have been 375 transit crimes, a jump of nearly 73% compared to the same period in 2021 that recorded 217 transit crimes, according to city data. This comes as ridership in the city’s transit system continues to increase but has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) recorded the highest ridership on March 1 since the start of the pandemic, with over 3.1 million riders on the subway, compared to just 1.7 million on the same day in 2021, MTA data shows.\n\nThe MTA reported 1,778 transit crimes in 2021, a slight increase over the 1,759 crimes reported in 2020 and a decrease from 2,524 transit crimes in 2019. In March 2020, before the lockdown hit, there were over 5 million riders on the subway, city data shows.\n\nThe New York City subway system, the nation's largest, has come under increasing scrutiny following the violent death of 40-year old Michelle Go in the Times Square subway station. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThe significant increase comes as Adams begins to roll out his comprehensive plan to combat crime and address homelessness in the subway system that will expand response teams of health, police and community officials across the city.\n\n“We are days into the first part of a long-term effort to connect New Yorkers to services and set them on a path to permanent housing and stability,” Adams said in a statement on Friday. “The systemic challenges facing people experiencing homelessness and living with serious mental illness developed over decades, and will take time to fix.”\n\nAdams unveiled the plan alongside Gov. Kathy Hochul last month, highlighting the local, state and federal resources the city will employ to combat mental health and safety amid a concerning spate of violent crime incidents occurring within the transit system.\n\nAfter the city’s announcement in late February, eight violent incidents occurred in a three-day period the following weekend on various subway platforms spanning several boroughs, including at least six people who were stabbed or slashed, CNN reported.\n\nThe joint initiative involves the deployment of up to 30 inter-agency collaborative teams that bring together the Department of Homeless Services (DHS), the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), the NYPD and community-based providers in “high-need” locations, the plan states.\n\nMayor revives ‘anti-crime unit’ in response to violence\n\nIn January, major crimes were up by nearly 38% when compared to January 2021, NYPD data shows. While there were six fewer murders in January 2022 than in the previous year, there were increases seen across every other major crime category tracked by the NYPD for the same period.\n\nThe mayor’s plan to combat gun violence in the city aims to bolster the NYPD’s efforts to fight crime with “targeted, precision policing,” focusing on the 30 precincts where 80% of the violence occurs while expanding the anti-violence Crisis Management System (CMS) to address the symptoms of gun violence, Adams said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden visited New York City in February to discuss combating gun violence with state and local leaders, which included an appearance at a public school in Queens for a talk with community leaders.\n\nThe mayor resurrected the NYPD’s controversial anti-crime unit in January in response to a wave of violence during his first month in office, including a Harlem shooting that left two police officers dead after responding to domestic incident and the death of Michelle Alyssa Go, a woman who was pushed to her death in front of a Times Square subway train.\n\nThe anti-crime unit, which was disbanded in August 2020 following racial justice protests and unrest across the country, was rebranded as Neighborhood Safety Teams tasked with patrolling high-crime neighborhoods.\n\n“We cannot rely on NYPD to arrest its way out of our ongoing increasing crime wave,” said Herrmann of John Jay College. “We need to try other crime prevention programs and develop new neighborhood and community partnerships that focus on crime prevention as a longer-term strategy.”", "authors": ["Emma Tucker Mark Morales", "Emma Tucker", "Mark Morales"], "publish_date": "2022/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/09/jake-angeli-qanon-man-fur-hat-horns-capitol-riot-arrested/6609039002/", "title": "Jake Angeli, QAnon man in fur hat, horns during Capitol riot, arrested", "text": "PHOENIX – The QAnon-supporting man who briefly took the dais during the storming of the U.S. Capitol — while wearing a fur hat topped with buffalo horns and wielding a spear — has been arrested, the Justice Department announced Saturday.\n\nJake Angeli, of Phoenix, had been on the list of persons the Metropolitan Police of Washington D.C. said it wanted the public’s help in finding after the deadly siege of the Capitol building Wednesday by supporters of President Donald Trump.\n\nAngeli was charged with knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and with violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\n\nHe was taken into custody Saturday morning in Phoenix, according to the Justice Department. He's expected to have an initial appearance in federal court next week in Phoenix, a Justice spokesperson told The Arizona Republic.\n\nHe was among three men charged on Saturday in federal court in connection with the riots.\n\nDozens chargedin Capitol siege, including man carrying Pelosi's lectern\n\nIn a statement of facts, filed to secure an arrest warrant for Angeli, a Capitol Police special agent said he was able to identify Angeli through his “unique attire and extensive tattoos covering his arms and left side of his torso.\n\nAngeli, according to the statement of facts, called the FBI on his own Thursday and confirmed he was the person who briefly was at the dais of the U.S. Senate.\n\nAngeli told the FBI he came to D.C. “as part of a group effort, with other ‘patriots’ from Arizona, at the request of the President that all ‘patriots’ come to D.C. on January 6, 2021,” the statement of facts reads.\n\nThe affidavit and arrest warrant were signed by a magistrate judge on Friday.\n\nThe Justice Department's release said that Angeli was the man seen in extensive media coverage \"dressed in horns, a bearskin headdress, red, white and blue face paint, shirtless, and tan pants. This individual carried a spear, approximately 6 feet in length, with an American flag tied just below the blade,\" according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe Justice Department identified him as \"Jacob Anthony Chansley, a.k.a. Jake Angeli, of Arizona.\"\n\nCapitol riot Saturday updates:FBI looking for man in Senate with zip ties, tactical gear\n\nThough he identified himself publicly as Angeli, court records show he petitioned to have his name legally changed to Jacob Anthony Angeli Chansley in 2005.\n\nIn the court petition, he wrote, “I want my last name to be that of my step-father, my dad. I was not legally adopted by my step-father while a minor.” He said Angeli was his mother’s last name.\n\nAlso charged Saturday were Derrick Evans, a recently elected member of the West Virginia House of Delegates, and Adam Johnson of Florida, who was photographed carrying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lectern Wednesday.\n\nAngeli was recognizable to Arizonans as soon as images of the Capitol raid emerged. For the past two years, he had appeared in similar garb, becoming a fixture at political rallies, marches and protests. Besides his attention-getting outfit, Angeli had a booming voice that, without need of amplification, could be easily heard among a crowd.\n\nAngeli, reached on his cell phone on the night of the Capitol invasion, refused an interview with The Arizona Republic, unhappy with his portrayal in previous stories and videos.\n\nHowever, he did speak with NBC News on Thursday, as he was beginning his return trip to Arizona.\n\n'This was really big': Far-right extremist groups use Capitol attack to recruit new members\n\nAngeli told NBC News he thought the day was a political success. “The fact that we had a bunch of our traitors in office hunker down, put on their gas masks and retreat into their underground bunker,\" he said. \"I consider that a win.\"\n\nHe also said he didn’t do anything wrong by entering the U.S. Capitol. “I walked through an open door, dude,” he said.\n\nPhotos showed Angeli, at one point, assuming the dais of the U.S. Senate. It was the same spot where Vice President Mike Pence had stood earlier that day to preside over the joint session of Congress that was set to certify the election for Joe Biden.\n\nThat session was delayed for some six hours as Senators and Representatives were hustled out of the chambers and into safety.\n\nAngeli became one of dozens of people arrested and charged out of the events of that day.\n\nIn a conference call of federal officials on Friday, January 8, Steven D'Antuono, assistant director in charge of the FBI Washington field office, said, “Just because you've left the D.C. region, you can still expect a knock on your door if we find out you were part of the criminal activity at the Capitol.”\n\nCapitol Police officer Brian Sicknick who died after pro-Trump riot was veteran and war critic\n\nThe Republic interviewed Angeli during 2020 as part of a series of stories and a mini-documentary on the Patriot movement in Arizona, the increasingly powerful right-wing of the Republican party. Some adherents promoted conspiracy theories including the baseless idea of QAnon.\n\nAngeli lived in Phoenix, but it was not clear what he did for a living.\n\nHe was listed on a webpage for voice-over actor for hire. He also sold online courses in shamanistic studies. He said he also volunteered for an arts organization in Phoenix that worked with at-risk youth.\n\nA few days a week – when the spirit moved him, Angeli told the Republic in a 2020 interview – he would stand alone outside the Arizona State Capitol and shout diatribes at the buildings, regardless of whether the legislature was in session or not.\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Angeli was at nearly every march, rally or protest in the Phoenix area. After Election Day, Angeli was among the crowd that protested outside elections headquarters as the counting went on inside. He seemed to take a leadership role, often being one of the featured speakers.\n\nAngeli typically carried a cardboard sign that looked intentionally weathered. It read: Q Sent Me.\n\nIt was a reference to the QAnon conspiracy theory that Angeli believed and wished to share with others.\n\nHow QAnon and other dark forces are radicalizing Americans\n\nQAnon is a wide-ranging conspiracy theory. But its central belief is this: A government official with top-secret “Q” clearance anonymously posted cryptic clues about secret investigations being conducted by Trump into a \"deep state\" cabal of elites that controlled a child sex trafficking ring.\n\nAngeli said that his research into the secretive groups he believes control the world — Illuminati, Trilateral Commission and Bilderberg group, among others — predated the rise of the QAnon movement.\n\n“When you really do enough research,” he said, “it all ties together.”\n\nAnne Ryman contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/25/us/minneapolis-crime-defund-invs/index.html", "title": "Once nicknamed \"Murderapolis,\" the city that made itself the center ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMarnette Gordon was doing laundry at home in Minneapolis one summer morning last year when a call came from her 36-year-old son.\n\nShe figured her son, Telly Blair, was checking in to see if she wanted a soda from a gas station down the street, where he often went for fuel and snacks.\n\n“Mom, I’ve been shot,” he said. “Call the police!”\n\nMarnette, her other son Tamarcus and his 12-year-old daughter rushed to the gas station from their home in the city’s north side, a part of town long beset by violent crime.\n\nBlair’s family came upon his blue 1986 Chevy Caprice at pump No. 5 — beating police and paramedics by a few minutes, they said — only to find him slumped in his car, bleeding from multiple bullet wounds in his chest. A 17-year-old male in an orange hoodie had fired nine rounds from a handgun into Blair’s car before running off.\n\nWhile an off-duty nurse in scrubs who’d been at the gas station tried to stop his bleeding, Marnette — a heart-transplant recipient — couldn’t bear to watch and stood at a distance. Telly was her caretaker.\n\n“It was just horrible to see him sitting there, waiting on the ambulance,” she told CNN.\n\nThe 12-year-old called 911 while watching her uncle struggle to breathe.\n\n“Oh my God, please,” the girl, who was crying, said to a dispatcher, according to 911 transcripts of the August 9, 2021 shooting obtained by CNN. “Hurry up, hurry up, hurry, hurry, he’s dead, hurry up!”\n\nTelly Blair was among 93 people who were murdered in Minneapolis last year, city crime data shows. That’s just a few shy of the total killings in 1995, when the city earned the nickname “Murderapolis.” (Neighboring St. Paul witnessed 38 murders last year — a historic high.)\n\nA photo of Telly Blair and his mother, Marnette, rests on a table in their home in north Minneapolis. Marnette Gordon, 61, mother of Telly Blair, 36, who lost his life to gun violence in north Minneapolis, photographed in her home.\n\nAfter the police murder of George Floyd in May of 2020, Minneapolis became a worldwide symbol of the police brutality long endured disproportionately by Black people. In a kind of Newtonian response, the city became the epicenter of the culturally seismic “Defund the Police” movement. But that progressive local effort fizzled with a decisive referendum last November.\n\nNow, with its police department under investigation by the Department of Justice, the city of 425,000 is trying to find a way forward amid a period of heightened crime that began shortly after Floyd’s death.\n\nThat year, the number of murders soared to nearly 80 — dwarfing the 2019 body count of 46. It has cooled somewhat this year, though the amount of killing — and violent crime in general — remains elevated far above 2019 levels and homicides are on pace to surpass the 2020 figure. The reasons why are far from clear.\n\nKG Wilson, a longtime resident of the Twin Cities, said police withdrew from violent neighborhoods in the aftermath of Floyd’s killing — a common sentiment among locals.\n\n“The criminals were celebrating. They were getting rich,” he said. “They were selling drugs openly.”\n\nWilson told CNN the violence devastated his own family: His 6-year-old granddaughter was killed in May of 2021 after getting caught in the crossfire of a gunfight in north Minneapolis. The culprit remains at large.\n\nAnother factor was the pandemic, which some observers see as the biggest impetus for the crime surge.\n\n“It unsettled settled trajectories,” said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. “Kids who were going to school, who would have graduated but drifted off because there is no school — we’re seeing a lot of the violent crime is by juveniles.”\n\nCiting sinking morale in the wake of the unrest after Floyd’s killing, leaders at the Minneapolis Police Department say the officer head count has shrunk from 900 in early 2020 to about 560 in August — a loss of more than a third of the force.\n\nKG Wilson created a memorial for his granddaughter Aniya Allen in his SUV. The car seat cover of her face rests on the seat where she would ride with him. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the political pendulum on public-safety matters in this reliably liberal city — the “Mini Apple” hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1973, and that was for just a single day — seems to have swung away from a progressive mindset towards the middle.\n\nAnd on matters of public safety, the middle is where many of the city’s Black residents already were.\n\nLast year, progressives touted a ballot measure that was said to be a referendum on the “defund” concept. Question 2, as it was known locally, would have replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a new “public health-oriented” Department of Public Safety and removed a minimum staffing requirement from the city charter.\n\nIt failed in November, with 56% of voters rejecting it. That figure was 61% in north Minneapolis, a pair of neighboring city wards where Blacks make up a strong plurality of the roughly 66,000 residents. All but one of the 17 precincts in the north voted against the measure.\n\n“We did not believe that the police should be defunded, but we do believe in police reforms,” said Bishop Richard Howell of Shiloh Temple, a north-side church founded more than 90 years ago.\n\nRae McKay-Anderson — Telly Blair’s sister — said “you can’t possibly defund the police in a way that’s going to benefit the Black community.”\n\nDealing the final blow to the local “defund” movement last year was a city council vote to essentially refund a cut they’d made the prior year. Mayor Jacob Frey is proposing another budget bump for the next two fiscal years.\n\nThe question of the moment is, if the police budget has been restored, and if all the anti-cop shouting by politicians and activists that left officers demoralized has weakened to a whimper, why are citizens — especially in the rough parts of north Minneapolis — still feeling neglected by police and fearful for their safety?\n\nA feeling of lawlessness, a sense of neglect\n\nResidents of the north side describe a landscape that can feel lawless. Indeed, about 60% of police calls for shots fired this year have come from the area, even though it makes up just 15% of the population, according to city data.\n\nPaul Johnson, 56, said young men openly sell drugs during the day in public places, such as a gas station on Broadway Avenue that has been dubbed the “murder station” due to all of the fatal shootings there. (It is near the one where Blair was killed.)\n\n“You pull up to get gas – they try to sell you drugs,” he said. “And not just three or four, but it’s a bulk of people.”\n\nThe perception among many residents is that the police ignore the area.\n\n“They just let it go on,” said Johnson’s friend, Brian Bogan, 42, who said he moved from north Minneapolis to relatively safer St. Paul due to his kids growing up in an area where they don’t know if “it’s fireworks or gunshots.”\n\nA memorial for Aniya Allen lay on the ground of the corner store near where she was shot in north Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nWhile Minneapolis is far from the nation’s most dangerous city, its rate of increase in homicides — the count in 2021 was about double that of 2019 — is among the highest in the nation, said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri- St. Louis and co-author of an annual study on crime trends.\n\nOn per-capita murders, it has ranked fairly high — 19th out of 70 jurisdictions in the US — during the first half of this year, according to the Major Cities Chiefs Association. The city ranked even higher on other per-capita crime measures, such as robbery (4th), rape (8th) and aggravated assault (13th).\n\nJuliee Oden, 56, can’t even count the times she has called 911 to report gunfire outside her north-side home. One night last summer, a volley of shots jolted her out of bed while she was watching TV — it was coming from her front lawn.\n\n“I hit the floor,” she said. “My phone went flying. I had to crawl on my stomach to get to the phone” to dial 911.\n\nIt got to the point where it was hard to sleep at night and Oden, who works at a construction company, had colleagues install a bulletproof panel behind the headboard of her bed.\n\n“Now I go in my room with complete confidence,” she said. “If somebody is to shoot directly at my house, I know: As long as I’m behind my headboard, I’m 100% safe.”\n\nOden was among eight residents in north Minneapolis who filed a lawsuit in the summer of 2020 calling on the city to replenish the police department by filling vacant positions. The suit singled out city council members who supported the “radical ‘dismantle the police’” idea and accused them and Mayor Frey of creating a “hostile” environment for the police. It was largely upheld by a state Supreme Court decision this summer — meaning the city needs to staff up to at least 731 police officers.\n\nDoug Seaton, an attorney representing the eight residents, said the successful suit was filed in direct response to how progressive city council members had embraced the “defund” idea. It demoralized the police department and ultimately led to a mass exodus of officers, he said.\n\n“That is, we think, the major reason that crime has spiked throughout the city and hasn’t gone away yet,” Seaton said.\n\nMeanwhile, as the MPD headcount has shrunk, wait times have grown for people who call 911 to report serious “priority 1” incidents, which can include shots fired, robberies, assaults and mental health crises.\n\nAverage 911 response times jumped the very month of Floyd’s death — May of 2020 — from around 10 or 11 minutes early that year to 14 minutes, according to public records obtained by CNN. They kept rising in 2021 to 16 minutes; response times in the north side’s fourth precinct last year actually surpassed 17 minutes, where they remain.\n\nSome nights are so busy that the dispatchers are directed to hold all non-priority-1 calls citywide; these would include reports of property damage, suspicious persons or theft. That happened during a frenetic five-hour stretch on the night of September 8, when officers responded to multiple shootings and calls for shots fired — many of them in north Minneapolis; one near the “murder station” — that left two dead and seven wounded.\n\nThe Minneapolis Police Department has even flatly refused to respond to certain crimes in a timely manner. One couple who run a property management business recently took it upon themselves to investigate the theft of their van, box truck and tools by a culprit who brought the stolen goods into a homeless encampment on the north side, according to local news reports.\n\nPolice told KARE 11 that the hostility towards police on the part of some encampment dwellers compels them to take a slower approach when investigating property crimes there.\n\nBut by and large, police officials have said the slower response times are the expected byproduct of a depleted force that has witnessed an overwhelming wave of retirements, resignations and disability leaves due to post-traumatic stress.\n\nMuch of that exodus owes to a bottoming out of morale in the wake of a crisis that left police officers feeling reviled, said interim Minneapolis Police Chief Amelia Huffman.\n\n“There’s really been a very fundamental challenge to our sense of purpose in law enforcement,” Huffman said of the post-Floyd era. “(Minneapolis) is the eye of the storm. So all of those challenges and the pressure is magnified, you know, a hundred fold – a thousand fold.”\n\nSimilar headcount plunges have plagued police departments from coast to coast.\n\nSome law enforcement officials have attributed the mass resignations and retirements to pandemic-related reasons, but Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith of the National Police Association said morale is a major factor.\n\n“It’s no secret that law enforcement … especially in the last two and a half years, has been badly vilified and wrongly vilified,” she told CNN. “You can’t call an entire profession racist and expect people to just sit back and say, okay, you know, keep piling on.”\n\nThe gas station where Telly Blair was fatally shot in north Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nIn June, the embattled Minneapolis department was hit with more bad press — this time for its abysmal numbers on unsolved murders in recent years.\n\nSince 2016, the clearance rate (or the percentage of homicide cases closed) in Minneapolis sank from around 54% — the most recent national average — to 38% in 2020, according to the latest available data from the FBI. Figures for last year haven’t been released by the FBI, but Huffman insists the rate has improved considerably, claiming that the unofficial figure for this year to date is back to 54%.\n\nEven so, some family members of murder victims say they have felt compelled to take a lead role in the homicide investigations of their own loved ones.\n\nResidents take matters into their own hands\n\nAmong them is Dorothy Royston, a 26-year-old healthcare professional who said she spent weeks proactively feeding police information shortly after her unarmed younger brother, Charles Royston Jr., was gunned down on a snowy street in north Minneapolis on a January night in 2021, according to police reports.\n\n“They had a lot of the information or the logistics of what was – like bullet casings and stuff like that,” Dorothy said. “But when it comes to who was involved with the actual shooting, who was around – and the people information? I actually provided that to the police.”\n\nDorothy provided CNN with text messages between her and a lead investigator on the case. In February of 2021, the investigator told her in a message that there would be a warrant out for the arrest of a suspect by the next day. He still hasn’t been arrested, Dorothy said.\n\nShe said communications from the investigator fell off around March of 2021.\n\nA couple months ago, about a year and a half after the killing, Dorothy said, she called the investigator to ask for an update.\n\n“He told me that he was currently doing something and that he would call me back,” she said. “He never called me back.”\n\n(The investigator agreed to talk with CNN, but a police spokesperson called off the interview. )\n\nTaken together, the current state of crime and policing in Minneapolis — from slow response times to recent brutality complaints to the poor clearance rates — has fostered an atmosphere of distrust.\n\nThe distrust paves the way for some to assume bad intentions. Dave Bicking, a board member of the Minneapolis-based Community United Against Police Brutality, goes so far as to suggest the police since Floyd’s death may have engaged in a “sickout” — that is, that officers are purposefully sluggish to respond to or investigate certain crimes.\n\n“It’s still going on to a considerable extent — it was dramatic in the beginning,” Bicking told CNN. “The police would simply, if they showed up at all, say, ‘Oh, we don’t have anybody to deal with that,’ or ‘You people don’t want us here, so we’re not going to do anything.’”\n\nDave Bicking outside his facility, Communities United Against Police Brutality, in Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nBicking, who has been publicly critical of the “defund” tactic from the get-go, said he bases the sickout claim on a drop-off in jail bookings shortly after Floyd’s death and on more than 2,300 interviews the CUAPB has conducted over the past year and a half with Minneapolis residents about their experiences with the MPD.\n\nHe added that the CUAPB persuaded the Department of Justice to include in its investigation of the MPD the alleged lack of Minneapolis police investigations into murders of people of color.\n\nChief Huffman did not respond to follow-up questions related to sickout allegations, but in her earlier interview with CNN she said Minneapolis has unique challenges.\n\nFor one, she said, Minneapolis has a relatively low rate of domestic murders, which are typically easier to solve, and a high rate of gang murders, which are more difficult.\n\nBut the bigger factor again comes down to attrition. Huffman said the Minneapolis Police Department has lost about 100 investigators in its investigations bureau since early 2020.\n\nStill, Huffman said the MPD is committed to solving homicides, adding that unsolved murders can have serious negative repercussions that ripple through communities for years and devastate families.\n\n“The lack of justice for families who have had family members murdered is completely unacceptable,” she said. “And it’s incumbent on us to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to solve those cases.”\n\nHuffman’s new boss, Cedric Alexander — who was hired in August as the city’s first ever community safety commissioner — said he understands the community’s frustration.\n\n“When you have a body drop and another body drops and another body drops, what you have oftentimes is ongoing violence – it certainly does overwhelm an agency that already is struggling with a great deal of shortages,” he told CNN. “It does give people the perception nothing is being done. But I can assure you that it is. And in any of these violent cases where we have victims, it is taken at a very high priority.”\n\nHow ‘defund’ failed\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is shouted at by protesters at a Defund the Police march in early June of 2020 to protest the police killing of George Floyd. (Victor J. Blue/The New York Times/Redux) Victor J. Blue/The New York Times/Redux\n\nIn June of 2020, nine of the Minneapolis City Council’s 13 members stood on a stage adorned with an oversized sign saying “DEFUND POLICE.”\n\nAround the same time, in another spectacle that made national news, Mayor Frey was booed and jeered by activists at a George Floyd protest near his home for saying — in response to a question — that he did not support “the full abolition of police.” As he walked away, the crowd broke into a “Go home Jacob!” chant.\n\n“It was a lonely walk,” Frey told CNN recently. “At that moment there was a very loud chorus of people, including elected officials … that were all calling very loudly to defund the police.”\n\nIt’s well established that those widely viewed events boosted a movement in Minneapolis that would later fail at the polls last November. Lesser known is how the very community most directly impacted by crime and policing in the city — the north side — was among the least supportive of the “defund” idea.\n\n“I think what’s at issue is the White progressives’ belief that they’re helping us,” said Lisa Clemons, a former Minneapolis police officer, who is Black and runs a gun-violence organization called A Mother’s Love in north Minneapolis. “Oftentimes they are hurting us.”\n\nClemons said people in north Minneapolis don’t want to get rid of cops – “they just want respectful cops.”\n\nLisa Clemons, a resident of north Minneapolis and former cop, at the Northside Community Center at Cub Foods. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nMinneapolis voters not only resoundingly rejected what was seen as the “defund” initiative, they also voted to strengthen the office of the mayor and reelected Frey, who’d become a local avatar for moderate Democrats put off by the party’s most liberal wing.\n\nThe Minneapolis area with the largest Black population — Ward 5 on the north side — also proved a strong base of support for Frey in his reelection, according to a CNN analysis of voter data.\n\nFrey said that while no demographic group is a monolith, White progressives in the aftermath of Floyd’s death often seemed out of sync with ordinary Black residents.\n\n“I heard a lot of White activists purport to be speaking on behalf of communities of color. And I was listening to them — listening to communities of color — and they weren’t saying the same things,” Frey said. “I’d walk down the street and I’d hear from White people, ‘Defund the police! Defund the police!’ And then I’d hear from a Black person a half block later, ‘Hey, we really need to have some additional help.’”\n\nSheila Nezhad, a community organizer who turned out to be one of Frey’s most competitive mayoral opponents in November, noted that turnout was lower in north Minneapolis than the citywide average, and that the advocacy group — called Yes 4 Minneapolis — that proposed the ballot measure that came to be seen as the “defund” referendum was led by Black people.\n\n“And I’m not White,” she said. “So when Jacob Frey talks about only White people want to defund or whatever … I think that he is perhaps shaping the narrative to benefit his political goals.”\n\nEven before Floyd’s killing, the MPD had drawn criticism for its approach to policing the Black community.\n\nIn 2016, anti-police protests erupted after it was announced that two Minneapolis officers involved in the shooting death of Jamar Clark – a 24-year-old Black man who scuffled with the officers and, according to authorities, reached for one of their guns — would not be charged. Two years later, after responding to calls of a man shooting a gun in the air, police chased and fatally shot 31-year-old Thurman Blevins, who said “please don’t shoot me” as he ran away from them; body cameras showed officers yelling at him to drop his gun. Police say Blevins turned with his gun toward the officers, who ultimately were not charged.\n\nAnd then came May 25, 2020. In a nine-minute video that seemed to last an eternity, a police officer defiantly knelt on the neck of a handcuffed, face-down Floyd, whose pleas for help went unanswered until he fell silent. Now infamous, the officer, Derek Chauvin – who’d already had 18 prior complaints filed against him – was convicted of Floyd’s murder and sentenced to 21 years in federal prison.\n\nA person holds a sign displaying a portrait of George Floyd during a vigil at an art installation honoring victims of police burtaliuty in Minneapolis in June 2020. (Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images) Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“For me, it was a moment of deep grief,” said Nezhad, who still wants to abolish the Minneapolis Police Department. “And the days that followed offered a glimpse into just how ready so many people are for massive change.”\n\nIn April, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights released a report, two years in the making, charging that the Minneapolis department’s officers have engaged in a pattern or practice of race discrimination when conducting traffic stops or using force. It called for ordering a consent decree, which is essentially a court-enforced settlement to reform the department. The report also blasted the MPD for “ineffective accountability,” saying that “almost every investigation of a police misconduct complaint against an MPD officer … is assessed or guided by sworn MPD officers.”\n\nThe city is in negotiations with the human rights department over the consent decree, and Frey has indicated that some of his budget priorities are in direct response to the report.\n\nDon Samuels — a former Minneapolis City Councilman who surprised political observers this summer by nearly defeating US Rep. Ilhan Omar, an icon of progressive politics in America — said the video of Floyd’s death was the most “evil thing I had ever seen.”\n\n“That was so painful — just painful to watch and to see a Black man, of dark complexion, under the knee of a dispassionate White male,” Samuels said. “It conjured up all kinds of slavery imagery.”\n\nAnd yet, Samuels, a 73-year-old immigrant from Jamaica — who lives in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods of north Minneapolis — experienced another kind of dismay when he saw the nine council members on the Defund stage while watching the news on TV with his wife.\n\nDon Samuels, the moderate Democrat who nearly unseated US Rep. Ilhan Omar on August 9, photographed in his home in north Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\n“It was like a World Trade Center moment for us,” he told CNN. “Our jaws fell to the floor. Literally, we were aghast. We looked at each other and said, ‘Oh, my God. It’s going to be Crime City in Minneapolis.’”\n\nThat summer, Samuels joined the residents of north Minneapolis who sued the city for its police shortage. Half of the plaintiffs are Black.\n\nDuring his campaign for Congress, Samuels ran a kind of middle-ground campaign on public safety.\n\n“We don’t have to choose safety or police – we can have both/and,” Samuels said at a town hall campaign event in August. “Let’s get rid of the bad police, let’s fix the fixable police.”\n\nHe lost, but the “both/and” approach appears to be the current path that the city of Minneapolis is on.\n\n‘Both-and’: A post-Defund approach\n\nOn a morning this August, in a scene that offered a sharp contrast from two years ago — when Mayor Frey made his “lonely walk” through an angry crowd — he and Commissioner Alexander, both smartly dressed, strode triumphantly through corridors of City Hall.\n\nAlexander, a 67-year-old former deputy sheriff with a doctorate in psychology who was hand-picked by Frey, had just been confirmed as the city’s community safety commissioner in a contentious council meeting. His newly created position amounts to the first piece of Frey’s proposed plan to combine 911, police, fire, neighborhood safety and emergency management under one roof.\n\nCedric Alexander speaks about policing in America during CivicCon at the Rex Theatre in downtown Pensacola, Florida, in September 2021. (Gregg Pachkowski/News-Journal/USA Today Network) Gregg Pachkowski/USA Today Network\n\n“The number one, first priority is the fact that people in this community don’t feel that they’re safe,” said Alexander — who served on the 21st Century Task Force on Policing under former President Barack Obama — during an impromptu press conference minutes after his hiring. “The fact is that we have violent crime that’s occurring, and occurring way too frequently.”\n\nAlexander, who retired in 2017 as the public safety director in DeKalb County, Georgia, in the metro Atlanta area, added that the MPD isn’t likely to become fully staffed overnight — “probably not even in our careers” — and stressed the importance of data-driven policing and building relationships.\n\n“If we don’t build relationships with these people in our communities, you ain’t solving crime nowhere,” said Alexander, a former CNN contributor on law enforcement issues.\n\nOsler, the St. Thomas professor, said at the moment, people don’t want to work for the MPD, “where officers are not respected. And to be straight-up about it, MPD earned that lack of respect.”\n\nIn the meantime, he said, the department needs to focus on two key metrics: improving homicide clearance rates and executing search warrants for violent criminals, which, Osler acknowledged, is no easy feat.\n\n“Think about it from the perspective of the person executing that warrant,” Osler said. “You’re going to bust down the door and who you know is on the other side is someone who’s probably already shot somebody. That’s a tough job. No wonder people don’t want to do it.”\n\nExterior of the police department's 3rd Precinct in south Minneapolis that was burned by rioters in May of 2020. To this day it remains boarded up. Its officers are currently headquartered a few miles away downtown. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nOn the policy front, the wheels of change seem to be grinding forward, however slowly.\n\nSince Gov. Tim Walz signed a police accountability law two years ago that banned chokeholds and “warrior” style police training, the city of Minneapolis appears to be finding a path forward that avoids having to choose between building the police force and reimagining public safety. The city is not only looking at further beefing up the police budget but is also piloting a slate of programs that send unarmed responders to nonviolent 911 calls. Mayor Frey has proposed making them permanent in his recommended budget for 2023-2024.\n\nFrey argues that the centerpiece of his proposed public safety plan – creating a new Office of Community Safety — captures much of what the “defund” movement was after in the first place.\n\nThe concept is to “match the best possible people with what is actually being experienced on the street,” Frey said. “Anybody who was for that before but is not for it now is pretty disingenuous.”\n\nWhen it comes to hiring, the MPD is trying to entice young blood with incentives — for instance by covering the cost of tuition for potential recruits who need law-enforcement coursework but only have a high school degree. It’s a big challenge — not just because so many officers have left, but also because there is a shortage of young people across the country getting into law enforcement, Alexander said.\n\nThe city has made headway when it comes to filling the top job: Frey recently announced three finalists — all of them from outside Minneapolis — for the permanent chief position, which Huffman has filled on an interim basis since December.\n\nLast summer, the police presence in the city was so thin — and the rate of violence so high — that a group of volunteers in the faith community went to heroic measures to break the cycle.\n\nThe idea was simple. In an initiative called 21 Days of Peace, church volunteers simply hung out in some of the most deadly neighborhoods to engage in violence prevention.\n\nThe effort was considered a success, but for one volunteer it came at a cost.\n\nGloria Howard, a grandmother, had just handed out snow cones to two women with young children at one of the violence hotspots near a liquor store on Broadway Avenue when a barrage of gunfire sent people scattering.\n\nHoward crumpled to the ground. When she tried to get up, she couldn’t — she’d been shot twice.\n\nGloria Howard, a survivor of gun violence, poses for a portrait a few yards away from where she was struck by bullets in north Minneapolis. She was serving snow cones as a volunteer for 21 Days of Peace when it happened. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nPeople from a nearby church rushed out of the building to render aid and call the police.\n\n“When I got to the hospital, the doctors were like, ‘Well, you’re some lucky lady and you must be somebody special because you have no metal fragments in your body,’” Howard said. The bullets, she said, “went through and through.”\n\nHoward, who was against the “defund” initiative, said there are specific reforms she would like to see, starting with a push to require more officers to live in the city they serve.\n\n(A 2017 Star Tribune report found that just 8% of MPD officers lived in Minneapolis. Chauvin lived in the suburb of Oakdale, where nearly 72% of the residents are White.)\n\n“All Black men are not big and scary,” Howard said. “All Black women are not angry. So, you know, you have to be able to know the community.”\n\nBut she realizes that even with such reforms, improvement would take time.\n\n“I don’t even walk Broadway anymore,” Howard said, while eying the thoroughfare from a distance, close to where she was shot. “I’ve seen the cars speeding up and down when they’re chasing each other. And then when they start shooting, it can come from anywhere. So I don’t even do that anymore. And I never used to be afraid coming over here.”", "authors": ["Rob Kuznia.

He cast doubt on an imminent invasion of self-governing Taiwan, and seemed hopeful his message about avoiding all-out conflict was received.\n\nStill, the US president was frank that he and Xi came nowhere near resolving the litany of issues that have helped drive the US-China relationship to its lowest point in decades.\n\n“I’m not suggesting this is kumbaya,” Biden said at a news conference, “but I do not believe there’s a need for concern, as one of you raised a legitimate question, a new Cold War.”\n\nBiden entered Monday’s talks hoping for an opportunity to take stock with Xi of the world’s most important bilateral relationship. He described Xi as not overly confrontational but instead “the way he’s always been: direct and straightforward.”\n\n“He was clear, and I was clear that we will defend American interests and values, promote universal human rights and stand up for the international order and work in lockstep with our allies and partners,” Biden said. “We’re going to compete vigorously but I’m not looking for conflict.”\n\nIn a sign both men arrived to meeting hoping to improve the souring relationship, Biden announced his Secretary of State Antony Blinken would visit China and said officials from each country would begin working together through issues. Formal talks on climate cooperation between the US and China are expected to resume as well as part of a broader set of agreements between Biden and Xi, two US officials tell CNN.\n\nChina previously halted talks – viewed by the Biden administration as a key area where the two nations must work together – as part of retaliation for the visit to Taiwan by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The US and Chinese envoys for climate change are talking, but the Biden administration will see what China is prepared to do to make concrete progress, one of the US officials said.\n\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on whether formal climate talks between the two countries were back on.\n\nThe White House said in a statement after the meeting that Biden raised concerns about human rights and China’s provocations around Taiwan. But they found at least one area of apparent agreement – that nuclear weapons cannot be used in Ukraine, where that nation is trying to fight off a Russian invasion.\n\n“President Biden and President Xi reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won,” a White House readout said, referring to the threat of nuclear weapons use in Ukraine.\n\nBiden did underscore areas of potential cooperation with Xi, including on climate change, in talks that stretched past their expected time at a luxury hotel in Bali.\n\nAnd he sought to convince Xi that a nuclear armed North Korea was not in China’s interests – particularly because further nuclear or long-range missile tests by Pyongyang could prompt Biden to scale up American military presence in the region.\n\n“It’s difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity” to convince Kim Jong Un to back off his tests, Biden said. “I’m confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means.”\n\n‘Good to see you’\n\nThe meeting began in the later afternoon with Biden and Xi walking toward each other from opposite sides of a hotel lobby, shaking hands in front of a row of US and Chinese flags. They smiled for cameras and Xi – through a translator – appeared to say, “Good to see you.”\n\n“As leaders of our two nations, we share responsibility, in my view, to show that China and the United States can manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever nearing conflict and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation,” Biden said as the talks got underway.\n\n“The world expects, I believe, China and the United States to play key roles in addressing global challenges,” he said.\n\nSpeaking second, Xi seemed to offer what could be interpreted as a pointed message to his counterpart, who has spent more than half-a-century on the world stage.\n\n“A statesman should think about and know where to lead his country,” Xi said through a translator. “He should also think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world.”\n\nThe two leaders’ talks Monday could have consequences stretching months or even years as the world’s largest economies veer toward increasingly hostile relations.\n\nThe moments spent together on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit here will amount to only a fraction of the time the two men have been in each other’s company since 2011. Biden has claimed that as vice president, he spent north of 70 hours with Xi and traveled 17,000 miles with him across China and the United States – both exaggerations, but still reflective of a relationship that is now perhaps the most important on the planet.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit in Bali, Indonesia, November 14, 2022. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nChina warns US not to cross ‘red line’ over Taiwan\n\nXi stated that Taiwan is the “first red line” that “must not be crossed” in China-US relations, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.\n\nReferring to the “Taiwan question” as the “very core of China’s core interests” and “the bedrock of the political foundation” of China-US relations, Xi stated that peace and stability across the Taiwan strait and “Taiwan independence” is “as irreconcilable as water and fire.”\n\nChina’s ruling Communist Party has long claimed the self-ruled democracy of 24 million as an inseparable part of its territory, despite having never ruled over it, and has pledged to take it back – by force if necessary.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporters explain one of the most contentious issues of US-China relations 05:31 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the meeting, Xi stated that basic norms of international relations and the three Sino-US joint communiques – which touches on the Taiwan issue – are the “most important guardrail and safety net” for bilateral relations and are “vitally important” for the two sides to “manage differences and disagreements and prevent confrontation and conflict.”\n\n“We hope that the US side will match its words with action and abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiques. President Biden has said on many occasions that the US does not support ‘Taiwan independence’ and has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to seek advantages in competition with China or to contain China. We hope that the US side will act on this assurance to real effect,” according to the readout.\n\nXi also defended China’s human rights records and governance system, saying that China has “Chinese-style democracy” that fits its national conditions, according to the readout. He acknowledged the differences between China and the US, but stressed that they should not become “an obstacle to growing China-US relations.”\n\n“The Chinese nation has the proud tradition of standing up for itself. Suppression and containment will only strengthen the will and boost the morale of the Chinese people,” the readout said.\n\nA meeting long in the making\n\nThe meeting Monday took place at a remarkably low moment in US-China ties. Biden hoped coming face-to-face again after nearly two years communicating only by phone and video-conference can yield a more strategically valuable result, even if he entered the talks with little expectation they would produce anything concrete.\n\nRelations have deteriorated rapidly amid economic disputes and an increasingly militarized standoff over Taiwan. The tensions have led to a decline in cooperation on areas where the two countries once shared common interests, like combating climate change and containing North Korea’s nuclear program.\n\nIn a national security strategy document released last month, Biden for the first time identified China as posing “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge,” and wrote the country was the “only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.”\n\nThere was almost no expectation among American officials that any of those issues could be resolved simply by getting Biden and Xi in the same room. Just arranging the meeting itself required US and Chinese officials to establish lines of communication after Beijing furiously cut off most channels following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan over the summer.\n\n“Every matter associated with this meeting, from phone calls to logistics, has been very carefully considered, negotiated, and engaged between the two sides,” a senior US administration official said.\n\nPlanning for Monday’s meeting predated Pelosi’s trip, and discussions continued between US and Chinese officials despite Beijing’s furor. The process was “serious, very sustained and professional in the best traditions of US-China diplomacy,” the official said.\n\nA second official acknowledged the talks setting up the meeting were not always friendly.\n\n“I won’t say that the conversations weren’t contentious because obviously there’s lots of areas where we have differences and challenges,” the official said. “The dozens of hours we have spent talking to our Chinese counterparts has definitely surfaced many of those issues.”\n\nFor his part, Biden takes meetings like this “incredibly seriously” and reads extensively beforehand. In meetings with advisers, he runs through various scenarios for how the meeting might go.\n\n“He goes through ‘if this happens, then should we handle it this way,’” the first official said. “He understands that this is, in many respects, the most important bilateral relationship. And it’s his responsibility to manage it well and he takes that very, very seriously.”\n\nOfficials said in Monday’s meeting they expected Biden’s senior-most advisers to accompany him as part of his official delegation. And they said they expected Xi to similarly surround himself with top aides, though the US team entered the meeting expecting to see some new faces on the Chinese side amid an ongoing transition inside Xi’s inner circle.\n\nBiden and Xi entered the meeting with momentum\n\nFor Xi, the trip to Bali also marked one of his first journeys abroad since the onset of the Covid pandemic, which prompted the Chinese government to impose strict lock downs and draconian restrictions. Xi’s reemergence on the physical world stage also comes on the heels of China’s Communist Party Congress in Beijing, during which he secured a norm-breaking third term as its leader.\n\nEven a week ago, most inside the White House were expecting Biden to enter the talks comparatively weakened by Democratic losses in the midterm elections. But better-than-expected results for Democrats left the president feeling as if he was entering his meetings this week with the wind at his back, according to top aides.\n\n“I know I’m coming in stronger, but I don’t need that,” Biden said of his own improved political fortunes on Saturday.\n\nUS officials previewing the meeting have stressed the Biden administration is not looking to come out of it with specific “deliverables,” including a joint statement listing areas of potential cooperation. Rather, the setting is aimed at offering both Biden and Xi a significant opportunity to better share their respective countries’ goals and perspectives.\n\n“Xi is not an enigma to President Biden,” a senior administration official told CNN. “He knows him. And he is mindful of where Xi is trying to take China. He sees China as a competitor, and he feels confident the US can win that competition.”\n\nChina’s pandemic-era isolation, US officials say, had made it relatively harder in recent years to get a read on Beijing’s intentions abroad as Xi declined to travel outside of China – but they believe that is all about to change.\n\n“We can expect them to be more assertive on the world stage,” the senior administration said. But, they added: “What that looks like is difficult to know right now.”\n\nSullivan said this week that finally substituting the pandemic-era video calls with a face-to-face meeting for the first time since Biden took office “takes the conversation to a different level strategically and allows the leaders to explore in deeper detail what each of them see in terms of their intentions and priorities.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Mj Lee", "Kevin Liptak", "Mj Lee"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/china/china-xi-g20-summit-day-1-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "G20 summit: Xi Jingping starts first day with a whirlwind of meetings ...", "text": "Bali, Indonesia CNN —\n\nAfter a near three-year absence from the world stage, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has embarked on a whirlwind of face-to-face meetings with Western leaders at the Group of 20 summit in Bali, as he looks to reassert China’s global influence.\n\nFollowing a three-hour meeting on Monday with US President Joe Biden in an attempt to prevent their rivalry from spilling into open conflict, Xi on Tuesday held talks with the leaders of four US allies – Australia, France, the Netherlands and South Korea.\n\nChina’s relations with US allies have deteriorated to varying degrees in recent years, due to rising geopolitical tensions, disputes over trade and the origins of Covid-19 pandemic, as well as Beijing’s growing partnership with Moscow – despite Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nWhile the flurry of in-person meetings are unlikely to completely reset relations, they could serve as a positive first step in restoring open communication channels – in some ways similar to the meeting between Xi and Biden.\n\nFor the majority of the pandemic, Xi limited his diplomatic activities to virtual summits and video conferences, hunkering down inside of China’s borders during a period of rising tensions with the West.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden has sought to work closer with allies and partners to counter Beijing’s growing influence, framing the rivalry with China as part of the global clash between democracy and autocracy.\n\nOn Monday, Xi pushed back at that narrative. In a Chinese readout of the meeting, Xi described his country’s system of governance as “Chinese-style democracy,” in an apparent signal to US allies that ideological differences are not a barrier to relations with Beijing.\n\nStabilizing relations\n\nThe most anticipated in-person diplomacy by Xi on Tuesday was perhaps his meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, partly because ties between Beijing and Canberra have frayed significantly over the past years.\n\nIn a statement, Albanese called the meeting an “important step towards the stabilization of the Australia-China relationship.”\n\nAt the meeting, Xi told Albanese that good relations between Beijing and Canberra were in the “fundamental interests of both our peoples” and “conducive to peaceful development in the Asia-Pacific region.”\n\n“Mr. Prime Minister – you have said on multiple occasions that you will handle our countries’ bilateral relations in a more balanced approach, for which I highly value,” Xi told Albanese.\n\nThe two countries have been locked in a bruising trade dispute and diplomatic freeze since early 2020, when China slapped tariffs on Australia following its call for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus.\n\nGeopolitics is also a sore point between the two nations. Canberra is alarmed by Beijing’s growing influence in the Pacific islands, while China is angered by Australia’s new military alliance with the US and the UK, intended to provide Australia with nuclear powered submarines and other advance weaponry.\n\nLeaders of the two countries last met when Albanese’s predecessor, Scott Morrison, had brief informal discussions with Xi at the G20 in Japan in 2019. But it has been six years since leaders from the two sides have held a formal bilateral meeting, after then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s sit-down with Xi at the G20 in the Chinese city of Hangzhou in 2016.\n\n“We are always going to be better off when we talk to each other, calmly and directly,” Albanese said in his statement. “We will cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, and engage in our national interest.”\n\nAs the case with the meeting between Xi and Biden, few in Australia believe the meeting between Xi and Albanese can completely reset the two countries’ strained relations.\n\n“Much has happened in the last six years when the leaders of the two countries last met and the geopolitical dynamics of the region have changed too much for a ‘reset,’” said Jennifer Hsu, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Australia.\n\n“Furthermore, a certain and influential segment of Australia’s foreign policy and national security institutions have fundamentally reshaped how China is viewed and that is difficult to undo,” Hsu added.\n\nJohn Lee, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington and former national security adviser to the Australian government, said core Chinese objectives – such as its South China Sea, Taiwan and South Pacific policies – are “fundamentally at odds with Australia’s core interests.”\n\n“It may be a diplomatic reset of some sorts but not one in substance where both sides begin to genuinely approach each other in good faith and a preparedness to compromise,” Lee added.\n\nBusy schedule\n\nIn a sign of Xi’s busy schedule, the Chinese leader and French President Emmanuel Macron squeezed in a meeting early on Tuesday, before both leaders showed up at the opening of the G20 summit.\n\nThe talks, which lasted for 43 minutes according to the French Presidency, saw Xi reiterate his support for a ceasefire and peace talks to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Xi stressed China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent, advocating a ceasefire, a stop to war and peace talks,” a readout of the bilat from Chinese state media CCTV said.\n\nA readout from the French Presidency said the two leaders “reaffirmed their firm position on preventing the use of nuclear weapons” in the war in Ukraine – a line that was not included in the Chinese readout.\n\nFrance, like other European countries, has hardened its position on China in recent years, increasingly viewing the country as a competitor and security concern.\n\nXi also met South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Senegalese President Macky Sall, and is expected to meet a few more world leaders later on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/asia/china-xi-jinping-canada-justin-trudeau-g20-intl/index.html", "title": "China's Xi Jinping lectures Justin Trudeau at G20 over alleged leak ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping was captured by Canadian broadcasters in a rare candid moment on Wednesday, where he was filmed chiding his Canadian counterpart, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, over what he described as “leaked” discussions.\n\nOn the sidelines of the G20 summit in Indonesia, Xi chatted with Trudeau in Mandarin with a smile. But the English translation of what he said was a little less friendly.\n\n“Everything we’ve discussed has been leaked to the papers and that is not appropriate,” Xi’s translator said.\n\nTrudeau nods and Xi spoke again. “And that was not how the conversation was conducted,” the translator said.\n\n“If there was sincerity on your part, than we shall conduct our discussion with an attitude of mutual respect, otherwise there might be unpredictable consequences,” Xi tells the Canadian leader in Mandarin.\n\nXi’s translator attempts to translate what was said, only getting to “If there was sincerity on your part,” before being cut off by Trudeau.\n\n“In Canada we believe in a free and open and frank dialogue,” Trudeau said, adding “we will continue to work constructively together, but there will be things that we will disagree on.”\n\n“Let’s create the conditions first,” the translator said on behalf of Xi in the video. The Chinese leader then shakes Trudeau’s hand and walked away with his entourage.\n\nThe exchange offers a rare glimpse of how Xi, whose public appearances are highly choreographed, interacts with other leaders.\n\nNot every conversation will be “easy,” Trudeau said Wednesday, according to a statement he gave to the press after the exchange.\n\n“But it’s extremely important we continue to stand up for the things that are important for Canadians. This is something we always do and we will continue to,” Trudeau said.\n\nWhen asked about the incident, China’s foreign ministry said Canada should “create conditions with concrete actions” to improve ties with Beijing.\n\n“China has no problem with candid conversations, but we would like these conversations to be carried out equally and with mutual respect, instead of pointing fingers condescendingly,” ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, said Thursday. “As far as difficulties in recent China-Canada bilateral relations are concerned, it is clear that the responsibilities lie not with China.”\n\nMao also rejected characterizations of Xi’s remark as a threat, adding that the video should not be construed as Xi criticizing anyone.\n\nThe exchange between the two leaders comes as Xi looks to reassert China’s global influence at the summit in the island of Bali after a nearly three-year absence from the world stage.\n\nChina’s relations with United States allies have deteriorated to varying degrees in recent years, due to rising geopolitical tensions, disputes over trade and the origins of Covid-19 pandemic, as well as Beijing’s growing partnership with Moscow – despite Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nXi has sought to restore relationships at the summit, meeting with US President Joe Biden on Monday.

His silence has raised concerns in Mexico and the Borderland about the future of the two neighbors' relationship, the tone of which can influence trade, immigration, security and drug enforcement.\n\nAn official inside the Biden transition team told the El Paso Times in an email that the president-elect \"looks forward to a warm and constructive relationship with his Mexican counterpart,\" given that \"the scale of the shared challenges we face require deep and concerted cooperation.\"\n\nCiting unnamed sources in Mexico's Secretary of Foreign Relations, the Reuters news agency reported Tuesday that López Obrador would extend congratulations after the Electoral College votes on Dec. 14.\n\nStill, the Mexican leader's silence has puzzled foreign policy experts and disappointed those who want to see a return to increased cooperation between the two nations on key issues.\n\nThose include the implementation of labor and environmental provisions of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, including Mexico's enforcement of the rights of Mexican factory workers to unionize. They include a return to bilateral cooperation on humanitarian methods of curbing migration, as well as renewed attention to the simmering drug war in Mexican border cities.\n\nIn Juárez alone, nearly 1,500 people have been murdered this year, according to the Chihuahua State Attorney General's Office.\n\nMore:Did Trump just hand over a general accused of helping drug cartels to repay a favor?\n\nThe future ability of families to legally cross the border also hangs in the balance as the coronavirus drags on. The two countries lack a binational strategy to reopen U.S. border crossings, including those linking El Paso and Juárez, that have been closed to nonessential traffic and most Mexican nationals since March.\n\nU.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, characterized López Obrador's silence as \"extremely disappointing and disrespectful to the will of the American people.\"\n\n“While President-elect Biden has held multiple calls with foreign leaders, Mexico — our No. 1 trading partner — is wasting an opportunity to strengthen its relationship with the U.S. and work closely with the Biden-Harris administration to address our common challenges, including the public health and humanitarian crises that have deeply impacted our border region.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump continues to allege, without evidence, that the election was somehow stolen from him. Trump's lawsuits alleging election fraud have been tossed out in several key states, although he continues to mount challenges to results.\n\nAt the same time, in late November, the Trump administration set in motion the formal transition process, giving the Biden team access to federal funds and services — an important step toward an orderly transition of power.\n\nThat hasn't stopped some authoritarian leaders from sticking with their man in Washington. Trump has been friendlier to, and more forgiving of, strongman regimes than recent past U.S. presidents.\n\nLópez Obrador joins Russia's Vladimir Putin and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro — who has been called the \"Trump of the Tropics\" — in waiting to recognize Biden's win.\n\n\"He is in strange company,\" said Shannon O'Neil, a senior fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"And it is also quite odd, especially for a Mexican president, to join that company and remain aloof. Leaving Russia and Brazil aside, almost every other country responded within a couple of days.\"\n\nChina was also an outlier. The country's foreign ministry waited five days to congratulate Biden, extending recognition of the president-elect on Nov. 13 through a spokesman. President Xi Jinping personally congratulated Biden on Nov. 25.\n\nBeginning during his 2016 campaign and running through the first two years of his presidency, Trump engaged in relentless Mexico-bashing that many expected would sour the U.S.-Mexico relationship.\n\nFew expected López Obrador, elected in July 2018, to openly embrace Trump and his hard-line border policies after all the dirt thrown. But that's just what happened.\n\nAt heart, the two men are nationalists more concerned with domestic business than foreign affairs, experts say.\n\n\"I think we need to understand that AMLO has an uncommon worldview,\" said Duncan Wood, director of the nonpartisan Wilson Center's Mexico Institute in Washington, D.C. \"He is much more focused on what happens internally than what happens in the United States. He wants the world to know he isn’t beholden to the United States.\"\n\nWood added that López Obrador is also \"incredibly stubborn\" and, \"having made the decision not to congratulate Biden until it was official, that’s when it will happen. Right on cue, he will congratulate Biden\" after the Electoral College vote.\n\nSome experts have said that the Mexican president's silence was calculated to keep relations smooth with the current administration, given Trump's inclination to use Mexico and the border as a political piñata.\n\nThe Mexican president is relying on the country's historic noninterventionist doctrine as well, said Jesus Peña Muñoz, a social and political sciences professor at the university Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Juárez.\n\n\"It's not that he is worried that Trump won't leave the White House, but Trump is going to delay the usual process,\" Peña Muñoz said. \"I think López Obrador is being extremely cautious.\"\n\nLauren Villagran can be reached at lvillagran@elpasotimes.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/china/china-xi-diplomatic-victory-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China's Xi attempts to claim diplomatic victory in battle for global ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

Willy Kurniawan/AFP/Getty Images/File\n\nIn contrast to his self-cultivated image as an ideological hardliner, Xi attempted to portray himself as a broad-minded statesman, telling Biden in their meeting last Monday that leaders “should think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world.”\n\nThis sweeping diplomatic outreach appeared specifically targeted at US allies and regional leaders caught in an intensifying rivalry between Washington and Beijing. Since taking office, Biden has shored up relations with allies and partners to counter China’s growing influence.\n\n“Asia Pacific is no one’s backyard and should not become an area for big power contest,” Xi said Friday at the opening of the APEC summit, in the absence of Biden, who had already flown back to the US.\n\nThe whirlwind of face-to-face diplomacy represents something of a victory for Xi, whose self-imposed international isolation had proved extremely costly as China’s relations plummeted with the West and many of its neighbors during the pandemic. Tensions have flared over the origins of the coronavirus, trade, territorial claims, Beijing’s human rights record and its close partnership with Russia despite the devastating war in Ukraine.\n\n“Judging from the sheer volume of international heads of states wanting to have a one-on-one with Xi Jinping, I think it’s safe to say that (the trip) has been successful on Xi’s part,” said Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australia National University’s Taiwan Studies Program.\n\nWith broad smiles and handshakes, the Chinese leader held exchanges with his counterparts from the US, Australia, France, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, among others – including leaders whose governments had openly criticized Beijing.\n\nAnd in multiple speeches, Xi, who earlier this year had joined Russian President Vladimir Putin in proclaiming plans to create a “new world order,” attempted to now present himself as a leader for international unity. In a thinly veiled dig at the US, he decried “ideological division,” “block politics,” “cold war mentality,” and attempts to “politicize and weaponize economic and trade relations.”\n\nOver the two summits, Xi held a total of 20 bilateral meetings in a schedule so packed it sometimes stretched late into the night. He also made a point of holding most of the meetings in his hotel.\n\nThe optics speak for themselves.\n\n“All the leaders were lining up patiently to meet the ‘emperor’ of China,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University.\n\nBut despite the apparent outreach, Xi also showed he was ready to confront perceived slights.\n\nIn a rare, candid moment caught on camera, Xi chided Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, accusing him of leaking details of a brief conversation between them. As they parted ways, Xi could be heard off camera describing Trudeau as “very naive.”\n\n“It reminded the whole world that there are limits to this smiling diplomacy – as soon as you cross upon China’s interest you can get into trouble,” Cabestan said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China's Xi confronts Canadian prime minister in hot mic moment 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\nXi’s goal\n\nFor Xi, the diplomatic flurry with Western leaders is a crucial first step toward normalizing relations – which had been severely strained by his assertive foreign policy and the “wolf-warrior” diplomacy of Chinese diplomats.\n\nDespite its often aggressive stance, Beijing is increasingly worried about economic decoupling with the West. The poor state of the Chinese economy – thanks to unrelenting zero-Covid lockdowns and the recent US ban on the export of advanced semiconductor chips to China – have added to Beijing’s urgency to reverse the trend.\n\nNotably, among the leaders Xi met in Bali was Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, home to semiconductor giant ASML – which is under increasing pressure from the US to stop selling its products to China.\n\nDuring their meeting, Xi urged Rutte to avoid “decoupling” and the “politicization of economic and trade issues,” and invited him to visit Beijing next year.\n\n“While Biden may be trying to build a so-called values based alignment against China, Xi is trying to find ways to weaken the cohesion of that alignment by pursuing top-level diplomacy one on one with those countries,” said Sung, the political scientist.\n\nXi’s numerous meetings with US allies are all the more remarkable given recent tensions with Beijing over trade, geopolitics and China’s human rights crackdown on Xinjiang and Hong Kong. In other multilateral settings, such as the Group of Seven summit, Western nations had issued strongly worded statements expressing concerns about China’s human rights record and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\n“Amidst all that, Xi has proven that China still has enough lure and stature to attract all these countries to find ways to work with China. So in that sense, it’s successful diplomacy on Xi’s part,” Sung said.\n\nDomestic message\n\nThe international posturing is also intended for the Chinese domestic audience.\n\nFor Xi, the key message he wanted to send home was already set at the start of the trip, when he met Biden face-to-face for the first time as national leaders.\n\n“The fact that Xi was talking with Biden in a one-on-one setting, with confidence and smiles throughout, generates this image that the era of ‘G2’ has arrived,” Sung said.\n\nSince coming to power, Xi has touted the “Chinese dream” of national rejuvenation – his vision of restoring China to its past glory and reclaiming its rightful place as a world leader. In recent years, he has also pushed the notion that the East is rising, and the West is in decline.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden describes what he discussed with Xi Jinping in G20 meeting 03:43 - Source: CNN\n\nTo Xi’s domestic audience, the image of a superpower “G2” – China and the United States – served as a vivid visual representation of both narratives. “China now can talk with the US like a true equal,” Sung said.\n\nBut Chinese people who followed glowing state media coverage of Xi’s trip would have also noticed a striking image: their top leader attending indoor gatherings and mingling with world leaders without a face mask.\n\nThat was a far cry from Xi’s caution for Covid during his first trip abroad since the pandemic. When he visited Central Asia in September, Xi wore a mask to disembark from his plane and skipped a mask-free group dinner where leaders ate and talked around the table.\n\nThis time around, Xi appeared much more comfortable being maskless. He also attended the Group of 20 dinner, where he shook hands and chatted with leaders including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nBack home in China, however, snap lockdowns and mass testing edicts continue to torment residents, despite the government’s recent announcement of limited easing of its zero-Covid policy.\n\nIn the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, residents revolted against a Covid lockdown, tearing down barriers and marching down streets. In the central city of Zhengzhou, the death of a 4-month-old girl in hotel quarantine stoked nationwide outcry – the second death of a child under Covid restrictions this month.\n\nHaving had a taste of what living with Covid could look like in Bali and Bangkok, Xi returned Saturday to a China under siege from rising infections and tightening restrictions in many cities.\n\nApart from the Dutch Prime Minister, Xi also invited US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s newly elected Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to visit Beijing early next year.\n\nWhether they will visit a China free of Covid restrictions – and potential travel quarantines – remains to be seen.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/10/europe/summit-of-americas-white-house-migration-intl-latam/index.html", "title": "The White House wants to tackle migration again.

Jose Cabezas/Reuters\n\nBukele and Giammattei, in particular, have opened the door to anti-democratic behavior in their respective countries in recent years – the former famously led armed soldiers into congress to pass a budget law in 2020 – and relations with the US have declined since Biden took power as the White House has repeatedly criticized this sort of conduct.\n\n“Bukele and Giammattei are actively dismantling democracy and fostering corruption, they are creating the conditions that lead to more migration […] which explains why the Biden administration made the choice to emphasize the private sector,” Isaacson told CNN.\n\nNone of these countries were invited to the State Department’s ‘Summit for Democracy’ held last December, and several international organizations have raised concerns about corruption, limits on checks and balances in government and democratic backsliding.\n\nLast week, Amnesty International accused Bukele of having “engulfed El Salvador in a human rights crisis” in his first three years in office. Guatemala’s legislative and executive powers are “impeding accountability and threatening judicial independence,” according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nCastro’s predecessor, Juan Orlando Hernandez, was extradited to the US in April on drug trafficking charges. While her administration has been more in step with the White House, it may have nevertheless decided to skip the Los Angeles summit in order to avoid upsetting Honduras’ neighbours, as well as in a show of solidarity with the excluded countries Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela.\n\nAnd people from those excluded countries are turning up in record numbers at the US southern border.\n\nNearly 80,000 Cubans reached the US border from Mexico from October through March, according to US Customs and Border Protection data, with record numbers of Venezuelans and Nicaraguans arriving at the US border in 2021 and early 2022.\n\nOpposing objectives\n\nWhere Washington and the Northern Triangle governments’ perspectives differ the most is on the migration issue.\n\nIn the US, stemming migration has bipartisan support: Both Republicans and Democrats are working actively to reduce the number of migrants entering the country despite the fact the US economy needing workers.\n\nBut migration is not seen as a problem but as an opportunity in the Northern Triangle. The annual movement of tens of thousands of people eases the social pressures facing these governments, and remittances from nationals abroad have become a considerable chunk of these countries’ economies.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, El Salvador received almost $6 billion in remittances in 2020, Guatemala received more than $11 billion and Honduras about $5.5 billion, which constitutes 24%, 15% and 23% of their GDPs respectively.\n\nThat means the flow of remittances from migrants abroad is seven times higher than the investments the White House touted this week.\n\n“These countries have understood the centrality of the migration’s issue in US politics, which give them great leverage, as they don’t see too many threats in distancing themselves from Washington,” said Tiziano Breda, a Central American expert at the International Crisis Group in Guatemala.\n\nA growing number of Salvadorans leaving the country are calling foul on Bukele’s grand vision to ‘Make El Salvador Great Again,’ but it’s a fact that these economies receive much more investments from fellow nationals working in the United States than from any big US corporation opening a factory south of the border or foreign aid from Washington.\n\nMigrants taking part in a caravan heading to the US, walk from Huixtla to Escuintla, Chiapas state, Mexico, on June 9, 2022.

They last spoke just days after Moscow launched what it insists on calling a “special military operation.”\n\nChina, too, has refrained from referring to Russia’s actions as an invasion and has walked a fine line on the issue. It has portrayed itself as calling for peace and upholding the global order, while refusing to denounce Russia’s actions. It has also used its state media apparatus to mimic Kremlin lines blaming the United States and NATO for the crisis.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s call, Xi stressed China had always “independently assessed the situation” in Ukraine and called for “all parties” to push for a “proper settlement of the Ukraine crisis” – echoing language he used in a March call with US President Joe Biden.\n\nChina is “willing to continue to play its role” in promoting a “proper solution” to Ukraine, he said.\n\nThe Kremlin’s summary of the call took this position a step further, saying: “the President of China noted the legitimacy of Russia’s actions to protect fundamental national interests in the face of challenges to its security created by external forces.”\n\nChina’s lack of censure for Russia’s war in Ukraine has further strained Beijing’s tense relationship with the US and its allies.\n\nUS officials have repeatedly called on countries to condemn Russia’s actions and warned their Chinese counterparts against aiding Moscow. During the March call between Xi and Biden, the US President spelled out consequences if China gave material support, following US intelligence that Moscow asked Beijing for military assistance – a claim both deny.\n\nTrade ties\n\nWednesday’s call was also a chance for Putin and Xi to check in on a growing trade relationship.\n\nEarlier this year, weeks before the Russian invasion, the two leaders in a face-to-face meeting said their countries had a “no limits” partnership and pledged to boost trade.\n\n“Since the beginning of this year, bilateral relations have maintained a sound development momentum in the face of global turbulence and transformations,” Xi said in the Wednesday call.\n\n“The Chinese side stands ready to work with the Russian side to push for steady and long-term development of practical bilateral cooperation,” Xi said, pointing to the “steady progress” of their trade ties and the opening last week of the first cross-border highway bridge over the Amur River.\n\nThe two agreed to expand cooperation in energy, finance, manufacturing and other areas, “taking into account the global economic situation that has become more complicated due to the illegitimate sanctions policy pursued by the West,” the Kremlin readout said.\n\nThe two countries also pledged to work together to strengthen communication and coordination in international bodies such as the United Nations – where the two often vote as a bloc.\n\n“China is also willing to work with Russia to promote solidarity and cooperation among emerging market countries … and push for the development of the international order and global governance towards a more just and reasonable direction,” Xi said, in a comment that hit on the countries’ shared aim of pushing back against what they view as the global hegemony of the United States.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China refusing to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine 02:54 - Source: CNN\n\nBirthday greetings\n\nThe call was not the first time that Xi and Putin – two strongmen drawn together by mutual distrust of the West – have had engagements on each others’ birthdays.\n\nIn 2013, Xi presented Putin with a birthday cake and the two drank vodka together to mark the Russian leader’s 61st birthday during a conference in Indonesia. Xi later celebrated his 66th birthday during a 2019 summit in Tajikistan with Putin, who surprised him with ice cream, cake and champagne.\n\nTheir personal relationship, in which Xi has described Putin as his “best and bosom friend” is also thought to bolster the dynamics of their strengthening rapport on the national level.\n\nIn its summary of the two leaders’ latest call, the Kremlin noted the conversation was held in a “traditionally warm and friendly atmosphere.”", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/politics/joe-biden-israel-saudi-arabia-trip/index.html", "title": "Biden embraces a signature Trump achievement on first trip to the ...", "text": "Jerusalem CNN —\n\nAs President Joe Biden arrived here on Wednesday, he is doing something he has never done on a foreign trip: Embracing one of his predecessor’s legacy achievements.\n\nWhile much of his foreign travel in his first 18 months in office has focused on reversing the foreign policy of former President Donald Trump and shoring up battered alliances, Biden on his first trip to the Middle East will embrace the Trump-era Abraham Accords that normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries and pursue an expansion of growing Arab-Israeli security and economic ties.\n\nBiden landed in Tel Aviv just after 8 a.m. ET Wednesday and pledged in remarks at an arrival ceremony to deepen Israel’s relationship with the US and with other countries in the region.\n\n“We’ll continue to advance Israel’s integration into the region, expand emerging forums and engagement,” Biden said. “Greater peace, greater stability, greater connection.

Mahmoud Illean/AP In pictures: Biden's trip to the Middle East Prev Next\n\nIn the lead-up to the trip, US officials have been working to deepen Israeli-Arab security coordination and broker agreements that will inch Israel and Saudi Arabia – which do not have diplomatic relations – closer to normalization.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter said Saudi Arabia is expected to announce this week that it will allow all commercial flights to and from Israel to use its airspace and allow Israel’s Muslim minority to take charter flights directly to Saudi Arabia to participate in the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Biden will also fly directly to Saudi Arabia from Israel, a moment that he called a “small symbol of the budding relations” between the two countries.\n\nSenior Biden administration officials said full Saudi-Israel normalization remains out of reach, though covert coordination between the two countries has expanded.\n\n“It’s changed the security situation in the Middle East,” a senior US official said of the Abraham Accords signed in late 2020. “Our job is to go deeper with the countries that have signed up and to go wider if we can.”\n\nThe Biden administration’s focus on expanding normalization agreements between Israel and Arab countries has frustrated Palestinian officials who would prefer the US focus on reviving the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process. But US officials say their focus on Arab-Israeli normalization is a recognition of realities in the region: The momentum for growing Arab-Israeli ties coupled with dead-end political conditions in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nTwo senior administration officials said the administration would like to see movement toward Israeli-Palestinian peace but said the White House has decided not to pursue the kind of high-level shuttle diplomacy that previous administrations have chased because it would likely fail.\n\n“We’re very careful about setting objectives, particularly in the Middle East. Where administrations have gotten themselves in deep trouble is by promising the Moon and not being able to deliver and wasting time and resources and investment,” a senior administration official said. “Had we launched a peace process, there would have been nobody at the table.”\n\n“If the parties are ready to talk, we are always going to be right there to help, but we are not going to come out with some top-down mandated plan and create expectations that can’t be met,” the official said.\n\nAttempting to make incremental progress on Israeli-Palestinian relations\n\nUS officials have instead focused on making incremental progress to improve living conditions for Palestinians and restoring relations with the Palestinian Authority.\n\n“The Palestinian relationship that we walked into had been totally severed. We restored relations with the Palestinians, we turned back on funding for the Palestinians – almost $500 million – and we have looked for opportunities to improve the lives of Palestinians wherever we could,” the senior administration official said.\n\nBiden is expected to visit a Palestinian hospital in East Jerusalem this week and announce $100 million in new funding for those facilities, US officials said. The Biden administration has also been working with Israel on an aid package to bolster the Palestinian Authority, which governs Palestinian-controlled parts of the West Bank.\n\nPalestinian officials are still calling on Biden to do more to reverse Trump administration actions, including making good on his pledge to reopen a US consulate in Jerusalem to deal with Palestinians. That promise has gone unfulfilled amid disapproval from Israel.\n\nPalestinian officials are also urging the US to do more to hold Israel accountable for the killing of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in May, which the US State Department said last week “likely” resulted from gunfire from Israel Defense Forces positions during an IDF-led raid in the West Bank.\n\nThe State Department caveated their conclusion, however, by saying that a forensic analysis “could not reach a definitive conclusion regarding the origin of the bullet that killed” Abu Akleh. The statement angered Abu Akleh’s family, who wrote a letter to Biden saying his administration failed to conduct a thorough probe into her killing.\n\nThe Israeli government was angry with the statement, too, according to a senior Israeli official, because it appeared to contradict itself. On the one hand it said the analysis was inconclusive, and on the other concluding the bullet likely came from the IDF. “We do have a problem with the way it was presented,” the official said.\n\nEven amid that dispute, US officials have been working to ensure that the trip is not marred by an increase in tensions between Israel and Palestinians, encouraging dialogue between the two sides that led to the first call between an Israeli Prime Minister and Palestinian Authority President in five years last week, in which Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas congratulated new Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid on his ascension and the two leaders expressed their wishes for peace.\n\n“We’re encouraging them (Israelis and Palestinians) to have conversations and encouraging them to do things that keep things calm,” a senior US official said.\n\nState Department officials also requested last month that Israel tamp down on any military operations and settlement activity in the West Bank at least while Biden is in town, a second senior US official said.\n\nThe White House is particularly keen on avoiding a repeat of Biden’s visit to Israel as vice president in 2010, when Israel’s Interior Ministry approved a settlement expansion in east Jerusalem while Biden was in the country trying to build support for new talks with the Palestinians. Biden condemned the announcement and White House officials were so furious at the time that they urged Biden to fly home, officials told CNN.\n\nAsked whether Israel will honor US requests not to engage in settlement announcements around Biden’s trip, the senior Israeli official would say only that Israel is doing “everything possible” to make the visit a success.\n\n‘A policy earthquake’\n\nThe Biden administration’s focus on the Abraham Accords more broadly, though, also reflects a recognition that a fundamental shift in regional dynamics has begun.\n\n“In some ways, it’s a policy earthquake,” said David Makovsky, a distinguished fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy who worked on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process during the Obama administration. “I think there’s a fundamental paradigm shift from which there’s no return.”\n\nAhead of Biden’s trip, Israeli officials have made no secret of their eagerness to advance toward normalization with Saudi Arabi and their hope that Biden can help them make progress on that front.\n\n“Saudi Arabia, the way we see it, is that it is a very important country in the Middle East and beyond. In expanding Israeli normalization with the Arab world, we would also like to see Saudi Arabia as part of that expansion,” a senior Israeli official told CNN.\n\nTo that end, Israel has pushed for Biden to travel to Saudi Arabia and mend ties with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman – whom the US accused in a declassified CIA report of having approved the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi – believing that expanding the Abraham Accords would be more difficult without strengthened US-Saudi relations, despite Biden’s tough domestic political situation around Saudi relations. The Crown Prince has denied involvement in the murder.\n\nWhen Biden travels to Jeddah on Friday, he will attend a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council plus three – Egypt, Iraq and Jordan. He will also hold a bilateral meeting with Saudi King Salman and his advisers, including MBS. Some US officials told CNN they are hoping that MBS and Biden have some one-on-one time as part of the meeting, though the choreography will likely be driven by the Saudi hosts.\n\nBiden is likely to bring up Khashoggi’s murder, US officials told CNN, and the administration is hoping MBS will acknowledge some responsibility for the crime. While oil production is not expected to be the main topic of the meeting, US officials do expect the topic to arise – there is hope that the Kingdom will commit to increasing production in the weeks following the meeting.\n\nThe Yemen conflict will be a central piece of the conversation as well. US officials are hoping that the Saudis agree to extend the truce between the Saudi-backed Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, for six more months.\n\nWhile US officials are not expecting the Saudis to throw any major curve balls during the events, they acknowledge that it is possible especially because the Saudis are hosting. When National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met last year with MBS at a beach-front property along the coast of the Red Sea, MBS was dressed in shorts, while Sullivan and other US officials wore suits. It created a bizarre juxtaposition, adding another layer of strain to an already tense meeting, officials said.\n\nThe Biden administration is not overly anxious about the meetings, though, because of the extensive diplomatic groundwork that has already been laid over the last eight months by Biden’s national security advisers. And the US has already been central to deepening Israeli-Arab security coordination following the key decision last year to move military coordination with Israel under US Central Command, putting Israel under the same umbrella as Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. Earlier this year, Israel and Saudi Arabia both participated in joint naval exercises for the first time, with the US and Oman.\n\nMore could be in the offing. Biden will arrive in the region amid discussions of establishing a regional air defense framework that would include Israel and Arab countries to warn of Iranian attacks.\n\n“There is an effort (housed) under CENTCOM to develop regional security cooperation among all the actors and one element is the integrated air defense initiative. It is a goal, but we are not there yet and there is a long way to go,” a senior Israeli official said.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley also spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kohavi on Sunday night ahead of Biden’s visit. The call comes amid rising tensions with Iran and as CENTCOM is reviewing options for how to deter and, if necessary, use force against Iran. For the last several years, options for potential use of force against Iran have centered around a deterrence strategy in which the US would most likely only strike Iran if it, or militias it backs, were responsible for attacks on US interests or killing of American troops and citizens. A more complex scenario would be if there is solid intelligence Iran has a nuclear weapon and Israel was set on attacking inside Iran.\n\nThe CENTCOM update is not expected to fundamentally change US military policy, even though at least four defense officials say there is a broad view that Israel is heavily signaling the Biden administration it wants US military support for an Israeli strike inside Iran if that were to happen.\n\nLooking past Trump\n\nWhile Biden immediately embraced the Abraham Accords – which established diplomatic relations between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain – during the 2020 campaign, there were early signs in his administration of skittishness to fully embracing the accord.\n\nDuring the first months of Biden’s presidency, State Department officials, including spokesman Ned Price, referred to the Accords as “normalization agreements” and resisted using “Abraham Accords.”\n\nOne senior US official said there were some in the administration who “didn’t want to give Trump credit” by using the term, but said the administration has “surpassed that.” By the one-year anniversary of the signing, Price recorded a video hailing the accords by their name.\n\nA senior administration official said “from the White House, there was never any hesitancy” in embracing the accords.\n\nThe Biden administration has also sought to deepen Israel’s emerging relations with the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco – which inked its own normalization agreement in December 2020 – by dispatching Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the Negev Summit, which convened the countries’ foreign ministers in Israel in March.\n\nWhile in Israel, Biden is also set to participate in a virtual summit with the leaders of Israel, India and the United Arab Emirates to discuss global food security to demonstrate the deepening partnership.\n\nOverlap between Biden and Trump’s Middle East policies begin and end with efforts to normalize ties between Israel and the Arab world. And like his previous foreign trips, Biden’s trip to Israel, the West Bank and Saudi Arabia will underscore the significant US policy shift underway.\n\n“Our policy could not be any more different,” a senior administration official said. “Just because we support the Abraham Accords does not mean we have the same Middle East policy.”\n\nBiden laid out the many ways in which he has changed the course of US policy in the Middle East in a Washington Post op-ed Saturday ahead of his trip, pointing to reversing the Trump administration’s “blank-check policy” toward Saudi Arabia, reentering Iran nuclear negotiations alongside European allies and taking other military and diplomatic steps that he says have made the region more stable.\n\n“The Middle East I’ll be visiting is more stable and secure than the one my administration inherited 18 months ago,” Biden wrote. “In my first weeks as president, our intelligence and military experts warned that the region was dangerously pressurized. It needed urgent and intensive diplomacy.”", "authors": ["Jeremy Diamond Natasha Bertrand", "Jeremy Diamond", "Natasha Bertrand"], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/europe/ukraine-russia-tensions-explainer-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Ukraine-Russia crisis: As tensions rise on the border, here's what ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nTensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their highest in years, with a Russian troop build-up near the two nations’ borders spurring fears that Moscow could launch an invasion.\n\nUkraine has warned that Russia is trying to destabilize the country ahead of any planned military invasion. Western powers have repeatedly warned Russia against further aggressive moves against Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin denies it is planning to attack and argues that NATO support for Ukraine – including increased weapons supplies and military training – constitutes a growing threat on Russia’s western flank.\n\nThe picture is complicated – but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nWhat’s the situation on the border?\n\nThe United States and NATO have described the movements and concentrations of troops in and around Ukraine as “unusual.”\n\nAs many as 100,000 Russian troops have remained amassed at the Ukrainian border, despite warnings from US President Joe Biden and European leaders of serious consequences should Putin move ahead with an invasion. And US intelligence findings in December estimated that Russia could begin a military offensive in Ukraine “as soon as early 2022.”\n\nSpeaking alongside his Ukrainian counterpart in Kyiv on January 19, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia had “ratcheted up its threats and amassed nearly 100,000 forces on Ukraine’s border, which it could double on relatively short order.”\n\nIn late 2021, satellite photos revealed Russian hardware – including self-propelled guns, battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles – on the move at a training ground roughly 186 miles (300 km) from the border.\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s latest intelligence assessment says Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops near Ukraine, including some 21,000 air and sea personnel, transferred more Iskander operational-tactical missiles to the border, and increased its intelligence activity against the country.\n\nThe assessment came after three rounds of diplomatic talks between Russia and the West aimed at de-escalating the crisis failed to produce a resolution.\n\nUS officials have said a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any point in the next month or two.\n\nMany of Russia’s military bases are to the west of the vast country – the direction from which history suggests any threats are most likely to come. Russia’s Defense Ministry has said it is conducting “regular” winter military drills in its southern region, parts of which border Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions bordering Russia, an area known as Donbas, have been under the control of Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Russian forces are also present in the area, referred to by Ukraine as “temporarily occupied territories,” although Russia denies it.\n\nThe front lines of the conflict have barely moved in five years, but there are frequent small-scale clashes and sniper attacks. Russia was angered when Ukrainian forces deployed a Turkish-made combat drone for the first time in October to strike a position held by the pro-Russian separatists.\n\nRussia also has forces numbering in the tens of thousands at its massive naval base in Crimea, the Ukrainian territory it annexed in 2014. The Crimean peninsula, which lies to the south of the rest of Ukraine, is now connected by a road bridge to mainland Russia.\n\nRussian tanks take part in a military drills at Molkino training ground in the Krasnodar region, Russia, on December 14, 2021. AP\n\nWhat’s the history of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia?\n\nTensions between Ukraine and Russia, both former Soviet states, escalated in late 2013 over a landmark political and trade deal with the European Union. After the pro-Russian then-President, Viktor Yanukovych, suspended the talks – reportedly under pressure from Moscow – weeks of protests in Kyiv erupted into violence.\n\nThen, in March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, an autonomous peninsula in southern Ukraine with strong Russian loyalties, on the pretext that it was defending its interests and those of Russian-speaking citizens. First, thousands of Russian-speaking troops, dubbed “little green men” and later acknowledged by Moscow to be Russian soldiers, poured into the Crimean peninsula. Within days, Russia completed its annexation in a referendum that was slammed by Ukraine and most of the world as illegitimate.\n\nRussian soldiers patrol the area surrounding the Ukrainian military unit in Perevalnoye, outside Simferopol, Crimea, on March 20, 2014. Filippo MonteforteAFP/Getty Images\n\nShortly afterwards, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions declared their independence from Kyiv, prompting months of heavy fighting. Despite Kyiv and Moscow signing a peace deal in Minsk in 2015, brokered by France and Germany, there have been repeated ceasefire violations.\n\nAccording to UN figures, there have been more than 3,000 conflict-related civilian deaths in eastern Ukraine since March 2014.\n\nThe European Union and US have imposed a series of measures in response to Russia’s actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, including economic sanctions targeting individuals, entities and specific sectors of the Russian economy.\n\nThe Kremlin accuses Ukraine of stirring up tensions in the country’s east and of violating the Minsk ceasefire agreement.\n\nUkrainian soldiers prepare to support the withdrawal of troops on February 19, 2015 in Artemivsk, Ukraine. Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images\n\nWhat’s Russia’s view?\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia plans on invading Ukraine, insisting Russia does not pose a threat to anyone and that the country moving troops across its own territory should not be cause for alarm.\n\nMoscow sees the growing support for Ukraine from NATO – in terms of weaponry, training and personnel – as a threat to its own security. It has also accused Ukraine of boosting its own troop numbers in preparation for an attempt to retake the Donbas region, an allegation Ukraine has denied.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called for specific legal agreements that would rule out any further NATO expansion eastwards towards Russia’s borders, saying the West has not lived up to its previous verbal assurances.\n\nPutin has also said that NATO deploying sophisticated weapons in Ukraine, such as missile systems, would be crossing a “red line” for Russia, amid concern in Moscow that Ukraine is being increasingly armed by NATO powers.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in November that weapons and military advisers were already being supplied to Ukraine by the US and other NATO member states. “And all this, of course, leads to a further aggravation of the situation on the border line,” he said.\n\nIf the US and its NATO allies do not change course in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that Moscow has the “right to choose ways to ensure its legitimate security interests.”\n\nWhat is Ukraine’s view?\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO if it chooses.\n\n“Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN, in response to Russian calls for NATO to halt its eastward expansion.\n\n“Any Russian proposals to discuss with NATO or the US any so-called guarantees that the Alliance would not expand to the East are illegitimate,” it added.\n\nUkraine insists Russia is seeking to destabilize the country with the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, recently saying a coup plot, involving Ukrainians and Russians, had been uncovered.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned that a planned coup could be part of Russia’s plan ahead of a military invasion. “External military pressure goes hand in hand with domestic destabilization of the country,” he said.\n\nTensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a deepening Ukrainian energy crisis that Kyiv believes Moscow has purposefully provoked.\n\nAt the same time, Zelensky’s government faces challenges on many fronts. The government’s popularity has stagnated amid multiple domestic political challenges, including a recent third wave of Covid-19 infections and a struggling economy.\n\nMany people are also unhappy that the government hasn’t yet delivered on benefits it promised and ended the conflict in the country’s east. Anti-government protests have taken place in Kyiv.\n\nIn a January 19 video address, Zelensky urged the Ukrainian people to “calm down” amid mounting unease over a possible Russian invasion. “We are aware of everything, we are ready for everything,” he said, before adding that he “sincerely believes” this year “will pass without a war” with Russia.\n\nKuleba also sought to reassure Ukrainians who fear the US, its NATO allies and Russia could leave Kyiv out of discussions. “No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine is a principle that we adhere to,” he said.\n\nPro-Russian fighters arrive on February 20, 2015 in Debaltseve, eastern Ukraine. Pierre Crom/Getty Images\n\nWhat does NATO say?\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said “there will be a high price to pay for Russia” if it once again invades Ukraine, a NATO partner.\n\n“We have a wide range of options: economic sanctions, financial sanctions, political restrictions,” said Stoltenberg, in a December 1 interview with CNN.\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, NATO increased its defenses “with combat-ready battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in the Baltic countries, in Latvia … but also in the Black Sea region,” Stoltenberg said.\n\nUkraine is not a NATO member, and therefore doesn’t have the same security guarantees as NATO members.\n\nBut Stoltenberg left the possibility of Ukraine becoming a NATO member on the table, saying that Russia does not have the right to tell Ukraine that it cannot pursue NATO membership.\n\nHigh-stakes talks between Russia and NATO in Brussels in mid-January were “not an easy discussion,” according to Stoltenberg, who added that “differences will not be easy to bridge.” However, NATO allies and Russia “expressed the need to resume dialogue,” he said.\n\nWhat does the United States say?\n\nPresident Joe Biden told Zelensky earlier this month in a phone call that the US and its allies “will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.”\n\nBut Biden appeared to undermine that message when he subsequently suggested during a White House news conference that a “minor incursion” by Russia would elicit a lesser response than a full-scale invasion of the country.\n\nWhile Biden vowed harsh economic consequences on Russia should Putin send his troops over the border, including restricting its financial transitions in US dollars, he suggested Western nations were not in sync on what to do should a lesser violation occur. “There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do, depending on what happens,” he said.\n\nHis remarks prompted a swift White House clarification. “President Biden has been clear with the Russian President: If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that’s a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our Allies,” press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a statement.\n\nOne Ukrainian official told CNN he was “shocked that the US President Biden would distinguish between incursion and invasion” and suggest that a minor incursion would not trigger sanctions. “This gives the green light to Putin to enter Ukraine at his pleasure,” the official added.\n\nThe diplomatic kerfuffle came as Blinken prepared for further talks with European allies on the Ukraine-Russia crisis and to meet with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Blinken has previously warned Russia that “any renewed aggression can trigger serious consequences.”\n\nTwo defense officials told CNN on January 3 that the Defense Department has developed military options for Biden if he decides to increase capabilities in eastern Europe to further deter potential Russian aggression against Ukraine. Both officials emphasized that this part of routine planning the military does and that for now, the focus remains on diplomacy and potential economic sanctions.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov held meetings in Geneva on January 10, as the US sought to de-escalate the threat of a Russian advance.\n\nThe US delivered roughly $450 million in security assistance to Ukraine in 2021, the Pentagon said, including a package of small arms and ammunition in December. The Biden administration is now weighing new options, including providing more arms to Ukraine to resist a Russian occupation, a senior US official told CNN.\n\nThe Obama administration was taken by surprise when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 and backed an insurgency in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. US officials say they are determined not to be caught out by another Russian military operation.\n\n“Our concern is that Russia may make a serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014, when it amassed forces along the border, crossed into sovereign Ukrainian territory and did so claiming falsely that it was provoked,” Blinken said late last year.\n\nWhat other factors are at play?\n\nUnrest in the former Soviet state of Kazakhstan was unwelcome news for Putin at the beginning of 2022.\n\nDeadly protests in early January saw the Kazakh government resign, a state of emergency be declared and troops from a Russia-led military alliance deployed to help contain the unrest.\n\nBut experts have warned that Russia’s intervention is unlikely to be the end of the story. Blinken said that “once Russians are in your house, sometimes it is very difficult to get them to leave.”\n\nAnother issue revolves around energy supply. Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine.\n\nKyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against an invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAnalysts and US lawmakers have raised concerns that Nord Stream 2 will increase European dependence on Russian gas and could allow Moscow to selectively target countries such as Ukraine with energy cut-offs, without broader disruption to European supplies. Bypassing eastern European countries also means those nations would be deprived of lucrative transit fees Russia would otherwise pay.\n\nIn May 2021, the Biden administration waived sanctions on the company behind Nord Stream 2, effectively giving it the green light. US officials say the move was in the interest of US national security as it sought to rebuild frayed relations with Germany.\n\nIn November, the US imposed new sanctions on a Russian-linked entity and a vessel linked to Nord Stream 2. Some US senators have called for further sanctions to be imposed to prevent Russia using the pipeline as a weapon; Ukraine too has called for tougher measures.", "authors": ["Matthew Chance Laura Smith-Spark", "Matthew Chance", "Laura Smith-Spark"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/14/politics/joe-biden-saudi-arabia-mbs/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Saudi Crown Prince outlasts US' moral outrage, with a little ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has outlasted the United States, nearly four years after the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAn announcement Tuesday that President Joe Biden will visit Saudi Arabia next month is not a surprise – the White House has been preparing the ground for days. And the President’s decision to visit, as well as lawmakers’ reactions to the trip, fit a prevailing pattern of the US-Saudi relationship: Washington recoils over distaste for Saudi behavior that conflicts with its values, then gets pulled back into its marriage of convenience owing to the kingdom’s oil wealth and critical strategic position.\n\nAlthough Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday defended Biden’s upcoming meetings with the Saudis, Senate Majority Whip Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin – Schumer’s No. 2 – and other leading Democrats are showing their concern.\n\nDurbin told CNN he has “concerns” with Biden’s trip and called on the President to change his plans, but that he understands why Biden decided to take part in the visit.\n\n“I have concerns about it. I think the Saudis have demonstrated that they don’t share our values. The episode with Khashoggi is an international incident of historic proportions. I can’t get around it,” Durbin said, later adding, “It’s a tough call. Sustaining the energy services for our allies and NATO, doing something to increase the oil supply in the world, perhaps bring down gasoline prices. All these things are timely and important. But I’m sorry he has to do it with Saudis.”\n\nVirginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, a member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN that the trip is a “really bad idea.”\n\n“His blood stain has not been cleansed,” Kaine said. “And I get it that circumstances change. But what’s the fundamental issue in the world right now? It’s the authoritarians. … I don’t think you go say, ‘Well, circumstances change. We sit down with a murderer who killed a journalist who lives in Virginia.’ I think it’s a big mistake. I’d meet with other — I’d meet with (the) foreign minister. I’d meet with the Saudi ambassador. I’d meet with the King, but I wouldn’t meet with MBS.”\n\nConnecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, another member of Senate Foreign Relations, said he has some “real worries,” adding, “I think I need to hear more from the administration to understand what kind of commitments they’ve gotten from the kingdom to change their ways.”\n\nDurbin’s Republican counterpart, Senate Republican Whip John Thune of South Dakota, also had problems with the trip, saying, “I just wish he would focus on American energy and he wouldn’t have to deal with the Crown Prince.”\n\n“He’s expressed concerns about going there in the past for all the obvious reasons. And it just seems … having to go hat in hand to the Saudis to increase energy production because we won’t do it here – I think it’s unfortunate an American president is put in that position,” Thune added.\n\nThere’s little doubt that Biden is making his trip in order to persuade the Saudis to pump more crude oil to help alleviate the political impact of record-high US gasoline prices. His visit also comes as a new crisis looms with arch Saudi foe Iran, which may soon cross the threshold to building a nuclear bomb.\n\nTo quell the controversy, the White House is styling the visit of Biden to a nation he called “a pariah” over Khashoggi’s brutal killing, for which US intelligence determined the Crown Prince was responsible, as part of a regional peace initiative. The President will take part in a summit with the Gulf Cooperation Council plus Egypt, Jordan and Iraq in Jeddah after visiting Israel to show support for the Jewish state’s warming relations with anti-Iran Arab neighbors.\n\nThere will be bilateral meetings with King Salman and his team, which the White House expects to include the Crown Prince. And White House officials have broadly said that Biden plans to bring up human rights issues with bin Salman and the Saudis during their discussions, but they’ve also repeatedly underscored that the President is looking to reorient its relationship with the Middle Eastern nation.\n\n“We are not overlooking any conduct that happened before the President took office,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday in regard to Khashoggi’s death, noting that Biden “issued an extensive report” from the intelligence community on the journalist’s killing.\n\n“So, it’s important to also emphasize that while we [recalibrate] relationships, we are not looking to rupture relationships – but human rights issues, human rights conversation, is something that the President brings up with many leaders and plans to do so,” she continued.\n\nJean-Pierre also praised Saudi Arabia for having been “a strategic partner of the United States for nearly 80 years,” adding that “there’s no question that important interests are interwoven with Saudi Arabia, notably the recent extension of truce in Yemen, which has saved countless of lives.”\n\n9/11 Families United, an organization consisting of the families of individuals killed during the September, 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, sent a letter to the President earlier this month urging him to ensure accountability for the 9/11 attacks is a key priority of his discussions with Saudi officials.\n\nNational Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told CNN’s “New Day” on Tuesday that Biden is expected to discuss a “range of human rights issues” with the crown prince during the trip, but he did not say whether concerns from the 9/11 families would be brought up during the upcoming talks.\n\nAnd while the Saudis say they’ll be holding official talks with the US, Kirby refused to definitively characterize the meetings taking place between Biden and the Saudi Arabian government, adding that the President will hold “lots of bilateral discussions” with the nine heads of state present at the meeting, adding, “And yes, that will certainly include King Salman and his leadership team and we would expect that the Crown Prince will be part of those discussions.”\n\nStill, there’s no sugarcoating it.\n\nSometimes presidents must do things they find distasteful or that appear hypocritical to advance what they perceive to be the national interest – that is what Biden is doing here. But his visit sends a message to states like Saudi Arabia, that as the US embarks on what looks like a new Cold War with China and Russia, repressive conduct is no barrier to relations with a President who put saving global democracy at the center of his foreign policy.\n\nBiden, for instance, praised bin Salman’s “courage” in extending a truce in Yemen. But it was MBS who started the vicious war that killed thousands of civilians. So, Jean-Pierre’s remark Tuesday that the Saudi move had saved “countless” lives in the country was rather tone deaf.\n\nOnce a pariah.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to the US on Wednesday to celebrate the transfer with US President Joe Biden.\n\n“It increases accuracy, it increases the kill rate, so it really does exactly what you want it to do which is protection on the ground on very specific targets,” retired Maj. Gen. James “Spider” Marks previously told CNN of the system’s capabilities.\n\nThe Patriot’s radar system combines “surveillance, tracking, and engagement functions in one unit,” a description from the Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) says, which makes it stand out among other air defense systems. The system’s engagements with incoming aerial threats are “nearly autonomous” aside from needing a “final launch decision” from the humans operating it.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly asked for the US Army’s Patriot – an acronym for Phased Array Tracking Radar for intercept on Target – system, as it is considered one of the most capable long-range air defense systems on the market. And though the US did not fulfill the request for the first 10 months of the war, a senior administration official told CNN that the “reality of what is going on” on the ground in Ukraine influenced their decision to do so.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Russian military has increasingly attacked Ukraine’s power grid and infrastructure as winter approached and the temperatures dropped. Zelensky told Biden that “Russian missile terror” had knocked out roughly half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.\n\nThose attacks have only further fueled Ukraine’s asks for the Patriot. In fact, the Army calls the Patriot system the service’s “most advanced air defense system,” which can intercept “any aerial threat” under “any weather conditions.”\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, former commander of US Army Europe, told CNN that there is likely some unrealistic expectations about what a Patriot battery will be able to do for Ukraine. It won’t, for example, be available to use immediately after the US agrees to provide it — it takes months to train troops on how to use the complex system, Hertling said, adding that training US troops to serve as maintainers or repairmen takes around a year. And it won’t be able to provide blanket cover for the entire country.\n\n“These systems don’t pick up and move around the battlefield,” Hertling said. “You put them in place somewhere that defends your most strategic target, like a city, like Kyiv. If anyone thinks this is going to be a system that is spread across a 500-mile border between Ukraine and Russia, they just don’t know how the system operates.”\n\nIndeed, Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at CSIS, told CNN that the Patriot is “not a game-changer” because it is “still only able to defend a relatively small piece of dirt.”\n\nNot to mention the significant logistical needs; just one battery is operated by roughly 90 soldiers, and includes computers, an engagement control system, a phased array radar, power generating equipment, and “up to eight launchers,” according to the Army.\n\nCSIS recently said in a report that the missile rounds for the Patriot come in at roughly $4 million each. Rounds that expensive likely won’t be used to shoot down every missile Russia launches toward Ukraine, Hertling said.\n\n“This is not a system that will go after drones or smaller ballistic missiles,” he said. “Can it do that? Absolutely. But when you’re talking about knocking down a $20,000 drone, or a $100,000 ballistic missile that Russia buys, with a $3-5 million rocket, that doesn’t give you much of a return on the investment. What it can do it free up the low and medium systems to go after those kind of targets.”\n\nThe system has been purchased by other US allies, including Israel, Germany, and Japan, and was sent to Poland in an effort to help them defend themselves against Russia as it invaded Ukraine on its border. The US military made clear in March when the Patriot system was sent to Poland that it was purely for defensive purposes of NATO territory and “will in no way support any offensive operations.”\n\nAnd in Ukraine’s case, Hertling says offensive operations are far more important than the Patriot system. CNN first reported last month that the US was considering a dramatic increase in the training provided to Ukrainian forces by instructing as many as 2,500 troops a month at a US base in Germany. The Pentagon said this month that combined arms training of battalion-sized elements, which will include infantry maneuvers and live fire exercises, would begin in January.\n\n“The Patriots are a defensive, anti-ballistic and anti-aircraft weapon system, with the emphasis on defensive,” Hertling said. “You don’t win wars with defensive capabilities. You win wars with offensive capabilities.”", "authors": ["Haley Britzky"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/europe/biden-russia-hypersonic-missiles-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "What to know about hypersonic missiles fired by Russia at Ukraine", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Russian bomber fired three hypersonic missiles at the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Monday night, Ukrainian officials said, as part of a barrage that leveled a number of civilian targets including hotels and a shopping mall.\n\nIt is not the first time Moscow has deployed its Kinzhal hypersonic missile during its invasion, but it does appear to be a relatively rare occurrence.\n\nRussia said it used Kinzhal missiles Ukraine in mid-March – a claim later confirmed by US officials to CNN – in the first known use of the weapon in combat.\n\nIn March, US President Joe Biden confirmed Russia’s use of the Kinzhal missile, describing it as “a consequential weapon … it’s almost impossible to stop it. There’s a reason they’re using it.”\n\nBiden’s defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has downplayed the effectiveness of the missile, telling CBS in March that he “would not see it as a game-changer.”\n\nAnd the UK defense ministry has previously said the Kinzhal missile is really just an air-launched version of the Iskander short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), which Russia has used repeatedly in its war on Ukraine.\n\nHere’s what to know.\n\nWhy the fear and hype about hypersonic missiles?\n\nFirst, it’s important to understand the term.\n\nEssentially, all missiles are hypersonic – which means they travel at least five times the speed of sound. Almost any warhead released from a rocket miles in the atmosphere will reach this speed heading to its target. It is not a new technology.\n\nWhat military powers – including Russia, China, the United States and North Korea – are working on now is a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV). An HGV is a highly maneuverable payload that can theoretically fly at hypersonic speed while adjusting course and altitude to fly under radar detection and around missile defenses.\n\nAn HGV is the weapon that’s almost impossible to stop. And Russia is thought to have an HGV in its arsenal, the Avangard system, which Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018 called “practically invulnerable” to Western air defenses.\n\nA Russian Air Force MiG-31K jet carries a high-precision hypersonic aero-ballistic missile Kh-47M2 Kinzhal during the Victory Day military parade in Moscow, Russia on May 9, 2018. Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP/FILE\n\nBut the Kinzhal, as a variant of the Iskander SRBM, is not an HGV. While it does have limited maneuverability like the Iskander, its main advantage is that it can be launched from MiG-31 fighter jets, giving it a longer range and the ability to attack from multiple directions, according to a report last year from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n“The MiG-31K can strike from unpredictable directions and could avoid interception attempts altogether. The flying carrier vehicle might also be more survivable than the road-mobile Iskander system,” the report said.\n\nThe same report also noted that the ground-launched Iskander proved vulnerable to missile defense systems during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, during which Azeri forces intercepted an Armenian Iskander.\n\n“This suggests that claims of the Kinzhal’s invulnerability to missile defense systems may also be somewhat exaggerated,” the report said.\n\nDoes Ukraine have missile defenses?\n\nThe United States and its NATO allies are already sending several surface-to-air missiles systems to Ukraine to aid in its defense.\n\nAccording to a senior US official in March, these additional systems included the Soviet-era SA-8, SA-10, SA-12 and SA-14 mobile air defense systems.\n\nNATO member Slovakia has also sent more modern S-300 missile defense batteries to Ukraine.\n\nIn April, the United Kingdom promised £100 million ($123 million) worth of high-grade military equipment, including more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles. Weeks later, Germany said it would supply 50 anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine.\n\nAnd the US is preparing a mammoth $40 billion aid package that would include additional anti-aircraft capabilities for the Ukrainian military.\n\nWhy did Putin use the Kinzhal missile?\n\nUse in Ukraine marks the combat debut for Russia’s Kinzhal system.\n\n“On March 18, the Kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse of missiles and aviation ammunition of Ukrainian troops in the village of Delyatin, Ivano-Frankivsk region,” Russia’s Defense Ministry said at the time.\n\nUS officials later confirmed to CNN that Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine and were able to track the launches in real time.\n\nThe launches in March were likely intended to test the weapons and send a message to the West about Russian capabilities, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nAt that point, the war on the ground in Ukraine had become something of a stalemate. Russia may have been looking for victories it could tout.\n\nThe UK defense ministry said at the time that Moscow probably deployed the Kinzhal to “detract from a lack of progress in Russia’s ground campaign.” Austin, the US defense secretary, used similar language in his CBS interview in March, saying Putin was”trying to reestablish some momentum.”\n\nBy the end of March, the US assessed that Russian forces were running low on air-launched cruise missiles, according to a US defense official, who said there were indications that Russia was trying to preserve that inventory as part of its declining stocks of precision guided munitions.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/26/politics/us-long-range-rockets-ukraine-mlrs/index.html", "title": "US preparing to approve advanced long-range rocket system for ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration is preparing to step up the kind of weaponry it is offering Ukraine by sending advanced, long-range rocket systems that are now the top request from Ukrainian officials, multiple officials say.\n\nThe administration is leaning toward sending the systems as part of a larger package of military and security assistance to Ukraine, which could be announced as soon as next week.\n\nSenior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have pleaded in recent weeks for the US and its allies to provide the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS. The US-made weapon systems can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of kilometers — much farther than any of the systems Ukraine already has — which the Ukrainians argue could be a gamechanger in their war against Russia.\n\nAnother system Ukraine has asked for is the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, a lighter wheeled system capable of firing many of the same types of ammunition as MLRS.\n\nRussia has in recent weeks pummeled Ukraine in the east, where Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned, Ukrainian officials have said.\n\nThe Biden administration waivered for weeks, however, on whether to send the systems, amid concerns raised within the National Security Council that Ukraine could use the new weapons to carry out offensive attacks inside Russia, officials said.\n\nOn Friday, after CNN first reported the news, Russians warned that the United States will “cross a red line” if it supplies the systems to Ukraine.\n\n“The US intends to discuss the issue of supplying Ukraine with these weapons as soon as next week,” Olga Skabeeva, a prominent Russian TV host, said on her high-profile show on the state network Rossiya-1. “At the present moment, the issue is being addressed by the US presidential administration. So now, we are not even talking about tactical weapons anymore, but about the operational-tactical weapons.”\n\nShe continued: “The US MLRS can launch shells over 500 kilometers. And if the Americans do this, they will clearly cross a red line, and we will record an attempt to provoke a very harsh response from Russia.”\n\nWhile Skabeeva does not speak for the Kremlin, her views frequently reflect official thinking.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina responded to CNN’s reporting on Twitter Friday, saying he was frustrated the Biden administration has been “dragging their feet” on giving Ukraine the rocket systems.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon’s outgoing press secretary John Kirby suggested a final decision on the MLRS hadn’t been reached yet. “Certainly we’re mindful and aware of Ukrainian asks, privately and publicly, for what is known as a multiple launch rocket system. And I won’t get ahead of decisions that haven’t been made yet,” Kirby told reporters during a briefing.\n\nIn this File photo from 2020, a US soldier sits at a Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) after an artillery live fire event by the US Army Europe's 41st Field Artillery Brigade in Germany. Christof Stache/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nThe issue of whether to supply the rocket systems was at the top of the agenda at last week’s two meetings at the White House where deputy Cabinet members convened to discuss national security policy, officials said. At the heart of the matter was the same concern the administration has grappled with since the start of the war– whether sending increasingly heavy weaponry to Ukraine will be viewed by Russia as a provocation that could trigger some kind of retaliation against the US.\n\nOne major hang-up, the sources said, had been the rocket systems’ extensive range. The MLRS and its lighter-weight version, the HIMARS, can launch as far as 300km, or 186 miles, depending on the type of munition. They are fired from a mobile vehicle at land-based targets, which would allow the Ukrainians to more easily strike targets inside Russia.\n\nUkraine is already believed to have carried out numerous cross-border strikes inside Russia, which Ukrainian officials neither confirm nor deny. Russian officials have said publicly that any threat to their homeland would constitute a major escalation and have said that western countries are making themselves a legitimate target in the war by continuing to arm the Ukrainians.\n\nAnother major concern inside the Biden administration had been whether the US could afford to give away so many high-end weapons drawn from the military’s stockpiles, the sources said.\n\nAsked on Monday whether the US would provide the systems, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin demurred. “I don’t want to get ahead of where we are in the process of resourcing requirements,” he told reporters.\n\nThe administration had similar concerns about providing Ukraine with additional MiG-29 fighter jets, which some worried could allow the Ukrainians to take the fight into Russia. Ultimately, the US decided against backfilling Poland with new jets, which would have allowed the Poles to equip Ukraine with the soviet-era MiGs.\n\nThe debate about the MLRS is also similar to one that played out before the US decided to begin sending heavier, long-range Howitzers, to Ukraine last month. Weapons packages focused on anti-tank Javelin and short-range Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, as well as small arms and ammunition. At the time, the M777 Howitzers marked a significant increase in range and power over previous systems, but even those top out at around 25 kilometers or 18 miles in range. The MLRS can fire much further still than any of the artillery the US has sent to date.\n\nOne workaround could be to provide Ukraine with shorter-range rocket systems, officials said, which is also under consideration. It would not take too long to train the Ukrainians on any of the rocket launcher systems, officials told CNN — likely about two weeks, they said.\n\nEvery drawdown from existing inventories involves a review of its potential effect on US military readiness. With the previous drawdowns, the risk has been “relatively low,” said Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley on Monday. The military is watching “very, very carefully” to make sure the stockpiles don’t drop below levels that create a greater risk, he added.\n\nThe concern grows significantly with more capable, more expensive systems of which the US does not have as large a supply, the sources said.\n\nPentagon officials met with the CEO of Lockheed Martin last week to discuss supply and ramping up production of the MLRS, one source familiar with the meeting told CNN. The meeting was led by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Bill LaPlante.\n\nThe UK is also still deciding whether to send the systems, two officials told CNN, and would like to do so in conjunction with the US.\n\nChildren walk among buildings destroyed during fighting in Mariupol, in territory under the government of the Donetsk People's Republic, eastern Ukraine, Wednesday, May 25, 2022. AP\n\nFrustration has grown on the Ukrainian side with the US’ indecisiveness in recent weeks, because they believe that once the US sends the systems then other countries will quickly follow suit.\n\nAs recently as this week, the Pentagon had told Ukraine “we are working on it,” said one irritated Ukrainian official, who added that Ukraine is asking for an update on the decision “every hour.”\n\n“We are in great need of weapons that will make it possible to engage the enemy over a long distance,” Ukraine’s top military commander, General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said Thursday. “And this cannot be delayed, because the price of delay is measured by the lives of people who have protected the world from [Russian fascism].”\n\nWhen Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was asked Thursday what his country’s most urgent needs are, he responded: “If you really care for Ukraine, weapons, weapons and weapons again.”\n\n“My least favorite phrase is ‘We are working on it’; I hate it. I want to hear either ‘We got it’ or ‘It’s not going to happen,’” he added.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, who was part of a congressional delegation trip to Kyiv earlier this month, told CNN he believes the systems could help Ukraine gain significant momentum against Russia.\n\n“I think it could be a gamechanger, to be honest with you,” Crow said, not only for offensive attacks but also for defense. He explained that Russian conventional artillery, which has a range of about 50km, “would not get close” to Ukrainian urban centers if MLRS systems were positioned there. “So it would take away their siege tactics,” he said of the Russians.\n\nThis story has been updated with comments from Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby, as well as a Russian TV host on Friday warning the US would cross a red line by sending Ukraine the MLRS, and a tweet from Republican Sen.

Zelenskyy, in his nightly address Monday, said Soledar has been the focus of Russia's assaults in recent days and there are now \"almost no whole walls left\" in the town.\n\nThe streets, he said, are covered with the bodies of Russian soldiers and scars from rocket strikes. Russia is overrunning the city, but at a cost – Zelenskyy said the Ukraine military has gained valuable time and strength for defending the region.\n\n\"I thank all the warriors in Soledar who withstand new and even tougher attacks of the occupiers,\" Zelenskyy said. \"And what did Russia want to gain there? Everything is completely destroyed, there is almost no life left. ...

The agency said Sunday that some of them have used forged documents and others tried to bribe border guards.\n\n► Ukraine is investigating the involvement of about 500 Russian leaders, including President Vladimir Putin, in 5,600 possible war crimes, Irina Venediktova, Ukraine's chief prosecutor, said Sunday.\n\n► Authorities in the region that includes Ukraine's fourth-largest city, Dnipro, say the airport was hit twice by missile attacks on Sunday.\n\nRussia warns of 'direct military confrontation' with US\n\nUkrainian forces are pushing back Russian troops so successfully that the invaders have been forced to regroup, refit and refocus, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.\n\n“Russia has changed its behavior in this war,” Sullivan said on CBS News' Face The Nation. “They have retreated. They have pulled back from substantial territory in northern and northeastern Ukraine. Chiefly the reason they made those adjustments is because they were beaten by the Ukrainians.”\n\nSullivan credited the Ukraine military — and the flow of equipment the U.S. and its allies have been sending the besieged country. Last week, he said Slovakia was able to send an S-300 air defense system because the U.S. was willing to provide a Patriot battery to replace the system Slovakia was giving away.\n\nRussian Ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly Antonov earlier told Newsweek the West is provoking Russia.\n\n\"We warn that such actions are dangerous,\" the envoy said. \"They can lead the U.S. and the Russian Federation onto the path of direct military confrontation.\"\n\nRussia appoints new war commander\n\nMoscow has appointed a new war chief after a largely unsuccessful six weeks of battle in Ukraine, a senior U.S. official said Sunday.\n\nAccording to the official, who is not authorized to be identified and spoke on condition of anonymity, said General Alexander Dvornikov has a history of brutality against Syrians and other civilians. Dvornikov, 60, one of Russia's most experienced military officers, will be the first central war commander on the ground in Ukraine.\n\nBut U.S. officials don't seem to be worried about the new appointment.Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, said: “No appointment of any general can erase the fact that Russia has already faced a strategic failure in Ukraine.”\n\nUkrainians wrap up training in US\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday thanked a small number of Ukrainian troops who were departing the United States after training to operate patrol boats and kamikaze drones, the latter among the latest military technology sent to fight Russian invaders, the Pentagon announced. The Ukrainian contingent, whose size the Pentagon has not disclosed, took part in a long-standing training mission that began Feb. 24, the day Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces invaded Ukraine.\n\nThe mission was extended to include training on Switchblade drones, which stay aloft long enough for operators to locate enemy positions or armored vehicles and then crash into them and explode.\n\nAustin thanked the Ukrainian troops by video conference on their final day at the U.S. Navy’s base at Little Creek, Va., Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement.\n\nAustrian chancellor to meet with Putin; some Ukrainians not pleased\n\nAustrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday for talks, two days after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Nehammer told the Austrian Press Agency he hopes to promote dialogue between the countries and will address Putin's \"war crimes\" in Ukraine.\n\nNehammer's plans drew immediate fallout in Ukraine. The deputy mayor of Mariupol, Sergei Orlow, told the German outlet Bild that the meeting was not appropriate.\n\n\"The war crimes that Russia is currently committing on Ukrainian soil are still taking place,” he told Bild. \"I don't understand how to have a conversation with Putin at this time, how to do business with him.\"\n\nRussia scrambling to bolster troop strength\n\nIn response to mounting losses, the Russian armed forces are trying to bolster troop numbers by bringing back veterans discharged from the military over the last 10 years, according to an assessment from the British Defense Ministry. Efforts to generate more fighting power also include trying to recruit from the Moldovan separatist Transnistria region, the ministry said.\n\nThe assessment was released one day after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, promising a new package of financial and military aid for Ukraine's \"struggle against Russia’s barbaric campaign.\"\n\n\"The Ukrainians have the courage of a lion,\" Johnson tweeted. \"President @ZelenskyyUa has given the roar of that lion. The UK stands unwaveringly with the people of Ukraine.\"\n\nNATO leader calls for 'reset' and more defense spending\n\nJens Stoltenberg, the secretary general for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is looking to “reset” the alliance and have member states increase their defense spending, he told the Daily Telegraph in the United Kingdom.\n\n“What we see now is a new reality, a new normal for European security,” Stoltenberg said. “Therefore, we have now asked our military commanders to provide options for what we call a reset, a more longer-term adaptation of NATO.”\n\nStoltenberg said not all NATO members are spending 2% of their gross domestic product on national defense and would like to see them meet that threshold. He pointed to a plan by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to increase defense spending by 100 billion euros over the next two years to get to 2% of GDP.\n\n“With the size of the German economy, this really makes a huge difference also for NATO'S total defense spending,” he said.\n\nUkraine foreign minister says country should have been in NATO long ago\n\nUkraine would not be struggling to defend itself against Russia's onslaught if Ukraine had been allowed to join NATO more than a decade ago, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Sunday on Meet the Press. He said a \"strategic mistake\" was made by Germany and France in 2008 when they rejected efforts by the U.S. and other allies to bring Ukraine into the defense alliance.\n\n“If we were a member of NATO, this war wouldn't take place,” Kuleba said. “The strategic mistake is something that we are paying for. It's not Germany or France that are paying the costs for this mistake. It's Ukraine.”\n\nHe credited the U.S. with doing \"more than any other country in the world to provide us with necessary weapons” but said weapons need to come faster. All the parties spend too much time discussing whether Ukraine should be given offensive versus defensive weapons, he said.\n\nPetraeus predicts 'more of what we have seen' as war evolves\n\nRetired four-star general and former CIA director David Petraeus said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union that onlookers should expect “more of what we have seen” now that Russian President Vladimir Putin has turned over military operations in Ukraine to Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikov.\n\nDvornikov led military forces in Syria, where the Russian military was known for “depopulating” areas, Petraeus said. He said the missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk that killed dozens was the first major operation under Dvornikov’s leadership. Petraeus said the war is now focused in the Donbas region in the east and parts of the south. He said if the Russian military can take over land outside of the separatist states in the Donbas region and grab some land north of Crimea, Putin can spin the success as a win.\n\nKyiv mayor pleads for more weapons for Ukraine military\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir Klitschiko appeared Sunday on ABC This Week and said the country needed weapons to continue fighting the Russians, even as the war with the nuclear power is changing.\n\n“Weapons support is very, very important for us in this critical time – and we see who are the real friends of Ukraine,” Vitali said.\n\n“We cannot defend our country with our fists,” Wladimir Klitschiko said.\n\nHe said Russia pulling out of Kyiv did not end the war, but changed where it is being fought. He said fighting continues in the south and the east. “We are expecting Russian military forces being back and targeting the capital of Ukraine.”\n\nWladimir Klitschiko also said the second thing the country needs is for the western world to continue to isolate Russia economically. “Every cent and every trade that you do with Russia … they’re using for weapons to kill us,” he said.\n\nRussia's leadership change means continued 'brutality,' Psaki says\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told Fox News Sunday that a move at the top of the Russian military operation in Ukraine is a sign of more \"brutality\" to come.\n\n\"The reports were seeing of a change in military leadership and putting a general in charge who was responsible for the brutality and the atrocities we saw in Syria shows that there's going to be a continuation of what we've already seen on the ground in Ukraine, and that's what we are expecting,\" Psaki said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has named Army Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, commander of Russia’s Southern Military District, to oversee the war, media outlets have reported. He has been described as the \"Butcher of Syria,\" having led brutal campaigns in that country. The Kremlin's acknowledgement last week of casualties in the war was unexpected, Psaki added.\n\n\"Rarely do they acknowledge from the Russian leadership, any elements of weakness or any elements of defeat,\" she said.\n\nUkraine says 19,000 Russian troops have been killed\n\nThe Defense Ministry of Ukraine said Russia has lost over 19,000 troops and thousands of pieces of military equipment in 46 days of war. The ministry posted its tally to Twitter early Sunday.\n\nUkraine listed Russia’s human toll at about 19,300 personnel. The ministry calculated Moscow’s military equipment loss at 1,384 vehicles, 722 tanks, 1,911 armored vehicles and seven watercraft. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told British media on Thursday that Russia had experienced “significant losses of troops.” On Friday, he pointed to the official defense ministry tally of 1,351 soldiers dead.\n\nIn late March, NATO estimated that Russia may have lost as many as 15,000 troops, and up to 40,000 killed, wounded or taken prisoner.\n\nRefugee count rises to 4.5M\n\nThe number of people who have streamed out of Ukraine since war broke out on Feb. 24 has risen to over 4.5 million, the U.N. reported Sunday.\n\nThe U.N. refugee agency reported on its data site the higher number, which originates from a number of sources, but mainly border crossing points.\n\nNearly 2.6 million of those refugees have arrived in Poland, followed by over 686,000 in Romania. As many as 404,000 have arrived in Russia since war broke out, according to the figures. The agency notes many refugees may have moved on to other countries, beyond the neighboring country into which they initially crossed.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/europe/biden-weapons-deal-analysis-intl/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Biden is set to unveil $1.8B weapons deal for Ukraine ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS President Joe Biden is expected to announce an additional $1.8 billion in security assistance to Ukraine during President Volodymyr Zelensky’s expected visit to the White House. The significant boost in aid is expected to be headlined by the Patriot missile defense systems that are included in the package, a US official told CNN.\n\nWhat are details of the expected weapons deal?\n\nThere are two key headline deliverables: first, the Patriot missile systems. Complex, accurate, and expensive, they have been described as the US’s “gold standard” of air defense. NATO preciously guards them, and they require the personnel who operate them – almost 100 in a battalion for each weapon – to be properly trained.\n\nThe second are precision-guided munitions for Ukrainian jets. Ukraine, and Russia, largely are equipped with munitions that are “dumb” – fired roughly towards a target. Ukraine has been provided with more and more Western standard precision artillery and missiles, like Howitzers and HIMARS respectively.\n\nThe new deal will likely include the supply of guidance kits, or Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs), which Ukraine can use to bolt on to their unguided missiles or bombs. This will increase their accuracy and the rate in which Kyiv’s forces burn through ammunition. A lot of the $1.8 billion is expected to fund munitions replacements and stocks.\n\nUkrainian servicemen ride American self-propelled howitzers in Donetsk. Gleb Garanich/Reuters\n\nWhat difference will it make to the war?\n\nThese two headline packages alone could impact the course of the war. Russia’s most potent threat now is the constant bombardment of energy infrastructure. It is making winter colder and unbearable for some, plunging cities into darkness of up 12 hours a day and sometimes longer, in the hope of sapping high Ukrainian morale.\n\nPatriot air defense systems could intercept a large number of Russia’s missiles and attack drones – although Ukraine already claims a high success rate; on Monday, for example, it said 30 out of 35 missiles had been stopped. The Patriot is also a sign NATO’s best technology is on the table to help Ukraine win the war, or at least hold Russia back.\n\nIn this February 20, 2020 file photo, a member of the US Air Force stands near a Patriot missile battery at the Prince Sultan Air Base in al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AP\n\nMore precision weapons are vital: they ensure Ukraine hits its targets, and not any civilians remaining nearby. And it means Ukraine does not go through the hundreds or thousands of shells Russia appears to burn through as it blanket bombards areas it wants to capture.\n\nThe consumption rate of munitions for both sides will become an existential issue as the war drags into its second year.\n\nHow will Russia react?\n\nNoisily, but that may be all. Kremlin watchers like to parse the latest statements from the Russian President Vladimir Putin each time US weapons deliveries improve Ukraine’s position. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday the latest tranche “leads to an aggravation of the conflict and does not bode well for Ukraine.”\n\nBut Moscow is struggling to equip and rally its conventional forces, and, with the exception of its nuclear forces, appears to be running out of new cards to play. China and India have joined the West in open statements against the use of nuclear force, which has made that option even less likely.\n\nWestern analysts have noted Russia has grumbled consistently about these deliveries, but been relatively muted in its practical response to the crossing of what, as recently as January, might have been considered “red lines.”\n\nAre there more such deals in the pipeline?\n\nYes. There is an enormous $45 billion aid package in the works, and while not all military, it is part of a consistent drumbeat from the Biden administration. The message is simple: Ukraine is receiving as much aid as Washington can provide, short of boots on the ground, and that aid will not stop.\n\nWhatever the eventual truth of the matter – and military aid is opaque at the best of times – Biden wants Putin to hear nothing but headline figures in the billions, to sap Russian resolve, push European partners to help more, and make Ukraine’s resources seem limitless.\n\nHow much bipartisan support does Biden have for the deal?\n\nThis is trickier. Congress’s likely new Speaker, Republican Kevin McCarthy, has warned the Biden administration cannot expect a “blank cheque” from the new GOP-led House of Representatives.\n\nThe remnants of the Trumpist “America First” elements of that party have echoed doubts about how much aid the US should really be sending to the edges of eastern Europe.\n\nRealistically, the bill for the slow defeat of Russia in this dark and lengthy conflict is relatively light for Washington, given its near trillion-dollar annual defense budget.\n\nVideo by CNN affiliate TVN in Poland captures the moment Zelensky arrived by train in Przemysl, near the Polish/Ukrainian border, on his way to Washington on Wednesday, December 21.

A booster engine accelerated the missile to high speed, at which point the air-breathing scramjet engine ignited and propelled the missile at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5 and above.\n\nThe official offered scant details of the missile test, only noting the missile flew above 65,000 feet and for more than 300 miles. But even at the lower end of hypersonic range – about 3,800 miles per hour – a flight of 300 miles is less than 5 minutes.\n\nThe test came days after Russia says it used its own hypersonic missile during its invasion of Ukraine, claiming it targeted an ammunition warehouse in western Ukraine.\n\nUS officials downplayed the significance of the Russian use of their hypersonic Kinzhal missile. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he did not view it as “some sort of game changer” after the Russians announced the missile launch. Days later, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said it was “hard to know what exactly the justification” was for the launch, since it targeted a stationary storage facility.\n\n“That’s a pretty significant sledgehammer to take out a target like that,” Kirby said at the time.\n\nThe Kinzhal missile is simply an air-launched version of the Russian Iskander short-range ballistic missile. In other words, it is a variation of an established technology as opposed to a revolution in hypersonic weaponry. The US test was of a more sophisticated and difficult air-breathing scramjet engine. The HAWC missile also has no warhead, instead relying on its kinetic energy to destroy the target.\n\nAt the time of the US test, Biden was preparing for a visit to NATO allies in Europe, including a stop in Poland where he met with Ukraine’s foreign minister and defense minister.\n\nThe US has been careful not to take steps or make statements that could unnecessarily escalate the tensions between Washington and Moscow. On Friday, the US canceled a test of the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to avoid any misinterpretation by Russia. Austin had already postponed the test in early March to avoid any actions that could be misconstrued by Russia at such a sensitive time.\n\nIn general, the US has also remained somewhat discreet about the weapons and equipment it sends into Ukraine. Only in the latest $300 million security assistance package did the Defense Department list specific systems and weapons.\n\nThe US has also opposed the transfer of fighter aircraft to Ukraine through the United States, concerned that the Kremlin could interpret such a move as the US and NATO entering the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nUS officials remained quiet about this latest hypersonic test for two weeks for similar reasons, the defense official said, careful not to provoke the Kremlin or President Vladimir Putin, especially as Russian forces expanded their bombardment of Ukraine.\n\nThe US test is the second successful test of a HAWC missile, and it is the first of the Lockheed Martin version of the weapon. Last September, the Air Force tested the Raytheon HAWC, powered by a Northrop Grumman scramjet engine.\n\nThe test met all primary objectives, according to a press release from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), including the missile’s integration and release, safe separation from the launch aircraft, booster firing, and cruise. Then too officials offered few details about the flight, with no mention of how fast the missile flew or what distance it traveled. The release only stated that the missile traveled at speeds greater than Mach 5.\n\nThe US has placed a renewed emphasis on hypersonic weapons following successful Russian and Chinese tests in recent months, exacerbating the concern in Washington that the US is falling behind on a military technology considered critical for the future.\n\nIn the FY23 defense budget, the Biden administration has requested $7.2 billion for long range fires, including hypersonic missiles. In a report last year, the Government Accountability Office identified 70 efforts related to the development of hypersonic weapons, expected to cost nearly $15 billion between 2015 and 2024.\n\nOne month after the first successful HAWC test, the US suffered a setback when the test of a different hypersonic system failed. The failure came just as reports emerged that China had successfully tested a hypersonic glide vehicle over the summer and shortly after Russia claimed to have successfully tested its submarine-launched hypersonic missile, dubbed the Tsirkon.", "authors": ["Oren Liebermann"], "publish_date": "2022/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/asia/china-taiwan-invasion-scenarios-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "title": "China has the power to take Taiwan, but it would cost an extremely ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nOn his first trip to Asia as United States President last week, Joe Biden gave his strongest warning yet to Beijing that Washington was committed to defending Taiwan militarily in the event of an attack from China.\n\nBiden’s comments, which compared a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, appeared to deviate from Washington’s decades-old policy of “strategic ambiguity” on the issue and seemingly raised the possibility of a military clash between US and Chinese forces.\n\nIt’s the third time Biden has made similar remarks since taking office and, just as on the other two occasions, they were quickly walked back by the White House – which insists its policy has not changed. However, it inevitably raises the question: if China tries to take Taiwan, are the United States and its allies able to stop it?\n\nAnd the alarming answer is: Quite possibly not. Analysts say China has more troops, more missiles and more ships than Taiwan or its possible supporters, like the US or Japan, could bring to a fight. That means that if China is absolutely determined to take the island it probably can.\n\nBut there’s a caveat; while China could likely prevail, any victory would come at an extremely bloody price for both Beijing and its adversaries.\n\nMany analysts say an invasion of Taiwan would be more dangerous and complex than the Allied D-Day landings in France in World War II. US government documents put the number of killed, injured and missing from both sides during the almost three-month-long Normandy campaign at almost half a million troops.\n\nAnd the civilian carnage could be far, far worse.\n\nTaiwan’s population of 24 million people is packed into dense urban areas like the capital Taipei, with an average of 9,575 people per square kilometer. Compare that to Mariupol, Ukraine – devastated in the war with Russia – and with an average of 2,690 people per square kilometer.\n\nDespite its numerical advantages in sea-, air- and land-based forces in the region, China has Achilles heels in each arena of war that would force Beijing to think long and hard about whether an invasion is worth the overwhelming human cost.\n\nHere are some scenarios of how a Chinese invasion might play out:\n\nThe naval war\n\nChina has the world’s largest navy, with around 360 combat vessels – bigger than the US’ fleet of just under 300 ships.\n\nBeijing also has the world’s most-advanced merchant fleet, a large coast guard and, experts say, a maritime militia – fishing boats unofficially aligned with the military – giving it access to hundreds of additional vessels that could be used to transport the hundreds of thousands of troops that analysts say China would need for an amphibious invasion.\n\nAnd those troops would need massive amounts of supplies.\n\n“For Beijing to have reasonable prospects of victory, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) would have to move thousands of tanks, artillery guns, armored personnel vehicles, and rocket launchers across with the troops. Mountains of equipment and lakes of fuel would have to cross with them,” Ian Easton, a senior director at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote in The Diplomat last year.\n\nGetting a force of that size across the 110 miles (177 kilometers) of the Taiwan Strait would be a long, dangerous mission during which those vessels carrying the troops and equipment would be sitting ducks.\n\n“The thought about China invading Taiwan, that’s a massacre for the Chinese navy,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThat’s because Taiwan has been stocking up on cheap and effective land-based anti-ship missiles, similar to the Neptunes Ukraine used to sink the Russian cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea in April.\n\n“Taiwan is mass-producing these things. And they’re small, it’s not like (China) can take them all out,” O’Brien said.\n\n“What’s cheap is a surface-to-ship missile, what’s expensive is a ship.”\n\nThe Chinese guided-missile destroyer Changsha returns to a port in Sanya City, China, in March 2017. Zeng Tao/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nStill, China could – given its numerical advantage – simply decide the losses were worth it, pointed out Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine captain and now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n“There’s gonna be hundreds if not thousands of (Chinese) vessels there to soak up those (Taiwanese) missiles,” Shugart said.\n\nMissiles aside, China would face massive logistical hurdles in landing enough soldiers. Conventional military wisdom holds that an attacking force should outnumber defenders 3 to 1.\n\n“With a potential defending force of 450,000 Taiwanese today … China would need over 1.2 million soldiers (out of a total active force of more than 2 million) that would have to be transported in many thousands of ships,” Howard Ullman, a former US Navy officer and professor at the US Naval War College, wrote in a February essay for the Atlantic Council.\n\nHe estimated such an operation would take weeks and that despite China’s maritime strength, it “simply lacks the military capability and capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan for the foreseeable future.”\n\nAircraft carrier killers\n\nSome of the problems that would face China’s navy in Taiwan would also face any US naval force sent to defend the island.\n\nThe US Navy sees its aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, bristling with F-35 and F/A-18 jets, as its spear in the Pacific and would have a numerical advantage in this area. The US has 11 carriers in total, compared to China’s two. However, only about half are combat ready at any one time and even these might be vulnerable.\n\nO’Brien and others point out that the People’s Liberation Army has more than 2,000 conventionally armed missiles, many of which it has developed with the US Navy’s prized aircraft carriers in mind.\n\nOf particular concern would be China’s DF-26 and DF-21D – touted by Beijing’s state-run Global Times tabloid in 2020 as “aircraft carrier killers” and the “world’s first ballistic missiles capable of targeting large and medium-sized vessels.”\n\nAs O’Brien puts it, “The US better be careful thinking about, in any kind of war environment, sending carrier battle groups close to China … If you’re fighting a state-to-state war, you’re going to stay far away from shore.”\n\nOthers are more confident in the US carriers.\n\nRear Adm. Jeffery Anderson, the commander of the US Navy’s Carrier Strike Group Three centered on the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, recently told CNN his ships are more than ready to deal with the kind of missiles that sank the Moskva.\n\n“One thing I do know about our US ships is they’re extremely survivable. Not only are they lethal, but they are extremely survivable,” he said.\n\nA Chinese air force fighter jet takes off during training exercises in 2017. Liu Chang/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nThe air war\n\nChina is likely to seek air superiority early into any conflict, analysts say, and may feel it has an advantage in the skies.\n\nFlight Global’s 2022 directory of the world’s air forces shows the PLA with almost 1,600 combat aircraft, compared to Taiwan’s fewer than 300. The directory shows the US with more than 2,700 combat aircraft, but those cover the world while China’s are all in the region.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Taiwan holds ceremony for advanced F-16V fighter jets 02:11 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the air war, China also will have learned from Russia’s failures in Ukraine – where Moscow took months assembling its ground forces yet failed to soften up the terrain for them with a bombing campaign – and is more likely to emulate the “shock and awe” bombardments that preceded the US’ invasions of Iraq.\n\n“I’m sure the PLA is learning from what they’re seeing,” Shugart said. “You can read open-source translations of their strategic documents. They learned very carefully from what we did in Desert Storm and Kosovo.”\n\nBut even in the air China would face significant difficulties.\n\nA guided-missile-armed J-20 stealth fighter jet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force performs at Airshow China 2018. Shu ying/Imagine China/Reuters\n\nRussia’s failure to quickly seize control of the skies in Ukraine initially dumbfounded many analysts. Some put the failure down to the cheap antiaircraft missiles Western militaries have supplied to Kyiv.\n\nTaiwan has deals with the United States to supply it with Stinger antiaircraft missiles and Patriot missile defense batteries. And it also has been investing heavily in its own missile production facilities over the past three years in a project, when completed this summer, will see its missile production capabilities triple, according to a Janes report in March.\n\nOn the other hand, China would have an advantage over the US due to its closeness to Taiwan.\n\nA recent war game run by the Center for a New American Security concluded that an aerial conflict between the US and China would likely end in stalemate.\n\nCommenting on the result to Air Force Magazine, Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, US Air Force deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said that while the US was used to dominating the skies some factors weren’t in its favor.\n\nChina had “invested in modern aircraft and weapons to fight us,” he noted, and US forces would also face the “tyranny of distance” – most of the US air power used in the war game operated out of the Philippines, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) away.\n\nThe war game simulated Chinese forces beginning their campaign by trying to take out the nearest US bases in places like Guam and Japan.\n\nHinote likened that move to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, saying China would be motivated by “many of the same reasons.”\n\n“The attack is designed to give Chinese forces the time they need to invade and present the world with a fait accompli,” he told the magazine.\n\nChina has a growing arsenal of short-, medium- and intermediate range ballistic missiles that can reach these far-flung targets.\n\nAs of 2020, the PLA had at least 425 missile launchers capable of hitting those US bases, according to the China Power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nA Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldier fires an anti-tank rocket during a live-fire military exercise in Wuzhong, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China in 2019. Reuters\n\nThe ground war\n\nEven in a scenario where China was willing to take these risks and managed to get a significant amount of troops ashore, its forces would then face another uphill battle.\n\nTaiwan has about 150,000 troops and 2.5 million reservists – and its entire national defense strategy is based on countering a Chinese invasion.\n\nLike their counterparts in Ukraine the Taiwanese would have the advantage of home turf, knowing the ground and being highly motivated to defend it.\n\nFirst, the PLA would need to find a decent landing spot – ideally close to both the mainland and a strategic city such as Taipei with nearby port and airport facilities. Experts have identified just 14 beaches that would fit the bill and Taiwan is well aware of which ones those are. Its engineers have spent decades digging tunnels and bunkers to protect them.\n\nTaiwan’s troops would also be relatively fresh compared to their Chinese counterparts, who would be drained from the journey over and would still need to push through the island’s western mud flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, toward Taipei.\n\nChinese troops could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely.\n\nAnother problem for Chinese troops would be their lack of battlefield experience. The last time the PLA was in active combat was in 1979, when China fought a brief border war with Vietnam.\n\nSoldiers of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fire a mortar during a live-fire military exercise in Anhui province, China May 22, 2021. cnsphoto/Reuters\n\nIn that effort, China “really got a bloody nose, it was not very successful operation,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n“So China’s military today is not battle tested, and it could suffer great losses, if it indeed attacked Taiwan,” Glaser said.\n\nOthers pointed out that even battle-tested troops could struggle against a well-motivated defensive force – noting that the Russian military was bogged down in Ukraine despite its recent fighting experience in Syria and Georgia.\n\nStill, as with the other scenarios, it is not only Chinese forces that might be handicapped by a lack of experience. Taiwan’s troops have also not been tested, and depending on the scenario, there are holes in even the US’ experience. As Shugart put it: “There is not a single US naval officer who has sunk another ship in combat.”\n\nWhat are the chances China attacks?\n\nGlaser, the German Marshall Fund analyst, thinks a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is unlikely.\n\n“I think that the PLA lacks full confidence that it can seize and control Taiwan. The PLA itself talks about some of the deficiencies in its capability,” she said.\n\n“And obviously, the war in Ukraine highlights some of the challenges that China could face; it is certainly much harder to launch a war 100 miles across a body of water than it is across land borders, (such as those) between Russia and Ukraine,” she said.\n\nShe noted that the strong Ukrainian resistance may be giving Taiwan’s people reason to fight for their land.\n\n“Given how Ukraine has really demonstrated a very high morale and willingness to defend its freedoms … I think that this is likely to change the calculus of not only military leaders in China, but hopefully also of (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping personally,” she said.\n\nO’Brien, the University of St. Andrews professor, wrote in The Spectator this year that any war over Taiwan would lead to devastating losses on all sides, something that should make their leaders tread carefully before committing troops.\n\n“If the Ukrainian war teaches us anything, it is that war is almost always a rash choice. Don’t underestimate your opponent, and don’t assume your systems will all work that well.”\n\nA Chinese amy tank takes part in military drills in 2018. Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAny other option?\n\nOf course, the PLA has options other than a full-blown invasion.\n\nThese include taking outlying Taiwanese islands or imposing a quarantine on the main island, Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow wrote last year in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Residents of Taipei on edge about China after Russia invades Ukraine 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPossible PLA targets could be Taiping Island, Taiwan’s most far-flung outpost in the South China Sea; the tiny Pratas Island, a small outpost 170 nautical miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Hong Kong; Kinmen and Matsu islands, tiny territories just a few miles off mainland China’s coast; or Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWhile a PLA victory of any of the four is almost assured, it could come at the cost of galvanizing support for Taiwan in the rest of the world – much as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has united the West against it.\n\nBlackwill and Zelikow said the quarantine option might be more effective.\n\n“In a quarantine scenario, the Chinese government would effectively take control of the air and sea borders of Taiwan,” they wrote. “The Chinese government would run effectively a clearance operation offshore or in the air to screen incoming ships and aircraft. The screeners could then wave along what they regarded as innocent traffic.”\n\nAnything regarded as belligerent, such as US military aid for Taiwan, could be blocked or confiscated as a violation of Chinese sovereignty, they say. Meanwhile, China could allow the Taiwan government to function as normal except for foreign affairs.\n\nThis option would have an advantage in China’s eyes: the ball would be in the US’ court as to whether to use force to end the quarantine. Then it would be the US that would have to consider whether to risk a war that could cost countless lives.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Ivan Watson", "Brad Lendon", "Ivan Watson"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/us/five-things-december-22-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for December 22: Winter weather, Ukraine, Jan. 6 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Winter weather\n\nA major storm system, which the National Weather Service is calling a “once in a generation type event,” is touching nearly every state in the US. More than 100 million people are currently under winter weather and wind chill alerts as record-breaking temperature drops are being observed. Denver International Airport saw a 37-degree drop in temperature over one hour Wednesday, which officials said is the biggest ever drop recorded at that location. That same day, Cheyenne, Wyoming, also saw a 30-degree drop in temperature in just 10 minutes. Governors in Georgia, Oklahoma and Kentucky have each declared a state emergency, as several other state leaders activate emergency response operations. Major cities in the South – including Nashville, Memphis, Birmingham, Alabama, and Jackson, Mississippi – are all expected to see snow today.\n\n2. Ukraine\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed gratitude for US support in an impassioned address to Congress during his first overseas trip since the Russian invasion of his country began. In his speech Wednesday, Zelensky called for more US help and stronger sanctions against Moscow, telling lawmakers Ukraine “will never surrender,” and that their support “is not charity” but an investment in democracy. Earlier in the day, President Joe Biden had announced the US will send Kyiv a Patriot missile defense system as part of an additional $1.8 billion assistance package, and Zelensky reiterated that air defense systems are crucial to countering Russian attacks. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared there would be a substantial investment in his military as the war drags on.\n\n3. January 6\n\nHouse Republicans released a report Wednesday focused on security failures at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, highlighting well-documented breakdowns in intelligence sharing, Capitol security and coordination between various law enforcement agencies responding to the riot. Republicans cast the report as a rebuttal to the bipartisan House select committee’s investigation into the day’s events as they are set to take control of the chamber – and endeavor to take back the narrative. The Democratic-led select committee had planned to release its final report on Wednesday but has delayed the rollout until today. An executive summary released Monday laid blame for the insurrection squarely on former President Donald Trump.\n\n4. Crypto\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange FTX, is expected to soon be arraigned in the US after being extradited from the Bahamas Wednesday night. He faces eight counts of fraud and conspiracy following an indictment by federal prosecutors. In the wake of the company’s collapse, federal prosecutors in New York charged him with defrauding investors and stealing billions from FTX customer assets to pay for losses at his hedge fund. If convicted on all charges, the 30-year-old could face life in prison. Two of Bankman-Fried’s former senior executives were also charged Wednesday for their roles in the yearslong scheme. They pleaded guilty to multiple criminal charges and are cooperating with federal prosecutors, according to court records.\n\n5. Covid-19\n\nParts of China hit hard by rising Covid-19 cases have resorted to rationing the amount of medicine for sale down to the pill as the country faces a huge wave of infections. Local versions of Tylenol and Advil – some of the most common drugs used to alleviate flu-like symptoms – are nearly impossible to get at drugstores across China, fueling anger and concern. In some areas, purchases of ibuprofen are being strictly limited to a maximum of six tablets or 3 ounces of liquid per customer per week. Meanwhile in the US, Covid-19 and other causes have driven life expectancy down to 76.4 years, the lowest it has been since 1996, CDC data shows.\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nRunaway llama outsmarts officers in lengthy police chase\n\nThe adventurous llama caused some drama after escaping her enclosure in Fairfax County, Virginia.

Tesla’s driver-assist technologies are already being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration following reports of unexpected braking that occurs “without warning, at random, and often repeatedly in a single drive.” The agency has received hundreds of complaints from Tesla drivers.\n\nTODAY’S QUOTE\n\n“This bill is hanging by a thread.”\n\n– Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, warning Wednesday that Democrats are struggling to reach an agreement with Republicans on the $1.7 trillion federal spending bill.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is slated to virtually address Biden and other G7 leaders on Monday.\n\nIn response to requests by Ukrainian forces, other military assistance is also likely to be announced this week, including additional artillery ammunition and counter-battery radars. Ukrainian officials have asked for the missile defense system, known as a NASAMS system, given the weapons can hit targets more than 100 miles away, though the Ukrainian forces will likely need to be trained on the systems, a source said. The NASMAS system the same one that protects Washington, DC, and the area around the nation’s capital.\n\nThe US has been steadily announcing additional security assistance for Ukraine. Last week, the Biden administration announced an additional $450 million in military assistance for Ukraine, giving it four more multiple launch rocket systems and artillery ammunition for other systems.\n\nAnd earlier this month, the Biden administration said it was providing an additional $1 billion in military aid to Ukraine, a package that includes shipments of additional howitzers, ammunition and coastal defense systems.\n\nCNN reported last week that US assessments of the war increasingly envision a long and punishing battle in the eastern part of Ukraine, with high personnel and equipment losses on both sides.\n\nUS officials believe that Russian forces plan to maintain intense attacks in the east, characterized by heavy artillery and missile strikes, with the intention of wearing down Ukrainian forces and NATO resolve over time.\n\nFor Ukraine’s part, its military has been burning through Soviet-era ammunition that fits older systems, and Western governments have been facing a tough decision on whether they want to continue increasing their assistance to the country, something Biden has already pledged to do.\n\n“We will continue to lead the world in providing historic assistance to support Ukraine’s fight for freedom,” the President wrote in a New York Times op-ed last month.", "authors": ["Kaitlan Collins Natasha Bertrand Phil Mattingly", "Kaitlan Collins", "Natasha Bertrand", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/06/26"}]}

It was the first show back following a period of controversy fueled by representation struggles within the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.\n\nThe dark comedy \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" took home best comedy/musical, screenplay and best comedy actor for Colin Farrell. Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan garnered lead comedy actress and supporting actor wins respectively for \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" while Austin Butler (\"Elvis\") and Cate Blanchett (\"Tár\") won major acting prizes in the drama categories.\n\n'The Fabelmans,' Austin Butler:The complete 2023 Golden Globes winners list\n\nGolden Globes:The 6 biggest moments, from Jennifer Coolidge to Jerrod Carmichael's Tom Cruise jab\n\n'The Fabelmans,' 'Banshees of Inisherin' gained Oscar momentum at Golden Globes\n\nHere are the highlights from Globes night:\n\n\"The Fabelmans\" wins best drama and \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is named best comedy/musical.\n\nAustin Butler snags best actor in a drama for \"Elvis,\" Cate Blanchett wins best actress for \"Tár.\"\n\nMichelle Yeoh (\"Everything Everywhere\") and Colin Farrell (\"Banshees of Inisherin\") take lead comedy actor awards.\n\n'The Banshees of Inisherin' wins for best comedy, 'Fabelmans' is top drama\n\nThe Martin McDonagh dark comedy defeats the acclaimed \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\" More expected, Steven Spielberg's \"The Fabelmans\" is named best drama. The director shouts out composer John Williams and recalls being John Cassavetes' personal assistant. But he wants to wrap up the NBC show, which is running behind schedule, \"because my office is on the Universal lot and I want to stay on the Universal lot.\"\n\nWhat's the point of the Golden Globes anymore? The awards show should never have returned\n\nWhat TV didn't show at the Globes:Jennifer Coolidge swarmed, Austin Butler can't quit Elvis\n\n'House of Dragon' takes a sword to its best drama competition\n\nThe \"Game of Thrones\" prequel takes the Globe for top TV drama. \"I've got to say, 'Severance' is an awesome show,\" says executive producer Ryan Condal. \"If I could've made 'House of Dragon' like 'Severance,' I would have.\" More unsurprisingly, he also shouts out \"GOT\" as a \"really good show.\"\n\nKevin Costner wins for TV's 'Yellowstone,' 'Abbott Elementary' is best comedy\n\nCostner didn't make it to the show so Regina Hall accepts his award for best actor in a drama series. Quinta Brunson's definitely in the building, though, and the \"Abbott Elementary\" creator/star comes back to the stage to grab the Globe for best comedy. \"Are we all here?\" she says, making sure the whole cast is around her. \"I created this show because I love comedy,\" and she shouts out Henry Winkler, Seth Rogen and Bob Odenkirk. \"Comedy is so important to me.\"\n\nEddie Murphy is honored with Cecil B. DeMille Award\n\nTracy Morgan acknowledges that Murphy “was the reason why I’m in comedy” and he presents the achievement award to the comedian alongside Jamie Lee Curtis. \"I’ve watched you grow as a man and a husband and a friend, and we’ve all seen you grow as an artist,\" she says. Murphy remarks he's \"been in show business for 46 years and I’ve been in the movie business for 41 years, so this is a long time in the making.\" He also wants to make a point to the \"new up-and-coming dreamers in the room,\" he says. \"There is a definitive blueprint to follow for success, prosperity, longevity and peace of mind. And I followed it my whole career. These three things: Pay your taxes, mind your business and keep Will Smith’s wife’s name out of your (expletive) mouth!\"\n\nHBO's 'The White Lotus' rules the limited series category\n\n\"I'm still so choked up after Jennifer's speech,\" creator Mike White says after his star Jennifer Coolidge won a supporting actress honor. Looking at TV executives in audience, he jokes, \"You all passed on this show, so it's gratifying to have this moment.\"\n\nAmanda Seyfried wins for 'The Dropout,' Evan Peters for 'Dahmer'\n\nSeyfried isn't there, so \"Yellowstone\" actors accept her award for lead actress in a limited series. Peters is, though, so he grabs his trophy personally after winning actor in a limited series for Netflix's \"Dahmer: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.\" \"It was a colossal team effort,\" Peter says of a show that was \"a difficult one to make, a difficult one to watch, but I sincerely hope some good came out of it.\"\n\nPaul Walter Hauser, Jennifer Coolidge snag supporting TV honors\n\nHauser gets his first Globe win, for supporting actor in a limited series, for the Apple TV+ series \"Black Bird.\" \"It's like a wax museum with a pulse, right?\" he cracks, not getting many laughs from the unamused crowd. Coolidge also goes home with her first Globe, a supporting actress victory for HBO's \"The White Lotus.\" \"I don't work out, I can't hold it that long,\" she says, needing to put the trophy down. She tearfully thanks Ryan Murphy and others who gave her \"little jobs\" to keep her career going and also the \"American Pie\" movies: \"I'm down for (Nos.) 6 and 7.\" But \"White Lotus\" creator Mike White \"has given me hope (and) changed my life in a million different ways.\"\n\nSteven Spielberg wins best director for 'The Fabelmans'\n\nHis third win in the directing category, Spielberg takes home the trophy for his semi-autobiographical film. \"I always say if I prepare something, I jinx it,\" he says. \"And I'm really happy about this.\" But the director says his family, his sisters and late parents, \"are happier about this.\" Spielberg adds he never had the courage to \"hit this story head on\" until writer Tony Kushner started \"a conversation\" with him. \"Nobody knows who we are until we have the courage to tell who we are,\" and at age 74, Spielberg, now 76, told himself, \"I better do it now.\"\n\nBest screenplay goes to 'The Banshees of Inisherin'\n\nMartin McDonagh gets his second Globes win for the dark comedy. \"I wrote this film for Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson and their beautiful nuanced performances blew me out of the water,\" he says. \"I'll make sure I don't wait another 14 years to do another one,\" pointing out the time between 2008's \"In Bruges\" (which also starred Farrell and Gleeson), and \"Banshees.\"\n\nCate Blanchett wins best actress in a drama for 'Tár,' 'Argentina, 1985' gets best international film\n\nBlanchett's not there to accept the award as she's working on a movie \"so we all accept this for her,\" Henry Golding announces. But director Santiago Mitre is here to take home the international film honor for \"Argentina, 1985.\"\n\nRyan Murphy is honored with the Carol Burnett Award\n\nBilly Porter presents Murphy with the Carol Burnett Award, given for achievement in television, and honors his \"Pose\" show creator as a \"trailblazer\" and an \"ally.\" Murphy takes the stage and shouts out his \"Pose\" star MJ Rodriguez as the first trans woman to win a Globe and gives her a moment (since last year's event wasn't televised). \"It’s hard being an LGBTQ kid in America,\" Murphy says, and he spends most of his most of his speech honoring queer actors he's worked with to \"make a point of hope and progress\": Niecy Nash \"chose love not fear,” Matt Bomer \"is an action hero in life\" and Jeremy Pope \"refused to hide. Jeremy Pope is the future.\" All of them, Murphy concludes, show \"there is a way forward. Use them as your north stars.\"\n\nZendaya wins for 'Euphoria,' Julia Garner for 'Ozark'\n\n\"Euphoria\" star Zendaya isn't here to accept her Globe win for lead actress in a drama series, but Julia Garner is to get her trophy for supporting actress in a drama. \"I'm overwhelmed and so grateful to be here with all of you,\" says the \"Ozark\" star. \"Playing Ruth is the greatest gift of my life.\"\n\nAustin Butler takes lead drama actor for playing 'Elvis'\n\n\"My boy, my boy, woo. All my words are leaving me,\" says Butler, snagging the award for lead actor in a drama for \"Elvis.\" He shouts out some famous folks – \"Brad, I love you. Quentin, I printed out the 'Pulp Fiction' script when I was 12,\" he says to Pitt and Tarantino respectively – and also gives thanks to Elvis Presley himself: \"You were an icon and a rebel and I love you so much.\"\n\nGuillermo del Toro's 'Pinocchio' wins best animated film\n\n\"I'm very grateful for this and I'm happy to here in person. We're back! Some of us are drunk, what could be better,\" the director says. Del Toro adds he loves the big swings that movies are taking, like his stop-motion \"Pinocchio,\" a movie about \"life, loss and belonging.\" \"Animation is cinema – it's not a genre for kids. It's a medium.\"\n\nMichelle Yeoh takes major honor for 'Everything Everywhere All at Once'\n\n\"I'm just going to stand here and take this all in. Forty years, not letting go of this,\" says Yeoh, holding the trophy for lead actress in a comedy/musical. \"It's been an amazing journey and an incredible fight to be here today, but I think it's worth it.\" Coming to Hollywood was \"a dream come true until I got here,\" she says, finding racial prejudice when she arrived. She turned 60 last year \"and all of you women understand this: As the days and years become bigger, it seems opportunities become smaller as well.\" But she says \"Everything Everywhere\" was \"the gift\" and threatens the musicians who try to play her off: \"I can beat you up.\"\n\nColin Farrell wins best actor honor for 'Banshees of Inisherin'\n\nGlobe presenter (and nominee) Ana de Armas is out to present the award for best actor in a comedy/musical, which goes to Farrell for \"The Banshees of Inisherin.\" \"Ana, I thought you were extraordinary. I cried myself to sleep,\" Farrell tells de Armas of watching \"Blonde.\" He never expects films to work \"so I'm horrified about what's happened around 'Banshees,' which is thrilling.\" He shouts out his co-stars Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan and Jenny the donkey: \"She's having an early retirement.\"\n\nJeremy Allen White of 'The Bear,' 'Abbott Elementary' creator Quinta Brunson take TV comedy honors\n\n\"I'm in awe of you. You all are legends,\" White says of his fellow nominees when accepting his Globe win for best comedy actor for \"The Bear.\" He admits that he \"loves 'The Bear' and loves (my character) Carmy\" and, yes, \"I love acting.\" And Brunson wins best actress in a comedy for \"Abbott Elementary.\" She thanks studios and producers for \"believing\" in the show, plus shouts out her group text and castmates.\n\n'Babylon' wins best score, 'RRR' gets best song for 'Naatu Naatu'\n\nJenna Ortega arrives to hand out some music honors. Original score goes to Justin Hurwitz for \"Babylon,\" his fourth Globes win. \"I'm grateful that I had the opportunity at a young age that music was the thing for me,\" Hurwitz says. \"We need to spread the opportunity.\" And the original song honor goes to \"Naatu Naatu\" for \"RRR,\" scoring a victory over Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga. Composer M.M. Keeravani thanks the HFPA for \"this prestigious award\" and also honors his director S.S. Rajamouli \"for his vision and his constant trust in my work.\"\n\nTyler James Williams snags supporting actor honor for 'Abbott Elementary'\n\nJennifer Coolidge hands out the award for supporting actor in a TV show to Williams. \"The magnitude of the moment is not lost on me,\" says the \"Abbott Elementary\" star. He thanks co-star/show creator Quinta Brunson with a \"Yeah!\" and adds that he \"hopes this is a win for (his character) Gregory Eddie and for stories like his that need to be told out here.\"\n\nAngela Bassett takes supporting actress for 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever'\n\n\"I'm so nervous. My heart is beating,\" says Bassett, remember winning a Globe for the Tina Turner biopic \"What Love's Got to Do With It.\" She recalls a quote from Toni Morrison and thanks her fellow Marvel movie crew: \"By the grace of God, I stand here grateful.\" She also honored the late Chadwick Boseman and said this award \"is a part of his legacy.\"\n\n'Everything Everywhere' star Ke Huy Quan wins best supporting actor\n\nJennifer Hudson comes out to give the first award of the night: Ke Huy Quan wins supporting actor for \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\" \"I was raised to never forget where I came from and who gave me my first opportunity,\" he says, waving and thanking Steven Spielberg, who cast him as a kid in \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.\" For years, he says he thought he'd never achieved past what he did as a child. \"Two guys remembered that kid and gave me a chance to do it again,\" he tearfully says, honoring \"Everything\" directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert.\n\nHost Jerrod Carmichael takes aim at the Globes' diversity problems in his monologue\n\nJerrod Carmichael takes the stage as host and tells everyone to settle and be quiet. \"I tell you why I'm here: I'm here because I'm Black,\" the host jokes about the HFPA's diversity issues. Carmichael cracks about being asking to host: \"One minute you're making mint tea at home. The next minute you're invited to be the Black face of an embattled white organization. Life comes at you fast.\" He asked his friend if he should do it and she asked how much it pays. When he said it was $500,000, her response was \"Boy, if you don't put on a good suit and take the white people money ...\" Did he think the HPFA has changed: \"I took this job assuming that hadn't changed at all. I hear they got six new Black members, congrats to them, sure. I'm here because of you, people I admire, people who are actual incredible artists.\"\n\nJerrod Carmichael:Comedian jokes hosting 'SNL' is 'the gayest thing you can possibly do'\n\n'We want to be heard':Why comedians make intimate comedy specials\n\nAustin Butler, Brendan Fraser make the best actor race interesting\n\nFarrell probably has the lead comedy actor Globe sealed up, given his strong performance in \"Banshees of Inisherin.\" The drama actor race is a little more interesting: \"Elvis\" star Austin Butler could have the edge with his acclaimed portrayal of the King of Rock 'n' Roll over Fraser's heartfelt portrayal in the more polarizing \"Whale.\"\n\nWho's going to win? We've got predictions\n\nBefore the main event starts, we put together a list of who will and who should win Globes tonight. For example, Angela Bassett looks to rule the supporting actress category for \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" though Kerry Condon is pretty great as a concerned sibling in \"Banshees of Inisherin.\" Check out our picks and see how we do!\n\nOscar hopefuls Cate Blanchett, Michelle Yeoh compete in separate categories\n\nThose dreaming of a potential Oscar best actress faceoff between Blanchett and Yeoh will have to wait, but both could prevail in different Globe categories. Blanchett is in the best drama actress field with Michelle Williams (\"The Fabelmans\"), Viola Davis (\"The Woman King\"), Ana de Armas (\"Blonde\") and Olivia Colman (\"Empire of Light\"). Meanwhile Yeoh guns for lead actress in a comedy/musical, a category featuring Margot Robbie (\"Babylon\"), Emma Thompson (\"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande\"), Lesley Manville (\"Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris\") and Anya Taylor-Joy (\"The Menu\")\n\nStars plot a Golden Globes return (but not Brendan Fraser)\n\nFraser, who's nominated for best actor in a drama for \"The Whale,\" has stated he won't attend the Globes after accusing former HFPA president Philip Berk of groping him at a 2003 luncheon. \"Top Gun: Maverick\" star Tom Cruise might also be a no-show: He returned his Globe awards to the HFPA in 2021 following a Los Angeles Times investigation reporting the 87-member group had no Black members.\n\nSo who is showing up? The slate of confirmed presenters include Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tracy Morgan, Natasha Lyonne, Billy Porter, Quentin Tarantino and Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, the first transgender actor to win a Globe (in 2022 for “Pose\").\n\nFashionistas will want to check out the Globes red carpet\n\nBefore the main event, E! will kick off \"Live From E!: Golden Globe Awards,\" hosted by Laverne Cox and Loni Love, at 6 EST/3 PST with celebrity interviews and more from the red carpet at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills. In addition, an official Globes pre-show streams at 6:30 p.m. EST at goldenglobes.com.\n\nRead more about the winners\n\n'The Fabelmans' review:Steven Spielberg puts his life on screen, in rousing fashion\n\n'Banshees of Inisherin':Why broken friendships hit home for stars Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson\n\nKe Huy Quan:'Indiana Jones' star waited 'more than 30 years' for 'Everything Everywhere' role\n\n'Tár' review:Cate Blanchett conducts herself magnificently in a modern classical music drama", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/01/09/golden-globes-2022-winners-power-of-dog-west-side-story/9127065002/", "title": "Golden Globes 2022: Who won awards at the untelevised ...", "text": "If a typically major awards show happens, but it's not televised or live-streamed, no stars attend and few people even know about it – does it really happen?\n\nThe 2022 Golden Globes at least answered that philosophical question Sunday. The controversy-plagued, retooled Hollywood Foreign Press Association threw a subdued version of the awards show at its famed home, Los Angeles' Beverly Hilton hotel. This year the show happened behind closed doors, without any famous faces or press invited after NBC pulled the plug on airing the show in May.\n\nWith few witnesses on the ground, the official @goldenglobes Twitter account revealed the winners in real time.\n\nNBC's decision came amid blowback following a February Los Angeles Times report that the 87-person voting body had no Black members and permitted questionable ethical practices.\n\nOscar season chaos:How omicron has created the most 'confusing' awards season yet\n\nThe HFPA unveiled a slew of reforms, including new codes and bylaws, in October while inducting 21 new voters as its \"most diverse class to date.\" In December, the HFPA marched on without the support of major Hollywood institutions, announcing the 2022 nominees that featured \"The Power of the Dog\" and \"Belfast\" leading the pack. Few Globes nominees acknowledged the nods in public.\n\nAs the tweets rolled in Sunday night, Netflix's \"The Power of the Dog\" and Steven Spielberg's \"West Side Story\" proved to be the big movie winners, each with three major awards.\n\nReview: Steven Spielberg doesn't disappoint with his vibrant, revamped 'West Side Story'\n\nReview: Benedict Cumberbatch stuns as a cruel cowboy in Jane Campion's 'Power of the Dog'\n\n\"Power of the Dog\" pulled in the award for best drama, best director for Jane Campion ​and best supporting actor for Kodi Smit-McPhee.\n\n\"West Side Story\" won best movie (comedy or musical), best actress for Rachel Zegler and best supporting actress for Ariana De Bose.\n\n'There's no one way to be Latina': Rachel Zegler does stardom her way with 'West Side Story'\n\nWhile response on social media was muted, a handful of celebrities acknowledged their awards. Nicole Kidman posted on her Instagram Stories about winning best actress for playing Lucille Ball in \"Being the Ricardos.\"\n\n\"Thank you for the acknowledgement!\" Kidman wrote. \"Lucille, this is for you and all the other incredible women nominated.\"\n\nZegler noted her quick rise. \"I got cast as María in 'West Side Story' on 1/9/19. and I just won a Golden Globe for that same performance, on 1/9/22. Life is very strange,\" she tweeted late Sunday.\n\nDebose, who plays Anita in \"West Side Story,\" addressed the HFPA while giving thanks. \"There is still work to be done,\" the actress wrote. \"But when you’ve worked so hard on a project- infused with blood, sweat, tears and love- having the work seen and acknowledged is always going to be special. Thank you.\"\n\nOn the TV side, HBO's \"Succession\" led awards by snagging best drama, along with acting honors for Jeremy Strong and Sarah Snook.\n\n\"Pose\" star Michaela Jaé Rodriguez became the first trans woman to win a Globe, taking best lead actress in a drama series.\n\n\"To my young LGBTQAI babies WE ARE HERE the door is now open now reach the stars!!!!! @goldenglobes,\" Rodriguez posted on Instagram.\n\nAdditionally, \"Squid Game\" star O Yeong-su was the first South Korean actor to win a Globe for best supporting actor.\n\nHere's the full list of winners from the 2022 Golden Globes:\n\nMOVIES\n\nBest Movie – Drama\n\n\"The Power of the Dog\"\n\nBest Movie – Musical or Comedy\n\n\"West Side Story\"\n\nBest Movie Director\n\nJane Campion, \"The Power of the Dog\"\n\nBest Movie Actress – Drama\n\nNicole Kidman, \"Being the Ricardos\"\n\nBest Movie Actor – Drama\n\nWill Smith, \"King Richard\"\n\nBest Movie Actress – Musical or Comedy\n\nRachel Zegler, \"West Side Story\"\n\nBest Movie Actor – Musical or Comedy\n\nAndrew Garfield, \"Tick, Tick...

Questions still remain about who will attend and if the Globes still matter, but nominations announced Monday make it clear the show must go on.\n\nThe Tom Cruise blockbuster sequel \"Top Gun: Maverick\" – named the top film of 2022 by the National Board of Review last week – scored a nomination in the best drama category, which also includes James Cameron's long-awaited sci-fi follow-up \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" Steven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical \"The Fabelmans,\" rock biopic \"Elvis\" and the classical music drama \"Tár.\"\n\nSnubbed!

(Fraser has said he won't attend and alleges then-HFPA President Philip Berk assaulted him in 2003.)

Cate Blanchett (\"Tár\") heads up the drama actress category, which also includes Michelle Williams (\"The Fabelmans\"), Viola Davis (\"The Woman King\"), Ana De Armas (\"Blonde\") and Olivia Colman (\"Empire of Light\").\n\nFollowing widespread criticisms about the HFPA's lack of diversity, this year's Golden Globes did better in terms of nominations: At least one person of color is nominated in every film acting category, though they did not do as well in the TV field.\n\nAlso, no women are represented in best director, which was won the past two years by female filmmakers (Chloe Zhao for \"Nomadland,\" followed by Jane Campion for \"The Power of the Dog\"). Director Sarah Polley was shut out for her acclaimed drama \"Women Talking\" but did receive a Globes nod for best screenplay.\n\nThe 80th Golden Globe Awards air live on Jan. 10 (NBC and Peacock, 8 p.m. EST/5 PST).\n\nThe Golden Globes are back:After diversity controversy, awards show will return to NBC in January\n\nGolden Globes 2023 nominations in all categories:\n\nMOVIES\n\nDrama\n\n“Avatar: The Way of Water”\n\n“Elvis”\n\n“The Fabelmans”\n\n“Tár”\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick.”\n\nComedy or musical\n\n“Babylon”\n\n“The Banshees of Inisherin”\n\n“Everything Everywhere All At Once”\n\n“Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery”\n\n“Triangle of Sadness.”\n\nActress in a drama\n\nCate Blanchett, “Tár”\n\nOlivia Colman, “Empire of Light”\n\nViola Davis, “The Woman King”\n\nAna de Armas, “Blonde”\n\nMichelle Williams, “The Fabelmans”\n\nActor in a drama\n\nAustin Butler, “Elvis”\n\nBrendan Fraser, “The Whale”\n\nHugh Jackman, “The Son”\n\nBill Nighy, “Living”\n\nJeremy Pope, “The Inspection”\n\nActress in a comedy or musical\n\nLesley Manville, “Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris”\n\nMargot Robbie, “Babylon”\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy, “The Menu”\n\nEmma Thompson, “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande”\n\nMichelle Yeoh, “Everything Everywhere All at Once”\n\nActor in a comedy or musical\n\nDiego Calva, “Babylon”\n\nDaniel Craig, “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery”\n\nAdam Driver, “White Noise”\n\nColin Farrell, “The Banshees of Inisherin”\n\nRalph Fiennes, “The Menu”\n\nSupporting actress\n\nAngela Bassett, “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”\n\nKerry Condon, “The Banshees of Inisherin”\n\nJamie Lee Curtis,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once”\n\nDolly de Leon, “Triangle of Sadness”\n\nCarey Mulligan, “She Said”\n\nSupporting actor\n\nBrendan Gleeson, “The Banshees of Inisherin”\n\nBarry Keoghan, “The Banshees of Inisherin”\n\nBrad Pitt, “Babylon”\n\nKe Huy Quan, “Everything Everywhere All at Once”\n\nEddie Redmayne, “The Good Nurse”\n\nDirector\n\nJames Cameron, “Avatar: The Way of Water”\n\nDaniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, “Everything Everywhere All at Once”\n\nBaz Luhrmann, “Elvis”\n\nMartin McDonagh, “The Banshees of Inisherin”\n\nSteven Spielberg, “The Fabelmans”\n\nScreenplay\n\nTodd Field, “Tár”\n\nDaniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, “Everything Everywhere All at Once”\n\nMartin McDonagh, “The Banshees of Inisherin”\n\nSarah Polley, “Women Talking”\n\nSteven Spielberg and Tony Kushner, “The Fabelmans”\n\nNon-English language\n\n“All Quiet on the Western Front”\n\n“Argentina, 1985”\n\n“Close”\n\n“Decision to Leave”\n\n“RRR”\n\nAnimated film\n\n“Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio”\n\n“Inu-Oh”\n\n“Marcel the Shell With Shoes On”\n\n“Puss in Boots: The Last Wish”\n\n“Turning Red”\n\nOriginal song\n\n“Carolina” from “Where the Crawdads Sing” (music by Taylor Swift)\n\n“Ciao Papa” from “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio” (music by Alexandre Desplat)\n\n“Hold My Hand” from “Top Gun: Maverick” (music by Lady Gaga, BloodPop, Benjamin Rice)\n\n“Lift Me Up” from “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” (music by Tems, Rihanna, Ryan Coogler, Ludwig Göransson)\n\n“Naatu Naatu” from “RRR” (music by M.M.

It took place at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles with just select members and grant recipients present.\n\nThe ceremony wasn’t broadcast on TV and the results were announced via social media. The lack of a live-stream “meant no emotional or memorable acceptance speeches could be made”.\n\n‘Decent list of winners’\n\nSteven Spielberg’s West Side Story remake won best picture in the musical or comedy section, and also brought wins for Ariana DeBose as best supporting actress and newcomer Rachel Zegler as best actress in musical/comedy.\n\nJane Campion’s The Power of the Dog received best picture in the drama section, with best director and best supporting actor for Australian star Kodi Smit-McPhee. HBO’s hit drama Succession took home three prizes, including best TV drama.\n\nThere was “no backslapping, no boozy dinner, no outrageous presenter gags from Ricky Gervais, but a decent, if mainstream, list of winners”, said film critic Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian.\n\nDiversity and corruption\n\nIn previous years, the Golden Globes have been watched by millions around the world. As they precede the Oscars in the annual awards season calendar, the ceremony is often seen as a useful predictor for Academy Award success.\n\nBut in May last year, US broadcaster NBC ruled out screening this year’s ceremony. Meanwhile, stars including Scarlett Johansson and Tom Cruise distanced themselves from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organisation behind the awards.\n\nThis followed an investigation by the Los Angeles Times, which revealed that the HFPA had no black members and alleged that members had accepted freebies or perks which may have influenced how they voted.\n\nAccording to the LA Times, more than 30 HFPA members had flown to France in 2019 to visit the Emily in Paris set, where the “Paramount Network treated the group to a two-night stay” at a five-star hotel.

Boyhood was named best drama, Linklater won for best director and his star Patricia Arquette won for supporting actress for her portrayal of an underappreciated single mother.\n\n\"This is a very personal film for me, it couldn't be more personal, and it became very personal to everyone who worked on it,\" said Linklater, who filmed the coming-of-age movie once a year for 12 years.\n\n\"We're all flawed in this world, no one's perfect,\" he added, dedicating the director award to his parents and parents \"who are evolving everywhere and families who are just passing through this world and doing their best.\"\n\nArquette thanked her \"visionary\" director \"for allowing me to be part of something so human, so simple and groundbreaking and significant in the history of cinema\" and \"for shining a light on this woman and the many women like her and for allowing me to honor my own mother with this incredible character.\"\n\n\n\nMichael Keaton won for best actor in a musical or comedy and was one of two awards for Birdman, which also garnered best screenplay. It didn't win for best movie in its category, however — that honor went to Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel.\n\nPlaying a former superhero-movie actor looking for a career comeback, Keaton said he was thankful for being in director Alejandro González Iñárritu's \"unbelievably gutsy, polished look at human nature\" and got choked up when talking about his friends, family and son.\n\n\"I'm so grateful from the bottom of my heart. You don't know what this means to me,\" he said.\n\nJulianne Moore made herself the woman to beat at the Oscars by taking best actress in a drama for Still Alice, in which she plays a woman with early onset Alzheimer's. She said the filmmakers \"wanted to celebrate who we are and what we value and who we love.\"\n\nAnd The Theory of Everything star Eddie Redmayne, who plays theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking in the biopic, won an important victory in a tough dramatic actor field.\n\n\"This was a huge privilege. The Hawking family allowed us into their lives and entrusted us with their story,\" Redmayne said. \"Getting to spend time with Stephen Hawking — who, despite all the obstacles put in his way, has lived passionately and fully and with great humor — was one of the great honors of my life.\"\n\nShowtime's The Affair defied the odds — as well as the power of fellow series Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones — to win for best drama on its first time out, and star Ruth Wilson snagged the award for best actress in a drama.\n\n\"If I have learned anything from writing a show about an affair, it's that how sacred and valuable and essential marriages are,\" said Affair co-creator Sarah Treem.\n\nKevin Spacey captured the honor for best actor in a drama for playing an underhanded House of Cards politician.\n\n\"This is just the beginning of my revenge,\" Spacey said at the beginning of an emotional acceptance speech.

I am the caring white supporter killed on the front lines of freedom. I am the unarmed black kid who maybe needed a hand but was instead given a bullet.

It represents a culture that wants to see itself as heroes.\"\n\nFargo conquered the TV miniseries category and star Billy Bob Thornton won for best actor in a miniseries.\n\n\"These days you get in a lot of trouble no matter what you say,\" Thornton deadpanned. \"You could say anything and get in trouble. I know that for a fact. So I'm just going to say thank you.\"\n\nThe Normal Heart's Matt Bomer won for supporting actor in a TV miniseries or movie. He honored both his co-star Mark Ruffalo — \"the heart and soul of the movie\" — and those who died or are still suffering from AIDS: \"We love you and remember you.\"\n\nDownton Abbey star Joanne Froggatt earned an award for supporting actress in a TV miniseries. She recalled hearing from many fans for a story line this past season that involved the rape of her character. In one letter, Froggatt said, \"the writer wasn't sure why she'd written, but she wanted to be heard.\"\n\nIn addition, Juliana Margulies and Don Cheadle presented George Clooney with the Cecil B. DeMille Award, given annually to honor the recipient's \"outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.\"\n\nClooney mentioned how 80% of the people in the Globes audience would lose their categories. But, he countered, \"for the record, if you are in this room, you've caught the brass ring. You get to do what you've always dreamed to do and be celebrated for it. That just ain't losing.\"\n\nHe also gave a sweet shoutout to his new wife, Amal: \"It's a humbling thing when you find someone to love. Even better when you've been waiting your whole life, and when your whole life has been 53 years … Amal, whatever alchemy it is that brought us together, I couldn't be more proud to be your husband.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/01/07/golden-globes-2018-winners-list/1007632001/", "title": "Golden Globes 2018: The winners' list", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWho won big at the 75th annual Golden Globe Awards, honoring the best film and TV in 2017?

Clinton remembered the 16th president's \"steely resolve and necessary compromises\" to end slavery: \"We're all here tonight because he did it.\"\n\nDay-Lewis also lauded his director, Steven Spielberg, who the actor called \"a humble master with a quicksilver imagination.

(AP) — The Red Sox have reportedly agreed to terms with Rockies All-Star shortstop Trevor Story on a six-year, $140 million contract that would bring him to Boston to play second base.\n\nThe deal, which was first reported by USA Today and confirmed by multiple outlets, gives the Red Sox a long-term answer at second, which has been in flux since former AL MVP Dustin Pedroia was first injured in 2017, and leaves Xander Bogaerts in place at shortstop. The team also has a backup plan on the left side of the infield if Bogaerts opts out of his contract at the end of this season.\n\nStory, 29, batted .251 with 24 homers and 75 RBIs for the Rockies last season, an off-year that followed three straight years in which he received NL MVP votes. In five major league seasons, he has never played any defensive position other than shortstop.\n\n“He’s a big bat. We know what he does defensively already. I think that bat would play really well at Fenway just with that short porch over there,” Bogaerts told MLB.com last week when the deal was first rumored.\n\n“It would be nice if we could get an addition like that after some of the big names that we lost to free agency or traded away,\" Bogaerts said. \"That’s a big boy. That’s a big bat right there. That’s an impact player.”\n\nStory is the last to sign of a free agent shortstop class that sent Corey Seager to Texas (10 years, $325 million); Javier Báez to Detroit (six, $140 million); and, just this weekend, Carlos Correa to Minnesota (three, $105 million). Marcus Semien, a longtime shortstop who played second base for Toronto last season, signed a seven-year, $175 million contract with the Rangers.\n\nStory is a lifetime .272 hitter with 158 homers and 450 RBIs in 745 career games. He has benefitted from the thin air in Denver, hitting .303 with 95 homers and 279 RBIs at Coors Field and .241 with 63 homers and 171 RBIs on the road.\n\nWith Story at second, Kiké Hernández could settle into center field and Christian Arroyo becomes a utility bat off the bench.\n\nRed Sox manager Alex Cora declined to comment on the reports after Sunday's spring training game against Baltimore, saying they were rumors. Even before the deal was announced, the news was welcomed inside the Red Sox clubhouse.\n\n“It sparks the team,\" pitcher Nate Eovaldi told MLB.com. \"We know that they (the front office) want to win but then to add another big piece to the organization like that would be huge.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2021/12/05/inside-detroit-tigers-deal-top-target-javier-baez/8850315002/", "title": "Inside Detroit Tigers' deal with 'top target' Javier Baez", "text": "Detroit Tigers general manager Al Avila picked up his phone.

He did, though, lead the National League with 184 strikeouts over 502 at-bats. He stole 18 bases and walked 28 times, registering a .319 on-base percentage and a .494 slugging percentage (.813 on-base plus slugging).\n\n[ Subscribe for the latest news, analysis on this deal and everything else the Tigers do this offseason ]\n\nFor his career, the right-handed-hitting Baez is a .264 hitter with a .783 OPS and a 23.4 WAR. His career fielding percentage is .965 at shortstop. He made $11.6 million last season.\n\nIt is not yet clear how much money the deal is worth. But two other marquee middle infielders in this free-agent class signed for major money on Monday, both with the Texas Rangers. Marcus Semien, 31, who played second base last year with the Toronto Blue Jays, got seven years and $175 million, and Corey Seager, 27, the former World Series MVP with the Los Angeles Dodgers, received a 10-year, $325 million deal.\n\nDECISIONS, DECISIONS:Tigers must make decisions about arbitration-eligible players as deadline looms\n\nMany fans' dream scenario was for the Tigers to sign free-agent shortstop Carlos Correa, but it is believed that his asking price would be north of $30 million a year for perhaps a long as a decade. The 27-year-old, considered the class of what was a shortstop-rich free agent class, is a two-time All-Star who hits for power and won a Gold Glove this year and has been a member of the Astros, who have been to five straight American League Championship Series and three World Series since 2017.\n\nHis relationship with Tigers manager AJ Hinch, who managed Correa to two of those World Series, including the 2017 championship, was thought to help. But as Tigers general manager Al Avila has said, the team is not looking to wildly spend.\n\n“The resources will be there,” Avila said on Oct. 5, speaking broadly about free agency. “But I will caution you, this is not going to be spending like a drunken sailor.”\n\nThe Tigers have spent elsewhere: trading for Reds catcher Tucker Barnhardt and exercising his $7.5 million option for next season; signing starting pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez to a five-year, $77 million deal. If the Tigers do add Baez, they would have one more spot available on their 40-man roster, lending to the idea that they may not be done with free agency. However, time is running short with the current collective bargaining agreement scheduled to end at 11:59 p.m. Wednesday and no new pact between the owners and players' union on the horizon.\n\nThe native of Puerto Rico was drafted by the Cubs ninth overall in the 2011 draft out of Jacksonville (Fla.) Arlington Country Day. He debuted in 2014 and played in 52 games.\n\nBaez played in only 28 games in 2015, but he burst on the scene in 2016, the year the Cubs won the World Series. Playing more second base and third base than shortstop, he hit .273 in the regular season and .253 in the postseason as the Cubs beat Cleveland in seven games in the Fall Classic.\n\nHis best individual season was 2018, his first year as an All-Star. He hit .290 with 34 home runs and an NL-leading 111 RBIs that year, finishing second in the MVP voting.\n\nLast season, as the Cubs traded away several key members of that World Series team to begin a rebuild, Baez was sent to New York to pair up with longtime friend Francisco Lindor. But Baez could not fix the issues and injuries in the Big Apple as the Mets faded down the stretch. Though he hit .299 with an .886 OPS in 47 games (167 at-bats) after the trade.\n\nFree Press sports writer Tyler Davis contributed to this report. Contact Kirkland Crawford: kcrawford@freepress.com.

That 2017 World Series and his finest offensive season ever – his .315 batting average, 24 homers and .941 OPS – came in the heart of the Astros’ sign-stealing scandal, which will forever follow him. Injuries, too, have dogged Correa, who has played more than 110 games just once.\n\nYet the negatives are more than overcome by a skill set that rarely fails him when he is on the field, and an ability to rise to the moment in October. The Astros made the postseason in all but one of his seven seasons and won nine of 13 playoff series as he compiled an .869 OPS and smacked 17 home runs, tied for ninth all-time. His ability to shake off a so-so 60-game regular season and slam six home runs as the Astros fell a win shy of a surprise World Series appearance last October was a reminder of his capabilities.\n\nWhat happens now: Correa reportedly turned down a six-year, $120 million offer from the Astros and termed it “really low,” saying Thursday’s Opening Day deadline for an extension is firm. “Once the season starts and I start playing, I’m playing my last season before I become a free agent,” he said March 25. “For me, it doesn’t make any sense to be dealing while I’m trying to focus and trying to perform and trying to help my team win ballgames. So, yeah, absolutely not.”\n\nThe Astros signed infield cornerstones Alex Bregman and Jose Altuve to extensions but let center fielder George Springer walk in free agency. With Bregman’s ability to shift to shortstop in 2021, it’s possible the Astros may let Correa move on, too, especially if his 2021 performance puts his future price tag into the stratosphere.\n\nCorey Seager: House money\n\nDrafted: 18th overall, 2012\n\nHonor roll: 2016 NL Rookie of the Year, two-time All-Star, two Silver Sluggers, two top 10 MVP finishes, 2020 NLCS MVP, 2020 World Series MVP, 2020 World Series champion.\n\nThe stats that matter: .362 career OBP, .863 career OPS, 26 homers per 162 games.\n\nOutlook: After All-Star appearances in his first two full seasons, Seager endured a 1-2 punch in 2018 – Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow and arthroscopic hip surgery. While he led the NL with 44 doubles in 2019, he returned in full fury in 2020, hitting 15 homers in 51 games, posting career highs in OPS (.943) and adjusted OPS (152).\n\nIt felt like Seager, 26, destroyed baseballs with regularity and the stats bear it out – he ranked second in the major leagues in “barrels” per plate appearance (12.1%) and then hit seven homers in helping vanquish Atlanta in the NLCS, Tampa Bay in the World Series and steal all the postseason hardware.\n\nWhat happens now: The Dodgers, as always, have the capability to do whatever they want – witness the acquisition and $365 million extension of Mookie Betts a year ago. Yet the franchise also has a gaggle of superstars headed toward free agency – Seager and Clayton Kershaw this year, Cody Bellinger in 2023, Walker Buehler in 2024, with Trevor Bauer holding opt-outs each of the next two years.\n\nSeager’s trendline is edging closer to $300 million; even with the Dodgers’ bottomless revenues, a stealth strike before Opening Day that both sides could stomach seems unlikely. Paying full cost after this season will force the Dodgers to ponder how many nine-figure contracts they’re willing to carry throughout this decade.\n\nFrancisco Lindor: Almost home?\n\nDrafted: Eighth overall, 2011\n\nHonor roll: Four-time All-Star, two-time Gold Glove and Silver Slugger winner, Platinum Glove winner, three top 10 MVP finishes\n\nThe stats that matter: 138 home runs (most among shortstops since 2015), 11.1 UZR/150 rating (second to Andrelton Simmons since 2015), .833 career OPS.\n\nOutlook: The only member of this group to get traded, Lindor, 27, only has to put up an MVP-caliber year for a Mets team loaded with great expectations in the first year under a deep-pocketed owner. All while adjusting to New York and a new club.\n\nThen again, there isn’t much this guy can’t slug, field and charm his way through.\n\nLindor is by far the most durable shortstop of this or any group, never playing less than 143 games and leading the AL in plate appearances three times. He shoulders on- and off-field responsibilities with elan, as good an ambassador as he is a slugging, Gold Glove-caliber shortstop.\n\nOutlook: Stay tuned. While Lindor seemed adamant to test free agency after rejecting myriad low-ball overtures from Cleveland, new owner Steve Cohen is a motivated party after the club traded for him, then struck out on multiple high-profile free agents. Guaranteeing Lindor more than $300 million before he hits the market wouldn’t merely be a splash, but a relatively low-risk proposition for a franchise that needs an everyday cornerstone.\n\nTwo years ago, the Mets and ace Jacob deGrom agreed to a five-year, $137.5 million extension just two days before Opening Day, despite pessimism a deal would get done. Sunday, Cohen confirmed he enjoyed a dinner meeting with Lindor, who already will be the game’s highest-paid shortstop in 2021, at $22.3 million per year. In that sense, any extension would temporarily set the bar for his comrades in this free agent class.\n\nNone of this is lost on Lindor. So if Cohen wants to pick up this check, the tab – before tip – best exceed the $300 million Manny Machado received from the San Diego Padres in 2019.\n\nJavier Baez: Last Cub standing?\n\nDrafted: Ninth overall, 2011.\n\nHonor roll: Two-time All-Star, Gold Glove, Silver Slugger, 2016 NLCS MVP, 2016 World Series champion, 2018 NL MVP runner-up.\n\nThe stats that matter: 26 homers per 162 games, 43 Defensive Runs Saved as a shortstop.\n\nOutlook: Baez faces one minor hurdle the others don’t: A below-par 2020 season in which he slashed .203/.238/.360 and admitted the fan-less, grim pandemic campaign brought down his energy level.\n\nBaez’s offensive output isn’t as consistent or potent as his peers, either – he grades out at just above a league average hitter (102 adjusted OPS) and his .304 career OBP, with a career best of .326, does not equate to superstar production.\n\nStill, that belies the fact few, if any, can pull off what Baez does on a baseball field, be it his occasionally prodigious power (34 home runs in 2018), his unparalleled tagging ability around the second base bag and an overall charisma only his old pal Lindor can match.\n\nWhat happens now: Much of that is up to owner Tom Ricketts, who famously claimed “biblical” losses during the 2020 season, but also has a new TV network to push, and it’d be helpful to have some recognizable faces on the screen. Baez, Anthony Rizzo and Kris Bryant all face free agency after this season, with Willson Contreras to follow after 2022. Rizzo on Monday said contract negotiations with the club had stalled and he was prepared to play out the season.\n\nBaez is the youngest of that group and also retains some upside. Both parties might benefit from an agreement before the season – Baez wouldn’t have to shop his numbers on the market against his cohorts, and Ricketts wouldn’t have to worry about trotting out the Iowa Cubs in 2022.\n\nTrevor Story: Closing time at Coors\n\nDrafted: 45th overall, 2011\n\nHonor roll: Two-time All-Star, two-time Silver Slugger, one top-10 MVP finish\n\nThe stats that matter: .874 career OPS, 37- and 35-homer seasons, 60 Defensive Runs Saved.\n\nOutlook: Story’s future took a turn for the weird when his running mate and franchise cornerstone Nolan Arenado was traded by the Colorado Rockies to St. Louis. Suddenly, Story himself getting shipped out seemed far more likely than him re-upping with a franchise adrift.\n\nThose wondering if Story’s game will play outside of Denver might not realize prodigious home run totals are only a portion of his appeal.\n\nStory is a fantastic defender, hits the stuffing out of the ball – his 89.9 mph exit velocity last year mirrors Lindor’s – and is a freakish athlete. He has added stolen bases to his game, stealing 27 and 23 in 2018 and ’19 and leading the NL with 15 in 59 games last year. Meanwhile, his strikeout percentage has diminished every year since whiffing 34.4% of the time in his first full season; it was 24.3% last season.\n\nStory turns 29 in November and is the oldest of the pending free agent shortstops, which ostensibly could diminish his value. Yet almost every key metric is trending positively.\n\nWhat happens now: Story has adopted a diplomatic stance, though the chances the Rockies determine building around Story, tendering him an aggressive offer and him accepting – particularly after the Arenado debacle – seem remote at best.\n\nStory will have plenty of positives to take to free agency next winter. And there’s also a decent chance some of his competition takes themselves off the market by then.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2022/12/06/new-york-yankees-future-aaron-judge/10847640002/", "title": "New York Yankees' options if they don't sign Aaron Judge to new ...", "text": "SAN DIEGO — You’d think the New York Yankees have some clear advantages toward their stated goal of signing Aaron Judge.\n\nThe history bit. The lights of Broadway. The Yankee brand.\n\nOh, and the ability to outspend anyone in the game, if they choose.\n\nBut as good as GM Brian Cashman is at this card game, Judge has proven himself a shark – leaving the Yankees’ executive team guessing whether he’d really bolt for San Francisco, if all things are even.\n\nAnd here was an interesting take from Cashman here at the winter meetings:\n\n“Listen, if Aaron Judge signs somewhere else, do we pivot and do something else? Do we remake ourselves completely? I’ve got no idea.’’\n\nCashman quickly followed that comment with this: “That’s not what we want to do.’’\n\nMORE:San Francisco Giants' confidence is quietly growing in Aaron Judge sweepstakes\n\nMLB'S TOP 87 FREE AGENTS:From Aaron Judge to Corey Dickerson\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get top sports headlines delivered daily\n\nHard feelings?\n\nReading the tealeaves on Judge's decision wherever possible, Time Magazine - in naming Judge its Athlete of the Year - revealed the slugger's annoyance about the Yankees' late March decision to make public the $213.5 million, seven-year extension he rejected.\n\n\"I was a little upset that the numbers came out,'' Judge told Time in its cover story. \"I understand, that's a negotiating tactic. Put pressure on me. Turn the fans against me. Turn the media on me.\n\n\"That part of it I didn't like.''\n\nAsked about that decision recently, Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner echoed the organization's talking point that the figures would have been reported anyway, so why not be transparent about their effort? (Though the Yanks have rarely, if ever, operated this way in the Hal Steinbrenner era).\n\n\"It's something I approved when Cash brought (the idea) to me,'' Steinbrenner said last month of revealing their bid. \"Aaron and I have not discussed that, but it's something I definitely approved - I approve everything that comes down the pike.''\n\nSteinbrenner added that he would explain to Judge, if the subject came up, that it was \"my call, be mad at me. But here are the reasons why.''\n\nIn the same Time article, Judge was reminded by his wife Sam, of something he told her when they were Linden, Calif. high school sweethearts 12 years ago - that he'd be \"married to Sam and playing for the San Francisco Giants.''\n\n\"I was like, 'That'd better not get out,' '' Judge told Time.\n\nTrying to avoid Plan B\n\nAny of the Plan B scenarios aren’t as appealing as putting Judge back at Yankee Stadium.\n\nYet, the Yankees are forced to confront three scenarios as they negotiate with the signature slugger on the free agent market.\n\nHow do we improve around Judge? How do we pivot if Judge leaves? How do we proceed if Judge delays his decision?\n\nOn the No. 3 scenario, Judge has already stated his preference to sign sooner than later, allowing his team to build a contender around him.\n\nBut what if Team Judge must sort through late offers from Los Angeles, Chicago, San Diego, or some other “mystery’’ team?\n\nThere’s a reason the Yankees couldn’t act boldly on Justin Verlander, long an intriguing pinstriped target, who agreed to join the Mets on Monday.\n\n“Clearly, with the amount of commitment it would take to retain an Aaron Judge type, it’s put us a little bit on hold, obviously,’’ Cashman said, speaking generally about doing business while Judge is in limbo.\n\n“The way this winter is going,’’ Cashman said, “it could take us a lot of different roads we didn’t expect.’’\n\nThat could mean playing on the remaining elite shortstops market (Xander Bogaerts, Dansby Swanson, Carlos Correa) despite the high-end youngsters on the horizon.\n\nAnd if Carlos Rodon is still on the board, the Yanks could take an expensive flyer on a lefty starter reportedly seeking a six-year deal.\n\nExploring all options, including Brandon Nimmo\n\nAmong the free-agent outfielders, Brandon Nimmo might expect a full-court press from the runner-up in the Judge sweepstakes.\n\nThe Yanks also need to fill left field with a lefty hitter, and Andrew Benintendi is “a player we’d love to have back,’’ said Cashman, though Benintendi has a healthy list of suitors, including the Houston Astros.\n\nJapan’s Masataka Yoshida would be among the “players we would have to consider’’ once he joins the free-agent market, Cashman said.\n\nBryan Reynolds has long interested the Yanks, and his reported trade request from Pittsburgh has put the switch-hitting outfielder back into focus.\n\nAt this point, the Yanks don’t feel they’ve missed out on opportunities. On Tuesday, they agreed to a two-year deal to bring back free-agent reliever Tommy Kahnle.\n\n“I understand the longer things go, the more at-risk you are,’’ Cashman said Monday night of waiting on Judge.\n\n“I just don’t want to play the game of ‘take this, I need to know now,’ and risk what comes from that.’’\n\nAaron Boone checked in with Judge by phone late last week, nudging him with a playful ‘let’s go.’ (Judge merely chuckled in response).\n\nThe manager has “spoken to a couple’’ of other Yankees free agent targets but had no plans to meet with any in person.\n\nRodon was not one of the free agents on Boone’s recent call list. Boone said he texted with Benintendi around Thanksgiving. “A lot revolves around Aaron and that resolution,’’ Boone said of the Yanks’ winter plan.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2023/01/15/scott-boras-carlos-correa-mlb-free-agency-mets/11054597002/", "title": "Scott Boras talks Carlos Correa saga, billion dollar MLB winter", "text": "The American Airlines flight landed at 9:41 Wednesday night and Scott Boras walked off the plane at the Santa Ana (Calif.) Airport, still weary after spending the day in Minneapolis, with the Carlos Correa saga coming to a merciful conclusion at Target Field.\n\nBoras walked towards the baggage claim, saw the silver Rimowa suitcase come down the conveyer belt, grabbed it, walked to his car and had just pulled up to his home when his cell phone rang.\n\n“Mr. Boras, this is American Airlines,’’ the person said. “We have your bag here.’’\n\nBoras: “No, I have my bag right here.’’\n\nBoras, bewildered, reached for his suitcase.\n\nUh oh.\n\nHe had the wrong luggage, picking up someone else’s that looked just like his.\n\nBoras went back to the airport, exchanged suitcases, drove back home, got into his bed, and crashed.\n\nWhen you negotiate $865 million worth of contracts alone for Correa alone over a 28-day span, enduring two failed physicals and a canceled press conference before winding up with a six-year, $200 million guarantee from the Minnesota Twins, who can blame a fella for a little mix-up?\n\nBoras again was back at work at 5:30 the next morning, checking e-mails, making calls, and spending 2½ hours on the phone with USA TODAY Sports, talking about one of the wildest winters of his career, resulting in $1.1 billion worth of free-agent contracts.\n\n“It’s been quite the ride,’’ Boras says, “to say the least.’’\n\nWhile certainly pleased with the winter results, Boras still fumes how one physician’s opinion can turn Correa’s 13-year, $350 million deal with the San Francisco Giants to a 12-year, $315 million deal with the New York Mets to a six-year, $200 million contract with the Twins.\n\nThe Giants’ deal collapsed only after consulting with orthopedic specialist Dr. Robert Anderson, who expressed concerns about the fragility of Correa’s right ankle that required surgery in 2014. Farhan Zaidi, Giants president of baseball operations, said the deal was off. Boras summoned Correa to his hotel room to break the news, leaving Correa in disbelief.\n\nBoras retreated to his room and within an hour was on the phone with Mets owner Steve Cohen. Just 15 hours later, they had a deal. Correa and his family, who had even spent a day house-hunting in San Francisco before the scheduled press conference, tackled Boras in excitement in his room. The Correa family flew home to Houston, and then were off to New York on Cohen’s private plane for a physical to make it official.\n\nCorrea took his physical, and two days later, the Mets balked too. Yes, they had also consulted with Anderson, who advised against a long-term contract, leaving Boras absolutely seething.\n\n“I don’t understand the Mets,’’ Boras said. “I gave them all of the information. We had them talk to four doctors. They knew the issue the Giants had. And yet, they still call the same doctor the Giants used for his opinion. There was no new information. So why negotiate a contract if you were going to rely on the same doctor?\n\n“It was different with the Giants because a doctor had an opinion they didn’t know about. But the Mets had notice of this. They knew the opinion of the Giants. So why did you negotiate when you know this thing in advance?\"\n\nThe Giants never engaged in negotiations again with Boras but the Mets still wanted to work out a revised deal, with Boras and Correa remaining confident they could still reach a resolution.\n\nBoras offered contract language that would protect the Mets. If Correa’s previous right ankle injury caused him to miss more than 60 days, the Mets could reduce the contract. If he spent more than 120 days on the injured list over a two-year period, they could void the contract. If he finished a season on the injured list, the Mets would have the right to give him a physical to determine if they wanted to part ways.\n\nThe Mets instead wanted to slash their original agreement in half. The Mets would guarantee $157.5 million for the first six years, with club options for the next six years that would pay him another $157.5 million. But it would also require Correa to undergo a complete physical after every season in which the Mets could terminate the remaining six years of the contract.\n\n“I said [to Mets lawyers], 'You’re now putting the contract at risk,' Boras said. “I’ve got to cover your risk by your deferral. You can’t have everything. You can’t defer the contract, save $100 million on the CBT taxes, and have him take all of the risk at the back of the contract that’s not guaranteed.’’\n\nThe stalemate went on for two weeks when Boras and Correa realized the Mets weren’t going to budge. Even if the Mets picked up the first two club option years at $26.5 million a year, the backloaded contract would pay him $210 million over the first eight years –keeping the annual average salary at $26.5 million.\n\nDerek Falvey, Twins executive vice president and chief baseball officer, kept checking in with Boras throughout the process. He realized the longer there was an impasse, the better chance the Twins could re-engage in negotiations.\n\nThe Twins’ final offer to Correa before he initially agreed with the Giants was a 10-year, $280 million contract (not the widely reported $285 million). They began negotiating again the weekend of Jan. 6-8, and this time had leverage.\n\nThey began intensive talks on Monday morning, Jan. 9, and agreed to a six-year, $200 million contract at 8 p.m. The contract, with four club options, could turn into a 10-year, $270 million deal if the Twins pick up the option years, or become automatically vested if Correa basically stays healthy finishes in the top five of the MVP race, wins a Silver Slugger or wins the World Series or ALCS MVP award. The six-year guarantee pays Correa an average salary of $33.34 million, the second-largest by a shortstop.\n\nCorrea is earning $42.5 million more in the first six years of the Twins’ contract than he would have if he had taken the Mets’ offer. If the contract extended to eight years, the Twins were still paying $35 million more than the Mets. The Mets’ salary advantage wouldn’t have started until 2031 when Correa will be paid $15 million and $10 million in 2032 by the Twins. The Mets were paying $115 million the final four years in the club options.\n\n“I think this is a better deal for him because of the structure of the contract,’’ Boras said. “The likelihood of playing 12 years [without injury] was unforeseen. It wasn’t a favorable deal unless he had solid guarantee language. This contract is better because of the probability. There’s far more present-value.’’\n\nAnd, oh, by the way, there are no opt-outs in the entirety of the contract.\n\n“Look,’’ Boras said, laughing, “we never want to go through anything like this again.’’\n\nBoras was confident Correa would have no problems with the Twins’ physical considering he already had three exams last year by their doctors. They wouldn’t have sent a private plane to pick up Correa’s extended from Houston, putting everyone up at the Four Seasons hotel in downtown Minneapolis, and taking everyone out to a five-hour dinner on Tuesday night at the 112 Eatery.\n\nStill, it wasn’t until Wednesday morning when the Twins called Boras, telling him the deal was official, that he could finally exhale.\n\n“It was like a 100-pound weight was lifted off my shoulders,’’ Boras said. “I called up Carlos, and I didn’t even say hello. All I said was, 'It’s done.’\"\n\nCorrea’s reaction: “Fantastic.’’\n\n“When Carlos put that uniform on at the press conference,’’ Boras said, “there was finally, finality. It was for real.’’\n\nThe saga was over.\n\n“This was so hard emotionally because you’re sitting in front of a player, his wife, his parents, her parents,’’ Boras said, “and you have to share disappointment, not once, but twice. It was really, really stressful for Carlos and his family.\n\n“But in the end, seeing how happy he was and how excited the Twins are, maybe this was the way it was meant to be all along.’’\n\nWhile the Correa theater dominated the headlines, Boras had 13 free-agent players who signed major-league deals totaling $1.1 billion. It’s the third time Boras and his staff –including 30 researchers, eight trainers, six negotiators, five lawyers and two medical review members – eclipsed $1 billion worth of deals in a single off-season.\n\nBoras on his other clients:\n\n– Shortstop Xander Bogaerts, who had an opt-out in his Red Sox contract, turned three years and $60 million into 11 years and $280 million with the San Diego Padres.\n\n“It was just really clear to us there was a separation where Boston was going to go for Bogaerts,’’ Boras said, “compared to where the market was. They probably made a decision they were going to sign [Rafael] Devers, and were going to pay only one of them. So we knew at the forefront that Bogey would be somewhere besides Boston. Minnesota, the Cubs, the Blue Jays, they were really after him. But we kind of knew the Padres’ guy was Bogaerts (after Trea Turner rejected their offer). They wanted that personality, that leadership in that locker room.’’\n\n– Starter Carlos Rodon turned his opt-out – paying him $25 million if he remained with the San Francisco Giants – into a six-year, $162 million deal with the New York Yankees.\n\n“Whatever concerns the Giants or anyone else had of him a year ago,’’ Boras said, “he pitched so well he had 11 teams after him. Yankee Stadium was really a place he enjoyed pitching. He really wanted to go there.’’\n\n– Outfielder Brandon Nimmo returned to the Mets on an eight-year, $162 million contract.\n\n“The Giants had strong interest in Nimmo,’’ Boras said, “and so did Tampa Bay. There were five or six teams who were after him. But I knew he was so central to what the Mets wanted him to do.’’\n\n– Japanese outfielder Masataka Yoshida signed a five-year, $90 million contract with the Boston Red Sox.\n\n“He was a guy that Boston really wanted,’’ Boras said. “There’s not a lot of swing and miss there, great vision, he’ll adapt really well to Major League Baseball. I think he’ll be a great asset to them, no question.’’\n\n– Outfielder Michael Conforto signed for $36 million with the Giants, including an opt-out after the 2023 season – almost immediately after the Correa talks collapsed in San Francisco. So Conforto passes his physical after missing the entire season recovering from shoulder surgery but they reject Correa because of an eight-year-old injury?\n\n“I’m not going to let prior transactions or emotions interfere with what’s in the best interest of that player,’’ Boras said. “He could have signed with Houston [late] last year. They really wanted him. But we wanted to get him fully rehabbed, so we focused on that. He got to show teams where he was at.’’\n\nMore Boras guys:\n\nStarter Taijuan Walker, four years, $72 million, Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nFirst baseman Josh Bell, two years, $33 million, Cleveland Guardians.\n\nStarter Sean Manaea, two years, $25 million, San Francisco Giants.\n\nCenter fielder Cody Bellinger, one year, $17.5 million, Chicago Cubs.\n\nOutfielder Joey Gallo, one year, $11 million, Minnesota Twins.\n\nPitcher Matt Boyd, one year, $10 million, Detroit Tigers.\n\nPitcher Shintaro Fujinami, one year, $3.25 million, Oakland Athletics.\n\nThe Dream Series\n\nThey are still kids themselves, trying to establish their own identity in baseball, hoping to have long, illustrious careers.\n\nHunter Greene, 23, the second pick in the 2017 draft, made the Cincinnati Reds’ opening-day roster, spent the entire season in the big leagues and is regarded as one of baseball’s most talented young pitchers.\n\nJustin Dunn, 27, the 19th pick in the 2016 draft, has spent part of the past three years in the big leagues with Seattle and Cincinnati.\n\nYet, there they were this past weekend, giving back to the game and trying to make a difference in young lives, volunteering their services at the MLB Dream Series.\n\nMajor League Baseball, addressing the scarcity of Black players in their game – just 6.8% on the 2022 opening-day rosters – began the Dream Series six years ago in Tempe, Ariz.\n\nThe idea was to particularly focus on the lack of Black pitchers and catchers. There were fewer than 15 Black pitchers (seven starters) last season, and there hasn’t been a single everyday African-American catcher since Charles Johnson, who retired in 2005.\n\nGreene, who attended the first Dream Series, and Dunn became the first active major-league players to attend the event. They not only just showed up to help the high-school prospects, but instructed the young players and Greene even opened his house to them.\n\nHe invited all 80 of the high school players from the Dream Series to his home, telling them not to put any limits on their goals or desires, that anything in the game of baseball is possible.\n\n“Since it’s called the Dream Series, I want them to dream,’’ Greene said. “Without sounding vain, I wanted to bring all of the kids to the house to show them what to strive for, how your life can be changed, and what you can provide not just for yourself, but to your family. I want them and see the home and say, 'Wow, he’s only five years older than me. I’m not that far off.’\n\n“To see a player that looks like me, to see where I am now, they need to see it in person, they need to feel it, they need to know it’s attainable to them. It’s important for them to see that, and know it’s real.’’\n\nSo, there they were Friday night, sitting around, listening to stories, asking questions, and believing that one day, well, they can make it, too.\n\n“I love it, I just love it,’’ said Dunn. “It’s something my dad and I always dreamed of, playing on a team with everybody that looks like you. There’s just so few and far between.’’\n\nDunn, a native of Freeport, N.Y., never played on a single baseball team growing up that included another Black player.\n\n“It was like that every level of travel ball, really, all of the way from when I was 9 years old to college,’’ Dunn said. “It wasn’t until I got to the Seattle Mariners where I had Black teammates.’’\n\nDunn wants to be an inspiration for other young Black players, letting them know that baseball can pave a way to a possible college scholarship, or perhaps even a future in professional baseball. He remembers being stunned one day when a direct message was sent to his Twitter account. It was from Chris Archer, who was young pitching star with Tampa Bay, reaching out to let him know that he would be available for anything he needed.\n\n“I couldn’t believe it, I was telling guys, no way did Chris Archer DM me,’’ Dunn said. “But it was from him. It was a verified account. I remember he said, “'Listen, bro, there are very few of us in the league. But if you ever need anything, just text me, I’ll be a voice for you, and a shoulder you can lean on.'\"\n\nDunn has never forgotten, and now plans to be that same mentor for others.\n\n“It’s very important to me, man,’’ Dunn said. “It’s something I want to give back to young kids, let them I was once in their shoes. If you can see it, believe it, you can do it. If I can do it, you can do it.’’\n\nGreene, who never even received more than a 75% college scholarship being the No. 1 prospect in the country, remembers his Dad driving 1 ½ hours each way for him to pitch at the Urban Youth Academy in Compton. He played in the RBI [Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities] program. It allowed him the opportunity to play baseball with other Black and minority players.\n\nNow, with a platform to help others, Greene wrote a two-page handwritten letter that he plans to copy and leave with every player in the Dream Series camp, hoping to be an inspiration.\n\n“I just wanted them to take away from this Dream Series what it’s really going to take for them to continue to be where they want to be,’’ Greene said. “The whole theme is the importance to believe in yourself, to trust in yourself, to dream obviously around Martin Luther King and his vision, and how his vision came to life.’’\n\nAround the basepaths\n\n_The timing was awfully strange for Boston Red Sox infielder Trevor Story to undergo elbow surgery last week. One Red Sox player told USA TODAY Sports this summer that Story anticipated he would need surgery in the off-season, but perhaps even with his diminished arm strength last season, Story felt like his elbow would be fine with rest.\n\nNow, he’ll be out at least the first half of the season after struggling most of last season. Story produced a slash line of .293/.386./.776 with nine homers and 27 RBI in 68 plate appearances from May 10-26.\n\nThe rest of the season: 227/.290/.368 with seven homers and 39 RBI in 328 plate appearances\n\nThe Red Sox, to compensate for the loss of Story, has expressed interest in free-agent shortstop Elvis Andrus and free agent infielder/outfielder Jurickson Profar.\n\n– While rumors persist that the Astros will simply have owner Jim Crane and Hall of Famer Jeff Bagwell handle the top duties with the four current assistant GMs handling the day-to-day operations, Crane still plans to hire a full-time GM before the start of spring training.\n\nDavid Stearns, who is under contract through the year with the Milwaukee Brewers, still remains the Astros’ ultimate prize once the season ends.\n\n– The worst-kept secret in baseball is that the Los Angeles Dodgers are trying to stay below the luxury tax to jump in with all of their might to sign Shohei Ohtani as a free agent after the season.\n\nTheir stiffest competition?\n\nThe San Diego Padres, who also plan to be all in.\n\n– Mets owner Steve Cohen saved about $47 million a year with salary and luxury tax repercussions when Carlos Correa chose to sign with the Twins instead of the Mets.\n\nStill, the Mets spent $451 million in free agency this winter, bringing back outfielder Brandon Nimmo and closer Edwin Diaz, and signing pitchers Justin Verlander, Kodai Senga and Jose Quintana.\n\n– Michael Wacha, who went 11-2 with a 3.32 ERA in 23 starts last season, is easily the best pitcher still available on the free-agent market. He’s seeking a deal that would pay him about $15 million a season.\n\n– Hall of Famer David Ortiz on beloved Houston Astros manager Dusty Baker:\n\n“That organization went through some crazy [stuff], and he continued to build up the confidence of the players, and look what happened. He was like, '[Bleep] it, let’s do it.' He gave everything he had to that organization. He deserves all of the credit in the world.\n\n“Dusty, man, he’s just another on another level. You ask players how they feel about him, and they’ll tell you he’s like their uncle, their dad, their grandfather. He’s family.’’\n\n– The Nashville Stars continue to put themselves in prime position for an expansion franchise with the hiring of beloved former MVP Don Mattingly, joining Dave Stewart’s ownership group.\n\nNashville is striving to become the first majority-owned black team in Major League Baseball history.\n\n– The Mets could be without their entire starting infield for most of spring training with first baseman Pete Alonso, second baseman Jeff McNeil, shortstop Francisco Lindor and third baseman Eduardo Escobar expected to play in the WBC.\n\n– Twins GM Thad Levine on the signing of Correa to MLB Radio: “Through the middle of this saga there were a lot of twists and turns, and I think there was a lot of emotional turmoil and turbulence, and then the end was glorious. I think we liked the end part of the story the best, if I had to dissect it.’’\n\n– Future Hall of Famer Miguel Cabrera on the news that the Tigers are bringing in the fences by 10 feet in center field at Comerica Park and lowering the wall by 7 feet: “I have been waiting for this for 15 years.’’\n\n– Matt Holliday’s decision to back out as the Cardinals’ bench coach was strictly a family decision, with three kids still in high school or younger, including Ethan, who’s considered perhaps the top prep player in the country.\n\n– Pretty cool to see Andrew McCutchen return back to the Pirates where he became a five-time All-Star star and MVP winner, signing a one-year, $5 million contract.\n\nThe Pirates never gave out his jersey, No. 22, after he was traded in January, 2018.\n\nAnd, in all probability no one will ever wear No. 22 again for the Pirates once McCutchen retires.\n\n– Giants clubhouse manager Mike Murphy announced his retirement after 65 years in the organization.

So obviously what occurred in the past, which is obviously part of that background, it’s certainly not part of that initial process for me.\n\n“The bottom line is, is he a great player? The answer to that is yes. Puts up numbers with the best of them. He’s obviously had an incredible career thus far. He’s a free agent. So my job is to assess him as well as the others that are available and then act accordingly.’’\n\nThe personality vetting of Correa will come later.\n\nFor now, all that Cashman and every other GM with interest knows is that Correa’s price tag will start with a 3, possibly surpassing Francisco Lindor’s 10-year, $341 million contract with the New York Mets.\n\nLos Angeles Angels GM Perry Minasian spent hours at the meetings talking about the need to surround Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout with an abundance of pitching – at least two starters – to prevent them from wasting their prime years.\n\n“We'd like to significantly improve our rotation,’’ said Minasian, who no longer has Albert Pujols’ $30 million salary on the books. \"That's an area where we'll definitely look at a certain type of quality. We’d definitely like to find an arm or two that can impact the rotation.”\n\nThe Oakland A’s and Cincinnati Reds let anyone and everyone know that everyone and anyone is available on their roster with ownership ordering them to slash payroll. The Reds are shopping pitchers Sonny Gray and Luis Castillo, along with infielders Mike Moustakas and Eugenio Suarez. The A’s are making All-Star infielders Matt Olson and Matt Chapman available, with Olson drawing plenty of interest from the Yankees.\n\n“We have to have any and every conversation,’’ said A’s GM David Forst.”It’s hard to predict four months from now what the roster looks like, but right now we have to be open-minded.’’\n\nSaid Reds GM Nick Krall: “As a small-market club, if we don’t build through scouting and player development, we’re not going to have success.’’\n\nThose reversing direction are the Detroit Tigers and Texas Rangers, who have shed payroll and endured a painful rebuild, but are now letting agents know they plan to spend, and spend big.\n\n“We are committed to having a payroll consistent with our market size,’’ Rangers GM Chris Young said. “We intend to push the payroll up.”\n\nThe Tigers need a shortstop, and although Correa appears to be out of their price range, they are strongly looking at Seager and Story. The Tigers’ steepest competition may not necessarily be the Yankees, but the Rangers, who could have as much as $100 million to spend.\n\nThe only free-agent signing at the meetings was the failed Yankee starter Andrew Heaney signing a one-year, $8.5 million contract with the Dodgers. It left executives wondering why he was so eager to sign before fully testing the market.\n\nThe most discussed future Hall of Famer pitcher was Justin Verlander, and not Max Scherzer or Clayton Kershaw.\n\nVerlander, who received an $18.4 million qualifying offer from the Houston Astros, would normally seem like a lock to take the Astros up on their offer considering he has pitched only six innings since 2019, undergoing Tommy John elbow surgery.\n\nYet, he also knows it could be a bit uncomfortable returning to Houston. The Astros players revolted when Verlander was scheduled to throw out the ceremonial first pitch during the postseason, telling owner Jim Crane they preferred someone else considering Verlander had not been around all season.\n\nAstros GM James Click, however, backed Verlander, saying it was COVID-19 protocols that prevented Verlander from being around the players.\n\nIf Verlander winds up pitching elsewhere, the Yankees are the favored destination.\n\nThe Dodgers did not offer Kershaw a qualifying offer after missing the playoffs with a strained flexor tendon, and engaged in trade talks with the Reds about Castillo and Gray. But if Kershaw wants to return, no problem, a spot will be left for him.\n\n“I’m confident,’’ Dodgers president Andrew Friedman said, “we’ll be able to figure something out.”\n\nKershaw could opt to pitch for his hometown Rangers, but the reality is that if Kershaw pitches a 15th season, it would be only with the Dodgers.\n\n“It’s not just what he’s meant looking back,’’ Friedman said, “it’s also what we think he will do for our championship odds in ’22.’’\n\nScherzer, who was expected to re-sign with Dodgers, appears now he may be looking elsewhere. He’s not closing the door on a possible return, but his two-month stay hardly left him enamored enough to stay if someone else was offering more money.\n\nAnd, oh, wouldn’t the San Francisco Giants love to steal away the Dodgers’ valuable asset?\n\nFree agent Freddie Freeman was on the mind of every team seeking a first baseman, with Freeman rejecting Atlanta’s five-year, $135 million offer, and seeking closer to a six-year, $200 million deal. Yet, you couldn’t find a soul who believes Freeman won’t be returning to Atlanta.\n\nAnd no job was discussed more frequently from the putting green to the bar to the pop-a-shots in the GM lounge than the Mets’ GM vacancy.\n\nThey laughed trying to count up the number of candidates who have rejected the Mets’ overtures, and couldn’t contain themselves giggling that their leading candidate could be former Washington Nationals assistant GM Adam Cromie, who has been out of baseball for four years working in a law firm.\n\n“If you’re looking to be comfortable,’’ Mets president Sandy Alderson said, “the Mets are probably not the place to come. If you’re looking to be challenged and rewarded –because I don’t think there’s any doubt that this team is going to be successful over the next X number of years – then go for it.”\n\nOr, as in the case of the dozens who have rejected the overtures, just pass.\n\nGeneral managers also listened to discussions of potential rule changes, from everything from pitch clocks to automated strike zones to enlarged bases.\n\nBut while Commissioner Rob Manfred can implement the changes without approval from the union, he must give at least a one-year warning, which has yet to happen.\n\nReally, it’s the least of anyone’s worries as baseball’s 26-year streak without a work stoppage looms. It would temporarily freeze all trades and free-agent signings. Everyone still seems optimistic the season will open on time, just with a revised economic system.\n\nThere are only 17 teams who are even trying win next season under the current labor structure, agent Scott Boras says, with 4½ months remaining before opening day.\n\n“Obviously, we’ve got problems,” Boras said. “We’ve got a real cancer in this game. We know now, clubs will sacrifice seasons.”\n\nThere may always be franchises that continue to tank and avoid the free-agent market, but no matter how the new collective bargaining agreements looks like, and whether the winter meetings are cancelled, everyone agrees that the industry can’t afford the delay of even a day of spring training.\n\n“Everyone knows what’s stake, says Minasian, “that’s why we’re confident things will get done. We’ll be Ok.’’\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2020/11/05/indians-francisco-indians-trade-rumors-mlb/6173695002/", "title": "Indians' Francisco Lindor likely to be traded this offseason", "text": "The Cleveland Indians, severely strapped for money, are informing teams that they intend to trade All-Star shortstop Francisco Lindor by opening day, according to two rival executives.\n\nThe executives spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of trade talks.\n\nCleveland shopped Lindor last winter, and were in serious negotiations with the Los Angeles Dodgers in a deal that involved shortstop Corey Seager, but decided to hang onto him when the Dodgers declined to increase their offer.\n\nNow, Cleveland may have no choice with Lindor expected to earn about $20 million in salary arbitration for the 2021 season, and will be eligible for free agency after the season.\n\nThe New York Mets would likely be a strong suitor for Lindor with billionaire Steve Cohen becoming the Mets’ new owner.

The players believe the threshold acts as a de facto salary cap.\n\n\"The CBT, raising it is good for competition,\" Tigers catcher Tucker Barnhart told the Free Press this week. \"There's a real advantage to our game when teams can spend more money and have the ability to spend more money without as harsh of repercussions.\n\n\"I don't think we're setting out as a union to try and make everybody pay every dollar they have. Rebuilding is going to happen, that's obvious. Saving money is going to happen, that's obvious. Tanking, in my opinion, is going to happen. It's inevitable, in my opinion. We're not trying to go out and have 30 teams spend all the money that they can. What we're after is — if there are 15 teams actively spending money and trying to win, as a union, what we're trying to do is take that 15 number and make it 20. I think that helps competition.\"\n\nBut Ilitch wasn't even interested in a $220 million luxury tax threshold.

(By the way, that milestone is happening later this month.)\n\nIn-N-Out sells burgers, fries, sodas and shakes. Nothing else. In previous interviews, the chain has said the last significant menu change came more than 15 years ago when restaurants added lemonade.\n\nIt appears nostalgia is what prompted the hot cocoa addition to In-N-Out’s 328 restaurants in California, Utah, Arizona, Texas, Nevada and Oregon.\n\nCompany president Lynsi Snyder, whose grandparents founded In-N-Out in 1948, said hot cocoa was previously sold at the chain in the 1950s.\n\n“This is actually the return of hot cocoa,” she said in a statement. “My grandparents, Harry and Esther Snyder, served it for many years beginning in the ‘50s. I’m not sure how it fell off the menu but it’s part of our culture and something special for kids, and I’m happy that we’re bringing it back.”\n\nShe said the company sources cocoa powder from Ghirardelli Chocolate Company to make the hot chocolate.\n\nDuring a visit to a restaurant in Orange, the sweet beverage was poured from a thermal dispenser labeled “Hot Cocoa” in the chain’s signature red font. The drink, served in a white cup with the signature In-N-Out palm trees, comes topped with a packet of mini marshmallows. (Marshmallows can be requested on the side.)\n\nThe employee said the $1.60 drink is made with hot water, not milk. By comparison, McDonald’s sells a 12-ounce hot chocolate made with milk for $2. McCafe does not sell any drinks smaller than 12 ounces.\n\nAdding hot cocoa is one of two major business decisions made by the privately-held company in recent weeks.

Maybe.\n\nThe California-based chain met Thursday with Fort Collins officials to discuss plans for a 3,832-square-foot restaurant at 1700 S. College Ave., south of Prospect Road.\n\nPlans are preliminary, but if they move forward, Fort Collins would be among the company's expansion plans in Colorado, which include a $19.5 million distribution facility in Colorado Springs and up to 50 eateries across the state, according to news reports.\n\nThe first restaurant is expected to open in Colorado Springs. Plans have also been filed for a restaurant in Lone Tree.\n\nAccording to its conceptual review application, In-N-Out would raze the existing building at 1700 S. College Ave. that includes Wok N Roll Teriyaki to clear the way for the new restaurant and drive-thru.\n\nEAT AND DRINK: Fall-inspired goodies to try in Fort Collins\n\nCarl Arena, In-N-Out's vice president of real estate and development, was noncommittal about Fort Collins.\n\n\"At this time, all of our focus is on the design/build of our distribution center in Colorado Springs that has to be open and operating prior to the first store opening in Colorado,\" Arena wrote in an email.\n\n\"Although our real estate team continues to investigate several opportunities in a number of Colorado cities, it is far too early to comment on any further location plans,\" Arena said.\n\nA drive-thru is permitted at that location, city planner Noah Beals said, but the restaurant would have to mitigate for potential stacking of cars waiting to get into the site. The Starbucks next door has faced the issue of cars clogging the right lane along College Avenue while waiting to turn into the coffee shop.\n\nThe property owner agreed to change the design to create more space for vehicles to stack.\n\nBeals said restaurant representatives gave no indication of when they would hope to open in Fort Collins. But it could be a couple of years away. The distribution center would need to open first to serve the location, and that isn't planned until 2021.\n\nIn-N-Out keeps its menu simple: burgers (double, tripe or quadruple patties), cheeseburgers, fries, milkshakes, grilled cheese, plus a burger wrapped in lettuce for those who want to reduce their carbs.

Known for its fresh ingredients, the company slowly expanded to protect its quality. By 2015, In-N-Out had reached 300 restaurants in five states outside California: Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Texas and Oregon.\n\nThe Snyders' granddaughter now owns the company.\n\nPat Ferrier is a senior reporter covering business, health care and growth issues in Northern Colorado.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2021/11/23/iowa-poll-ikea-nordstrom-macys-which-retail-chain-iowans-want-open/6404074001/", "title": "Iowa Poll: Ikea, In-N-Out Burger debut would 'thrill' fifth of Iowans", "text": "© Copyright 2021, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nA fifth of Iowans \"would be thrilled\" to see national brands Ikea or In-N-Out Burger open their first Hawkeye State locations, according to a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll.\n\nTwenty-one percent of Iowans pine to shop at Ikea, the Swedish furniture and home furnishings chain, with In-N-Out Burger in hot pursuit, at 20%.\n\nHowever, for each of the six national chains the poll surveyed, the overwhelming majority of Iowans respond with a shrug at the possibility of the brand’s debut in the state, responding that they \"don’t really care one way or the other.\" The other chains included in the survey were Shake Shack, Macy’s, Nordstrom and Restoration Hardware.\n\nLike the rest of the country, Iowa's retail scene has been adapting as the accessibility and popularity of online shopping grow, a trend only exacerbated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor years, retailers in Iowa have been adjusting to the rise of e-commerce giant Amazon's growing presence in the state by expanding their own online offerings, catering to customers with unique shopping experiences or both.\n\nIn the Des Moines metro, bigger retailers have shifted their brick-and-mortar locations to better position themselves in high-traffic areas, such as Von Maur's announcement earlier this year of its intention to relocate from Valley West Mall to Jordan Creek Town Center, where an H&M opened in June.\n\nThe poll, conducted by Selzer & Co., surveyed 810 randomly selected Iowa adults from Nov. 7-10. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.\n\nHere’s what Iowans think about each national chain:\n\nIkea\n\nLeading the pack with the most interest (21%), Ikea is the “returning champ,” according to pollster J. Ann Selzer. It also was the favorite pick when the Iowa Poll asked a similar question in February 2013. Then, 25% of respondents said they'd be thrilled to welcome an Ikea to Iowa.\n\nIkea is a bigger deal for those under age 35 (28% thrilled) than those age 65 and older (13%), and for more women (27%) than men (15%). Suburban dwellers also pop at 40%.\n\nPoll respondent Andy Miesner, 38, an associate professor of pharmacy at Drake University, said he'd be excited to see Ikea in central Iowa after shopping at the retailer elsewhere.\n\n\"The closest we can go currently would be to the Twin Cities or one down in Kansas City,\" the Des Moines resident said.\n\n\"I have several Ikea products in my home as far as furniture and whatnot. I tend to shop locally if I can, but if there are those specific types of items, I find myself going online rather than traveling somewhere to get something.\"\n\nThe company, with 462 locations worldwide as of last month, started experimenting with a smaller store format earlier this year. The retailer, known for its meatballs and lofty warehouses filled with ready-to-assemble furniture, opened the first smaller store in New York at 115,000 square feet, compared to its typical 300,000 square feet of retail space.\n\nTwenty-three percent of poll respondents say they would feel “mildly happy” if the brand came to Iowa, and 53% don’t care one way or the other. Three percent of respondents are unsure.\n\nIowa Poll: More than half of Iowans approve of the job Gov. Kim Reynolds is doing\n\nIn-N-Out Burger\n\nTrailing close behind Ikea, the arrival of an In-N-Out Burger is an exciting prospect for 20% of poll respondents.\n\nIn-N-Out Burger appeals to more Iowans under age 35 (28%) than those 65 and older (9%). Overall, 19% of Iowans say the California-based chain’s arrival in Iowa would make them “mildly happy,” and 59% report indifference. Two percent are unsure.\n\nA new In-N-Out Burger can cause quite a stir among its fans. Cars backed up for 14 hours in Colorado after the chain opened its first stores there in 2020, according to the Denver Post.\n\nPoll respondent Miesner said that while he's never tried In-N-Out, he's noticed the brand's loyal following and would be excited for an Iowa location to open.\n\n\"It's one of those things you always hear on TV or movies as being a big deal in California,\" Miesner said.\n\nBut the brand's popularity doesn't extend to poll respondent Janet Wiedermann, a 66-year-old retired teacher in Dubuque, who prefers dining and shopping at locally owned businesses.\n\n\"I'm retired so the way for me to make money is to not spend money,\" Wiedermann said. \"I do go out to lunch a lot, but I go to local restaurants with friends.\"\n\nThe regional fast-food chain was in the news recently when officials closed two of its stores in California for violating local policies requiring restaurants to check customers’ vaccination status for indoor dining, according to The Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn-N-Out executive Arnie Wensinger said in a statement it isn’t the company’s job to police a person’s vaccination status and that the company refuses \"to become the vaccination police for any government,” according to USA Today.\n\nMore:How is the Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll conducted? We answer your top questions.\n\nMacy’s\n\nThe prospect of Macy's, one of America’s oldest retailers, coming to Iowa would thrill 11% of poll respondents — an 8 percentage point drop from the February 2013 poll.\n\nThe New York-based department store chain appears to be shifting its focus toward e-commerce, with plans to launch a digital marketplace in 2022 and to finish closing one-fifth of its stores by 2023.\n\nA Macy’s department store in Iowa would make 20% of residents mildly happy, but 67% don’t care either way. One percent are unsure.\n\nIowa Poll: Majority of Iowans support Deere workers over the company as strike enters second month\n\nNordstrom\n\nThe Seattle-based department store chain trails just behind Macy’s; a first store in the state would thrill 9% of Iowans. Seventeen percent of respondents say they would be mildly happy, while 72% are apathetic and 3% are unsure.\n\nShake Shack\n\nEight percent of Iowans would be thrilled about the arrival of New York-based Shake Shack, a fast-casual chain with around 345 locations globally.\n\nThirteen percent of respondents would be mildly happy about the opening of a restaurant known for its never-frozen roadside burger with signature sauce. Seventy-five percent don’t care either way, and 4% are unsure.\n\nIowa Poll:In a potential 2024 match, Donald Trump leads Joe Biden by double digits\n\nRestoration Hardware\n\nRanking lowest of the six, arrival of a Restoration Hardware would thrill just 5% of Iowans. Debut of the upscale home furnishings store would make 15% of Iowans mildly happy. As with Shake Shack, 75% of respondents don’t care either way. Five percent are unsure.\n\nAbout the poll\n\nThe Iowa Poll, conducted November 7-10, 2021, for the Des Moines Register and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 810 Iowans ages 18 or older. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cell phone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex, and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent American Community Survey estimates.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 810 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Questions based on the subsample of 658 likely voters in the 2024 presidential election have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.4 percentage points or 3.8 percentage points, respectively. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to the Des Moines Register and Mediacom is prohibited.\n\nHannah Rodriguez covers retail for the Register.

And boy, did you answer.\n\nWe received hundreds of responses for more than 80 restaurants and stores. While many answers were unsurprising (like The Chicken Restaurant That Shall Not Be Named), we also received some more unusual responses (looking at you, guy who submitted Church's Chicken on our survey 50 times). One thoughtful person even took the time and postage to mail one of our reporters a note handwritten on an index card, requesting the return of Long John Silver's.\n\nIn last year's survey, the top answer was grocery store Trader Joe's, with Chick-fil-A coming in second. This year, the roles have reversed, with Chick-fil-A coming out on top and Trader Joe's falling behind.\n\nMore:Sioux Falls will have a reason to 'Eat Mor Chikin' after mayor announces Chick-fil-A's arrival\n\nHere are the rest of the top 10 businesses you'd like to see in Sioux Falls:\n\nWinston-Salem, N.C.\n\nNumber of Locations: 1,000+\n\nClosest Location: Omaha\n\nA favorite of fundraisers everywhere, the donut chain is unique in this list because it actually used to have a Sioux Falls location at 3501 W. 41st St., but it closed back in 2006.\n\n\"We're going through some restructuring right now,\" Jim Hoskinson, general manager for the company that opened Krispy Kreme in Sioux Falls, told the Sioux Falls Business Journal shortly after the closing. \"Sioux Falls has been good to us.\"\n\nBack then, Krispy Kreme considered a smaller location elsewhere in the city, but so far, nothing has panned out.\n\nCanton, Mass.\n\nNumber of Locations: 11,300+\n\nClosest Location: Omaha\n\nThe coffee and donut shop that dropped the donuts from its name is a new addition to Sioux Falls' most wanted list. Once an East Coast-only staple, Dunkin' has expanded across the country. Heck, Omaha already has eight of them.\n\nBut while many of the states around us are currently available for franchising, South Dakota is not. It is classified as a \"future market,\" not open or reserved for franchisers. However, this could change as the area grows.\n\nAustin, Texas\n\nNumber of Locations: 500+\n\nClosest Location: Omaha\n\nThe natural supermarket sometimes called \"Whole Paycheck\" for its high-end prices has stores in South Dakota neighbors Iowa, Minnesota and Nebraska. It has so far snubbed less-populated states like Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming and South Dakota.\n\nBut Whole Foods was purchased in 2017 by Amazon, which has floated the idea of expanding the store into states like Wyoming, according to a Wall Street Journal report. So there could be hope for Sioux Falls Whole Foods fans after all.\n\nPhotos:18 favorite South Dakota foods\n\nRaleigh, N.C.\n\nNumber of Locations: 483\n\nClosest Location: Maple Grove, Minn.\n\nThe buffet chain is currently in 41 states, not including South Dakota. However, the majority of its restaurants are franchised, and Sioux Falls is listed as an open market on Golden Corral's website.\n\nSo if Sioux Falls wants to see Golden Corral any time soon, someone around here needs to pony up the $50,000 franchise fee.\n\nIrvine, Calif.\n\nNumber of Locations: 340+\n\nClosest Location: Salt Lake City, Utah\n\nSorry, Sioux Falls, you probably won't get locally made Double-Doubles or Neopolitan shakes any time soon.\n\nThe classic California burger joint doesn't franchise, and it has a rule about new restaurants not being more than a day's drive away from the nearest warehouse, in order to preserve freshness.\n\n“I don’t see us stretched across the whole U.S. I don’t see us in every state,\" In-N-Out president Lynsi Snyder told Forbes in 2018. “You put us in every state and it takes away some of its luster.”\n\nHowever, in 2019 the chain announced plans to open several locations in Colorado, so anything's possible.\n\nMore:In-N-Out Burger just filed plans for its first Denver-area restaurant.

While many of the restaurants on this list are fast food, P.F. Chang's is a little more upscale, with a full bar and dim sum to go with its lineup of standard Chinese entrees.\n\nAs for whether Sioux Falls will actually get one, P.F. Chang's is no stranger to the Midwest, but it tends to gravitate toward larger cities or suburbs (think Des Moines, Kansas City and Edina, Minn.). It also does not franchise within the U.S.\n\nMore:True South Dakotans will recognize these state favorites — but how did they come to be?\n\nBaton Rouge, La.\n\nNumber of Locations: 490+\n\nClosest Location: Norfolk, Neb.\n\nNamed after the founder's Labrador Retriever, this Southern restaurant does pretty much one thing: Chicken fingers. But it must be doing it well, because Nation's Restaurant News recently dubbed it the sixth-fastest growing fast food chain in the country, with sales up 22.5 percent last year.\n\nRaising Cane's is a new addition to this wish list, replacing IKEA, which did not even place in the top 10 this year. While Raising Cane's has shown it will come to smaller markets like Norfolk, there are already a lot of chicken places here, especially now that the long-awaited Chick-fil-A is gracing us with its presence.\n\nMore:This fast-food chain serves one specialty\n\nCalabasas Hills, Calif.\n\nNumber of Locations: 211\n\nClosest Location: Omaha\n\nPerhaps known more for its dictionary-sized menu than for its namesake dessert, the Cheesecake Factory is in 40 states, including Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa.\n\nThe Cheesecake Factory does not franchise, meaning it would be up to the company to decide if it would bring its opulent restaurants to Sioux Falls, and it has not yet said whether it plans to do so.\n\nBut while some may be disappointed at Sioux Falls' lack of a Cheesecake Factory, others may be grateful that their waistlines will not suffer.\n\n\"I love Cheesecake Factory,\" one Sioux Falls Business Journal reader wrote, \"but their cheesecake has 1,200 calories, so I'll enjoy it when I visit out of town.\"\n\n2. Trader Joe's\n\nHeadquarters: Monrovia, Calif.\n\nNumber of Locations: 500+\n\nClosest Location: Omaha\n\nThe tropical-themed grocery store famous for its Charles Shaw wines — affectionately known as \"Two-Buck Chuck,\" even though in most places it is now $3 — was Sioux Falls' most-desired business in 2019. Even though it dropped below Chick-fil-A in this year's rankings, it is still high on a lot of lists.\n\nSo far, Trader Joe's is in 42 states, but it has not indicated when it will come to Sioux Falls. But if Sioux Falls can sustain THREE Aldi stores, which are similar in price and structure to Trader Joe's, surely we can support just one TJ's.\n\nAtlanta\n\nNumber of Locations: 2,200+\n\nClosest Location: Brookings\n\nSioux Falls' top pick has already set its sights on the Queen City.\n\nMayor Paul TenHaken announced Wednesday that Chick-fil-A would at last be coming to Sioux Falls.\n\n\"More than any other restaurant or business in the world, Chick-fil-A gets brought up in my office,\" TenHaken told the Argus Leader ahead of the announcement.\n\nThe chicken restaurant is known for its customer service, homemade lemonade and tangy Chick-fil-A sauce, and already has two smaller versions at the South Dakota State University and the University of South Dakota campuses.\n\n\"Chick-fil-A is the only right answer,\" one reader said in response to the survey. \"If Brookings and Vermillion both have the express, (there's) no reason why Sioux Falls shouldn't have an actual restaurant.\"\n\nMore:Cheers and jeers: Chick-fil-A's arrival prompts mixed reaction", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2021/08/18/tulares-n-out-burger-opening-thursday/8182169002/", "title": "Tulare's In-N-Out Burger opening Thursday", "text": "The wait for a Double-Double in Tulare is over: In-N-Out Burger will open its first location in the city on Thursday after months of construction and years of begging.\n\nTulareans have eagerly anticipated the beloved burger joint for more than a year.

The restaurant will feature one drive-thru lane, indoor seating for 58 guests, and an outdoor patio with seating for 38 guests.\n\nAn opening date for Visalia's second In-N-Out on Dinuba Boulevard has not been publicly announced but is nearing completion.\n\nTulare residents welcomed the restaurant's debut in the city on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm glad it's finally opening. My family enjoys In-N-Out, and this might save us a few trips to Visalia,\" Steve Jiminez said. The Tulare man added that he would like to see more businesses come to the town, particularly those offering higher-paying jobs.\n\nIn-N-Out is open daily from 10:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. and until 1:30 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.

(It ranked No. 28 on Forbes' list of America's Best Employers.)\n\nChomping into its signature Double-Double — two burgers and two slices of cheese — feels so much better when it's served to you with kindness, right? In-N-Out's menu is limited, but its not-so-secret menu shows customers how to add a little zing to their orders. Primarily serving California, restaurants also are in Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Texas and Utah.\n\nSadly for Florida fans, In-N-Out has no plans to come to the East Coast of the U.S.\n\nIn its 70-some years, In-N-Out has expanded very slowly, focusing on quality over quantity. As this interesting SFGate article points out, In-N-Out doesn't use freezers, so all of its stores must be within 300 miles of its distribution facilities. Seeing as the chain, which does not franchise, has only made it to Texas, Florida seems pretty far-flung for the time being.\n\nWhere's the closest In-N-Out Burger?: Rockwall, Texas (1,200 miles)\n\nJack In The Box\n\nThe spicy chicken strips and sourdough Jack might be the big draws, but Jack In The Box'slate-night menu is where it's at.\n\nServed from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., \"munchie meals\" include comfort foods like — get ready — a grilled cheese stacked onto a burger. But wait! There's more! You also get two tacos, a mixed order of french fries and curly fries and a soft drink.\n\nThe San Diego-based chain also serves breakfast and something it calls brunchfest.\n\nThere are more than 2,200 restaurants in 21 states but, so far, none in Florida. However, the fast-food chain may be looking for area franchisees. According to a 2017 article in the Orlando Business Journal Jack In the Box held a franchise candidate meeting for its restaurants during the Airport Revenue News Conference and Exhibition in Orlando in spring 2018. Attempts to reach Jack In the Box for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nAccording to the article, interested Jack In The Box franchisees must have a minimum net worth of $1.5 million, seven years of restaurant experience and up to $750,000 in liquid assets.\n\nWhere's the closest Jack In The Box?: Rock Hill, South Carolina (608 miles)\n\nHoney Dew Donuts\n\nThe largest locally owned coffee and doughnut shop chain in New England, Honey Dew got its start in 1973 in Mansfield, Massachusetts. It has since grown to more than 145 locations throughout the northeast, according to its website. Over the last 46 years, the chain's offerings have also grown to include coffee drinks, muffins and bagels. But doughnuts are what it's famous for. Fan favorites include classic apple-cider doughnuts, Boston creams, glazed doughnuts with \"jimmies\" (that's New England-speak for sprinkles) and its Honey Dew Drops, a cutesy name for doughnut holes.\n\nWhile New England's snowbirds flock to Florida en masse each winter, it's unclear if Honey Dew will ever do the same. The chain did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhere's the closest Honey Dew Donuts? Hyannis, Massachusetts (1,398 miles)\n\nRaising Cane's\n\nIf chicken's your thing, then douse it in Cane Sauce and be done with it.\n\nThe Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers makes choosing lunch or dinner easy, with just four combo meals on its short menu: The Box Combo; The 3-Finger Combo; The Caniac Combo; and The Sandwich Combo.\n\nAnd really, you don't need much more than chicken, coleslaw, crinkle-cut fries and a big piece of Texas toast to feel better about things.\n\nRestaurants are in 27 states but none is in Florida. If Raising Cane's website is any indication, the chain seems to be focusing its expansion efforts on Ohio, Texas, Iowa and Colorado.\n\nWhere's the closest Raising Cane's?: Athens, Georgia (581 miles)\n\nSheetz\n\nOK, so Sheetz is more of a convenience store than a restaurant. However, like Wawa, which was also founded in Pennsylvania, Sheetz has a passionately devoted following, so it's included on the list.\n\nLike Wawa, the Altoona, Pennsylvania-based Sheetz is a gas station that also sells a mix of fast food and other convenience store items, including made-to-order doughnuts, burritos, french fries and specialty coffee drinks. Stores are in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, Virginia and North Carolina.\n\nWawa expanded to Florida in 2012 with a location in Orlando, and it has since spread far and wide across the state. Will Sheetz do the same? Only time will tell.\n\nWhere's the closest Sheetz?: Lillington, North Carolina (575 miles)\n\nMore:Cheaper than Disney, here are 10 unique Florida museums worth visiting this summer\n\nTim Hortons\n\nIn the 1980s, Florida was home to two Tim Hortons, in Deerfield Beach and Pompano Beach. Timmies also had a kiosk at Amalie Arena in Tampa for a short while starting in 2013. They proved unsuccessful, so here's our plea to try again.\n\nTim Hortons was founded 55 years ago in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. One of the co-founders was National Hockey League player Tim Horton, who died in 1974 in a car crash.\n\nTim Hortons first specialized in coffee and doughnuts. Now its menu includes breakfast sandwiches, wraps, salads, soups and baked goods.\n\nThe chain has more than 4,800 locations around the world, including restaurants in Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nWill Timmies give Florida another go? The chain already ships its signature coffee blends to all 50 states, but as for a brick-and-mortar store, the company issued this statement via email: \"We are always looking into opportunities to grow and expand both in our home markets and around the world. As you may know, we announced at our first ever Investor Day that Restaurant Brands International plans to expand its restaurant count from 26,000 to 40,000 in the next eight to 10 years.\"\n\nSo, you know, be patient.\n\nWhere's the closest Tim Hortons?: Norfolk, Virginia (861 miles)\n\nWhite Castle\n\nCredited as the nation's first fast-food chain, White Castle began serving its iconic small, square \"sliders,\" which Time declared the most influential burger of all time, to Kansans in 1921. Soon, \"the crave heard round the world\" was making noise in other cities across the Midwest.\n\nToday, White Castle serves sliders of the fish, breakfast, cheese, bacon-cheese, chicken and even vegetarian varieties, not to mention fries, mozzarella sticks, fish nibblers, desserts and seasonal shakes at restaurants mostly in the Midwest. There are also White Castles in Arizona, Kentucky, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Jersey and New York.\n\nNinety eight years later, though, there still are no White Castles in Florida. The Facebook page \"Bring White Castle to Florida\" and its more than 8,100 followers would love to change that, posting multiple appeals to the company to, well, bring White Castle to Florida.\n\nThe state's appetite for the chain seems strong. In 2015 a White Castle-owned food truck took to the streets of Orlando. It had lines 200-people deep, according to an Orlando Sentinel article, and sold more than 10,000 of its signature sliders in a single day.\n\nWhere's the closest White Castle?: Nashville (814 miles)\n\n(Psst! Florida's missing these, too!)\n\nThe following restaurants are hyper-local — for instance, Taco Villa is available only in central and north Texas, and Blake's Lotaburger has locations just in the southwest — but many USA TODAY Network Florida staffers rave about them, so they're worth mentioning, too:\n\nMore:Florida's skunk ape, headless dinosaur, Coral Castle and other weird, wacky attractions\n\nMaureen Kenyon is a trends reporter for TCpalm.com.

Customers reported waiting as long as two hours to get their first taste of the chain's \"One Love\" chicken finger meals.\n\nIt's unclear whether the new In-N-Out — located on another busy highway in the city — will attract similar traffic problems. So far, the In-N-Out is the only business currently open in the Orchard Walk West development.\n\nThe restaurant is the first new construction on the intersection of Dinuba and Riggin Avenue since Orchard Walk East, anchored by Target and Ross, opened in 2007.\n\nOriginally, Home Depot was rumored to be the anchor for the new Orchard Walk, however, it's unclear which big stores will go into the spot. The corner backs up to a residential neighborhood that stretches Shannon Ranch's multiple phases.\n\nThe In-N-Out on Mooney Boulevard was Tulare County's only location for more than two decades, until the chain opened a Tulare restaurant last month. The north Visalia spot will be the county's third In-N-Out, as the iconic chain continues its expansion across the West Coast.\n\nThe Irvine-based chain has more than 330 restaurants across seven states.\n\nJoshua Yeager covers water, agriculture, parks, and housing for the Visalia Times-Delta and Tulare Advance-Register newspapers.

The video platform also said it would be “significantly limiting recommendations to these channels.” Google (GOOGL) and YouTube have also said they will no longer allow Russian state media outlets to run ads or monetize their content.\n\nConsulting\n\nAccenture is discontinuing its business in Russia as it “stands with the people of Ukraine,” it said.\n\nThe firm announced the move in a statement on March 3, where it thanked its “nearly 2,300 colleagues in Russia for their dedication and service to Accenture over the years.”\n\n“We will be providing support to our Russian colleagues,” the company added.\n\nIn a similar move, Deloitte announced on March 7 that it would stop operating in Russia and Belarus.\n\n“While we know this is the right decision, it will have an impact on Deloitte’s [approximately] 3,000 professionals located in Russia and Belarus.

We are a purpose-led and values-driven organization that believes in doing the right thing.”\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is also planning to break away from its Russian business.\n\n“As a result of the Russian government’s invasion of Ukraine we have decided that, under the circumstances, PwC should not have a member firm in Russia and consequently PwC Russia will leave the network,” the “Big Four” consultancy said in a statement.\n\n“Our main focus at PwC continues to be doing all we can to help our Ukrainian colleagues and support the humanitarian efforts,” it added.\n\n“We are also committed to working with our colleagues at PwC Russia to undertake an orderly transition for the business, and with a focus on the wellbeing of our 3,700 colleagues in PwC Russia.”\n\nEnergy and metals\n\nBP said it was planning to exit its 19.75% stake in Russia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft, and suspending their joint ventures — which amount to one of the biggest foreign investments in Russia.\n\nEquinor will also begin to exit its joint ventures in Russia, the Norwegian oil and gas company announced.\n\n“We are all deeply troubled by the invasion of Ukraine, which represents a terrible setback for the world,” said CEO Anders Opedal.\n\nThe company said it had $1.2 billion in long-term investments in Russia at the end of 2021.

Just after 9 a.m. Thursday, about 750 flights had been delayed and just 86 were canceled nationwide.\n\nEven though the FAA was at fault for the outage, airlines could be on the hook for refunds and other compensation. Kurt Ebenhoch, a consumer travel advocate and former airline executive, said passengers are entitled to a full refund if an airline cancels a flight for any reason.\n\nStaying calm and knowing your rights can go a long way if your flight plans are disrupted, experts say. Here's some of their advice for dealing with a flight delay or cancellation.\n\nFAA computer outage:10,000+ US flights delayed, canceled: 'I'm frustrated, but I smell like passion fruit'\n\nExperts weigh in: Could old tech be responsible for FAA outage that caused thousands of delays?\n\nMy flight was canceled. Now what?\n\nIf you still want to get to your destination, most airlines will rebook you for free on the next available flight as long as it has seats, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nMajor airlines including Delta, American, Southwest and United were waiving change fees for Wednesday flights and, in some cases, Thursday flights to make it easier for passengers to change their travel plans.\n\nAirline waivers:What carriers are offering travelers affected by the FAA outage\n\nIf you want to cancel the trip, you are entitled to a full refund, even if you bought non-refundable tickets. You're also entitled to a refund of any bag fees, seat upgrades or other extras.\n\nEbenhoch stressed that travelers are eligible for a refund, not just vouchers for future travel. If you do take a voucher, make sure you inquire about blackout dates and other restrictions on its use.\n\nMy flight was delayed. Does the airline have to provide me with compensation?\n\nNo. There are no federal laws requiring airlines to provide passengers with meal vouchers or other compensation when their flights are delayed. But each airline has its own policy, so if you are experiencing a long delay, you should ask if you can get a meal voucher or a hotel room. In some cases airlines might offer you a discounted hotel rate.\n\nFlight delayed or canceled?:What you need to know and what airlines owe travelers.\n\nMy flight was delayed for so long that I no longer want to take the trip. Can I get a refund?\n\nMaybe. The U.S. Department of Transportation says travelers are entitled to a refund if there is a \"significant delay.\" It does not define \"significant,\" so airlines have their own standards. Delta will refund a flight that was delayed by more than two hours, for example, while American will refund a flight that was delayed by more than four hours.\n\nCan I ask to be rebooked on another airline's flight?\n\nYes. Airlines aren't required to put you on another airline's flight, but they can and sometimes do, according to the DOT.\n\nJeff Klee, CEO of CheapAir.com, recommends researching alternate flights while you're waiting to talk to an agent. Agents are typically under a lot of pressure when a flight is canceled, so giving them some options helps.\n\nEbenhoch also suggests looking for alternative airports that are close to your original destination.\n\nI'm facing a long wait to rebook my flight. What should I do?\n\nIf someone in your traveling party is at a higher level in a frequent flier program, use the number reserved for that level to call the airline, Ebenhoch said. You can also try calling an international help desk for the airline, since those agents have the ability to make changes.\n\nContributing: Zach Wichter, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/business/southwest-airlines-service-meltdown/index.html", "title": "Flight cancellations: Why Southwest Airlines is melting down | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nA punishing winter storm that dumped multiple feet of snow across much of America led to widespread flight cancellations over the Christmas holiday. By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nA lack of tools\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/01/12/faa-outage-biden-documents-california-weather-george-santos/11038004002/", "title": "Daily Briefing: FAA, Biden documents, California weather, George ...", "text": "Thousands of fights were canceled and delayed, causing transportation mayhem across the United States.

President Joe Biden directed the Department of Transportation to investigate.\n\nHere's what you need to know about NOTAMs.\n\nLive updates:Thousands of flights delayed across US following FAA computer outage\n\nWhat is a NOTAM?\n\nA Notice to Air Missions is a notice that provides pilots and other flight personnel with real-time, safety information concerning flight operations, conditions and airports.\n\nNOTAMs alert of potential hazards and conditions that can impact flights – from runway construction or possible icing to a change in an aeronautical facility or flight service. Pilots are required to consult NOTAMs before starting every flight.\n\nThe FAA notes that a NOTAM “states the abnormal status of a component of the National Airspace System (NAS) – not the normal status.” The federal agency adds that NOTAMs are “not known far enough in advance to be publicized by other means.”\n\nThe NOTAM system was telephone-based in the past, with pilots calling flight service stations for the information, but it has now moved online.\n\nMcCormick told reporters that the NOTAM system has been \"incrementally upgraded over the past several years\" to transition from a manual system to an internet-based system. \"There are redundancies built into it,\" he said.\n\nWhen did the NOTAM system outage occur?\n\nThe NOTAM system failed at 8:28 p.m. ET on Tuesday, according to FAA advisories.\n\nIn efforts to keep departures flying overnight, the FAA used a telephone hotline. But the telephone system was overwhelmed as daytime traffic increased.\n\nThe stop order on Wednesday morning impacted nearly all commercial and shipping flights. Some medical flights were able to get clearance.\n\nThe outage did not impact military flights. Ann Stefanek, Air Force spokesperson, confirmed to the Associated Press that the military has its own NOTAMs system that is separate from the FAA's system.\n\nUSA TODAY analysis:Here are the 10 airports with the most flight cancellations around the holidays\n\nAre NOTAM system outages common?\n\nAn outage of its kind appears to be very rare.\n\nMcCormick told reporters on Wednesday that the there hasn't been a nationwide ground stop since 9/11. Other experts underlined the significance of the event.\n\n“Periodically there have been local issues here or there, but this is pretty significant historically,” Tim Campbell, a consultant in Minneapolis and former senior vice president of air operations at American Airlines, told The Associated Press.\n\nCampbell added that there has been concern about the FAA’s technology for a long time, and not just the NOTAM system.\n\n“So much of their systems are old mainframe systems that are generally reliable but they are out of date,” he said.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Lesser delays also showed at New York LaGuardia earlier in the day. By early afternoon, “staffing” delays had dissipated at Philadelphia but had popped up in Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport.\n\nThe FAA listed “staffing” as the cause and had issued a “traffic management” initiative to slow down the rates of departures. Typically, that “metering” effort helps controllers space out planes to keep the pace of either arrivals or departures from exceeding their capacity.\n\nThe FAA confirmed it had initiated procedures to adjust flights because of an increase in sick calls by controllers.\n\n“We have experienced a slight increase in sick leave at two facilities,” a spokesman for the FAA said in a statement to USA TODAY. “We’ve mitigated the impact by augmenting staffing, rerouting traffic, and increasing spacing between aircraft when needed. The results have been minimal impacts to efficiency while maintaining consistent levels of safety in the national airspace system. The public can monitor air traffic at fly.faa.gov and they should check with airline carriers for more information.”\n\nMore:Amid shutdown, is it safe to fly? Airlines say yes, but worry about increasing delays\n\nMore:Shutdown Day 35: Senate leaders negotiate as staffing shortages cause delays at major airports\n\nMore:10 percent of TSA workers call in sick as government shutdown drags on\n\nAt one point Friday morning, the FAA site had listed departure delays averaging more than an hour at both Newark and Philadelphia. The Philadelphia delays had dissipated later in the morning, according to the FAA site. Just before noon ET, LaGuardia remained a trouble spot, with delays on arriving flights averaging nearly 90 minutes. Atlanta's delays, which popped up after noon, were more than an hour. Delays persisted at Newark as of 12:55 p.m. ET, though the cause was no longer staffing but \"wind,\" according to the FAA.\n\nFlyers could face sporadic delays at those airports, and possibly others, throughout the day.\n\nThe delays were caused by an insufficient number of air traffic controllers in two regional facilities near Washington, D.C., and Jacksonville, Fla., according to the FAA’s Air Traffic Control System Command Center. Those facilities help coordinate the thousands of flights that fly through an area of the East Coast that stretches from Florida to Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nThe news of staffing issues comes two days after leaders of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union which represents the controllers, held a press conference on the steps of Capitol Hill arguing that the now-ended shutdown was harming the safety of air travel in the United States.\n\nAir traffic controllers have been working without pay since Dec. 22. They have received paychecks during that time, but each check read $0.00, said Bill Striffler, the union’s representative at Newark airport.\n\n“We have a growing concern for the safety and security of our members, our airlines and the traveling public due to the government shutdown,” the union said in a statement issued prior to the end of the shutdown. “In our risk averse industry, we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break.”\n\nPress secretary Sarah Sanders said President Trump has been briefed on the airport delays.\n\n“The President has been briefed and we are monitoring the ongoing delays at some airports. We are in regular contact with officials at the Department of Transportation and the FAA.”\n\nThe travel troubles come a day after a trio of airline CEOs sounded alarms that the shutdown had reached a tipping point. The CEOs of American, Southwest and JetBlue specifically warned about the potential for flights to be delayed because a shortage of air traffic controllers would require more spacing between flights.\n\nOne major airline, Air Canada, issued a rebooking waiver for customers headed to Newark and LaGuardia because of “Air Traffic Control restrictions.” So far, none of the biggest U.S. airlines were waiving fees, though they said they were monitoring the situation.\n\n“We haven’t experienced significant impacts to our operation or schedule at this point, but continue to monitor and are working closely with the FAA,\" American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said to USA TODAY before the shutdown-ending deal was announced. \"Our goal is to minimize disruptions for our customers and our team members taking care of our customers. In this spirit, we urge that the federal government be re-opened before shutdown impacts begin to escalate.”\n\nJetBlue Airways passengers traveling Friday may experience delays or longer-than-normal flight times due to air traffic control staffing shortages, spokesman Philip Stewart said. Customers should check their flight status at jetblue.com or on the airline's mobile app, he said.\n\nDelta Air Lines said about 200 flights at LaGuardia and other airports in the Northeast were delayed Friday morning due to the FAA's ground delay program.\n\n\"Delta is working to reaccomodate customers to their destinations and encourages customers traveling on Friday to check delta.com or the Fly Delta App for their current flight status,'' spokesman Drake Castañeda said.\n\nLabor officials also began to weigh in Friday on the staffing-related issues with controllers, saying that they had already sounded the alarm for potential harm to aviation from the shutdown.\n\n\"This is exactly what AFA and other aviation unions have been warning would happen,” Sara Nelson, president of Association of Flight Attendants that represents about 50,000 attendants at numerous airlines, said in a statement.\n\n“The aviation system depends on the safety professionals who make it run,” she added. “They have been doing unbelievably heroic work even as they are betrayed by the government that employs them. They are fatigued, worried, and distracted – but they won't risk our safety. So the planes will stay on the ground. This is anything but a sick out - it is only about our safety and the air traffic controllers' absolute commitment to it.”\n\nContributing: David Jackson and Dawn Gilbertson of USA TODAY and Christopher Maag of The Record of Bergen County, New Jersey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/business/thursday-flight-cancellations/index.html", "title": "Thursday flight cancellations top 2,400 nationwide, disrupting ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSnow, rain, ice, wind and frigid temperatures are disrupting air travel plans across the United States as well as bus and Amtrak passenger train service.\n\nAirlines canceled more than 2,400 US flights by 9 p.m. ET Thursday and proactively canceled more than 2,200 flights for Friday, according to the flight tracking site FlightAware.

Most winners opt for the cash option, which for the next drawing Tuesday at 11 p.m. ET is an estimated $576.8 million.\n\nThe single chance of matching all six numbers is roughly 1 in 303 million. Mega Millions tickets – which cost $2 each – are sold in 45 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nWhat's the Mega Millions cut off time to buy tickets?\n\nIn many states, eligible tickets are sold until 15 minutes before the drawing takes place. The drawing is at 11 P.M. ET on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions, so it's best to check the rules in your own state. For example, in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, the cutoff is 9:50 p.m. ET on the day of the drawing.\n\nWhy shouldn’t you tell everyone?\n\nScammers.\n\n“Some of those scammers have falsely identified themselves as being affiliated with Mega Millions,” Mega Millions said. “These scams all have one thing in common: They try to trick you into sending them money or personal information by claiming that you have won a large lottery prize.”\n\nNo representative of Mega Millions would ever call, text, or email anyone about winning a prize, Mega Millions said.\n\nDON'T GET CONNED:Stay alert against financial scams\n\nWINNING:‘We did it again’: Maryland mom wins $100K jackpot for third time in five years\n\nAlso remember, \"no real lottery tells winners to put up their own money in order to collect a prize they have already won,\" it said.\n\nSteve Azoury, owner of Azoury Financial in Troy, Michigan, said he has advised many lottery winners, including a $181 million winner \"who said ‘If I didn’t know you before, I don’t want to know you now.’”\n\nIf you can’t tell everyone you won, what can, or should you do?\n\n“Get a tax attorney and a tax accountant right off the bat and then a financial adviser,” said Azoury. “They’ll work hand in hand to figure out the plan.”\n\nThe plan will include which payout option to choose:\n\nAn annuity option makes an initial annual payment followed by 29 annual payments. Each payment is 5% larger than the previous one.\n\nThe cash option is a one-time, lump-sum payment equal to all the cash in the Mega Millions jackpot prize pool.\n\nThe plan also should include a “fall guy,” Azoury said. “That’s the person or adviser who keeps you from giving loans to anybody, who tells people all the money’s tied up in investments, not available. We have nothing available to help you out and we’re not interested in your project.”\n\nREGULAR PAYOUTS:Are annuities safe in a recession? Sales are surging, here's what to know\n\nSLIM ODDS:7 things more likely to happen than winning the Powerball or Mega Millions lottery\n\nShould you take the lump sum or installment payments?\n\nThat decision depends on your goals, your age, and what lottery rules are for beneficiaries to continue receiving payments, or if you’d likely squander a lump sum.\n\nMark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt, recommends considering the following:\n\nSize of the lottery winning: That can serve as a guide to determining taxes you may owe and the financial security you can derive from it. If the amount is on the smaller side, a lump sum may simply be easier.\n\nCurrent and projected earnings: Consider your ability to earn money and tax rates over your lifetime.\n\nEASY GAMBLING:Online lottery tickets put Texans’ most-played games a touch away\n\nDIFFERENT GAMBLE:'He won the lottery': Ohio 13-year-old sells Mac Jones football card for $100,000\n\nHow much do you bring home?\n\nThat depends on how you decide to take your money and complex state laws.\n\nIf you win the Mega Millions lottery, you’ll likely be propelled into the highest federal tax bracket. Your state of residency and where you bought the winning ticket can greatly impact what you pay in state taxes.\n\nFor example, if you’re a California resident and purchase your ticket there, then you pay the 37% federal tax rate but are in luck because California doesn't tax lottery winnings, Steber said.\n\nNew York, though, has the highest tax rate on lottery winnings.\n\nBut, if you’re a California resident on vacation in Rhode Island and decide to buy a ticket there, you’ll have to include your lottery winnings on your federal and California tax returns and file a nonresident Rhode Island tax return for your jackpot. You should claim a tax credit for the Rhode Island taxes on your California return so you won't be double-taxed on the same income in two states, he said.\n\n“This is where a tax professional really comes in handy,” Steber said. “State taxes can be very tricky.”\n\nTAXING:Senate Dems say boosting taxes on higher income earners will extend Medicare solvency\n\nA MILLION MISTAKE:Man claims $1 million Mega Millions prize from ticket he says was a 'mistake'\n\n\"How long does it take to get your money if you win the Mega Millions?\"\n\nOnce you claim the prize, it shouldn’t take too long, Azoury said. “Maybe a couple of weeks,” he said.\n\nRemember, most people won’t claim their winnings right away because they'll take time to set their plan. Claim periods vary by jurisdiction so people should check with the lottery in the state where the ticket was purchased to get the applicable claim period for that ticket.\n\nMega Millions claim periods range from 90 days to one year from the draw date, the lottery said.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

We don’t know whether … they even know that they won a prize. So I encourage everybody to check your ticket,” Illinois Lottery Director Harold Mays told reporters Saturday morning in Chicago.\n\nThe jackpot rose to $1.337 billion late Friday, up from an earlier estimate of $1.28 billion, lottery operators said.\n\nIf the holder chooses a lump-sum cash option, the ticket will yield a one-time payment of about $780 million. Otherwise, the nearly $1.34 billion prize will be spread over an initial payment and 29 annual payments.\n\nFriday night’s winning numbers were 13, 36, 45, 57, 67 and a Mega Ball of 14.\n\nThe Speedway convenience store in Des Plaines will receive $500,000 for selling the winning ticket, Mays said.\n\nThe ticket holder has a year from the drawing to claim the prize, and can choose to withhold his or her name from the public, Mays said. In Illinois, winners of more than $250,000 can ask the lottery to keep their name and hometown confidential.\n\nThe largest ever Mega Millions jackpot of $1.537 billion was won by a single ticket sold in South Carolina in 2018. That’s the second-largest jackpot for any US lottery game, and it’s the world’s largest lottery prize won by just one ticket, according to Mega Millions.\n\nThe largest jackpot of any US lottery game was $1.586 billion – a Powerball prize from January 13, 2016, shared by winners in California, Florida and Tennessee.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback History of the lottery 01:23 - Source: CNN\n\nOther tickets win big prizes\n\nSome other ticket holders also won some sizable prizes Friday.\n\nTwenty-six tickets won a secondary prize of at least $1 million because they matched the first five numbers.\n\nSix of the 26 tickets won $2 million because the buyers matched not only the first five numbers, but also paid an additional $1 to activate the game’s “multiplier,” which elevates non-jackpot prizes.\n\nOne of the 26 tickets, sold in California, did not have the multiplier but still won more than $4.2 million, according to the state’s lottery officials. That’s because all prizes in California must be based on sales and number of winners instead of being a fixed amount.\n\nThe 20 “Match 5” winners without the multiplier were sold in California; Florida (two); Georgia (two); Illinois; Kentucky; Louisiana; Michigan; Minnesota (two); North Carolina (two); New Hampshire (two); New York; Oklahoma; Pennsylvania; Texas (two); and Wisconsin.\n\nThe six $2 million tickets were sold in Arizona; Florida (three); Iowa and Pennsylvania, according to Mega Millions.\n\nFirst MegaMillions jackpot win since April 15\n\nThe jackpot had been rising since mid-April, when the jackpot was hit on consecutive drawings on April 12 and April 15. Since then, no ticket in twice-weekly drawings matched all six numbers – which is tough. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 302,575,350.\n\nThe Mega Millions website on Friday night became inaccessible for several minutes after the drawing. The lottery’s jackpots start at $20 million and grow based on game sales and interest rates, according to its website.\n\nThe next drawing will be Tuesday at 11 p.m. ET, at the $20 million starting point.\n\nMega Millions tickets are sold in 45 states, Washington, DC, and the US Virgin Islands, where drawings are on Tuesdays and Fridays at 11 p.m. ET.

Flourish*ink is a platform for curating and catalyzing conversations on the future of food.\n\nProgressing from lab production to making products in commercial facilities, some companies are moving away from the term “lab-grown meat,” said a spokesperson for Mosa Meat, a Netherlands-based food technology company. Instead, these companies refer to it as cultivated meat, cultured meat, cell-based or cell-grown meat, or non-slaughter meat.\n\nA cultivated beef burger comes from Mosa Meat, a food technology company based in the Netherlands. Redwan Farooq\n\nIn addition to mitigating animal slaughter, cultivated meat could also help slow climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. The food system is responsible for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, most of which are from animal agriculture. The transport needed for agriculture emits both methane and carbon dioxide, and clearing land and forests – including for agriculture – emits carbon dioxide, according to the United Nations.\n\n“The presumption is we’re going to do better because of the sustainability element here – to reduce the land footprint, reduce the water needs and reduce some of the waste streams that go out from feedlots,” said David Kaplan, a professor of biomedical engineering at Tufts University. Waste streams containing carbon dioxide and methane are responsible for large flows of emissions into the atmosphere.\n\nThe industry is about 10 years old, so cultivated meat is still a few years away from being commercially available to US consumers in grocery stores or restaurants – and maybe up to 20 years more for it to replace a substantial portion, or all, of the traditional meat industry, Kaplan said. At this time, Singapore is the only country to have approved cell-based meat for consumer consumption.\n\nUntil then, cultivated meat and its potential benefits for animal, human and environmental health are more hope than promise.\n\nHow it works\n\nMaking cultivated meat is based on the field of tissue engineering – growing human tissues in a lab for medical repairs and regeneration, Kaplan said.\n\nScientists get cell samples from animals by harvesting a tiny piece of tissue taken via biopsy, isolating cells from eggs or traditionally grown meat, or obtaining cells from cell banks. These banks already exist for purposes such as medication and vaccine development, said Josh Tetrick, CEO of Eat Just, Inc., a California-based company that makes plant-based alternatives to eggs. GOOD Meat is the cultivated meat division of the company.\n\nThis beef tartare is made with cultivated meat from Mosa Meat. Redwan Farooq\n\nThe biopsy method is “just like a human biopsy,” Kaplan said. “In principle, the animal’s fine afterwards.”\n\nThe second step is identifying nutrients – vitamins, minerals and amino acids – for the cells to consume. In the same way that a traditionally grown chicken has cells and gets nutrients from the soy and corn it’s fed, isolated cells can absorb the nutrients they’re fed in a lab or facility, Tetrick said.\n\nThose cells go in their nutrient bath in a bioreactor, a large stainless steel vessel “that has an internal process by which it agitates cells under a particular pressure to create an environment that allows cells to grow efficiently and safely,” Tetrick said. “That can be used for vaccine production or drug production, therapeutics – or, in our case, can be used to feed people.”\n\nThis process is basically making raw meat, he added.\n\nUpside Foods has an Engineering, Production and Innovation Center in Emeryville, California. UPSIDE Foods\n\nThe cell sample takes roughly two weeks to grow into the desired size, Tetrick said which is “about half the amount that a chicken would take.” Next is converting the meat into the finished product, whether that’s a chicken breast or nugget, or beef burger or steak.\n\n“What’s cool about it is you can start to tweak the texture,” Kimbal Musk, a chef, philanthropist and cofounder and executive chairman of The Kitchen Restaurant Group, said at Life Itself. “Alternative meats can be too spongy or they can be too firm and, frankly, even bad chicken can be, too. With this technological approach to things, you have the ability to adjust that and really tweak it for a palette that matters to you.”\n\n“The first time I cooked this was probably two years ago and I tried it again this morning,” he said during a June 2 session of Life Itself. “It is remarkably better, which means it’s technology that you’re constantly improving.”\n\nI tried the Upside Foods cultivated chicken breast Kimbal cooked during that Life Itself session. The chicken’s texture and fibers were nearly identical to that of regular chicken, but the flavor profile seemed to be missing some element I couldn’t put my finger on.\n\nGranted, making cultivated meat as similar to regular meat as possible is still a work in progress. However, this discrepancy could also be due to the fact that traditional meat’s flavor is influenced by myriad factors involved in the agricultural process, I learned from Valeti – including the conditions in which animals are raised and the feed they’re given.\n\nA panacea for hearth and health?\n\n“Whether it’s animal welfare, climate, biodiversity or food safety, (there are) a lot of really important reasons to change how we eat meat,” Tetrick said.\n\nFor one, few to no animals would have to be farmed and used for cultivated meat, and therefore hundreds of millions of acres of land wouldn’t be needed to grow feed for them.\n\n“The holy grail, if we all do our job right, is that you only need one animal in the initial biopsy,” Kaplan said. “You can do what we call ‘immortalize’ those cells so they essentially propagate forever.”\n\nA single cell could make hundreds of billions of pounds of meat, Tetrick said. “There’s no ceiling.”\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2022 assessment report said that cultivated meat is an emerging food technology that could help substantially reduce global emissions from food production, because of its “lower land, water, and nutrient footprints.”\n\nCultivated chicken made by Upside Foods, a cultivated meat company, rests atop a salad. UPSIDE Foods\n\nWhether cultivated meat will require less water is debatable and remains to be seen, Kaplan said, “because you still need a lot of water for cellular agriculture.”\n\nAnd cellular agriculture may or may not result in a substantial reduction in energy use, according to the IPCC.\n\nLessening human encroachment on land and oceans for agricultural use could also preserve biodiversity, Tetrick said.\n\nNutritional quality and impacts on human health are areas where “I think cultivated meat can shine, because the process is much more controlled than traditional agriculture,” Kaplan said. “You have more control of inputs and outputs to the system, meaning less chance for contamination and less chance for variability. … You can sort of make sure only the best parts of meats end up in the meats that you make or grow, as opposed to the animal where you kind of have what’s there.”\n\nThose tailoring possibilities include adjusting nutrient profiles, “whether that’s less saturated fat and cholesterol, or more vitamins or healthy fats,” said Valeti of Upside Foods. “Imagine if we could produce a steak with the fatty acid profile of salmon.”\n\nEating too much saturated fat and cholesterol can increase risk for a heart attack or stroke.\n\nTraditionally grown animals are given high doses of antibiotics to combat disease or contamination from bacteria such as salmonella and E. coli, Valeti and Tetrick said.\n\n“You have lots of chickens in a facility and their throats have to be slit,” Tetrick said. “You have blood and you have feathers and live animals bumping up against each other. Or, (with cultivated meat), you have a stainless steel vessel that is entirely contained without all that.”\n\nCultivated meat from Upside Foods also can be used to make kebabs. UPSIDE Foods\n\nBecause cultivated meat producers don’t expect to use antibiotics – or at least large amounts – cultivated meat could also alleviate the antibiotic resistance problem among humans, Kaplan said. Cultivated meat also shouldn’t need synthetic growth hormones, the subject of debate over their potential impact on human health, puberty and cancer. The US Food and Drug Administration maintains that approved synthetic hormones are safe for humans eating meat from treated animals.\n\nAnd since cultivated meat would require less contact with animals and use of their habitats, it could also lower the risk of more virus spillover from animals to humans, according to the IPCC.\n\nThe top two human drivers of zoonotic disease – which Covid-19 is – are the increasing demand for animal protein and unsustainable agricultural intensification, according to the UN.\n\n“This field is not intended to initially displace traditional animal agriculture. There (are) too many needs right now,” Kaplan said. “But it’s going to start slowly and build.”\n\nAs promising as it may seem, it’s unclear whether certain aspects of cultivated meat will be problematic.\n\nAffordability for consumers remains to be seen.\n\nWhile people in Singapore are able to enjoy cultivated meat, Americans await approval by the FDA and the Department of Agriculture. These agencies announced in 2019 they would jointly oversee the production of cultivated animal foods to ensure marketed products are “safe, unadulterated and truthfully labeled.” They began seeking insights on labeling in September.\n\n“The nomenclature is one of the things to be working on with the regulators, because it is real meat,” Valeti said at Life Itself. “If someone’s got, let’s say, an allergy to meat or fish, they should know this is real meat. So, it’s going to be called meat but the prefix is what we’re working on.”\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics emphasized “the need for a better understanding of the long-term health effects of cultured meat and poultry products,” according to a comment letter it sent to the USDA. “There is also little available information about the bioavailability of nutrients in, or the nutrient density of, cultured meat and poultry products.”\n\nThe topic of meat is “a very difficult one because it’s very culturally charged,” Christiana said at Life Itself. “It has all of these tradeoffs between access, health, sustainability, animal welfare and, of course, as my husband cares about as a chef, taste is a really important thing to keep in common. It’s an issue of major debate.”\n\nBut if cultivated meat ends up checking all the important boxes, “it will be a great achievement when people can eat the meat they love without slaughter,” Valeti told CNN in an interview.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}]}

Without offering details, Truss promised a “bold plan” to cut taxes and build economic growth, and “deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people’s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply.”\n\nMonday’s announcement ends weeks of bitter campaigning during which Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), accused the Foreign Secretary of risking a prolonged recession if she goes ahead with her promised tax cuts.\n\nOnce Johnson formally resigns his post to the Queen on Tuesday, Truss will also visit the monarch at her Scottish residence Balmoral, where, as leader of the largest party in parliament, she will be invited to form a government.\n\nTruss had been the frontrunner for weeks, and the 47-year-old will now follow Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May to become Britain’s third female premier. Despite voting to remain in the European Union back in 2016, she has found herself to be the preferred candidate of the vast majority of Brexiteers in her party.\n\nHer victory was smaller than expected, Conservatives who supported both candidates are privately admitting. It had been predicted by many that her margin of victory would be larger than the 18 percentage points announced on Monday afternoon.\n\nIn terms of her premiership, this could mean that she cannot run roughshod over her MPs, who voted in greater numbers for Sunak than Truss in the parliamentary part of this leadership contest.\n\nAnd Truss could find that she has to accommodate a wider range of views from her party, which could mean embracing Sunak’s ideas for helping Britons with the cost-of-living crisis and a less aggressive approach to tax cuts – especially corporation tax.\n\nMany Conservative MPs are privately worried that Truss’s modern-day Thatcherism could cost them the next election and will be leaping on the surprisingly low margin of victory to encourage the next PM to soften her economic stance.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party immediately dismissed her arguments, saying in a statement, “after years serving in Tory cabinets, nodding through the decisions that got us into this mess, Liz Truss simply doesn’t have the answers to this crisis.”\n\nLong political journey\n\nIn the leadership campaign, Truss’s platform had featured plenty of red meat for the Conservative membership, from a hard line against the EU on Brexit to tax cuts as her main solution to the cost-of-living crisis. This tactic clearly proved decisive in winning over ordinary members, who had the final say in electing the leader of the ruling party, who consequently becomes prime minister.\n\nBut critics have accused her new-found hardline Brexit stance of being a cynical ploy. They have pointed to the fact that throughout her adult life Truss has evolved, from being an anti-monarchist Liberal Democrat in favor of legalizing drugs in her youth to the embodiment of the Conservative right today.\n\nThroughout her political career, especially during the leadership contest, Truss has been compared to Thatcher, who, for many on the right, remains the benchmark for Conservative leaders. She was a tax-cutting, hard-nosed leader who took on the unions and played a large role in ending the Cold War. Like Thatcher, Truss has come from relatively humble beginnings to dominate a world inhabited largely by men.\n\nSince becoming an MP, Truss has gone from being the darling of the liberal Conservative leader David Cameron, who took a personal interest in her career, to the Euroskeptic right’s figurehead.\n\nBefore the Brexit referendum, Truss said that she was “backing remain as I believe it is in Britain’s economic interest and means we can focus on vital economic and social reform at home.”\n\nCabinet colleagues at the time say that she never voiced any issue about supporting staying in the EU, despite having ample opportunities to express her own Euroskepticism.\n\nThese days, Truss is more than happy to pick fights with Brussels and to claim that it was the EU all along that held the British economy back.\n\nA country in turmoil\n\nTruss will take over a Conservative government that is facing multiple crises in the country. With steep rises in energy and food prices, long waiting lists for hospital treatment, and public sector workers, dock workers and even lawyers going on strike, making the case that the party deserves to win a historic fifth term at the next general election – due to be called by December 2024 at the latest – will be an uphill battle.\n\nInflation rose above 10% in July for the first time in 40 years, driven largely by the rising cost of energy, food and fuel. According to a forecast by the Bank of England, inflation will soar to 13% by the end of the year. The central bank also predicted that the UK would enter into recession before the end of the year. And on Monday, in a signal of these serious challenges ahead, the British pound dropped 0.3% to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical that Truss’s tax-cutting policies will do much help citizens, especially after a decade of austerity policies. The Institute for Fiscal studies, an independent research group focusing on public finances, said last month that the leadership contestants, who were both promising tax cuts and smaller government spending, “need to recognise this even greater-than-usual uncertainty in the public finances.”\n\nThe specter of Johnson\n\nLooming over Truss’s new government will be the long shadow of Johnson, whose time in office saw approval ratings and voter intentions plummet for the Conservative Party. He leaves office a deeply unpopular prime minister less than three years after romping home to an enormous landslide election victory in 2019.\n\nJohnson was forced to resign from office on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable. His downfall followed months of revelations over parties held in 10 Downing Street while the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nHowever, Johnson rode out the “Partygate” scandal. It was only when Chris Pincher, his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party, and Johnson delayed in acting over the matter, that his own party finally turned on him.\n\nIt is not yet known whether Johnson will remain in politics. He may still be forced to resign as a Member of Parliament after a House of Commons committee gives its verdict on whether or not Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he claimed no rules were broken in Downing Street.\n\nRegardless, Johnson is likely to remain a high-profile figure. There is a good chance he will return to his former media career as a columnist and broadcaster, though the damage to his reputation in office might mean his appeal is limited compared to where it stood before he entered Downing Street.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Truss has been seen by most as the Johnson continuity candidate and enjoyed the backing of many of his loyalists.\n\nWhile this support has helped Truss during the leadership contest with Conservative members who saw her rival Sunak as a traitor, and who value tribal loyalty, it means she will be forever tied to the Johnson legacy.\n\nThat could ultimately become a weight around her neck, as the specter of Johnson risks overshadowing anything Truss might do to tackle the misery that many Britons are set to face this winter.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee Peter Wilkinson", "Luke Mcgee", "Peter Wilkinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/health/monkeypox-vaccine-intradermal/index.html", "title": "Monkeypox vaccine: FDA authorizes change in how vaccine is given ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization Tuesday that allows health-care providers to change how the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine is administered, stretching out the supply amid high demand.\n\nThe vaccine can now be given to high-risk adults intradermally, meaning between the layers of the skin, rather than subcutaneously, or under the skin, as it has been given up till now. This will allow providers to get five doses out of a standard one-dose vial.\n\nThe new EUA also allows subcutaneous vaccination in people under 18 who are at high risk of infection.\n\nThe move could increase the number of vaccine doses in the national stockpile from 441,000 to over 2.2 million, officials said Tuesday.\n\nBut the EUA isn’t going to be a panacea as the outbreak continues to grow and vaccine demand remains high. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that at least 1.5 million people in the US are eligible for the two-dose vaccine.\n\n“I think we’re going to see that we will likely still run out of vaccines before we run out of arms,” Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the White House’s assistant national response coordinator, said Tuesday.\n\nThe CDC reports 9,492 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia as of Tuesday evening.\n\nMoving “as quickly as possible”\n\n“In recent weeks the monkeypox virus has continued to spread at a rate that has made it clear our current vaccine supply will not meet the current demand,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a statement. “The FDA quickly explored other scientifically appropriate options to facilitate access to the vaccine for all impacted individuals. By increasing the number of available doses, more individuals who want to be vaccinated against monkeypox will now have the opportunity to do so.”\n\nHe added at a briefing Tuesday, “we encourage jurisdictions to utilize alternative dosing method as quickly as possible, and we’ll be your partner in this step every step of the way.”\n\nThe move comes less than a week after the Biden administration declared monkeypox a public health emergency, which gives the FDA and other government health agencies more flexibility to fight the spread of the virus.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra issued a determination to pave the way for the FDA’s move.\n\n“Last week, I declared monkeypox to be a public health emergency to unlock additional tools that will help us contain and end this outbreak and to signal to the American people that we are taking our response to the next level,” Becerra said in a statement. “Today’s action will allow FDA to exercise additional authorities that may increase availability of vaccines to prevent monkeypox while continuing to ensure the vaccine meets high standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality.”\n\nPrevention remains important\n\nThe CDC is launching an outreach program to ease the transition to the new strategy, expanding its education and information efforts for public health officials and health care providers. Vaccine equity will be a key part of this message, as will training and outreach on how to use the special needle for intradermal vaccination.\n\nOfficials also emphasized that people should continue to take steps to protect themselves from the monkeypox virus even after they’re vaccinated, especially those in the hard-hit population of gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men. This includes avoiding skin-to-skin contact with someone who may be infected and limiting the number of sex partners.\n\n“Really, prevention for monkey pox is multidomain,” Daskalakis said. “And so as people are working to get vaccinated … we really want to give people options and clear guidance of what to do between the first and second dose and also to be aware that it does take time after the second dose to also achieve adequate protection.”\n\nJynneos is given as two doses at least four weeks apart. Officials said Tuesday that people who have gotten a first dose subcutaneously can get the second intradermally.\n\nResearch will continue\n\nUsing a smaller dose with intradermal injection has been done with vaccines for flu and rabies, epidemiologist Dr. Jay Varma told CNN in an email. Intradermal shots are also used for the tuberculosis skin test.\n\n“The skin has special cells that are very good at helping a vaccine stimulate the body’s immune system,” he wrote.\n\nThese cells, called dendritic cells, are better able to produce an immune response, said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University.\n\n“They live in the skin, and they’re better at teaching the immune system what they need to respond to,” he said.\n\nA 2015 study found a similar immune response when the vaccine was given intradermally in doses one-fifth the size of those given subcutaneously. Side effects like redness, itchiness and swelling were more common with the intradermal method, but there was less pain.\n\nJynneos has also been found to be safe and effective in people with conditions that weakened their immune system, Califf said Tuesday.\n\nHowever, the existing research on the vaccine focuses on recipients’ immune response, not on whether it actually prevents cases of monkeypox.\n\n“There is no traditional assessment of this vaccine … because there weren’t smallpox cases, and the monkeypox outbreaks before this were not large enough to really do a clinical trial,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Tuesday. “We want to collect outcome data, as we do with all vaccines.

Accelerometers measured when participants drifted off and woke up over the course of seven days, and researchers then followed up 5.7 years later, on average, to learn whether the participants had received a new diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. They found that 3.6% of the participants had done, a total of 3,172 people.\n\nIt appears that the trick to better heart health is a bedtime that’s “not too early and not too late”, said The Guardian. The analysis found the “sweet spot” to be between 10pm and 10.59pm, with people falling asleep during that time the least at risk of a future heart condition. People whose sleep onset time (SOT) fell on or after midnight were comparatively 25% more likely to develop a cardiovascular disease.\n\nFalling alseep before 10pm was also found to put participants at risk. Though only 132 people who later developed heart conditions were found to fall into this category, participants nodding off before 10pm were found to be at a 24% increased risk of heart disease.\n\nThe relationship between bedtimes and heart health appears to be related to our body clocks. A human’s mental and physical functioning is regulated by its circadian rhythm, its own “24-hour internal clock”, study author Dr David Plans, from Exeter University, explained.\n\n“While we cannot conclude causation from our study, the results suggest that early or late bedtimes may be more likely to disrupt the body clock, with adverse consequences for cardiovascular health,” he said in the Daily Mirror.\n\nParticipants also filled out “questionnaires about their demographic, health and lifestyle choices” before taking part in the study. The researchers found that people with an SOT after midnight were more likely to be smokers and have a history of diabetes or high blood pressure.\n\nAnd sleeping for a shorter period of time can increase the likelihood of future conditions. Women, who made up 58% of the participants, were also found to be at greater risk. Plans explained this may be down to a “sex difference in how the endocrine system repsonds to a disruption in circadian rhythm”, said Metro.\n\nHowever, he also noted that age could be a factor, as women’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease increases post-menopause, “meaning there may be no difference in the strength of association between women and men”.\n\nThe findings are cause for further research into sleep timings as a heart health risk factor, particularly for women, the authors concluded.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/09/11/mps-proposed-budget-meets-state-mandated-reserve-montgomery-public-school-intervention-arthur-watts/2270117001/", "title": "While Montgomery Public Schools' proposed budget meets state ...", "text": "Chief School Financial Officer Arthur Watts did not attempt to hide his frustration during the first of two Montgomery County Board of Education hearings to present the proposed 2020 budget.\n\nDespite achieving the state requirement of having a balanced budget without a deficit, Watts repeatedly pointed to the painful challenges that were forced to be made because of low local support.\n\n“We are way too dependent on state funds,” Watts told the board and packed audience, pointing to the fact that nearly 74% of the district’s budget is funded by the state. Just under 25% comes from local funding — property taxes and sales taxes — equating to $56.6 million.\n\nIn contrast, Watts repeatedly pointed to other Alabama districts whose budgets look very different from Montgomery's. Birmingham City Schools’ local funds make up 42% of the district’s budget, bringing in about $99 million for 6,000 fewer students than MPS. For Baldwin County Schools, local support equates to 46% of its budget — with $138 million.\n\n“That is not the way to truly fund education,” Watts said.\n\n“Anytime there’s some kind of hiccup in state funding, that is when proration is declared. … These schools have, in case something happens, the local resources to sustain themselves until the economy recovers,” he added.\n\nAnother issue with this is that in order to receive portions of the state funding, districts are required to put up local funds to support the effort. For example, MPS was awarded about $7 million to put toward capital improvement projects from the last Education Trust Fund budget, but in order to receive it, the district had to agree to set aside an additional $1.2 million of local money to go toward the projects.\n\nOverall, Watts said MPS had to agree to spend about $30 million of the $56 million received in local dollars in order to participate in the state’s foundation program. The other districts, such as Birmingham and Baldwin, had to as well, but they were left with much more in local dollars to be spent at their discretion.\n\n“We’re asked to do so much with so little,” Watts said. “It’s almost like saying ‘we want you to go out and raise your family on the same amount of monies that you earned 25 years ago.’ That’s almost impossible.”\n\nThe total amount of funding set for 2020 is $228.7 million. Because of changes in state funding, teachers will see a 4% salary increase, each will receive $600 for student materials and supplies and the district will be funded $75 per student for textbooks, versus the $70 this year.\n\nThere was also an increase to the transportation budget, which Watts said only pays for the transport of students to and from school. The district has to use local dollars to pay for transportation to field trips and athletic events.\n\nMore:Montgomery Public Schools owns more property than it uses. Selling it could bring needed cash\n\nAdditionally, the state supported an increase in the school nurse program.\n\n“Their (state legislators) intent is to have a nurse in every school, but they can’t afford that right now,” Watts said. While other districts are able to pull on local funds to ensure that still happens, within MPS, “right now our schools are having to share nurses. That’s why local support is so important.”\n\nThis past year, Watts and his department called on all district department heads to cut the portion of their budgets supported by local dollars by at least 10%. Additionally, he went to the board and stressed the need to decrease the number of teachers and staff within the system, which had not decreased as rapid a rate as student enrollment. It was for these reasons, he was able to present a balanced budget.\n\nThe state requires the district end its fiscal year with a one-month reserve of its operating budget. With the cuts, Watts said that required number decreased from $19.7 million to $18.8 million.\n\nBased on the projection, the district will end 2020 with $19.8 million, succeeding in having the state-mandated reserve.\n\nThis is quite an achievement for a district that prior to intervention — or more specifically prior to Watts' hiring — had not passed a balanced budget on time in nearly a decade.\n\nHowever, because the district has seen a decline in enrollment since 2015, state enrollment dollars have also declined. This year threatens to bring another shortfall as well. Although the official number the state recognizes is based on the average attendance for the first 20 days after Labor Day, Watts shared that as of Aug. 28 — three weeks after the start of the year — enrollment was 27,720. That is a decrease of more than 1,100 students.\n\nIn 2015, more than 31,000 students were enrolled in the system. As the state experiences a decreasing population — the threat of losing a congressional seat as a result looming — many districts have experienced declining enrollment.\n\nMore:Pike Road boards votes unanimously to allow Maxwell students to enter district\n\nMore:Study finds carving up school districts like Montgomery's worsens segregation\n\nFor MPS specifically, some student loss can be attributed to growing districts in the surrounding area, Pike Road as one example. This year also marks the opening of LEAD Academy, Montgomery’s first charter school, which currently has 350 students.\n\nAnother major issue the district faces is a deferred maintenance bill tagged at $200 million, which district officials say is likely a low estimate. Watts asked those in the community to compare what would happen to a home if the homeowner continued to ignore maintenance needs. The needs, and the price, will increase, he said.\n\nThe figure does not include the cost of building a new high school for Booker T. Washington.\n\nMore:One year later, the limitations for BTW students at Hayneville are steep\n\nAn in-depth look — drawing some moans from audience members about the length Watts spent presenting — the overall reaction to his explanation of how the system is funded was received in a thankful manner by those in attendance.\n\n“I don’t know where you got him, but we are proud of him,” K.T. Brown, an avid board meeting attendee said. In response, several people began clapping.\n\nHired in July 2018, Watts completed the 2018 budget, which was due in September 2017, one month into the job. He then turned around the 2019 budget the following month.\n\nA second budget hearing will be held Thursday, Sept. 12 at MPS Central Office, 307 S.

The polling figures suggest it is Fox’s cheerleading for the protests that is out of touch with the views of a significant majority of the Canadian public.\n\nIn addition, one of the recent Canadian polls has been falsely described this week in some pockets of conservative media. While that poll did show that there is considerable Canadian discontent with Trudeau’s handling of the protests, it’s not true that only 16% of Canadians said they want Trudeau back as prime minister, as a Fox contributor claimed, or that only 16% would vote for Trudeau again, as the right-wing Washington Examiner reported.\n\nHere’s an explanation of how the “16 percent” figure is being misused – followed by a look at some of the actual findings of four February polls of Canadian adults.\n\nPoll question about Trudeau has been falsely described\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported Sunday that a new poll “showed that only 16% of Canadians would vote again for Trudeau as prime minister.” Fox contributor Tammy Bruce made a similar claim on television on Monday: “Sixteen percent would want him back as the prime minister. So that tells you about where people are and how they’re viewing this.”\n\nBut both the Examiner and Bruce were wrong.\n\nThe poll they were citing, conducted by Maru Public Opinion, did not even ask people if they would support Trudeau in another election or wanted him back as prime minister.\n\nRather, the poll tried to gauge how people’s support for Trudeau was being affected by his handling of the protests. It asked respondents this rather confusing question: “Do you think Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made you want to vote for him because of how he has dealt with the situation?”\n\nSixteen percent of poll respondents answered yes, as Ungar-Sargon of Newsweek – the formerly prominent newsmagazine that now, under different ownership, bears little resemblance to its 20th century incarnation – correctly noted in her Monday tweet. But that 16% clearly does not represent the entirety of the support for Trudeau.\n\nA voter who definitely intends to vote for Trudeau’s Liberal Party in the next election could have answered no to this question if they were unhappy that Trudeau hadn’t taken a harder line in trying to end the protests. And a voter who is considering voting Liberal for some other reason, say tax policy or housing policy, could have answered no to the question on the grounds that they don’t plan to cast their vote “because of” anything related to the protests.\n\nIn other words, these results are difficult to conclusively interpret. But it’s plain inaccurate to claim the poll showed that only 16% of Canadians want Trudeau back or would vote for Trudeau. (Side note: Canadians vote for a local Member of Parliament, not directly for prime minister, though the party leaders are the central figures in each national campaign.)\n\nWith that said, Trudeau critics can fairly cite other recent poll findings that have been poor for the prime minister. For example, 48% of respondents in the same Maru poll said Trudeau has demonstrated he is not up to the job of prime minister, while an Angus Reid Institute poll found that about 65% said Trudeau had made the protest situation worse.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean Trudeau is toast in Canada’s multi-party parliamentary system, especially because there is no election imminent. In the federal election in September, Trudeau’s Liberals won the most parliamentary seats, though not a majority, with the support of 32.6% of voters.\n\nAlso, February polling clearly shows that discontent with Trudeau’s approach to the protests does not equate to support for the protests.\n\nA look at four Canadian polls\n\nAngus Reid Institute poll: More than two-thirds strongly oppose the protesters’ approach and behavior\n\nIn the Angus Reid Institute survey, conducted from February 11 to 13, 69% of respondents said they opposed the protesters themselves – their approach and behavior – versus just 27% who said they were supportive of the protesters.\n\nSixty-four percent of respondents said they opposed the protesters’ demand to end all pandemic restrictions, versus 33% who said they were supportive.\n\nIn addition, 72% said the protesters have made their point and should “go home now,” while 22% said the protesters should “stay in Ottawa and other protest sites until their demands are met.” And while 24% of respondents said the protests have made them less supportive vaccine requirements for international travel and crossing the US border – the protests were sparked in part by a new vaccine requirement for truckers who cross from the US – 44% said the protests had actually made them more supportive of these vaccination requirements, while 32% the protests had no real effect.\n\nThe survey was conducted online “among a representative randomized sample of 1,622 Canadian adults who are members of Angus Reid Forum.”\n\nLeger poll: Nearly two-thirds think the protesters are a selfish minority\n\nIn a Leger survey conducted from February 4 to 6 in collaboration with The Canadian Press news agency, 62% of respondents said they opposed the protests’ message of no vaccine mandates and fewer public health measures versus 32% who supported that message.\n\nSixty-five percent of respondents agreed with the following statement: “The convoy is a small minority of Canadians who are selfishly thinking only about themselves and not the thousands of Canadians who are suffering through delayed surgeries and postponed treatments because of the ongoing pandemic.”\n\nThe online survey of 1,546 Canadian adults used a representative sample “selected from LEO’s (Leger Opinion) representative panel.”\n\nIpsos poll: Strong majority disagrees with the goals of the protests\n\nIn a survey conducted by Ipsos from February 8 to 9 on behalf of Global News, 59% of respondents agreed with this statement: “The truck protest is mostly a group of anti-vaxxers and bigots intent on causing mayhem and they should not be allowed to protest.” Forty-one percent disagreed.\n\nWhen respondents were asked if they agreed that “while I might not say it publicly, I agree with a lot of what the truck protestors are fighting for,” 63% disagreed and 37% agreed.\n\nThe poll did find that 46% of respondents agreed that while they may not agree with everything the protesters in the capital of Ottawa have said, “their frustration is legitimate and worthy of our sympathy.” Still, even on this question, 54% said that what these protesters have said and done “is wrong and does not deserve any of our sympathy.”\n\nThe online survey was conducted among a sample of 1,000 Canadian adults. The poll used quotas and weighting to ensure that the sample reflected the Canadian population.\n\nMaru Public Opinion poll: Nearly two-thirds favor military support role in ending the protests\n\nIn the survey conducted by Maru Public Opinion from February 9 to 10, 56% of respondents said they don’t agree with the protesting truckers in “any way, shape or form” and that everything possible should be done to end the protests. Just 20% of respondents said they “fully” support the protesting truckers, while another 24% said they support the reasons for the protest but “not the way they are going about it.”\n\nSixty-four percent agreed with the statement that “Canada’s democracy is being threatened by a group of protesters and they must be stopped immediately.” Sixty-four percent also supported using the Canadian military in a support role to tow protesters’ trucks. And as Ungar-Sargon acknowledged in a subsequent tweet on Monday, in which she conceded at least that there isn’t “blanket support” for the protests, 58% said drivers who refuse to follow law enforcement directives to move should “face fines and potential jail terms of up to two years.”\n\nThe online survey was conducted among a random selection of 1,523 Canadian adults who are “Maru Voice Canada panelists” and weighted by education, age, gender, and region to match the Canadian population.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/11/politics/inflation-republican-messaging/index.html", "title": "Republicans have spent the year attacking Democrats on inflation ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFrustrated by Republicans’ intense focus on inflation and President Joe Biden in the party’s closing pitch to voters, some conservatives want to see the GOP talk more about hot-button cultural issues in the final sprint to Election Day.\n\nThe thinking among critics of the current approach is that Democrats’ most controversial positions are being ignored by Republicans at the expense of a messaging strategy that disproportionately focuses on pocketbook issues, like the economy, gas prices and taxes. And that as Republican candidates and the party’s election apparatus shy away from more divisive issues – including abortion rights, a topic that was injected into the midterm landscape after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June – they are creating an automatic opening for Democrats.\n\n“Abortion is proving to be a much more galvanizing issue for Democratic voters than inflation is for Republican voters,” said Ryan Girdusky, a conservative commentator and campaign consultant. “The old Republican idea is that we’ll win suburbanites because they care about pocketbook issues. But to try and galvanize them on the fact they’re going to pay an extra quarter for bacon? They don’t care.”\n\nOne prominent Republican operative said that while economic issues can be motivating, they “ebb and flow and are less likely to galvanize people as consistently and intensely as those that have to do with safety and common sense.” Republicans spent much of the summer talking about soaring gas prices, for example, hoping that pain at the pump would send voters their way this November – but the national per-gallon average has consistently dropped since June.\n\nA new Marist poll released Thursday found a 7-point drop since July in the proportion of Americans who cited inflation as their top voting issue this cycle (30%), though the issue remains the leading overall concern in the same survey.\n\nOthers pointed to abortion access becoming a motivating issue for Democratic and independent voters, claiming that Republicans – many of whom have struggled to message around the issue since the Supreme Court ended federal abortion rights with its June decision – shouldn’t shy away from the issue while also trying try to capitalize on other cultural flashpoints. Last month, Kansas voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would have allowed state lawmakers to further restrict abortion access. The development energized many Democrats who have since turned abortion into a top campaign issue.\n\nAmong the issues that conservatives want to see GOP candidates weave into ads and stump speeches are gender identity, critical race theory, and criminal justice reform, all of which they consider liabilities for most Democrats.\n\n“It is too narrowly focused and it’s thoughtless if you think that the mom who is filling up her gas tank isn’t the same mom who is caring about her kids’ school and making sure that CRT (critical race theory) isn’t part of her kids’ curriculum. That mom is faced with both sets of issues, cultural and economic, and so elected officials need to meet voters where they’re at,” said Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action for America. Anderson said two “seasoned” Republicans fighting for reelection this cycle – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson – should be a model for other GOP candidates on confronting a wide array of economic and social issues.\n\nThe tension between conservatives who want a deeper focus on cultural issues and Republicans who think economic woes are the dominant theme this cycle comes as the GOP grapples with infighting in other areas, too: the caliber of candidates in important Senate and gubernatorial contests, the way party bigwigs are choosing to spend money, and how closely campaigns should align themselves with former President Donald Trump – particularly as he faces intense legal scrutiny over his keeping of classified records after leaving office.\n\n“Go ahead and add this to the pile,” said a GOP strategist who requested anonymity due to their involvement in several races this cycle. “Republicans can’t agree on a message, we can’t agree on where to invest [campaign cash], and instead of hashing these things out behind closed doors, we’re bickering about it in public.”\n\nBut some conservatives say the party’s message is the most pressing problem because Republican candidates and outside groups are on the brink of starting to spend aggressively on advertising, and the content of those ads will need to send a jolt of energy through the party’s base if the GOP wants to remain well-positioned to retake the House of Representatives and, potentially the Senate, this fall.\n\n“Our closing pitch must be compelling enough to make Republicans want to vote. ‘It’s the economy stupid,’ no longer fits into that category,” said a Senate campaign aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nSpending on a counter-message\n\nFor that reason, one conservative group has begun taking matters into its own hands.\n\nThe dark-money Citizens for Sanity has committed to spending millions of its own this cycle to deliver a counter-message, targeting voters on the internet and airwaves with warnings about so-called wokeness in education, business, and politics. The group has launched a series of provocative radio, television, billboard and newspaper ads that stand in stark contrast to Republicans’ broader economy-themed message. A person familiar with the matter said the group has already spent seven figures this cycle between its advocacy efforts and advertising.\n\nOne of the group’s recent ads, which has accumulated more than 2 million views on Twitter in less than one week, is a 90-second montage of gruesome local news reports and surveillance footage depicting incidents of violent crime across the country. The ad accuses “woke far-left politicians” of enabling an “assault on public safety,” among other claims.\n\nA separate ad launched Tuesday by the Senate Leadership Fund, a PAC affiliated with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, tackles the same issue with a more traditional approach, by using Pennsylvania Democratic Senate hopeful John Fetterman’s own words to portray him as soft on crime. The 30-second spot featured two-year-old video footage of Fetterman discussing his efforts as chair of Pennsylvania’s Board of Pardons to end automatic life-without-parole sentences for individuals convicted of second-degree murder.\n\n“Our advertising on crime, in particular, is being done in races where it makes the most sense,” said an SLF official, adding that, “generally speaking, economic concerns tend to be the top-rated issues.”\n\nIan Prior, a strategic adviser for Citizens of Sanity, said the group wants to capitalize on what he described as a “major realignment” in the current political landscape. The group, which has already spent about $670k on advertising since August, according to AdImpact data, will launch a new $600k ad buy across Washington, Texas and Arizona this week focused on crime, “woke craziness,” and gender ideology, Prior confirmed to CNN. The group is also “messaging aggressively” in Latino-dominated markets as Republicans try to maintain recent gains in Hispanic support, Prior added, and has previously launched ads in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado around the participation of transgender athletes in male and female sports leagues.\n\n“Latinos are fleeing the political left over its embrace of ‘woke’ policies – an agenda created by and for wealthy white privileged coastal liberals,” Prior claimed in a statement. (An earlier CNN analysis found a 5-point shift toward Republicans in generic ballot preference among Hispanics, though a recent Pew Research Center study found that 56 percent of Hispanics oppose the ending of federal abortion rights, which could negatively impact Hispanic support for the GOP come November).\n\nStriking a balance\n\nSo far, efforts to nudge Republican candidates and campaigns away from economic issues and toward cultural topics have occurred outside the party consensus.\n\nBy the end of July, Republicans had spent more than $40.6 million since the beginning of the year on TV ads that referred to inflation, according to the data firm AdImpact. Both privately and publicly, many GOP figures have also acknowledged that they consider inflation and kitchen table issues to be the most important to voters this cycle.\n\n“Inflation is all that matters to the public… at the end of the day, people vote with their pocketbooks,” said conservative radio host Erick Erickson on his podcast in mid-August.\n\nThe SLF official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the party’s internal polling has repeatedly shown that inflation ranks the highest among voters’ concerns, though there are instances where Republicans may need to offer a blended message that goes beyond inflation to focus on crime or immigration, too. The official said they had not seen evidence that wedge issues like gender ideology resonated deeply with broad swaths of voters.\n\n“Inflation is cutting across most demographic and income groups. Everybody fills up their gas tank, everybody goes to the grocery store, and they are seeing these price increases affect their budgets in real time,” said the official, adding that Republicans have “a buffet of messages” that could work to the party’s advantage this cycle.\n\n“There may be races where we talk almost exclusively about one or the other (inflation or crime and immigration) or we talk about both,” the official said.\n\nEven conservatives who have been nudging candidates to talk more about cultural issues said they should balance those messages with proposals to combat economic problems.\n\n“My advice to candidates is to do both at the same time; draw the contrast with the left and run on a winning platform that actually shows voters what you care about,” said Anderson. “Republicans, I think, have been doing this but they need to do it a lot more in the next 60 days.”\n\nA prebuttal to Biden’s primetime speech by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy last Thursday, where the president slammed “extremist” MAGA Republicans and accused his predecessor of being a threat to democracy, could provide one roadmap to candidates, campaigns, and conservative outside groups as they look to reach both middle-of-the-road and grassroots Republicans in the closing weeks of the midterm race. While the California Republican, who is angling to become Speaker if the GOP wins control of the lower chamber, repeatedly criticized the current administration over gas and energy costs and littered his remarks with mentions of the economy, he accused Biden and Democrats of “dismantling American democracy” with their policies.\n\n“Is it morally right that our children were forced to stay home from school while politicians dined out? When biological boys are allowed to compete in girls sports, does President Biden think that is fair?” McCarthy said while bemoaning “historic inflation” and “daily violence against innocent Americans” in the same breath.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/uk/profile-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Britain's new prime minister: Rishi Sunak, rich ex-banker who will be ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nJust seven short weeks ago, it looked as if it might be all over for Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe former chancellor of the exchequer – the UK’s title for its chief finance minister – made a high-stakes gamble. He launched an attack that helped to end Boris Johnson’s premiership, put himself forward as his replacement, but ultimately lost to Liz Truss. Admitting defeat, he retreated to the parliamentary back benches.\n\nBut in a sign of just how unpredictable British politics has become, Sunak has returned triumphant from the political wilderness to replace Truss, whose premiership imploded last week.\n\nSunak was the only leadership hopeful to secure the support of 100 Conservative members of parliament, the necessary threshold set by party officials for potential candidates. He will become the first person of color to be British prime minister – and at the age of 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nHe was the last person standing after his rivals – Johnson and the Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt – fell by the wayside.\n\nSpeaking after being declared the new Conservative leader, Sunak said he was “honored and humbled” to become the next prime minister.\n\n“It is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love, and to be able to give back to the country i owe so much to,” Sunak said.\n\n“The United Kingdom is a great country, but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” he added. “We need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.”\n\nSunak first publicly declared on Sunday morning that he would be standing in the contest. Other than that brief statement, he made no big pitch for the leadership this time round.\n\nIn the last contest, over the summer, he was widely seen as the more moderate of the two candidates. Compared to Truss, he took a less ideological line on matters like Brexit and the economy. (Unlike Truss, a remainer-turned hardline Brexiteer, Sunak voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.)\n\nLike Truss, Sunak promised a tough approach to illegal immigration and vowed to expand the government’s controversial Rwanda immigration policy.\n\nSunak, whose parents came to the UK from East Africa in the 1960s, is of Indian descent. His father was a local doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England, something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nHe will be the first Hindu to become British prime minister, securing the position on Diwali, the festival of lights that marks one of the most important days of the Hindu calendar.

Aaron Chown/AP In pictures: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nSunak has also been scrutinized over the tax arrangements of his wife Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire.\n\nEarlier this year, Sunak and Murty appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK’s 250 wealthiest people – the newspaper estimated their joint net worth at £730 million ($826 million).\n\nSunak’s election on Monday marks the pinnacle of what has been a speedy rise to power. He was first elected as an MP in 2015 and spent two years on the back benches before becoming a junior minister in Theresa May’s government. Johnson gave Sunak his first major government role, appointing him as chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019 and promoting him to chancellor in 2020.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic, and positioned himself as the “sound finance” candidate.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Sunak put in place measures worth £400 billion ($452 billion) aimed at boosting the economy, including a generous furlough scheme, business loans and discounts on eating in restaurants. But that stimulus came at a huge cost and left the government scrambling to find savings.\n\nSunak was an early critic of Truss’ economic plan, which was panned by investors, the International Monetary Fund and credit ratings agencies. While he also advocated for lower taxes, he said tax could only be cut once inflation is brought under control, which could take several years.\n\nHis warning over the summer that Truss’ unfunded tax cuts could spark panic in the financial markets turned out to be true. The British pound crashed to a record low against the US dollar when Truss and her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled their plan. Prices of UK government bonds rose at the fastest pace ever, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive vote among grassroots members, Sunak was not far behind, gaining 43% of the vote.\n\nSecond chance\n\nJohnson has made no secret of the fact that he believes Sunak betrayed him by resigning from his government, triggering his resignation on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable.\n\nJohnson’s downfall followed months of revelations of parties held in 10 Downing Street while the rest of the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nFor a long time, Sunak stood by Johnson – especially since he too was fined in the so-called Partygate scandal.\n\nBut he turned against him after Johnson was slow to act when his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, Chris Pincher, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party in early July. (Pincher later said he had “drunk far too much,” although has not directly addressed the allegations.)\n\nSunak’s shock resignation from Johnson’s cabinet over the Pincher scandal set into motion a series of high-profile resignations that led to Johnson’s demise – and ultimately, to his own rise to the Downing Street.\n\nSunak faces an enormous task. The UK is in the midst of a deep cost-of-living crisis and soaring inequality. Financial markets are still spooked after Truss’ disastrous economic policy missteps.\n\nThe Conservative party, already unpopular after 12 years in power, has plunged itself into a state of utter chaos over the past four months and is now well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls. The only comfort for Sunak is that he doesn’t have to call an election until January 2025.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/health/monkeypox-vaccine-explainer-us/index.html", "title": "Monkeypox: US is offering vaccines to certain people exposed to the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs global health leaders investigate an unusual outbreak of monkeypox across more than a dozen countries, discussions in the United States have turned to vaccination against the disease – and certain people exposed to the virus could be offered a vaccine.\n\nThe US has mobilized vaccine for monkeypox to states that have reported cases, and officials plan to move the vaccine where it may be needed, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Thursday.\n\n“The US has the resources we need to help us respond to monkeypox in this country right now. We’ve been preparing for this type of outbreak for decades,” she said.\n\nThe US has two preventive vaccines and two antiviral treatments that can be used for orthopox, the family of viruses that includes monkeypox.\n\n“One of these vaccines, with the trade name of Jynneos, is approved for the prevention of monkeypox disease in adults 18 years of age and older,” Walensky said. “CDC has mechanisms in place to move these products around the country so that they can be used for prevention or treatment for people who may benefit, wherever they may be.”\n\nCDC officials are recommending vaccination for people at highest risk of infection due to direct contact with someone who has monkeypox.\n\n“Right now, while we are in the early phase of investigating this, we know that those at highest risk for infection are those who had contact with a known monkeypox patient, with the kind of contact that would facilitate spread. So those are the individuals we’re really focusing on recommending vaccination for right now: post-exposure vaccination,” said Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, a veterinarian and deputy director of the CDC’s Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology.\n\n“We continue to watch what is happening and think about whether wider vaccination recommendations would make sense, but at this time, we only have nine known cases, and we have contacts that we’ve identified associated with those cases that would likely most benefit from vaccines,” McQuiston said. “And so that’s where we’re focusing our energies right now.”\n\nVaccines for monkeypox have been made available to some health care workers treating infected people.\n\n“I’m happy to report, even with the first case in Boston at Massachusetts General Hospital, our colleagues across the government have been able to get vaccines to that hospital. And just yesterday they’ve already started offering the vaccines to health care workers who have been exposed,” Dr. Raj Panjabi, who leads the White House’s monkeypox response, told CNN’s Laura Coates on Monday night.\n\n“The first part is to identify those who are infected and to isolate them and make sure that they get the care they need,” Panjabi said. “The second part is to ensure we vaccinate those who’ve been exposed to the infected individuals. If we do that again and again – and that’s our approach at the White House and across the government – then we have a better chance of ending this outbreak.”\n\nDr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, says not to expect a large-scale rollout of vaccines.\n\n“I think that we will need to use vaccinations in contacts of cases. This isn’t something where everybody lines up and gets vaccinated,” he said of the current outbreak. “That’s going to be critical to stopping cases.”\n\nWhat vaccines could work against monkeypox?\n\nA senior Biden administration official said Tuesday that there’s sufficient vaccine to cover the United States’ current level of cases.\n\n“Right now, we have over 1,000 doses of [Jynneos] available, and we expect that level to ramp up very quickly in the coming weeks as the company provides more doses to us,” McQuiston said Monday.\n\nThe CDC estimates that the vaccine is at least 85% effective in preventing monkeypox, based on data from Africa.\n\nAnother vaccine, called ACAM2000, is licensed in the United States to prevent smallpox. Although the vaccine could be used to prevent monkeypox, it is not licensed for that.\n\nThe United States has more than 100 million doses of ACAM2000, McQuiston said.\n\n“ACAM2000 is an older-generation smallpox vaccine that has some potential significant side effects with it,” she said. “So a decision to use that widely would have to have some serious discussion behind it.”\n\nACAM2000 is a live virus vaccine – and once the shot is given, a lesion will develop at that site. Because the virus grows at the site of the lesion, it can spread to other parts of the body or even to other people, according to the CDC, which is why people who get ACAM2000 “must take precautions” to prevent the spread.\n\nIn comparison, the Jynneos vaccine is given as a live virus that is non-replicating. That means there is no visible “take” and, as a result, no risk of viral spread, according to the CDC. Some common vaccine side effects include pain at the injection site, muscle pain, headache or fatigue.\n\nWho should get vaccinated against monkeypox?\n\nMost people won’t be vaccinated against monkeypox.\n\nThe CDC’s Advisory Committee and Immunization Practices voted last year to recommend vaccination for select groups at risk for monkeypox and other related viruses due to their occupations, like research lab personnel and health care workers.\n\nAmid the global outbreak, World Health Organization officials plan to make recommendations on who should be prioritized to receive a smallpox vaccination to lower their risk of monkeypox.\n\n“We will be making recommendations on who should be prioritized for this,” Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonoses lead and technical lead on Covid-19, said during a social media Q&A Monday.\n\n“This is not something that everybody needs. It is a virus that is spreading between people who are coming in close contact with those who are cases,” Van Kerkhove said. “We really need to discuss evidence-based use of these measures, access and equity.”\n\nAndy Seale, strategies adviser for the WHO Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes, added that vaccinations should be considered for countries where monkeypox is endemic, which are in West and Central Africa.\n\n“Communities are already saying to us, ‘if we get this right, if we contain this, if we get the access right for the outbreak, we have to do this for the endemic countries as well,’ ” Seale said.\n\nCan someone get vaccinated after being exposed to monkeypox?\n\nVaccination after exposure to monkeypox virus can still offer some protection, according to the CDC.\n\n“That’s the norm. We usually don’t do vaccination of everybody beforehand. We use vaccination as post-exposure prophylaxis,” Adalja said.\n\n“Because monkeypox has a long incubation period, just like smallpox – it’s 12 days or so, on average, for monkeypox – you can intervene with a vaccine in an exposed person, and it will abort the infection,” he said. “Or if you do get an infection, maybe it gets to them really late or late in the incubation period, it makes the infection less severe.”\n\nBut the sooner an exposed person gets the vaccine, the better. The CDC recommends giving the vaccine within four days of exposure in order to prevent illness. If it’s given between four and 14 days of exposure, vaccination may reduce the symptoms but may not prevent the disease itself.\n\nOverall, people who have been exposed to the monkeypox virus and have not gotten the vaccine within the past three years should consider getting vaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\nWill a smallpox vaccination protect against monkeypox?\n\n“Because monkeypox virus is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox, the smallpox vaccine can protect people from getting monkeypox,” the CDC website says. “Smallpox and monkeypox vaccines are effective at protecting people against monkeypox when given before exposure to monkeypox. Experts also believe that vaccination after a monkeypox exposure may help prevent the disease or make it less severe.”\n\nScientists have known for years that smallpox vaccines can be effective in preventing monkeypox, too. The variola virus that causes smallpox and the monkeypox virus belong to the same family.\n\n“The viruses come from the same family of viruses, and what we’ve seen in prior monkeypox outbreaks is that vaccinating contacts does abort infection or attenuate infection in those individuals with monkeypox,” Adalja said.\n\nThere probably is some “remnant” of protection against monkeypox for adults who were vaccinated against smallpox as children, he said, but it may not be full protection.\n\n“The smallpox vaccination program ended in the 1970s in the United States. Obviously, if someone is in the US military and they got vaccinated last year, I’m sure they’re completely protected,” Adalja said. “But people who got vaccinated as children in the era when smallpox was a routine childhood vaccination, they may have some residual immunity.”\n\nThe senior administration official said Tuesday that, theoretically, there is some protection offered from a previous smallpox vaccination, but there is not good evidence on how much protection – and that protection could wane over time.\n\nHas the monkeypox virus changed with this outbreak?\n\nThe official said that it doesn’t seem like anything has changed about the biology of the monkeypox virus and that the chances of contracting it are still very low for the general public.\n\nWHO officials have not found evidence of the monkeypox virus changing or mutating in this outbreak. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that the licensed vaccines won’t work against the currently circulating virus.\n\n“It’s a very stable virus. So we don’t yet have evidence that there’s mutation in the virus itself,” Rosamund Lewis, head of smallpox secretariat at WHO Emergencies Programme, said during the Q&A on Monday.\n\n“We are beginning to collect that information,” Lewis added. “We will be convening our groups of virologists and other experts who will discuss this very question based on the sequence of the genome of some of the cases that are being detected.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat is a “key question” that is important to answer, said Dr. Daniel Rhoads, co-chair of the College of American Pathologists Microbiology Committee.\n\n“Did something change with the biology, or is this just an unusual situation that hasn’t happened before or we haven’t recognized it before? I think anytime there’s a change in geography for these endemic diseases, that’s a key question,” said Rhoads, a pathologist at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n\n“Whenever we see a new infection or an infection transmitted in what seems to be a new way, I always wonder, is this just something we haven’t recognized before that’s always been around? Or is this an actual biological change, which would be due to a mutation in the virus? I don’t know,” Rhoads said.\n\n“My guess is, once they sequence the virus causing the current outbreak, they’ll be able to compare it to known sequences, and then hopefully we’ll have some insight as to whether or not this is kind of the same old monkeypox or if there’s something that appears to be different.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}]}

Carmichael cracks about being asking to host: \"One minute you're making mint tea at home. The next minute you're invited to be the Black face of an embattled white organization. Life comes at you fast.\" He asked his friend if he should do it and she asked how much it pays. When he said it was $500,000, her response was \"Boy, if you don't put on a good suit and take the white people money ...\" Did he think the HPFA has changed: \"I took this job assuming that hadn't changed at all. I hear they got six new Black members, congrats to them, sure. I'm here because of you, people I admire, people who are actual incredible artists.\"\n\nJerrod Carmichael:Comedian jokes hosting 'SNL' is 'the gayest thing you can possibly do'\n\n'We want to be heard':Why comedians make intimate comedy specials\n\nAustin Butler, Brendan Fraser make the best actor race interesting\n\nFarrell probably has the lead comedy actor Globe sealed up, given his strong performance in \"Banshees of Inisherin.\" The drama actor race is a little more interesting: \"Elvis\" star Austin Butler could have the edge with his acclaimed portrayal of the King of Rock 'n' Roll over Fraser's heartfelt portrayal in the more polarizing \"Whale.\"\n\nWho's going to win? We've got predictions\n\nBefore the main event starts, we put together a list of who will and who should win Globes tonight. For example, Angela Bassett looks to rule the supporting actress category for \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" though Kerry Condon is pretty great as a concerned sibling in \"Banshees of Inisherin.\" Check out our picks and see how we do!\n\nOscar hopefuls Cate Blanchett, Michelle Yeoh compete in separate categories\n\nThose dreaming of a potential Oscar best actress faceoff between Blanchett and Yeoh will have to wait, but both could prevail in different Globe categories. Blanchett is in the best drama actress field with Michelle Williams (\"The Fabelmans\"), Viola Davis (\"The Woman King\"), Ana de Armas (\"Blonde\") and Olivia Colman (\"Empire of Light\"). Meanwhile Yeoh guns for lead actress in a comedy/musical, a category featuring Margot Robbie (\"Babylon\"), Emma Thompson (\"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande\"), Lesley Manville (\"Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris\") and Anya Taylor-Joy (\"The Menu\")\n\nStars plot a Golden Globes return (but not Brendan Fraser)\n\nFraser, who's nominated for best actor in a drama for \"The Whale,\" has stated he won't attend the Globes after accusing former HFPA president Philip Berk of groping him at a 2003 luncheon. \"Top Gun: Maverick\" star Tom Cruise might also be a no-show: He returned his Globe awards to the HFPA in 2021 following a Los Angeles Times investigation reporting the 87-member group had no Black members.\n\nSo who is showing up? The slate of confirmed presenters include Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tracy Morgan, Natasha Lyonne, Billy Porter, Quentin Tarantino and Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, the first transgender actor to win a Globe (in 2022 for “Pose\").\n\nFashionistas will want to check out the Globes red carpet\n\nBefore the main event, E! will kick off \"Live From E!: Golden Globe Awards,\" hosted by Laverne Cox and Loni Love, at 6 EST/3 PST with celebrity interviews and more from the red carpet at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills.

Questions still remain about who will attend and if the Globes still matter, but nominations announced Monday make it clear the show must go on.\n\nThe Tom Cruise blockbuster sequel \"Top Gun: Maverick\" – named the top film of 2022 by the National Board of Review last week – scored a nomination in the best drama category, which also includes James Cameron's long-awaited sci-fi follow-up \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" Steven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical \"The Fabelmans,\" rock biopic \"Elvis\" and the classical music drama \"Tár.\"\n\nSnubbed!

The Globes return on Jan. 10 on NBC and Peacock (8 p.m. EST/5 PST) with a live show hosted by stand-up comedian Jerrod Carmichael.\n\nHere are the major movies, TV shows and performances that were passed over by the Globes:\n\nGolden Globes nominations:'Banshees of Inisherin' leads with 8, including best comedy\n\nGolden Globes 2023 snubs:\n\nTom Cruise\n\nCruise has the highest-grossing movie of the year with the long-awaited sequel \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which was named the best film of 2022 by the National Board of Review last week. But even with a best picture nod from the Globes for \"Top Gun,\" Cruise was curiously passed over for best actor.\n\nWill Smith\n\nSmith's Oscar apology tour is in full swing, with the A-lister appearing on late-night shows and red carpets to promote his just-released \"Emancipation,\" about an enslaved man's tense escape. But Hollywood may not be ready to forgive the star just yet for slapping Chris Rock, as Smith was notably absent from Monday's Globe nominations for best actor.\n\nJennifer Lawrence\n\nThe three-time Globes winner has slowly waded back into public life after getting married and becoming a mom, returning to her indie roots with the quiet veteran drama \"Causeway.\" But the Apple TV+ film may have been too muted for voters who slept on a best actress nod for Lawrence.\n\n'Ticket to Paradise'\n\nJulia Roberts and George Clooney revived the studio rom-com with \"Ticket to Paradise,\" which earned nearly $170 million at the global box office this fall. But ticket sales didn't translate to awards love for the Hollywood megastars, who were both shut out of the comedy acting nominations at the Globes. Roberts still did manage one nomination, though, for best actress in a limited series for Starz drama \"Gaslit.\"\n\nAdam Sandler\n\nSandler has been working the campaign trail hard for his Netflix basketball movie \"Hustle,\" charming the Gotham Awards with his hilarious tribute speech and reuniting with former co-star Brendan Fraser for Variety's Actors on Actors conversation series. But the funnyman will have to sit out yet another Globes, where he was last nominated nearly two decades ago for \"Punch-Drunk Love.\"\n\nTom Hanks\n\nThe 10-time Globes nominee and four-time winner has two movies in awards contention this season: Baz Luhrmann's splashy \"Elvis\" and the upcoming dramedy \"A Man Called Otto\" (in select theaters Dec. 30). But Hanks was shunned for both films, although \"Elvis\" still clinched nominations for best picture, director and actor (Austin Butler).\n\nKeke Palmer\n\nNo one's having a better December than Palmer, who announced she's pregnant while hosting \"Saturday Night Live\" earlier this month. She also earned best supporting actress from the New York Film Critics Circle Awards for Jordan Peele's \"Nope,” but was left out of the Globes nominations.\n\nWomen directors\n\nThe Globes have long gotten flak for their lack of female representation in the best director category, with Natalie Portman memorably calling out the \"all-male nominees\" at the 2018 show. After Jane Campion (\"The Power of the Dog\") and Maggie Gyllenhaal (\"The Lost Daughter\") earned Globe director nods last year, filmmakers including Sarah Polley (\"Women Talking\"), Gina Prince-Bythewood (\"The Woman King\") and Maria Schrader (\"She Said\") were noticeably absent from this year's entirely male category.\n\n'Yellowstone'\n\nParamount's Western megahit \"Yellowstone\" has never been an awards magnet, earning just one Emmy nomination for best production design since debuting in 2018. The snubs continued in Monday's Globes nominations, where Kevin Costner earned the series' sole nod for best drama actor.\n\n'Barry'\n\nHBO series \"Barry\" has twice been nominated for the Globes' best comedy or musical award, telling the story of a hitman-turned-aspiring actor (\"Saturday Night Live\" veteran Bill Hader). Hader and co-star Henry Winkler once again earned acting nods this year, although the show's third season was skipped over in the Globes' top TV category.\n\nMichael Shannon\n\nJessica Chastain earned her eighth Globes nomination Monday for playing country singer Tammy Wynette in the Showtime miniseries \"George & Tammy.\" But Michael Shannon, who co-stars as Wynette's third husband George Jones, missed out for best actor in a limited series.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/09/entertainment/golden-globes-winners-2022/index.html", "title": "Golden Globe winners list 2022 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nOn a typical year, the Golden Globe Awards serve as the gold standard for tipsy fun.

The semi-autobiographical film stars Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy Fabelman, a fictionalized version of Spielberg, alongside Michelle Williams, Paul Dano and Seth Rogen. While the movie is still currently in theaters, you can stream it at home for $19.99 on Apple TV, Prime Video and others.\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin\n\nBest comedy or musical\n\nBest actor in a comedy or musical (Colin Farrell)\n\nBest screenplay (Martin McDonagh)\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin is Martin McDonagh's fifth turn as a film writer/director, and reunited Farrell and Gleeson for the first time since 2008's In Bruges for a sharp, oftentimes hilarious glimpse into a dissolving friendship. You can catch the film (and Farrell in all his sunshine-y glory) on HBO Max.\n\nEverything, Everywhere, All at Once\n\nBest actress in a comedy or musical (Michelle Yeoh)\n\nBest supporting actor (Ke Huy Quan)\n\nDaniel Kwan and Daniel Sheinert's euphoric multiverse flick Everything, Everywhere, All at Once was up for several awards at this year's Golden Globes and brought home wins for both Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan's wonderful performances. If you have yet to catch the film, you can stream it on Showtime or Paramount Plus.\n\nTár\n\nBest actress in a drama (Cate Blanchett)\n\nCate Blanchett earned herself a best actress (in a drama) win for Tár, which is directed by Todd Filed and stars Blanchett in the title role of Lydia Tár, a disgraced conductor in freefall. The film had a limited release this fall and has been slowly making its way over to rental through services like Apple TV and Prime Video.\n\nElvis\n\nBest actor in a drama (Austin Butler)\n\nAustin Butler snagged a Golden Globe this year for his portrayal of Elvis Presley in Baz Luhrmann's elaborate biopic, which also stars Tom Hanks, Olivia DeJonge and others.

But until now, it hasn’t been clear precisely how litigious he is and what that might portend for a Trump presidency.\n\nAn exclusive USA TODAY analysis of legal filings across the United States finds that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and his businesses have been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions in federal and state courts during the past three decades. They range from skirmishes with casino patrons to million-dollar real estate suits to personal defamation lawsuits.\n\nThe sheer volume of lawsuits is unprecedented for a presidential nominee. No candidate of a major party has had anything approaching the number of Trump’s courtroom entanglements.\n\nJust since he announced his candidacy a year ago, at least 70 new cases have been filed, about evenly divided between lawsuits filed by him and his companies and those filed against them. And the records review found at least 50 civil lawsuits remain open even as he moves toward claiming the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in seven weeks. On Tuesday, court documents were released in one of the most dramatic current cases, filed in California by former students accusing Trump University of fraudulent and misleading behavior.\n\nThe legal actions provide clues to the leadership style the billionaire businessman would bring to bear as commander in chief. He sometimes responds to even small disputes with overwhelming legal force. He doesn’t hesitate to deploy his wealth and legal firepower against adversaries with limited resources, such as homeowners. He sometimes refuses to pay real estate brokers, lawyers and other vendors.\n\nAs he campaigns, Trump often touts his skills as a negotiator. The analysis shows that lawsuits are one of his primary negotiating tools. He turns to litigation to distance himself from failing projects that relied on the Trump brand to secure investments. As USA TODAY previously reported, he also uses the legal system to haggle over his property tax bills. His companies have been involved in more than 100 tax disputes, and the New York State Department of Finance has obtained liens on Trump properties for unpaid tax bills at least three dozen times.\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes, tied to Trump and his companies\n\nAnd despite his boasts on the campaign trail that he “never” settles lawsuits, for fear of encouraging more, he and his businesses have settled with plaintiffs in at least 100 cases reviewed by USA TODAY. Most involve people who say they were physically injured at Trump properties, with settlements that range as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nAlan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said in an interview that the number and tenor of the court cases is the “cost of doing business” and on par with other companies of a similar size. \"I think we have far less litigation of companies of our size,\" he said.\n\nHowever, even by those measures, the number of cases in which Trump is involved is extraordinary. For comparison, USA TODAY analyzed the legal involvement for five top real-estate business executives: Edward DeBartolo, shopping-center developer and former San Francisco 49ers owner; Donald Bren, Irvine Company chairman and owner; Stephen Ross, Time Warner Center developer; Sam Zell, Chicago real-estate magnate; and Larry Silverstein, a New York developer famous for his involvement in the World Trade Center properties.\n\nTo maintain an apples-to-apples comparison, only actions that used the developers' names were included. The analysis found Trump has been involved in more legal skirmishes than all five of the others — combined.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis included an examination of legal actions for and against Trump and the more than 500 businesses he lists on the personal financial disclosure he filed with the Federal Election Commission. USA TODAY also reviewed five depositions in which Trump sat for 22 hours of sworn testimony. This report is based on those legal filings as well as interviews with dozens of his legal adversaries.\n\nA handful of the ongoing cases involve local or state government entities, with the possibility of personal legal disputes between the president of the United States and other branches of government if Trump is elected. For instance, the Trump team has filed a lawsuit seeking a state ethics investigation of the New York attorney general. The suit was filed in response to an ongoing fraud investigation into Trump University by the attorney general, an elected state official.\n\nTrump, New York attorney general spar again over Trump U.\n\nAnd at a campaign rally in San Diego last Friday, Trump railed against a federal judge overseeing an ongoing lawsuit against Trump University. Trump said Judge Gonzalo Curiel \"happens to be, we believe Mexican,\" and called him a \"hater of Donald Trump\" who \"railroaded\" him. Born in Indiana, Curiel was appointed to the federal bench by President Obama. The judge on Tuesday unsealed hundreds of pages of documents in the case.\n\nThe trial is set for November — just after Election Day.\n\nTrump’s history of legal actions provides clues about his style as a leader and manager. While he is quick to take credit for anything associated with his name, he is just as quick to distance himself from failures and to place responsibility on others. In one lawsuit — filed against him by condo owners who wanted their money back for a Fort Lauderdale condo that was never built — he testified in a sworn deposition: “Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers.”\n\nAt times, he and his companies refuse to pay even relatively small bills. An engineering firm and a law firm are among several who filed suits against Trump companies saying they weren't paid for their work. In a 2011 deposition tied to a dispute over his deal with Van Heusen menswear, he said he abruptly decided not to sign a check to a firm that helped broker the deal, after 11 consecutive quarterly payments, because \"I don't feel that these people did very much, if anything, with respect to this deal.”\n\nThe number of lawsuits raises questions about potential conflicts and complications if Trump does win the White House. Dozens of cases remain unresolved, about half in which he is the plaintiff. It raises the possibility of individuals being sued by the president of the United States, or suing him, in non-governmental disputes.\n\nUnder the law, Trump wouldn’t get special advantages as the plaintiff — or protections as a defendant. Under long-standing conflict-of-interest rules, as a plaintiff he couldn’t improperly benefit from governmental knowledge. He also wouldn’t get immunity from civil litigation that stemmed from events prior to taking office.\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK gathered Trump court files\n\nTogether, the lawsuits help address this question: How would Trump’s record in business translate into leading the most powerful government on the globe — a task that involves managing a $4 trillion annual budget, overseeing 1.8 million civilian federal employees and commanding the most powerful armed forces in the world?\n\nWhile leaders who had business careers sometimes have been elected to the White House — oilmen George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, for instance, and mining engineer Herbert Hoover — the jobs have some fundamental differences, political scientists and presidential historians say. A president can't rule by fiat, as some CEOs do. And getting things done in government often involves building coalitions among legislators and foreign leaders who have their own priorities and agendas.\n\n“He’s operating as his own boss and a CEO-on-steroids mentality, where you snap a finger and things get done,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who has written biographies of Franklin Roosevelt and Teddy Roosevelt and edited Ronald Reagan’s diaries. “But a lot of good governance is on learning how to build proper coalitions and how to have patience with the glacial pace of government, and you’re forced to abide by laws at all times. \"\n\nBrinkley sees \"a lot of warning signs about having someone of Trump’s temperament and professional disposition being the commander-in-chief.”\n\nTo be sure, likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has had her own legal challenges, including an ongoing FBI investigation and civil lawsuits into her exclusive use of an email server while secretary of State. When husband Bill Clinton was president, she was involved in investigations by special counsels looking into the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas and other controversies. None resulted in legal charges against her.\n\nDuring her time as first lady, U.S. senator from New York and secretary of State, Clinton has been named in more than 900 lawsuits, mostly as a defendant, a review of state and federal court records finds. More than a third of the lawsuits were filed by federal prisoners, political activists or other citizens seeking redress from the government by suing a list of high-ranking officials.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis identified at least 3,500 legal actions involving Trump. Reporters reviewed thousands of pages of records collected electronically and in person from courts in 33 states over three months, read more than 20 hours of depositions and interviewed dozens of litigants.\n\nAmong those cases with a clear resolution, Trump's side was the apparent victor in 451 and the loser in 38. In about 500 cases, judges dismissed plaintiffs' claims against Trump. In hundreds more, cases ended with the available public record unclear about the resolution.\n\nClose to half the court cases — about 1,600 — involved lawsuits against gamblers who had credit at Trump-connected casinos and failed to pay their debts. About 100 additional disputes centered on other issues at the casinos. Trump and his enterprises have been named in almost 700 personal-injury claims and about 165 court disputes with government agencies.\n\nDozens dealt with the bankruptcy proceedings of Trump's companies, and dozens more involved plaintiffs' lawsuits against Trump businesses that judges terminated because the Trump companies targeted had gone bankrupt.\n\nThey include Trump's ongoing suit against the town of Palm Beach over airplane noise near his Mar-a-Lago Club and an earlier lawsuit against the town over an 80-foot flag pole. Trump's team argued in court that a smaller flag would understate his patriotism, but he eventually settled with town officials, agreeing among other concessions to lower the pole by 10 feet.\n\nThere also are disputes with local governments from New York to Florida to Nevada over the size of his property-tax bills.\n\nThe terms of most of the 100 settlements that Trump and his businesses reached with plaintiffs have not been disclosed. In about 60 additional cases, those sued by the Trump side have settled with him.\n\nA few have become fodder on the campaign trail, including two breach-of-contract lawsuits he filed against restaurateurs in connection with Trump's development of the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. The businesses said they backed out of deals with Trump because of his derogatory comments about Mexicans. Both lawsuits are pending.\n\nThe luxury Trump hotel will have a prime view of the Inaugural Parade next January.\n\nReview of thousands of legal actions show that Trump is fiercely protective of his brand, quick to distance himself from deals that struggle, willing to deploy outsized resources against adversaries and sometimes prone to micro-management, even in disputes that involve relatively small amounts of money. Those approaches, however appropriate in a business setting, may not translate to a political one, especially at the level of the White House.\n\nAmong the details:\n\n• Trump distances himself from deals that sour.\n\nWhen projects struggle, Trump doesn’t hesitate to cut ties, even those that relied on his name to secure investments. That was the case in condo projects that were never completed in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Panama and Baja, Mexico.\n\nCondo buyers who sued to get their deposits back often said they believed Trump was a full partner in the buildings. Trump was shielded by disclaimers in sales agreements explaining his branding-only role, though plaintiffs and their lawyers argued in court that fine print didn’t sync with marketing materials that made it appear these were Trump properties.\n\nIn depositions and court filings in the condo cases and similar branding deals, Trump's team appears to try to have it both ways in depicting his involvement. On one hand, Trump contends deep influence over even the smallest details to ensure Trump-branded products and developments are up to his standard, and he places high importance on the influence of his marketing muscle in such deals — usually as the lead name, face and voice behind a project.\n\nOn the other hand, his team argues in court that he's not liable for the deals that fail because he's simply lent his name.\n\nTrump himself walked lawyers through the difference between a brander and a developer in a 2013 deposition in one of the Fort Lauderdale condo cases.\n\n“Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers,” Trump said, arguing he’s not accountable when a project he lends just his name to goes under. “We worked on the documents, we worked on the room sizes and the things, but we didn't give out the contracts, we didn't get the financing, we weren't the developer, but we did work with the developer.”\n\nIn lawsuits over his Trump University, he testified that he had never met instructors who were described in the university’s promotional materials as being “handpicked” by him. “It depends on the definition of what that means, handpicked,” Trump said during an exchange with a lawyer in a sworn deposition last December.\n\nWhen attorneys representing plaintiffs pointed out some instructors had criminal pasts and had been accused of berating seniors who signed up for the program, Trump replied: “In every business, people slip through the cracks.”\n\nFlorida attorney Sherri Simpson, who defends homeowners in foreclosure actions, said she signed up for Trump University classes because she hoped to capitalize on low prices during the housing downturn. She wanted to turn to a trusted real-estate name to learn how.\n\n“I’m aggravated that I lost all that money,” she said in an interview. “He promised to hire the best, to handpick the instructors, make sure everyone affiliated with the program was the best. But he didn’t do that.”\n\n• Trump is willing to spend large sums on small claims.\n\nNo detail is too small for a Trump suit, and he often brings to bear overwhelming legal resources that enable him to outlast his adversaries.\n\nIn February, he filed five lawsuits against eight neighbors of his Doral golf club in Miami for $15,000 in damages to reimburse him for \"vandalizing\" or \"destroying\" expensive areca palms and other plants his groundskeepers installed between their homes and the course. Trump's staff says the foliage was planted to block golfers' views of the houses; the homeowners say the trees blocked their views of the course. All five cases are pending.\n\n“No other developer put so many resources in trying to fight claims brought by the plaintiffs,” said Jared Beck, a Miami attorney who has represented dozens of clients in lawsuits against developers in South Florida. He said none has fought with the tenacity of Trump, citing a “mismatch of resources” that often works in Trump’s favor.\n\nBeck is now appealing to the Florida Supreme Court a case that dates to 2008 in which he represented a group of people who invested in condos in a failed development in Fort Lauderdale to which Trump licensed his name. “He is willing to go to the mat and has practically unlimited resources.”\n\n• Trump fiercely protects the monetary value of “Trump” as a brand name.\n\nTrump publicly has placed the value of his licensed real estate and other branding deals at $3.3 billion, though Forbes and other analysts question whether the figure is inflated. His moniker drives the value of his licensing deals, which now make up an important arm of his business model.\n\nIn one case, a South Florida developer hired experts who testified that having Trump's name attached to their proposed condominium development boosted the condos' value by at least $200 per square foot. The swanky seaside complex was only partially built, prompting some condo buyers to file a lawsuit against Trump and the developers seeking to recover their deposits. The developers had paid to license Trump’s brand, allowing them to use Trump’s name, his image and his reputation to help them sell units.\n\nTrump has attempted to pull out or distance himself from similar licensing deals, real estate and otherwise, if he feels the situation is hurting his brand. He also goes to court to collect royalties and other fees he says he's owed on those same kinds of deals.\n\n“Anything I put my name to is very important,” Trump said in a 2010 deposition tied to a failed real-estate development in Tampa licensed to carry Trump’s “mark,\" as he calls it. \"If I allow my name to be used, whether it’s a partnership or whether it is a licensing deal, they are all very important to me.”\n\nTrump sued for $4.5 million over unpaid royalties after a company that had been paying him to call its liquor Trump Vodka fell on hard times during the economic downturn, hurting sales of pricier spirits. The company stopped making its licensing payments, and Trump terminated the deal and sued to recoup what he was owed. He won a judgment for the amount, though it's unclear whether he ever collected from the troubled company.\n\nAnd he has been aggressive in suing unrelated companies that were using his name without permission. He won rulings over attempts to market Trump’s Best Coffee, a series of websites with names like trumpabudhabi.com and trumpbeijing.com, and a marketing agency calling itself Trump Your Competition.\n\nTrump’s general counsel, Garten, defended the number of lawsuits. “Our philosophy is that we are a company of principle,” he said. “When we believe we are in the right, we are going to pursue the matter to the end. If that requires that we go to trial and present evidence to a jury, we are prepared to do so. We are not going to cave to pressure.”\n\nBut experts in the presidency and business say Trump’s record, including in courtroom disputes, raise questions about whether he has exhibited the leadership qualities that have distinguished the nation’s most successful presidents.\n\n“Somebody like Lyndon Johnson was a guy who woke up in the morning studying the decisions and the hopes and the strengths and the weaknesses of all the people he had to influence,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and author of Leadership BS: Fixing Workplaces and Careers One Truth at a Time. “For that, you need two traits I think Trump lacks: Number one, an attention to detail, and number two, you have to subordinate your own ego. I’ve seen nothing from Trump that suggests he has that capacity, and government is the art of compromise.”\n\nTrump’s lack of government experience was a political advantage during the GOP primaries, reinforcing his status as an outsider vowing to shake up a dysfunctional Washington. But it threatens to be a liability in the general election. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week, six in 10 voters said they had reservations about or were uncomfortable with Trump’s lack of experience in government or the military.\n\nEven so, some of those who have sued Trump, been sued by him or otherwise been caught up in his legal wake, say they still may vote for him in November.\n\nPhilip Monnin represented his daughter, Miss Pennsylvania contestant Sheena Monnin, in a defamation suit Trump filed after she posted on Facebook that she thought the 2012 Miss USA Pageant was “rigged.” An arbitration ruling upheld by a federal judge ordered her to pay $5 million in damages, although she and Trump eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed lesser amount. Monnin, who lives in Michigan, said the suit demonstrated Trump’s bullying tactics and attempts to intimidate legal opponents.\n\nBut he doesn’t rule out voting for Trump for president. “Both sides have failed to bring satisfactory candidates,” he said in an interview. “I don’t think any of us in the family has decided what to do, and we have a lot of time to consider how to cast our votes.”\n\nContributing: David McKay Wilson, Karen Yi, John Kelly and Kevin McCoy\n\nExclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee\n\nUSA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills\n\nTrump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes over taxes tied to Trump and his companies\n\nDive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits\n\nTrump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City\n\nAs campaign rolls on, so do Trump's lawsuits in Florida\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK is tracking Trump court files\n\nTrump and the Law", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/01/07/who-lives-here-20-famous-people-homes-sarasota-bradenton-including-stephen-king-and-brian-johnson/4073659001/", "title": "Who lives here? 21 celebrities with homes in Sarasota and Manatee", "text": "The sugary sand, warm winters and perpetual sunshine make Sarasota-Manatee quite the destination.

At the same time he doubled down on previous allegations, accusing his brother and sister-in-law of “stereotyping” his wife, Meghan, because of portrayals in the British media, and stating that “certain members” of his family had been cosying up to journalists, or as he put it “getting in bed with the devil”.\n\nSince copies of his tell-all memoir were accidentally leaked early by a Spanish retailer last week, Harry has faced a huge backlash from the British press and public, with polling showing that he and his wife are now the least popular senior royals apart from Prince Andrew, according to the Financial Times.\n\nWhat did the papers say?\n\n“Harry had time to decide his message, and again it was his family who took the direct hit,” wrote Sky News’s royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills.\n\nSpeaking to ITV’s Tom Bradby, Harry said his family had “shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile up until this point. And I’m not sure how honesty is burning bridges. You know, silence only allows the abuser to abuse.”\n\nMills said: “For all his efforts to say how much he still loves them, it felt like another huge betrayal as he compared them to abusers.”\n\nPrince Harry insisted he is “100%” confident he can reconcile with his family and multiple news outlets have reported that King Charles is also keen to mend relations with his youngest son. The King reportedly wants to extend an invitation to the Sussexes to his coronation, which will take place in May.\n\n“Charles wants to project an image of unity for the royal family and would like a genuine rapprochement with his youngest son,” reported Vanity Fair. However, the magazine cited “sources close to the King” who have also said that Charles “will not tolerate Harry attacking his wife and that Harry may have crossed a line by speaking about Camilla”, whom he accused of planting stories in the press and being a “villain” who “needed to rehabilitate her image”.\n\nWhat next?\n\nA source told The Daily Telegraph that King Charles “has never given up hope of reconciling with the Duke of Sussex”. The paper said that “despite all of the recent revelations and allegations fired from California, Charles believes he will one day be reunited with his son and they will move forward”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2023/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/959223/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-11-january-202", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 11 January 2023 | The Week ...", "text": "‘Murky’ Johnson may be investigated\n\nThere are calls for a Commons investigation into Boris Johnson after it was reported that he is living in a Tory donor’s £20m home on one of UK’s most expensive streets.

She was featured on the nation’s banknotes for more than 60 years, the first British monarch to do so. Her portrait also features on the currency of several countries that were formerly under British rule.\n\nSince 1953, one year after the Queen took the throne, UK coins have borne five different versions of her portrait. She appeared on the country’s banknotes starting in 1960.\n\nBut now, the Bank of England, which prints the country’s banknotes, and the Royal Mint, which makes its coins, face the sizeable task of withdrawing that currency from circulation and replacing it with money bearing the portrait of King Charles III.\n\nThere are more than 4.7 million banknotes in circulation in the UK, worth a collective £82 billion ($95 billion), according to the central bank. There are also around 29 billion coins circulating, the Royal Mint said.\n\nThe new money is likely to introduced gradually, and coexist as legal tender with the old notes and coins for a period of time.\n\nA similar phase-in happened in 2017, when the Royal Mint began issuing a new 12-sided £1 coin. The new coin circulated at the same time as the old round-shaped £1 for six months before the latter lost its status as legal tender.\n\nBut it’s not just cash that will require a makeover. The UK faces a mammoth operation to change the royal insignia on thousands of post boxes and newly issued passports.\n\nNo changes yet\n\nThe Royal Mint said in a statement on its website that coins bearing the image of the Queen “remain legal tender and in circulation,” and that their production would continue as usual during “this period of respectful mourning.”\n\nThe Bank of England said that the Queen’s “iconic portraits [were] synonymous” with some of its most important work.\n\n“Current banknotes featuring the image of Her Majesty The Queen will continue to be legal tender,” it said in a Thursday statement. (At one point Friday, so many people were attempting to access the Royal Mint’s website that there was a virtual queue to get in.)\n\nThe central bank said it would lay out its plans to replace existing banknotes once the period of mourning ends. The Royal Mint also said that it would make an announcement in due course.\n\nThe Queen’s image is also emblazoned on some banknotes and coins across the Commonwealth — an association of 54 countries, almost all of which were formerly colonized by the UK.\n\nIn Canada, where the Queen remains the head of state, her image features on plastic $20 banknotes.\n\n“The current polymer $20 bank note is intended to circulate for years to come. There is no legislative requirement to change the design within a prescribed period when the Monarch changes,” Amélie Ferron-Craig, a spokesperson for the Bank of Canada, said in a statement to CNN Business.\n\nCanada’s finance minster is responsible for approving the design of new banknotes, Ferron-Craig added, and issuing those notes usually takes a few years.\n\nIn Australia, too, the Queen’s portrait features on the $5 note. The Reserve Bank of Australia said on Friday that there would be no “immediate change” to its banknotes.\n\nIt added that its $5 notes would “not be withdrawn” and would likely stay in circulation for years.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/uk/order-of-service-queen-funeral-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "The Orders of Service for Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral and ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe funeral service for Queen Elizabeth II will be conducted by the Dean of Westminster at Westminster Abbey, starting at 11 a.m. (6 a.m. ET), with the Archbishop of Canterbury giving the Sermon and Commendation.\n\nThe Queen’s great-grandchildren Prince George and Princess Charlotte will form part of the royal family procession behind the Queen’s coffin as it is carried into Westminster Abbey\n\nDuring the service, the choir will sing a specially commissioned piece, “Like as the hart,” a setting of Psalm 42 by the Master of the King’s Music, Judith Weir.\n\nOther music selected for the state funeral include the hymn “The Lord’s my shepherd,” which was also sung at the then-Princess Elizabeth’s wedding to Prince Philip in 1947, and the anthem “O Taste and see how gracious the Lord is,” which was composed for the Queen’s coronation in 1953 by Ralph Vaughan Williams.\n\nThe nation will observe a two-minute silence towards the end of the hour-long service after which the Sovereign’s Piper of the Royal Regiment of Scotland will play the traditional lament, “Sleep, dearie, sleep.”\n\nFull order of service\n\nMusic before the service\n\nMatthew Jorysz, Assistant Organist, Westminster Abbey, plays:\n\nFantasia of four parts, Orlando Gibbons (1583–1625)\n\nRomanza (Symphony no 5 in D), Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872–1958) arranged by Robert Quinney (b 1976)\n\nReliqui domum meum Peter Maxwell Davies (1934–2016)\n\nMeditation on ‘Brother James’s Air’ Harold Darke (1888–1976)\n\nPrelude on ‘Ecce jam noctis’ Op 157 no 3 Healey Willan (1880–1968)\n\nPsalm Prelude Set 1 no 2, Herbert Howells (1892–1983)\n\nIn the Country Op 194 no 2, Charles Villiers Stanford (1852–1924)\n\nFantasy on ‘O Paradise,’ Malcolm Williamson (1931–2003)\n\nElegy Op 58 Edward Elgar (1857–1934) arranged by Matthew Jorysz (b 1992)\n\nThe Sub-Organist plays:\n\nAndante espressivo (Sonata in G Op 28), Edward Elgar Sospiri Op 70, Edward Elgar, arranged by Peter Holder (b 1990)\n\nThe Choir of Westminster Abbey sings the Sentences, during which the Procession of the Coffin moves through the Abbey\n\nI AM the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.\n\nJohn 11: 25–26\n\nI KNOW that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.

For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

It is thought that the young princess was taught to play piano by Harris, according to the palace.\n\nThe service will also feature several nods to the the Queen’s family, with the choir singing “The Russian Contakion of the Departed,” which was also sung during Prince Philip’s funeral at St. George’s last April. Meanwhile, the Dean will read Revelation 21, verses 1-7, which were read at the funerals of the Queen’s grandparents King George V and Queen Mary in 1936 and 1953. They were also read at the Queen’s father’s funeral in 1952.\n\nAs the committal service draws to a close, the Queen’s coffin will be lowered into the Royal Vault, set beneath St. Georges, as the Dean reads Psalm 103, which concludes with the words, “Go forth upon thy journey from this world, O Christian soul.”\n\nThe Garter King of Arms will then proclaim the Queen’s styles and titles before her piper plays for her one last time.\n\nOrder of service for committal\n\nMusic before service\n\nBefore the service, the organ will be played by Miriam Reveley, the Organ Scholar.

Here, in St George’s Chapel, where she so often worshipped, we are bound to call to mind someone whose uncomplicated yet profound Christian Faith bore so much fruit. Fruit, in a life of unstinting service to the Nation, the Commonwealth and the wider world, but also (and especially to be remembered in this place) in kindness,concern and reassuring care for her family and friends and neighbours. In the midst of our rapidly changing and frequently troubled world, her calm and dignified presence has given us confidence to face the future, as she did, with courage and with hope. As, with grateful hearts, we reflect on these and all the many other ways in which her long life has been a blessing to us, we pray that God will give us grace to honour her memory by following her example, and that, with our sister Elizabeth, at the last, we shall know the joys of life eternal.\n\nAll remain standing for the Hymn:\n\nAll my hope on God is founded;\n\nHe doth still my trust renew.\n\nMe through change and chance he guideth,\n\nOnly good and only true.\n\nGod unknown,\n\nHe alone\n\nCalls my heart to be his own.\n\nGod’s great goodness aye endureth,\n\nDeep his wisdom, passing thought:\n\nSplendour, light and life attend him,\n\nBeauty springeth out of naught.\n\nEvermore\n\nFrom his store\n\nNew-born worlds rise and adore.\n\nDaily doth th’Almighty giver\n\nBounteous gifts on us bestow;\n\nHis desire our soul delighteth,\n\nPleasure leads us where we go.\n\nLove doth stand\n\nAt his hand;\n\nJoy doth wait on his command.\n\nStill from man to God eternal\n\nSacrifice of praise be done,\n\nHigh above all praises praising\n\nFor the gift of Christ his Son.\n\nChrist doth call\n\nOne and all:\n\nYe who follow shall not fall.\n\nWords: Robert Bridges, OM (1844-1930) based on the German of Joachim Neander (1650-80)\n\nMusic: ‘MICHAEL’ Herbert Howells, CH, CBE (1892-1983)\n\nThe Dean of Windsor gives The Reading.\n\nI SAW a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.

But, she added, “what matters most is that we are now collectively brave enough to reshape a tabloid industry that conditions people to be cruel, and profits from the lies and pain that they create”.\n\nAssociated Newspapers appealed the High Court’s decision, arguing that Markle had written the letter with the knowledge that it could be leaked and pushed for the case to go to trial. However, the appeal was dismissed, with judges ruling that the Duchess of Sussex had a “reasonable expectation of privacy” in regards to the contents of the letter.\n\nIn 2021, a High Court judge issued a ruling in favour of Markle, saying the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online had violated the Duchess of Sussex’s privacy by publishing excerpts of the private letter. The judge said Markle had a “reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private”.\n\nBack in 2019, Markle sued Associated Newspapers over five articles published in 2019 that reproduced parts of a handwritten letter she had sent to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018.\n\nThe number of lawsuits the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have launched against the UK press now total five in the past three years. Here’s what you need to know about each of them.\n\nThe news of Prince Harry’s claim against Associated Newspapers comes weeks after the closure of Meghan Markle’s three-year battle against the same publisher for printing a “personal and private” letter she sent to her father three months after her wedding.\n\nReports suggest his claim related to a Mail on Sunday article published on 20 February with the headline: “Revealed: How Harry tried to keep his legal fight over bodyguards secret.” The story referenced a separate legal battle the prince is having with the Home Office over his family’s private police protection.\n\nCourt documents show the Duke of Sussex launched a libel complaint against Associated Newspapers Limited on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe long-standing battle between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the British media ratcheted up this week, with Prince Harry now taking on the publisher of the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex was awarded a nominal sum of £1, but the publisher also agreed to pay a “confidential sum in damages for copyright infringement” and a “substantial part of Meghan’s legal costs”, said The Guardian.\n\nPrince Harry vs. News Group Newspapers and Reach\n\nThe same week in 2019 that Markle began legal action against Associated Newspapers, the Duke of Sussex launched a legal action against the owners of The Sun, the defunct News of the World and the Daily Mirror.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex’s claim related to alleged phone-hacking dating back to between January 1996 and December 2010, with Prince Harry claiming damages of more than £200,000, according to The Guardian.\n\nCourt papers said the illegal interception of Prince Harry’s voicemail messages by journalists “affected his relationships with friends and family” and impacted his relationship with Chelsy Davy, which ended in 2010.\n\nIn 2021, journalists at Newsweek obtained a court filing by lawyers for News Group Newspapers, the Rupert Murdoch-owned publisher of The Sun and formerly News of the World, which claimed that Prince Harry was “too late to sue” over alleged phone-hacking.\n\n“These [stories] were first published over 6 years prior to the issue of these proceedings and this claim is therefore statute-barred and it is denied that [Prince Harry] is entitled to any relief in relation to it,” the document read.\n\nA spokesperson for News Group Newspapers refused to comment on what it described as “historical allegations… many of which have been firmly rejected in proceedings over a number of years”. Reach, the owner of the Daily Mirror, has not commented on the allegations.\n\nThe Guardian expects this legal dispute to come to court this year, describing it as “another case that would pit one half of the Sussexes against powerful players in the tabloid press”.\n\nPrince Harry vs. the BBC\n\nPrince Harry complained to the BBC over the corporation’s decision to broadcast and publish online an image from a neo-Nazi social media site that called him a “race traitor” and depicted the royal with a gun pointed at his head.\n\nA spokesperson for Prince Harry told The Guardian in September 2019 that the image, first shared in August 2018, had “caused his family great distress specifically while his wife was nearly five months pregnant”.\n\nThe BBC internally and the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom rejected the complaint, ruling that the image’s use was clearly in the public interest. But the BBC did apologise for failing to warn the Duke of Sussex ahead of broadcasting and publishing the image.\n\nPrince Harry vs. Associated Newspapers\n\nIn 2020, Prince Harry sued Associated Newspapers for libel over two “almost identical” articles published in the Mail on Sunday and on Mail Online which claimed he had “turned his back” on the Royal Marines after stepping away from frontline royal duties earlier that year.\n\nThe articles, published in October 2020, claimed he had “not been in touch by phone, letter nor email since his last appearance as an honorary Marine” in March, said the BBC.\n\nA remote hearing at the High Court in London on 1 February 2021 accepted the claims were “false”. The Duke of Sussex accepted an apology and “substantial damages” from the publisher. Jenny Afia, his lawyer, said he would donate the money to his Invictus Games Foundation for wounded warriors.\n\n“The baseless, false and defamatory stories published in the Mail on Sunday and on the website Mail Online constituted not only a personal attack upon the Duke’s character but also wrongly brought into question his service to this country,” said Afia.\n\nDuke and Duchess of Sussex vs. the BBC\n\nIn June 2021, the law firm Schillings issued a legal letter to some news broadcasters and publishers on behalf of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, accusing the BBC of “false and defamatory” reporting.\n\nThe accusation related to a June 2021 article by the BBC’s royal correspondent Jonny Dymond, which claimed that the couple had not asked the Queen about naming their daughter Lilibet.\n\nDymond quoted an unnamed Buckingham Palace source who “disputed reports in the wake of the announcement of the name that Prince Harry and Meghan had spoken to the Queen before the birth”.\n\nThe letter said the BBC report was “false and defamatory and should not be repeated”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/05/uk/queen-elizabeth-ii-platinum-jubilee-accession-day-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II uses Platinum Jubilee message to elevate ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritain’s Queen Elizabeth II has used the historic milestone of her Platinum Jubilee to redefine the future of the monarchy, calling for the Duchess of Cornwall to be known as Queen Camilla when Charles becomes King.\n\nWhen Charles married Camilla in 2005, the couple announced she intended to be known as “Princess Consort” despite having a right to the title of Queen. It was seen as a recognition of the sensitivities around a title that was destined for Charles’ first wife, Diana.\n\nIt’s the same reason Camilla doesn’t use the title of Princess of Wales.\n\nThe Queen would be expected to consult her direct heirs Charles and William before making such a significant announcement about titles, which suggests they both agreed and felt the British public is ready to accept Camilla as Queen.\n\nThe 95-year-old monarch laid out her vision for institution’s transition in an extraordinary message released as she reached the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne.\n\n“I would like to express my thanks to you all for your support. I remain eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me,” the Queen said.\n\n“And when, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his wife Camilla the same support that you have given me; and it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.”\n\nWhen her father died in 1952, Elizabeth II — then just 25 years old — became the Queen of England.

Stroud/Hulton Royals Collection/Getty Images 70 years ago, Queen Elizabeth II took the throne Prev Next\n\nIt’s a hugely significant intervention from the monarch, who is the only person who can define royal titles.\n\nCamilla became something of a public pariah following the breakdown of Charles and Diana’s union in the mid-90s.\n\nDiana had blamed Camilla for ruining her marriage, saying in a 1995 television interview, “There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.” A year earlier, Charles had also appeared on television and confessed his infidelity, but maintained he had only been unfaithful once his marriage had crumbled.\n\nPositive public sentiment for the Princess of Wales was only further cemented when she was killed in a Paris car crash in 1997.\n\nIn the intervening years, Camilla retreated to the shadows, supporting Charles quietly from a distance.\n\nBut as time has gone by, sentiment toward the Duchess of Cornwall has softened. And the Queen’s moves to future-proof the monarchy reflects Camilla is no longer viewed as the royal mistress but a central figure in “the firm.”\n\nOn Saturday, Prince Charles and Camilla announced they were “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words” according to a spokesperson.\n\nElizabeth ascended to the throne on February 6, 1952, following the death of her father, King George VI, at the age of 56.\n\nThroughout her reign, Elizabeth has often used landmark moments to reaffirm her devotion to her duties, and did so once more in her message on Saturday, despite the fact she is nearing her 96th birthday.\n\n“As we mark this anniversary, it gives me pleasure to renew to you the pledge I gave in 1947 that my life will always be devoted to your service,” she said.\n\nThe Queen also expressed “a sense of hope and optimism” for the year ahead, before conveying her gratitude to her family for their support and paying tribute to her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\n“I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrifices that go with it. It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my father’s reign,” she shared.\n\nThe monarch ended her message by restating she looked forward “to continuing to serve you with all my heart” and shared her hope her jubilee would provide an opportunity for people to come together after the difficulties of recent years.\n\nTraditionally, the Queen marks her Accession Day at her countryside retreat of Sandringham in Norfolk, about 100 miles north of London.

Here, in the oldest part of the Houses of Parliament, it reverberates instantly around the space, stopping people in their tracks and capturing their attention.\n\nMoments later, footfalls on ancient steps resound as soldiers from units serving the Royal Household march into the room to relieve the guard around the Queen’s coffin.\n\nMembers of the public watch as the new guard makes its way in perfect synchronicity to the central platform, mesmerized by the jingling of medals as the soldiers move.\n\nWith another tap, the old guard troops out and its replacement takes up position, standing perfectly still beneath the 11th-century hall’s medieval roof.\n\nThe crowd reanimates once more and the lines streaming past the catafalque resume. Here, beneath these ancient timber beams, ancient traditions are playing out in present day.\n\nThe Queen has been lying in state since Wednesday, when her coffin was conveyed to Westminster Hall in a somber procession that saw King Charles III, Princes William and Harry and other senior royals follow behind on foot. It will remain here until the morning of the Queen’s state funeral on Monday.\n\nThe Queen’s mother and father both lay in state here before her: King George VI in 1952, and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother in 2002. So did her grandfather George V in 1936 and her great-grandfather Edward VII in 1910 – the first royal to lie in state.\n\nTo maintain a continuous vigil, each watch lasts for 20 minutes. Lauren Said-Moorhouse/CNN\n\nState funerals are only reserved for monarchs, however, there has been one exception: Elizabeth II’s first prime minister, Winston Churchill. He also lay in state in the hall after his death in 1965.\n\nAs candlelight glistens on the symbols of state atop the coffin – the Imperial State Crown and the Sovereign’s Orb and Sceptre – mourners pay their respects to the late monarch. Some young, some old, families with children in school uniforms, those of faith and those of none – all are here to say farewell and thank the Queen for her lifelong service.\n\nThe walk from one end of the hall doesn’t take long – a few minutes at most. After waiting for hours in The Queue, sometimes overnight, the fleeting moment they’ve all been waiting for finally arrives.\n\nMen pause briefly to bow to the coffin while several women perform a deep, respectful curtsey. Some simply smile or nod their head. Others take a moment to blow a kiss toward the catafalque. Then there are the older military veterans, with medals proudly displayed, who stand to attention and perform one last salute to their former commander-in-chief.\n\nMembers of the public view the Queen's coffin, which is draped with the Royal Standard, on which lie the Instruments of State -- the Imperial State Crown and the Orb and Sceptre.

But as each person finds their own way to acknowledge the Queen, some stopping the flow of movement for the briefest of seconds, no one complains. Those in line wait patiently for the person ahead of them to do what they need to do before they move forward, and on toward the exit.\n\nAs the mourners reach the far side of the hall, almost every single person – including us – stops and turns back for one final look and to say a silent goodbye to the only monarch most have ever known.\n\n(CNN’s James Frater contributed to this story.)\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThe King walks with his family behind the Queen's coffin on Wednesday.

Multiple official agencies were brought together. Meticulous plans were secretly drawn up. Intricate logistical technicalities were ironed out. A route was carefully mapped out. And no country’s population could have been better prepared for it.\n\nWe are talking, of course, about the line that Britons must join in order to pay their respects to the Queen. This is not an ordinary line. It has taken on symbolic meaning, a ritual to be undertaken, an embodiment of the national mood. It is, in short, not a queue but The Queue.\n\nIt snakes from Westminster Hall, where the late monarch’s body is lying in state, for miles along the south bank of the Thames river. It stretches past landmarks such as the London Eye, the Globe theater and London Bridge. On Friday morning, the line was closed, having reached capacity for “at least six hours,” according to the UK government’s live tracker.

At the stables of Balmoral, where she tended to her ponies in Wellington boots and a Barbour jacket, a patterned scarf was always tied under her chin. But most often, it was a hat.\n\n“You almost can’t see it in isolation. There’s always a brooch, there’s usually pearls, there’s usually white gloves,” Beatrice Behlen, senior curator of fashion and decorative arts at the Museum of London, said in a 2019 phone interview. “And then the matching hat.”\n\nHats were a part of the Queen’s life from childhood, when she was photographed in bonnets and berets. She would continue to wear them through adolescence and young adulthood, often coordinating with younger sister Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother. From the outset, her tastes were bold and provocative.

There seems to be endless appetite for tales about royals like those in \"The Palace Papers\" (Crown, 592 pp.), especially as Britain and royals fans around the world prepare to mark Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee this summer, celebrating the 96-year-old monarch's unprecedented 70 years on the throne.\n\nSubtitled \"Inside the House of Windsor – The Truth and the Turmoil,\" this is not just any book about the queen, her sprawling, brawling family and their dramas over the past 25 years: It's a Tina Brown book.\n\nThe buzz-queen of media-turned-royal biographer (\"The Diana Chronicles\"), Brown, 68, deploys her sterling contacts and deeply embedded sources, her familiarity with British royal history and her personal encounters with royals, palace courtiers, politicians and journalists to serve up a luscious feast of … well, yes, gossip.\n\nBut what elegant gossip, dressed up in Brown's stylish sentences and erudite insights. Seeking a more conventional, footnoted and document-rich look at the queen's life? Try royal biographer Robert Hardman's \"Queen of Our Times.\" Not sure about the accuracy of pop-culture fare such as Netflix's \"The Crown\" or the film \"Spencer\"? Turned off by daily tabloids attacking certain royals in spiteful and barely literate terms?\n\nBrown is your gal.\n\nIt's not that the book is full of \"bombshell\" revelations so beloved of headlines; anyone who has been paying half attention will be familiar with the scandals, histrionics, jealousy and cupidity on display since the throne-shaking death of the Princess of Wales in 1997. Never again, the queen vowed, could one supernova royal threaten the future of a 1,000-year-old monarchy.\n\nIt hasn't quite worked out that way, so there is a larger purpose beyond tittle-tattle to Brown's mission: These stories, she writes, are about the royals who have molded the modern monarchy – Charles, Diana, Camilla, William and Harry, Kate and Meghan, Andrew, Philip and Margaret – and about what she thinks their recent wobbles mean for the stability and survival of that monarchy.\n\n\"Above all, I hope we will get closer to understanding the woman who matters more than anyone else: the Queen,\" Brown says in her prologue.\n\nSome takeaways:\n\nPrince Harry: A very angry man\n\nPrince Harry was way more damaged by his mother's death and his inability to process the tragedy than we knew, writes Brown. It turned Harry into a \"very angry man,\" especially after he left the discipline of the British Army. Like his mother, his emotions and explosive temper were always close to the surface. \"He took up boxing because, as he later said, he was always 'on the verge of punching somebody,' \" Brown writes.\n\nBrown discovered it was one of his girlfriends (prior to the former Meghan Markle), Cressida Bonas, who had serious worries about his mental health and persuaded him to get therapy. Among others, Harry, 37, turned to MI6, the British Secret Service, for help because they had teams of experienced therapists who could be discreet.\n\nWhy Prince Harry really loathes the tabloids\n\nAs Brown tells it, he has good reason to. \"The Palace Papers\" paints a blistering picture of the depredations of the \"redtop\" tabloids. Their outrages, as Harry sees them, predate his mother's death while being chased by paparazzi, as well as the racist attacks on biracial Meghan that he first condemned in an extraordinary statement early in their relationship in 2016.\n\nAs far back as 2005, tabloid reporters, private investigators and other \"creative researchers\" in tabloid pay subjected Harry and William and his then-girlfriend Kate Middleton to illegal phone hacking and also to \"blagging,\" or obtaining confidential data by impersonation, aka lying. It happened to Diana, too, Brown found. To this day, Harry is one of multiple celebrity plaintiffs pursuing a lawsuit against several British redtops for long-ago phone hacking.\n\nAnother cause for resentment: Two of Harry's girlfriends before Meghan, Bonas and Chelsy Davy, were endlessly harassed by paparazzi while dating the prince, in a repeat of what happened to Kate Middleton when she was dating Prince William, and to Lady Diana Spencer when she was dating Prince Charles.\n\nDavy and Bonas concluded they didn't want the life of a royal, although they remained friends with Harry and attended his wedding to Meghan. But he remained bitter about what he views as media intrusions targeting his friends and family, and unlike the usual royal protocol, he and Meghan have struck back with lawsuits.\n\n\"How, you might ask, did tabloid journalism – never exactly elevated – sink so very, very low?\" Brown wonders.\n\nHarry and Meghan's wedding: Bitterness before the magic\n\nEnough has been said and written about the chaos preceding the nuptials – like, who threw a tantrum about a tiara and who made whom cry – but Brown sheds more evenhanded light on the breakdown of relations between Meghan, 40, and her Markle family, especially father Thomas Markle.\n\n\"Scattered, discordant and mutually resentful, the Markles were never a 'Leave It to Beaver' American household,\" Brown writes. \"But in a contest of dysfunctional families, the Markles versus the Windsors is probably a toss-up.\"\n\nThomas Markle, 77, is indeed a difficult man, Brown concedes. He sold fake pictures of himself supposedly prepping for the wedding and denied it, then dithered about whether he would walk his daughter down the aisle, exchanged tetchy texts with Harry and ended up in the hospital with a heart attack.\n\nBrown suggests the Markles were trapped by paparazzi and tabloid reporters who hounded them into doing and saying nasty things about Meghan and Harry. \"You want to hear evil stories about reporters? I can keep you here for a long time,\" Markle tells Brown from his Baja California home.\n\nIt was too much for Harry. \"Once again, the media had found a way to wreak incalculable damage on someone he loved, this time by ensnaring her father,\" Brown writes.\n\nThomas Markle reserves much of his resentment for his son-in-law, \"the snottiest man I've ever heard in my life,\" who called him while he was still in hospital to, according to Markle, chastise him about his failure to listen to Harry's orders on dealing with the media. \"And I hung up on him,\" Markle tells Brown. \"I said, 'That's it, no more.' \"\n\nHarry and Meghan's exit: 'Mutual addiction to drama'\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex's messy move to California in 2020 had \"much in common with the American exit from Afghanistan: a necessary end executed with maximum chaos,\" Brown writes. Megxit, she writes, is an inaccurate term: \"The decision was Harry's, with acceleration from Meghan.\"\n\nThe British-born Brown's long residence in the U.S. makes her somewhat more sympathetic to Meghan's trials after marrying Harry. She blames much of Meghan's distress on the American's misunderstanding of what royal life actually entailed, especially the primacy of hierarchy and the sometimes deadening effect of crusty traditions.\n\nAs Brown describes her, Meghan was clueless about what she was joining and Harry failed to prepare her because he was fed up with it himself. She was now his \"comrade in arms\" fighting the royal rules he had wrestled for years. \"An aide described their confrontational stance as 'mutual addiction to drama,'\" Brown writes, and Meghan was as combative as he was.\n\n\"I didn't do any research,\" Meghan told Oprah Winfrey in the 2021 interview with Harry heard 'round the world. For someone like Meghan, a smart woman who was laser-focused from an early age on achieving fame, it was odd that she claimed to never even Google her family-to-be.\n\nSo, Brown observes, no wonder she was mystified about why she and Harry would always rank behind Will and Kate, even though the Sussexes, in Meghan's Hollywood view, were the true global superstars. Effusive Meghan made reserved palace pooh-bahs blanche when she vowed to \"hit the ground running\" in her new royal role.\n\nUsed to commanding entertainment publicists, she failed to grasp that palace press teams work for the institution on the premise the less said in public, the better. Meghan could not just order them knock down media coverage she didn't like. And \"she was hopelessly at sea\" with English culture and Brits' drier, more satirical sense of humor.\n\nOnce married, Harry and Meghan were \"both drunk on the shared a fantasy of being the instruments of global transformation ... who would operate in the celebrity stratosphere once inhabited by Princess Diana,\" Brown writes. \"Meghan couldn't and wouldn't bide her time to get there.\"\n\nStill, the two have achieved a major change that no one can take away, Brown writes: Meghan's Black mother, Doria Ragland, and the queen are now \"grandmothers in the same family, a twin victory over entrenched attitudes towards race and class,\" Brown concludes.\n\nKate Middleton played the long game – and won\n\n\"In 2011, the question mark over Kate Middleton was whether a girl of such unexalted origins could successfully evolve into a future queen. Now the only question is whether the House of Windsor could survive without her,\" Brown writes.\n\nKate, 40, was ambitious in deciding what she wanted – the heir to the throne – and going after it. And she had a supportive, strategic, circumspect mother, Carole Middleton, to help guide her. As Brown puts it, they were both good at playing \"the long game.\"\n\nBrown suggests that after it was announced in 2000 that William was headed to the University of St. Andrews in Scotland for college, Kate \"suddenly bailed out of the University of Edinburgh 50 miles away and reapplied at St. Andrews.\" They ended up in the same dorm, later in the same off-campus digs, and eventually she wowed him at a charity fashion show where she wore little more than her underwear.\n\nBy 2007, after years together and after enduring media pressure without palace protection, Kate wanted a ring. William wanted to break up. She was devastated but threw herself into nights-on-the-town in London with sister Pippa. Within months, William realized his mistake and begged her to come back. They married in 2011, and now Kate is Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, the future Queen Catherine and mother of the future king.\n\n\"Love and Strategy would be a good name for a Kate Middleton perfume,\" Brown writes.\n\nTen years on, Kate has become a \"savvy dynastic strategist who buys wholeheartedly into both the monarchy's mission of duty and its priority of survival,\" Brown writes.\n\nCharles and Camilla: Sex and sensibility\n\nAnother woman who understands how to play the long game: Camilla Shand Parker Bowles, 74, daughter of the English countryside aristocracy and great-granddaughter of a mistress of Prince Charles' great-great grandfather Edward VII. Like her ancestor, Camilla never blabbed and stuck to her family motto of \"Thou shalt not whine\" in the face of public dislike fueled by media mischief, Brown shows.\n\nOne of the ironies of the past 25 years is that the Prince of Wales, 73, and Camilla, who was blamed by all, especially his sons, for the breakup of his marriage to Diana, emerged from catastrophic condemnation with a strong and happy marriage, popular respect and the approval of the queen, who granted her son's dearest wish in declaring that his wife would be Queen Camilla when he becomes king.\n\nThis was after the queen had already showered Camilla with other prestigious honors for her dutiful loyalty and charity work. It's a remarkable turnaround, Brown notes, given that the queen and her mother, the late Queen Mother, declined to be in the same room with Camilla for years until she and Charles wed in 2005, despite both queens being longtime friends of Camilla and her first husband, Andrew Parker Bowles.\n\nNot all the family is thrilled about Queen Camilla. Harry \"can't stand\" his father's second wife, Brown writes; as a teen, he once freaked her out by silently glowering at her when first forced to be in the same room with her.\n\nNevertheless, Brown writes that Camilla is perfect for Charles, the \"sexual and emotional comfort food\" for the Prince of Wales, the \"horse whisperer of his emotional needs\" since they met in the early 1970s.\n\nBrown quotes the queen's former press secretary Michael Shea saying that Charles' three siblings in the mid-1980s thought of writing to Charles to protest his relationship with Camilla. Brown is not sure it happened but if it did, it had no effect: \"Charles was hypnotized by Camilla sexually,\" Shea told her.\n\nPrince Andrew: The Duke of Hazzard\n\nThe yearslong scandal involving the Duke of York and the late American sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein was only the latest, most shocking, most expensive and widely covered chapter in the buffoonish life of the queen's second son, described by Brown as a dim bully with an exaggerated sense of his own intelligence and a habit of doing dodgy financial deals with dictators.\n\n\"The Duke of York was a coroneted sleaze machine,\" Brown pronounces. Prince Andrew, 62, even horrified Prime Minister Boris Johnson, himself no slouch in the prat department. After Andrew left a business lunch with Johnson when he was mayor of London, Johnson turned to a companion, London Assembly chair Darren Johnson, and said, \"I'm the last person to be a republican but ... if I ever have to spend another lunch like that, I soon will be.\"\n\nThe most surprising anecdote Brown shares involves Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, 62, known as Fergie. They've been divorced for decades but they are still close, still live together (in different wings) in the same mansion (Royal Lodge, in Windsor) and still back each other up when under fire, which is often.\n\nBrown describes how an unnamed American media executive was having lunch with Fergie at Royal Lodge one day when Andrew came in, sat down and said, referring to Fergie, \"What are you doing with this fat cow?\" The executive was stunned at the \"level of sadism.\"\n\n\"Whatever the undertow of their curious arrangement, the deal seems to be that he bails (Fergie) out when she's in trouble, and she backs him up when he's assailed by scandal. It is the symbiosis of sheer survival,\" Brown writes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}]}

Nancy Pelosi, a “defender of democracy” and a “no-nonsense negotiator” who will go down as the “best speaker of all time.”\n\nHis introduction to McCarthy sounded at times like a campaign speech, and the longer it went on the more Republicans called on him to wrap it up, eventually booing.\n\nJeffries said of Democrats in the new Congress: “We will not compromise our values.”\n\nSome Republicans in the chamber retorted: “Neither will we!”\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nMoney and politics:These House lawmakers received campaign money from Kevin McCarthy, then voted against him\n\nBiden congratulates McCarthy and challenges him to work together\n\nPresident Joe Biden quickly issued a statement congratulating newly elected House Speaker Kevin McCarthy – and just as quickly issued a challenge.\n\n\"The American people expect their leaders to govern in a way that puts their needs above all else, and that is what we need to do now,\" Biden said in a statement released by the White House.\n\nBiden promoted his economic record and said he is prepared to work with Republicans \"when I can.\" He added: \"And voters made clear that they expect Republicans to be prepared to work with me as well.\"\n\nMcCarthy and the Republicans made Biden the issue during last year's campaign to win control of the House. The new speaker has repeatedly said Biden is leading the nation in the wrong direction.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nThe week that was:Without rules, House speaker debate opens chamber to cameras, video chronicling chaos\n\nHouse speaker ballot 15: McCarthy wins 216 votes\n\nA bruised Kevin McCarthy finally got over the top in the wee hours of Saturday, recording 216 votes and becoming speaker of the House after days of rancor, reversals and deal-making with opponents.\n\nThe win came on a post-midnight 15th ballot that only took place after a group of Republicans defeated a motion to adjourn and convinced enough colleagues to change their votes.\n\nIt turned out that six Republicans who had opposed McCarthy during 14 previous ballots voted \"present\" on this one, lowering the magic number McCarthy needed to claim a majority.\n\nIn addition to McCarthy's total of 216, the House clerk officially reported that Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries again won 212 votes from party colleagues.\n\nThe six Republicans who voted \"present\" were Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, Eli Crane, Bob Good and Matt Rosendale. All had been involved in this week's effort to block McCarthy from ascending to the speakership.\n\n– David Jackson and Rachel Looker\n\nWho is the next speaker?:Kevin McCarthy was once rejected for a House internship. Now he could become the next speaker\n\nHouse speaker vote 15: McCarthy appears to have the votes\n\nOn a record 15th ballot, Kevin McCarthy tentatively racked up the votes to become speaker of the House on Friday, picking up sufficient votes from Republicans who signed onto an agreement over rules, committee assignments, and other perks.\n\nThe new McCarthy supporters had voted for other people during the three previous days but went with the Republican leader he made concessions that essentially give more power to the conservative critics who opposed him.\n\nThe tally from ballot 15 must still be confirmed and made official by the House clerk.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMore votes to go:McCarthy House speaker drama signals more fights no matter who holds gavel, lawmakers say\n\nGaetz votes present on 15th ballot\n\nFlorida Republican Matt Gaetz, in many ways the face of the anti-McCarthy movement, voted present which gives the GOP leader a needed edge.\n\nBy the time Gaetz had voted four Republican holdouts were voting present as well.\n\n—Phillip M. Bailey\n\nPhillips nominates Jeffries in 15th vote\n\nRep. Dean Phillips nominated House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries for speaker in the 15th round of voting this week, with the latest round of voting stretching into early Saturday morning.\n\n“I rise to say, ‘Wow,’” Phillips quipped in a nod to the late night.\n\nDemocrats haven’t missed an opportunity to highlight their unity all week, pointing out that Jeffries has received the unanimous 212 votes of his full caucus 13 of the 14 previous votes. Rep. David Trone missed the 12th vote for shoulder surgery Friday morning but had returned in time for the 13th vote Friday afternoon.\n\n“We the people still find ourselves without a constituted government,” Phillips said.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nRound 15: McCarthy backer gives a short nomination speech\n\nRepublican Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas got right to the point as he nominated Kevin McCarthy on a 15th ballot.\n\nHe said the new Congress needs less talk and more action and urged his colleagues to finally put McCarthy over the top.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRepublican chant ‘one more time’\n\nRepublicans began chanting “one more time” on the House floor Friday night after switching votes against adjournment to remain in the chamber for a 15th ballot.\n\nAt one point cheers erupted from the caucus and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz received hugs and high fives from his colleagues.\n\n-- Rachel Looker\n\nAdjournment fails; on to ballot 15\n\nAfter a dramatic 14th ballot — which almost got physical on the House floor at one point — failed to hand Kevin McCarthy the speaker's gavel, GOP leadership made a motion to adjourn until Monday.\n\nBut that maneuver was blocked by bipartisan group of lawmakers in a late night vote Friday.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nHouse speaker 14th vote: McCarthy polls 216 votes – needed 217\n\nIt's official: McCarthy came up a single vote shy of becoming speaker of the House, according to the official tally of a notably tense 14th ballot.\n\nMcCarthy recorded 216 votes, but six Republicans would not give him that one last vote.\n\nAs he has throughout the week, Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries had 212 votes from colleagues.\n\nAnother six Republicans voted for Jim Jordan and Andy Biggs, or voted \"present\" – none gave McCarthy the single vote he needed to become speaker.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMcCarthy standoff:A visual guide to a House speaker deadlock not seen for a century\n\nHouse floor gets heated as McCarthy appears in gridlock\n\nIn the vote that could have given the speaker’s gavel to McCarthy, Republican supporters of former President Donald Trump supporters have prevented the California representative from winning the ballot.\n\nAides of McCarthy and Rep. Matt Gaetz, who voted present in the latest round, held animated discussions on the floor.\n\nThe tension of the situation resulted in what appeared to be an altercation on the floor involving Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers, who charged at the group and walked out of the chamber.\n\nThe chaos happens on the two year anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol where the two holdouts-- Gaetz and Boebert-- refuse to vote for McCarthy are strong Trump supporters.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat's to come:McCarthy House speaker drama signals more fights no matter who holds gavel, lawmakers say\n\nMcCarthy in a better position to win\n\nAbout halfway through the historic 14th vote for speaker, the House Republican Leader was in his best position of the week.\n\nOne of his biggest detractors, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, voted present, giving him one fewer vote against him compared to previous rounds.\n\nAnother detractor, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, missed his vote. He could come back at the end of voting to cast a ballot, but if he doesn’t vote it will lower the total of voting members McCarthy needs to clinch the speakership.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nJeffries nominated a 14th time\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries was nominated for a 14th time, and once again the nomination came from House Democratic Chair Pete Aguilar.\n\nDemocrats have touted their unity all week, pointing out that Jeffries has received the unanimous 212 votes of his full caucus 12 of the 13 previous votes. Rep. David Trone missed the 12th vote for shoulder surgery Friday morning but had returned in time for the 13th vote Friday afternoon.\n\nOn Friday night, Aguilar used much of his speech to thank everyone for whom the Capitol is a workplace and called out Republicans for two years ago objecting to the 2020 presidential election and peaceful transfer of power.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nThe Democratic leader:Who is Hakeem Jeffries in Congress?

Byron Donalds, R-Fla., or Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla. Without those votes, McCarthy is short of the votes needed to win the powerful position.\n\nDemocrats have remained united around leader Hakeem Jeffries, all 212 voting in his favor in all 10 votes.\n\nThe situation has left Congress stymied, since no member of the House of Representatives can be sworn in and no rules can be adopted until someone is selected for the role.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nWhat to expect on Day 4\n\nWhen the House gavels in at noon Friday, it will become evident if Thursday negotiations were fruitful for House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy who has lost 11 consecutive votes for speaker.\n\nLawmakers and political analysts in both parties discussed last night the possibility of a deal that could appease 20 rebels in his right flank and whether at least 16 of them would be swayed to McCarthy’s side.\n\nOn the fourth day of a new Congress without a speaker and sworn-in members, all eyes will be on the competing GOP factions of McCarthy and his 200 allies and his 20 detractors led by Reps. Matt Gaetz, Chip Roy, Scott Perry and Andy Biggs.\n\nThe math allows McCarthy to lose four of the 20 in his bid for speaker. But after days of a cumbersome process, any movement to his side would be seen as a huge momentum shift for the caucus leader.\n\nIt’s possible a historic 12th vote could begin at noon, or some members could push for an adjournment until Monday, leaving Congress without a House speaker or sworn-in representatives for the weekend. McCarthy is not in favor of adjourning for the weekend and has said the House shouldn't leave if its work isn't done.\n\n“Progress” has been the magic word all week, with both McCarthy allies and opponents telling reporters an agreement was near.\n\nFriday could prove them right or wrong.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nHouse to honor Jan. 6 anniversary\n\nBefore the House reconvenes Friday, Democrats and Republicans will remember the Jan. 6 anniversary in press conferences to honor those who were killed, injured and impacted by the violent attack two years ago.\n\nAt 9:30 a.m. on the House Triangle, Democratic Reps.

But the conservative hardliners are emboldened by the likelihood of a narrow House GOP majority and are threatening to withhold their support – something that could imperil his bid or force him to make deals to weaken the speakership, something he has long resisted.\n\nRep. Chip Roy of Texas told reporters that “no one currently has 218” votes for speaker, which is the magic number McCarthy would need to secure the speaker’s gavel on the House floor in January, and said he wants McCarthy to list in greater detail his plans for a wide array of investigations into the Biden administration. And Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona complained that McCarthy seemed to backpedal on whether he’d be willing to launch impeachment proceedings into President Joe Biden or members of his Cabinet.\n\n“I’ve heard from multiple of my constituents who question the wisdom of proceeding forward with that leadership,” Biggs said, adding that there needs to be a “frank conversation” about who they elect for the top job.\n\nMembers of the group are also pushing to make it easier for lawmakers to call for floor votes on ousting a sitting speaker. That is something that McCarthy is adamantly against and was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner before he eventually resigned.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado said it was a “red line” for her, but not everyone in the Freedom Caucus is united on whether to make that a hard line.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus, a group that includes dozens of hardline members, have been meeting in Washington, DC, this week for their new member orientation, where they have begun to plot out their strategy for the speaker’s race. With a slimmer-than-expected majority, they see an opportunity, and are planning to use their leverage to get more power in a GOP-led House.\n\nBut the group’s push to extract concessions from McCarthy has exacerbated tensions inside the party. Said one senior GOP lawmaker: “They are a bunch of selfish, prima dona a**holes who want attention for themselves. They are trading effectiveness for the warm embrace of their social media followers.”\n\nMcCarthy, who has been working the phones locking down support from across the conference and received former President Donald Trump’s endorsement on Monday, still remains a frontrunner for the job, and no serious challenger has emerged. And two would-be challengers, Reps. Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise, have lined up behind his speakership bid.\n\nMcCarthy also has time to win over critics. The GOP’s internal leadership elections, where he only needs a simple majority to win his party’s nomination for speaker, are next week, but the floor vote where McCarthy needs a majority of the entire House is not until January.\n\nHis ability to round up 218 votes for speaker will ultimately depend on two things: the size of his majority and whether he’s willing to cut deals with the conservatives that he assiduously courted after they denied him the speakership in 2015. So far, however, McCarthy has not made any promises or given in their demands, with sources saying he has just been in listening mode with potential holdouts.\n\nCNN has yet to project which party will have control of the House of Representatives, though as of Friday morning, CNN has projected that Republicans have 211 seats to Democrats’ 198.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina said McCarthy personally called and asked for his support for speaker, but Norman wouldn’t commit. He told McCarthy there’s a group of them that wants to meet in person, which he said McCarthy was amenable to.\n\nNorman said the group hopes to formalize a lengthier list of all the rules changes they are seeking. They are also pushing to delay next week’s internal leadership elections, though there is no indication McCarthy plans to do so.\n\n“I’m not supporting anybody until I know what the blueprint is,” Norman said.\n\nWhen asked whether McCarthy should get credit for delivering the majority, Norman responded: “The taxpayers that voted the representatives in deserve the credit.”\n\nRep. Bob Good, a member of the Freedom Caucus, told reporters that McCarthy “has not done anything to earn my vote” for speaker.\n\nThe Virginia Republican also predicted that “there will be a challenge to (McCarthy) as a speaker candidate,” a possibility that CNN first reported was under consideration by the group.\n\nSuch a challenge would be more of a protest candidate than a serious one. The group just wants to show McCarthy during next week’s internal GOP leadership elections that he doesn’t have the floor votes for speaker, in hopes of forcing him to the negotiating table.\n\nBut there is at least one member who has said there is nothing McCarthy could do to earn his vote. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida said on his podcast that not only was McCarthy not his first choice to lead, he was not “even in my top 100”.\n\n“With a slim majority, we shouldn’t be starting the C team,” Gaetz said. “We need to put our star players in a position to shine brightest so that we can attract more people to our policies and ideas.”", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/politics/house-speaker-elections-what-matters/index.html", "title": "House speaker elections and floor fights, explained | CNN Politics", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter.

Kevin McCarthy has the support of a majority of Republicans to be the GOP leader but has so far not secured enough votes to become House speaker.\n\nWhat’s standing between McCarthy and the position he has long sought is a handful of conservative lawmakers. These conservatives, many members of the Freedom Caucus, don’t trust McCarthy and have not yet been convinced by him or those lobbying on his behalf, including former President Donald Trump, that McCarthy will appropriately stand up to Democrats and President Joe Biden.\n\nRepublicans will only have a slim majority – 222 Republicans compared with 212 Democrats – which means McCarthy can’t afford many defections if he is to find the 218 votes needed to make him speaker of the House.\n\nHow the day will unfold\n\nCongress can’t really function until it has a House speaker; the position is filled on the first day of a new Congress, January 3, even before members-elect take the oath of office.\n\nMembers will meet in the morning to tie off loose ends and close the 117th Congress. Then, at noon Eastern time, the clerk of the House will gavel in the new Congress and will call a quorum. The first major order of business will be the speaker election. Democrats will place Rep. Hakeem Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans are set to place McCarthy’s name.\n\nThen the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot. If another ballot is needed, it is not clear if Congress will recess the chamber or if members will continue voting.\n\nMembers can vote for anyone they want\n\nThere’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.\n\nBoth parties met last year to determine their leadership, with Democrats selecting Jeffries and Republicans agreeing to nominate McCarthy, but by a margin that signaled a possible floor fight ahead.\n\nMcCarthy faces a long-shot challenger: hard-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. The challenge highlights the opposition McCarthy is up against and could draw votes away from him.\n\nIf no one wins a majority …\n\nLawmakers will continue voting until someone wins the majority. They can take successive votes on January 3. They can adjourn to horse trade and deal among themselves. But the House does not kick off the new Congress until a speaker is elected.\n\nThis is what people are talking about when they refer to a “floor fight.” It’s when House members require multiple ballots, or votes, to elect their speaker.\n\nIt’s been 100 years\n\nThe chamber of the House of Representatives is seen at the Capitol on February 28, 2022. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nIn the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 14 times, according to the House historian.\n\nAll but one of those multi-ballot speaker elections took place before the Civil War as the two-party system was evolving. Back then, floor fights were routine.\n\nA floor fight has only taken place once since the Civil War, exactly 100 years ago, when it took nine ballots for Rep. Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts to be elected speaker in 1923.\n\nThere is some mystery here\n\nPolitico notes it’s been so long that the exact procedure if no one has a majority is a smidge unclear. A Congressional Research Service brief on electing the speaker simply says that if no one gets a majority, the vote is repeated.\n\nThere have been exceptions to the majority vote\n\nWay back in 1849, the House had been in session so long without being able to elect a speaker – 19 days – that members voted to elect their speaker with a plurality rather than a majority. Members ultimately confirmed the plurality election with a majority vote.\n\nThe epic record for a floor fight\n\nIn 1855 and 1856, it took 133 separate votes for Rep. Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts to be elected, again by a plurality and not a majority.\n\nThe process stretched over more than a month and included a sort of inquisition on the House floor of the three contenders. They answered questions about their view of the expansion of slavery. Read more from the House historian’s website.\n\nIt’s also interesting to read about Banks; his official House biography notes he was elected to office as a Republican, an independent, a member of the America Party and as a Democrat.\n\nIt doesn’t always require 218 votes\n\nOne important thing to remember is that McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to become speaker. A majority of those present and voting is required to get the speakership, which is usually 218 lawmakers. But if enough people skip the vote or vote “present,” the number of votes required for a majority can drop.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi was elected with 216 votes in 2021.\n\nFormer Speaker John Boehner won reelection to the post with 216 votes in 2015 after beating back a conservative rebellion like the one McCarthy is dealing with now.\n\nMost of the negotiation and arm-twisting happens long before the floor vote. Pelosi got 220 votes in 2019 after turning most of the fellow Democrats who opposed her. She did so by agreeing to serve only another few years as speaker, a pledge she kept by announcing her decision in November to not seek reelection for leadership.\n\nAbility to remove the speaker is a sticking point\n\nConservatives who oppose McCarthy have said they want to reinstate a dormant and arcane power to allow any member to call for a vote to remove the speaker at any time. Read more about the “motion to vacate.”\n\nRepublicans who oppose McCarthy see it as a tool for accountability. McCarthy and his allies see it as a recipe for bad governance if he is constantly at risk of losing the post that’s so difficult for him to attain.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Post-grad Donalds worked at TIB Bank, CMG Life Services and Moran Wealth in Naples.\n\nHe was elected to the Florida State House of Representatives in 2016, then later to the House in 2020.

Andy Biggs of Arizona, a conservative hardliner who is challenging McCarthy to be the most powerful member of Congress, doubled down on his commitment to stop the California Republican’s ascension.\n\n“I’m not bluffing,” Biggs told CNN on Thursday when asked if he would drop out.\n\nWith the increasing likelihood that the speaker’s race could go to multiple ballots – something that hasn’t happened since 1923 – McCarthy’s allies and foes alike are starting to quietly game out the next steps if he can’t get the necessary 218 votes on the first round and they move into uncharted territory.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bash asks Pelosi if McCarthy has what it takes to be House Speaker. See her response 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nMcCarthy’s supporters are vowing to keep voting for him on multiple ballots, and GOP sources said there are early discussions about a floor strategy for that potential scenario, including whether to recess the House or let the votes keep rolling – no matter how long it takes.\n\nTo prevent that from happening, McCarthy and his team have been engaged in serious talks with a group of conservatives, including over potentially giving them influential committee assignments and more power to drive the legislative process. GOP sources said those negotiations are still early in the process and could ultimately end up giving the group some aspect of what the hardliners desperately want: additional power to seek a sitting speaker’s ouster with a vote on the floor.\n\nAsked if he would drop out of the race if he doesn’t get 218 votes on the first ballot, Biggs refused to say.\n\n“I’m not going to talk about hypotheticals,” said Biggs, who lost his conference’s nomination to become speaker last month after securing 31 votes.\n\nBut in the case of a doomsday scenario – where neither McCarthy nor Biggs can get 218 votes on January 3 and neither drops out – some pro-McCarthy Republicans are signaling support for a different approach. Some said they would be willing to work with Democrats to find a moderate Republican who can get the 218 votes to clinch the gavel – a long-shot idea that underscores the uncertainty looming over the speaker’s race.\n\n“Our initial plan is vote for Kevin and let him fight this out repeatedly. … But if they think they’re going to use this to infinity to drive him out, well, we’re not going to bend to their will,” said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican.\n\nBacon added if GOP hardliners don’t bend, then he would be willing to work with Democrats to find another more moderate Republican to secure the 218 votes to become speaker.\n\n“If a small group refuses to play ball and be part of the team, then we’ll work across the aisle to find an agreeable Republican,” Bacon said. “But I hope we don’t get there.”\n\nMcCarthy’s detractors don’t buy it.\n\n“There are very significant rules, changes being discussed that would open the House up, that would be transformative, that would give us the ability to actually legislate and represent our constituents,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Republican from Florida who said he’s a “hard no” on McCarthy. “And whoever is speaker is going to have to agree to those rules, I think. And I don’t think that person will be Kevin McCarthy because Kevin McCarthy won’t have 218 votes.”\n\nGaetz added: “I think the person who is ultimately going to be the speaker isn’t even the candidate yet.”\n\nIndeed, the small group of Republicans known as the “Never Kevin” movement – confident that Biggs could not win a majority of the House – has been trying to recruit a viable alternative, and claim “several” Republicans have privately told them they would be interested in running if McCarthy drops out. Their goal with voting for Biggs is to show that McCarthy is weak on the first ballot, which they hope would inspire other candidates to jump in.\n\n“How many members vote for someone else will show the strength (of the anti-McCarthy group),” Rep. Bob Good, a Virginia Republican who is a “hard no” on McCarthy, told CNN. “I think the second ballot is going to have more candidates. … There are already Republicans letting us know they’d like to be considered.”\n\nEven House Republicans who are supporting McCarthy predicted that a number of lawmakers would run if McCarthy withdrew his name, with some saying that House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, McCarthy’s top deputy, would emerge as the front runner in that case.\n\n“If at some point, if Kevin did take his name out, then you would have good people (running). Scalise would probably be the guy,” one GOP lawmaker said.\n\nScalise has repeatedly vowed to support McCarthy and refused to speculate on whether he would jump into the race if the GOP leader can’t get the votes.\n\n“No, I’m not going to get into speculation,” Scalise told CNN. “Obviously, our focus is on getting it resolved by January 3. And there’s a lot of conversations that everybody has been having, Kevin, surely, with the members who have expressed concerns.”\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the conservative set to become the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, went even further, ruling out jumping into the race even though Gaetz and other hardliners have urged him to seek the speakership.\n\n“No,” Jordan said when asked if he’d run if McCarthy couldn’t get the votes. “I want to chair the Judiciary Committee.”\n\nMcCarthy’s weighs more concessions\n\nWith 222 GOP seats next year, McCarthy can only afford to lose four Republican votes and still win the speakership. But he and his team are still hopeful he can win on the first round as he has been working both publicly and privately to win over holdouts. So far, at least five Republicans have promised to oppose him on the floor – but in a positive sign for McCarthy, one of them has shown he’s gettable.\n\n“I will vote for Andy for speaker, subject to what we’re discussing,” said Rep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican after leaving a meeting in McCarthy’s office on Wednesday. He later added: “All this is positive. We’re having good change, regardless of what happens. And you’ll see more of it.”\n\nIn addition to those five, a new group of seven Republican hardliners on Thursday laid out a list of conditions to earn their vote, although they did not specifically threaten to vote against McCarthy if their demands aren’t met.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP lawmaker explains why he won't vote for McCarthy to become House Speaker 03:08 - Source: CNN\n\nTheir list of demands – which shows the work McCarthy needs to do to get to 218 – includes a promise that leaders won’t play in primaries, restoring the motion to vacate the speaker’s chair, placing more conservatives on key committees, giving members at least 72 hours to read bill text before a vote, and committing to using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip to demand more spending cuts, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN.\n\nMcCarthy has already begun brokering some rules changes to empower rank-and-file members, created a new select committee on China, vowed to boot some Democratic lawmakers from their committees, and sketched out in greater detail his investigative plans – including a potential impeachment inquiry into Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nBut McCarthy still has additional levers he could pull. Conservative hardliners are pushing for more representation on the powerful House Rules Committee, a leadership-aligned panel that decides how and when bills come to the floor. In one private meeting with a member of the House Freedom Caucus, McCarthy was urged to take a harder public stance on the coming policy issues for next year, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAnd the anti-McCarthy group is also still pressing for a process that would allow any single member to hold a floor vote on ousting the sitting speaker, which was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner before he was forced out of the job by the far right in 2015.\n\nMcCarthy has been adamantly opposed to restoring the “motion to vacate the chair,” and a majority of the House GOP voted against the idea during a during a closed-door meeting last month. When asked by CNN on Thursday if he would visit the issue, McCarthy laughed and refused to answer.\n\nBut McCarthy’s detractors said it’s an issue very much still on the table and think he may end up needing to embrace it if he still doesn’t have the speaker votes by January 3. GOP sources told CNN there’s potential room to negotiate to give members more power to call for a vote to oust the speaker – perhaps by allowing the vote to occur if a certain number of members call for one, rather than allowing a single lawmaker to call for a vote as the hardliners want.\n\n“A competent secure leader is not threatened by (the motion to vacate),” Good said. “And so, yeah, that I think that’s central to many members.”\n\nYet others said what Good and his allies are seeking is a recipe for chaos — and are calling on their colleagues to fall in line.\n\n“I think that’s one of the reasons that we didn’t see a red wave … the idea that people are sick and tired of the noise, and they’re sick and tired of the fighting,” Rep. David Joyce, an Ohio Republican, said of the impact of a January 3 floor fight. “And I know I get that wherever I go in my district is, ‘why can’t you guys just get things done?’”\n\nAs McCarthy scrambles to lock down speaker’s votes, he also delayed the GOP’s internal elections for committee chairmanships. There was some speculation that one of the members competing for a gavel, Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida, may retire early if he doesn’t win, which would make McCarthy’s math problem even tougher. But Buchanan vehemently disputed the notion.\n\n“It’s ridiculous, laughable,” he told reporters. “I’m doing everything I can to help get Kevin to 218.”\n\nMcCarthy could also try to convince Democrats or his GOP detractors to vote present or not show up to the floor proceedings, which would lower the threshold he needs to become speaker. But McCarthy promised his GOP colleagues he would not court Democratic votes.\n\nCould Democrats join Republicans and select a speaker?\n\nIn recent weeks, part of McCarthy’s pitch to his critics has been warning that if they don’t unify, then Democrats could theoretically band together and peel off a few Republicans to elect the next speaker.\n\nSome Democrats have said they would entertain the idea, including Rep. Henry Cuellar, a moderate Democrat from Texas who told CNN some of his GOP colleagues have approached him “informally” about it.\n\nJoyce also said some members have reached out to him about potentially running, but he dismissed it. “At the end of the day, Kevin’s going to be the new speaker.”\n\nNew York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the next House Democratic leader, said, “there are no behind-the-scenes conversations” that he has had with Republicans to put up an alternative candidate. But he refused to rule out a scenario where his caucus would help elect the next speaker if McCarthy couldn’t get the votes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear if Hakeem Jeffries would be willing to help Kevin McCarthy 02:25 - Source: CNN\n\n“Democrats are in the process of organizing the Democratic Conference,” Jeffries told CNN on Thursday. “Republicans are in the process of organizing the Republican Conference. Let’s see what happens on January 3.”\n\nSome of the potential consensus picks that have been floated included retiring Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and John Katko of New York, who both voted to impeach Donald Trump for inciting the Capitol insurrection; Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus; and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, a veteran lawmaker and incoming head of the House Rules Committee.\n\nBut that would require agreement from every single Democrat and the help of five Republicans – no easy feat. Upton said he has no plans to be in Washington that day, telling CNN: “I’ll be skiing.”\n\nAnd progressives like Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York said they would never vote for a GOP speaker candidate, no matter how moderate.\n\n“No,” Bowman said, indicating he’d be voting for Jeffries on every ballot on January 3. “It’s going to be Hakeem.”\n\nBut Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman said this has happened before – nearly a decade ago in his state where minority Democrats in the Arkansas legislature joined forces with a handful of Republicans to elect a GOP speaker of their choice. Westerman privately made this case to his colleagues at a closed-door meeting this week.\n\n“I’m concerned about January 3 getting here and us not being able to form a Congress and organize committees and getting delayed in pushing the policy objectives that we want to push,” Westerman said.\n\nWesterman added that the discussion over changing House rules is good for the party. But he added: “I’m not really excited about any type of destructive movement.”", "authors": ["Manu Raju Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/house-leadership-elections/index.html", "title": "What to know about upcoming House leadership elections | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new Congress won’t be sworn in until January and control of the House has not yet been determined, but Republicans appear on track to recapture the chamber and the race to determine who will serve as the next speaker is underway.\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has officially declared his bid for the speakership, but is already facing headwinds from members of the hardline, pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus who are threatening to withhold their support as they hope to extract concessions.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Nancy Pelosi, the current House speaker, has not yet made clear what her next move will be. Speculation has intensified in Washington over her political future and whether she will run again for the top leadership spot for House Democrats or if she will instead decide to step aside as a new generation of potential leaders waits in the wings.\n\nTiming for internal GOP leadership elections – and the speaker vote\n\nThe vote to elect the next speaker will take place in January at the start of the new Congress, but House Republicans will hold their internal leadership elections to pick a Speaker nominee this week.\n\nRepublicans are scheduled to hold a candidate forum on Monday evening, followed by leadership elections on Tuesday, November 15, according to a copy of the schedule shared with CNN.\n\nThe elections are conducted behind closed doors and are done via secret ballot. In the GOP’s internal leadership elections, McCarthy only needs a simple majority to win his party’s nomination for speaker. That is expected to happen, but McCarthy could still fall short of 218 votes – the magic number needed to win the speaker’s gavel in January.\n\nDuring that speaker vote, McCarthy will have a higher hurdle to clear. The full House holds a vote on the floor for Speaker and to win, a candidate needs to win a majority of all members, which amounts to 218 votes if no member skips the vote or votes “present.”\n\nWhen will Democrats hold their election?\n\nHouse Democrats will hold their internal leadership elections later – the week after Thanksgiving.\n\nHouse Democratic leadership elections have been announced for Wednesday, November 30. Voting will take place behind closed doors via secret ballot using an app.\n\nTo be elected to any position in Democratic leadership, a candidate needs to win a majority among those present and voting. If more than two candidates run and no one wins a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes after the first round of voting will be eliminated and voting will proceed to a second round. That process continues until one candidate wins a majority.\n\nWhoever is elected for the top leadership spot in the House Democratic caucus would serve as their party’s Speaker nominee. But if Republicans have a majority, that nominee would be expected to fall short in the vote by the full House in the Speaker’s election in January and would be poised to become House Minority Leader instead.\n\nThe first election on November 30 will be for the next House Democratic Caucus Chair and whoever is elected to that role will administer the rest of the leadership elections.\n\nWho to watch in GOP leadership elections\n\nMcCarthy has been working the phones locking down support from across the conference and has received former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. But even if he becomes his party’s speaker nominee, as is expected, he could still face a rocky road to securing the gavel.\n\nMembers of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus are threatening to withhold support for McCarthy’s speakership bid and have begun to lay out their list of demands, putting the California Republican’s path to securing 218 votes in peril if the party ultimately takes the House with a slim majority. Members of the caucus are emboldened by the likelihood of a narrow House GOP majority – which would make the margins for McCarthy’s vote math tight.\n\nMcCarthy and his team are confident he will ultimately get the votes to be speaker. And two would-be challengers, Reps. Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise, the current House GOP whip, have lined up behind his speakership bid.\n\nBut if enough members of the Freedom Caucus withhold their support, it could imperil his speaker bid or force him to make deals to weaken the speakership, something he has long resisted.\n\nCNN reported Sunday that Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, a former chairman of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus, is considering mounting a long-shot challenge to McCarthy, according to GOP sources familiar with the matter. McCarthy’s team has been prepared for this possibility.\n\nIf a challenger does emerge, it would be more of a protest candidate than a serious one. But the House Freedom Caucus is hoping to show McCarthy during the internal GOP leadership elections that he doesn’t have the floor votes for speaker, in hopes of forcing him to the negotiating table.\n\nRepublican races besides leader of the party\n\nAside from the speaker’s race, Republicans’ underwhelming performance in the midterms has scrambled other leadership races.\n\nThe race for House GOP whip – a position that will only open up if Republicans win the majority – was already competitive, though Rep. Tom Emmer, who chairs the House GOP’s campaign arm, was seen as having the edge since he was likely to be rewarded if they had a strong night.\n\nNow, Republicans say it could be tougher for Emmer to pull out a win.\n\nEmmer told reporters Tuesday he still plans to run and that he doesn’t know if a smaller majority impacts his bid. But his pitch to members is similar to McCarthy’s, saying: “we delivered.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, a Trump ally and the head of the conservative Republican Study Committee, also officially declared his candidacy for the whip’s position. And Rep. Drew Ferguson of Georgia, the current deputy whip, is also vying for the post, arguing that his experience on the whip’s team will be even more valuable in a slimmer majority, where the chief vote counting job will be crucial for governing.\n\nWho to watch: Nancy Pelosi\n\nWhat happens in Democratic leadership elections revolves around the key question of what Pelosi decides to do.\n\nPelosi was asked by CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday whether she would make a decision on running for leadership before the party’s leadership elections.\n\n“Of course. Well, you know that I’m not asking anybody – people are campaigning, and that’s a beautiful thing,” the California Democrat told Bash. “And I’m not asking anyone for anything. My members are asking me to consider doing that. But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nIf Pelosi decides to run again for the top leadership spot for House Democrats, it will make clear that she is not yet ready to relinquish her role atop the House Democratic caucus. Pelosi, a towering figure in Democratic politics, commands widespread support among her members and is viewed as an effective leader within her party.\n\nBut if she runs again for leadership, such a move would also likely surprise, and even frustrate, many in Washington, including members of her own party, who have been anticipating that she might step aside for a new generation of leadership to take the reins.\n\nIf Pelosi does not run for the top leadership post, it would set the stage for a major shakeup in House Democratic leadership and mark the end of an era for Washington. The move would kick off a fight for her successor that could expose divisions within the party as other prominent members of the party look to move up the leadership ladder.\n\nPelosi’s future freezes much of the Democratic races\n\nUntil Pelosi makes her announcement, much of the rest of the field is expected to remain essentially frozen in place.\n\nCurrently, Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer serves as the No. 2 House Democrat, in the role of House majority leader, and South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn serves in the role of House majority whip. Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark serves in the role of assistant Speaker and New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries serves as House Democratic caucus chair.\n\nAs potential candidates for the higher rungs of House Democratic leadership wait to see what Pelosi does before publicly making moves, some Democrats vying for other positions in their party’s leadership have already announced their candidacy.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado, who currently serves as the co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, has announced his run for caucus chair to replace Jeffries who is term limited.\n\nThe race to lead the party’s campaign arm, DCCC chair, is starting to take shape up after the current chair Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York lost his reelection.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Tony Cardenas of California announced his race for the spot on Friday but others are being floated as well including Reps.

She then guided Democrats as they rode the waves of popular opinion, seeing their power swell to a 257-seat majority after the 2008 elections, ultimately crash to a 188-seat minority, and then rise once again.\n\nHer political career was marked by an extraordinary ability to understand and overcome those political shifts, keeping conflicting factions of her party united in passing major legislation. She earned the Speaker’s gavel twice – after the 2006 and 2018 elections – and lost it after the 2010 elections.\n\nOf late, she has conducted a string of accomplishments with one of the slimmest party splits in history, passing a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package last year and a $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill in August.\n\nHer legislative victories in the Biden era cemented her reputation as one of the most successful party leaders in Congress. During the Obama administration, Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the massive economic stimulus bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which provides over 35 million Americans health care coverage.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the California liberal has been relentlessly attacked by Republicans, who portray her as the personification of a party for the coastal elite. “We have fired Nancy Pelosi,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Fox News on Wednesday, after Republicans won back the chamber.\n\nIn recent years, the anger directed toward her has turned menacing. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, pro-Trump rioters searched for her — and last month, a male assailant attacked Paul Pelosi, the speaker’s husband, with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco, while she was in Washington.\n\nPelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this month that her decision to retire would be influenced by the politically motivated attack. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital two weeks ago after surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his arm and hands.\n\nAfter thanking her colleagues for their well-wishes for Paul, the House chamber broke out into a standing ovation.\n\nDemocrats now look to finally choose Pelosi’s successor\n\nPelosi’s long reign became a source of tension within her own party. She won the gavel after the 2018 elections by promising her own party that she would leave her leadership post by 2022.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN it’s time for a new chapter.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” said Moulton.\n\nBut some Democrats praised Pelosi and said they wished she would remain leader. Asked about her decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said ‘please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nHouse Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats won’t vote until November 30.\n\nAfter her speech, Pelosi wouldn’t tell reporters who’d she support. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced they would also step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi. Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.” Clyburn added that he hoped Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in House Democratic leadership.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries, and help him become the first Black House Democratic leader.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” said Beatty.”I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nRetiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a former CBC chairman, told CNN that Jeffries “is prepared for the moment” if Pelosi steps aside. Butterfield said he thought Jeffries would run.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that members of her caucus had asked her to “consider” running in the party’s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding: “But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nAny decision to run again, Pelosi said, “is about family, and also my colleagues and what we want to do is go forward in a very unified way, as we go forward to prepare for the Congress at hand.”\n\n“Nonetheless, a great deal is at stake because we’ll be in a presidential election. So my decision will again be rooted in the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus,” she continued. “But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. And there are all kinds of ways to exert influence.”\n\nPelosi is a towering figure in American politics with a history-making legacy of shattering glass ceilings as the first and so far only woman to be speaker of the US House of Representatives.\n\nPelosi was first elected to the House in 1987, when she won a special election to fill a seat representing California’s 5th Congressional District.\n\nWhen she was first elected speaker, Pelosi reflected on the significance of the event and what it meant for women in the United States.\n\n“This is an historic moment,” she said in a speech after accepting the speaker’s gavel. “It’s an historic moment for the Congress. It’s an historic moment for the women of America.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Annie Grayer Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Annie Grayer", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}]}

Astra’s stock shed more than 10% of its value, and trading was briefly halted.\n\nBut then, another update came: “We can confirm the successful deployment of the satellites on Spaceflight’s Astra-1 mission today,” the company wrote on Twitter. But the company’s stock didn’t immediately reverse. Twenty minutes after confirming the success, its stock price was still down more than 3%.\n\nThe ordeal highlights how volatile it can be to invest in a rocket company — especially when they choose to set off a rocket during trading hours.\n\nAstra in particular has been on a wild ride in recent months. The company had five failures attempting to put a rocket into orbit before its first success in November 2021. That caused a massive surge in trading, taking the stock price up more than 30%. But then, in February, it notched another failure.\n\nNow, the company’s stock is consistently below the $4 per share mark, way off its high of more than $16 per share.\n\nAstra is one of dozens of companies that plan to use relatively small, lightweight rockets to make frequent trips to space to drop off satellites — not to be confused with the far larger rockets launched by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, or the suborbital space tourism rocket developed by Jeff Bezos’ company, Blue Origin.\n\nAstra, Rocket Lab and California-based Virgin Orbit are among the only startups that have now proven their rockets can get the job done.\n\nAnd all of those companies have now gone public via SPAC, or “special purpose acquisition company,” which serve as investment placeholders on the stock market as the fund’s backers hunt for an acquisition target. The target company then takes over the SPAC’s trading symbol, allowing it to go public with little of the financial disclosure or scrutiny that comes with traditional IPOs.\n\nThat’s not to say Astra and the others can’t or won’t be successful. But the company is facing stiff competition.\n\nWhen asked in a company Q&A posted online how Astra plans to stand out in such a crowded industry, Adam London, Astra’s founder and chief technology officer, said that “rockets are typically artisanal, crafted objects. You make one at a time, and they’re very complicated. But when you really get into it, they don’t need to be that complicated, particularly when you’re not flying people or critical national assets, and they don’t absolutely, positively have to work 100% of the time.”\n\nIn other words, Astra plans to mass produce rockets to make them cheaper, but it doesn’t put too much emphasis on having a pristine success rate.\n\nAnd that means its stock is likely to continue to be a wild ride for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut that’s not necessarily a bad thing, said Micah Walter-Range, president of space consulting firm Caelus Partners.\n\n“The stock swings related to Astra’s launch can be seen as a positive sign because investors are watching the company’s progress and are actively engaging with the space industry,” he said via email. “The market moves also indicate that this is still an emerging industry, and we look forward to the day when launches are viewed in the same routine way as airline flights, where investors monitor the overall trends but not each individual flight.”", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/31/tech/blue-origin-rocket-space-launch-thursday-scn/index.html", "title": "Blue Origin successfully completes fourth space tourism mission ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nJeff Bezos’ Blue Origin just launched its fourth successful space tourism mission, putting yet another feather in the cap of the company that hopes to make these supersonic joyrides a mainstay of pop culture.\n\nThe six passengers, which include a Blue Origin engineer and five paying customers, boarded their New Shepard capsule Thursday just after sunrise at the company’s West Texas launch facilities. Boosted by a 60-foot-tall rocket, they soared to more than three times the speed of sound, or more than 2,000 miles per hour. Their capsule vaulted past the Kármán Line at 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) altitude, which is widely recognized as the altitude at which outer space begins. And at the peak of the flight, they experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and, out their window, sweeping Earthly views.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the trip cost the five paying customers. Blue Origin has not publicly disclosed a fixed per-seat price point, though it had auctioned off a ticket for $28 million. But that was for a seat to ride alongside Bezos himself, and the auction winner didn’t end up going. (He is slated to fly later this year, however.) Blue Origin’s direct competitor, Virgin Galactic, is currently selling seats for $450,000, up from its previous price point of around $250,000.\n\nBlue Origin is conducting its fourth human spaceflight on Thursday, March 31. It includes Marty Allen, Sharon Hagle, Marc Hagle, Jim Kitchen, Gary Lai, and Dr. George Nield. Blue Origin\n\nThis flight had been slated to include Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson, but he dropped out of the mission after Blue Origin announced a schedule change earlier this month. The company cited the need for additional ground tests on the New Shepard rocket as the reason for the delay.\n\nGary Lai, who has been with Blue Origin for 18 years and holds several patents related to the New Shepard rocket’s design, flew in Davidson’s place and was the sole non-paying customer on the flight. Lai’s crewmates included Marty Allen, an investor and the former CEO of a party supply store; Jim Kitchen, an entrepreneur and business professor; George Nield, a former associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation; Marc Hagle, an Orlando real estate developer, and his wife, Sharon Hagle, who founded a space-focused nonprofit.\n\nBlue Origin is conducting its fourth human spaceflight on Thursday, March 31.

He described outer space as the “blackest black I’ve ever seen,” adding that it was “breathtaking.” Nield called it “the thrill of a lifetime.”\n\n“Pictures don’t do it justice,” he added.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nBusiness activity in space — largely led by SpaceX — is booming. From building cheaper rockets and designing new uses for satellites to imagining futuristic space hotels, the industry has attracted record levels of investment, according to data collected by analytics firm Space Capital.\n\nAfter years of quiet development, Blue Origin’s space tourism rocket made its crewed launch debut last year with Bezos, flying alongside a heroine of the space community, Wally Funk, as well as his brother Mark Bezos and a paying customer.\n\nSince then, Blue Origin made headlines for flying other well-known names on two subsequent flights, including Star Trek star William Shatner and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan.\n\nStrahan wrote a message for the passengers on Thursday’s flight that was read to them by ground control: “This is the best ride you will ever have, but it’s way too short.”\n\nBlue Origin’s goal is to make these suborbital spaceflights a mainstay of pop culture, giving a 10-minute supersonic joyride to invited guests — who thus far have mostly been celebrities — and anyone else who can afford it.\n\nBlue Origin is the first company to begin offering regular suborbital space tourism flights. Its chief competitor, Virgin Galactic, notably had its first crewed flight — which included founder Richard Branson — before Bezos’ flight last July. But Virgin Galactic has yet to follow up that flight with another crewed flight after it later became clear that the company’s space plane had traveled out of its designated flight path. The company now says it’s undergoing unrelated technology upgrades and may return to flight later this year.\n\nBlue Origin is conducting its fourth human spaceflight on Thursday, March 31. It includes Marty Allen, Sharon Hagle, Marc Hagle, Jim Kitchen, Gary Lai, and Dr. George Nield. Blue Origin\n\nSpaceX is the only private company that offers trips to orbit. The company completed the first-ever all-civilian flight to orbit last September, taking a billionaire and three of his chosen crewmates on a three-day trip. And next week, the company plans to take four paying customers on a flight to the International Space Station, which orbits about 200 miles above Earth.\n\nBlue Origin does have plans to build a rocket powerful enough to reach orbit, called the New Glenn. And, in light of the news that Russia may no longer sell rocket engines to the United States, those plans are more pressing than ever. The engines Blue Origin plans to use for the New Glenn, the BE-4, will also be used on an upcoming launch vehicle designed by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that is responsible for significant US national security launches. ULA currently relies on Russian RD-180 engines. Its new rocket with the US-made BE-4 engines is scheduled to make its debut this year.\n\nBlue Origin did not have specific updates on BE-4 when reached for comment.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/tech/virgin-galactic-tickets-logo-scn/index.html", "title": "Virgin Galactic reopens space tourism ticket sales after a rough year ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nDuring his flight, “I just felt really charged up and energized about the idea that we just have to keep pushing and going further and further.”\n\nThe company already has about 600 reservations from its first round of ticket sales, which priced a trip to suborbital space at about $200,000 to $250,000 per seat. The company announced Tuesday that the tickets will go back on sale February 16, requiring a $150,000 deposit with the full amount due before flight.\n\nDuring Virgin Galactic’s latest earnings call in November, CEO Michael Colglazier said the company had been testing its sales process during the prior few months and had sold about 100 seats at the new $450,000 per-seat price point. The company is working to sell a total of 1,000 seats before it begins commercial operations.\n\nLast July, the company appeared poised to begin commercial operations after it launched company founder Sir Richard Branson to the edge of space. But a report from the New Yorker later revealed that warning lights had gone off in the cockpit during Branson’s flight and the space plane had traveled outside its designated airspace for 41 seconds. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights pending a review, which concluded in September and gave Virgin Galactic the all-clear.\n\nThe company then announced it was delaying the start of commercial services, citing unrelated technology upgrades. It isn’t expected to fly paying customers before this October. At the time Virgin Galactic went public in 2019, it had been touting plans to start commercial service in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, Virgin Galactic’s chief competitor in the suborbital space tourism game, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, has launched three successful crewed missions for celebrities and paying customers. (Blue Origin has not disclosed how much its tickets cost.)\n\nThe ticket sale news caused Virgin Galactic’s stock, which took a beating last year after a string of bad news, to pop — notching a more than 30% gain during trading hours Tuesday. Virgin Galactic also announced a logo change, replacing the former design featuring a human iris with a simple, purple outline of its rocket-powered space plane.\n\nBeginning commercial operations, however, has been a moving target for Virgin Galactic. Since the company was founded in 2004, it’s faced numerous delays and hangups during its development and testing program.\n\nThe company’s stock was also battered in January by news that it was raising as much as half a billion dollars in debt.

That’s another 24-hour delay from what NASA and Axiom were targeting on Saturday.\n\nNASA\n\nThey now plan to spend a day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida at about 1 pm ET Monday, according to a tweet from Kathy Lueders, the head of NASA’s human spaceflight program.\n\nAX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays have extended the mission by about a week.\n\nDuring their first 12 days on the space station, the group stuck to a regimented schedule, which included about 14 hours per day of activities, including scientific research that was designed by various research hospitals, universities, tech companies and more. They also spent time doing outreach events by video conferencing with children and students.\n\nThe weather delays then afforded to them “a bit more time to absorb the remarkable views of the blue planet and review the vast amount of work that was successfully completed during the mission,” according to Axiom.\n\nIt’s not clear how much this mission cost. Axiom previously disclosed a price of $55 million per seat for a 10-day trip to the ISS, but the company declined to comment on the financial terms for this specific mission beyond saying in a press conference last year that the price is in the “tens of millions.”\n\nThe mission has been made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated. And the space agency has revealed some details about how much it charges for use of its 20-year-old orbiting laboratory.\n\nFor each mission, bringing on the necessary support from NASA astronauts will cost commercial customers $5.2 million, and all the mission support and planning that NASA lends is another $4.8 million. While in space, food alone costs an estimated $2,000 per day, per person. Getting provisions to and from the space station for a commercial crew is another $88,000 to $164,000 per person, per day.\n\nBut the extra days the AX-1 crew spent in space due to weather won’t add to their own personal overall price tag, according to a statement from NASA.\n\n“Knowing that International Space Station mission objectives like the recently conducted Russian spacewalk or weather challenges could result in a delayed undock, NASA negotiated the contract with a strategy that does not require reimbursement for additional undock delays,” the statement reads.\n\nIt’s not the first time paying customers or otherwise non-astronauts have visited the ISS, as Russia has sold seats on its Soyuz spacecraft to various wealthy thrill seekers in years past.\n\nThe 11-person crew aboard the International Space Station on April 9, 2022.

It’s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft.\n\nThe mission has set off yet another round of debate about whether people who pay their way to space should be referred to as “astronauts,” though it should be noted a trip to the ISS requires a far larger investment of both time and money than taking a brief suborbital ride on a rocket built by companies like Blue Origin or Virgin Galactic.\n\nLópez-Alegría, a veteran of four trips to space between 1995 and 2007 during his time with NASA, had this to say about it: “This mission is very different from what you may have heard of in some of the recent — especially suborbital — missions. We are not space tourists. I think there’s an important role for space tourism, but it is not what Axiom is about.”\n\nThe first all-private mission to the International Space Station finally made its way home Monday, making a splash down landing off the coast of Florida and concluding a mission that has lasted a week longer than expected.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/06/tech/axiom-space-spacex-launch/index.html", "title": "What to know about Axiom Space, the company behind the first all ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn a historic first, a crew of four civilians are set to launch to the International Space Station this week as part of an inaugural mission for the commercial spaceflight company Axiom Space.\n\nThey’ll be riding on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, and docking at the station via a SpaceX Dragon capsule, but don’t get Axiom confused with Elon Musk’s private spaceflight company.

Axiom has arranged with NASA for them to spend eight days aboard the orbiting laboratory managed by a team of international government-backed agencies.

Courtesy SpaceX\n\nThe commander of the first-ever private astronaut mission to the ISS is Axiom’s Michael López-Alegría, a veteran Spanish-American NASA astronaut with four previous spaceflights under his belt, and who now has the professional title of Vice President of Business Development for Axiom. He will be joined by three fee-paying crewmates – Larry Connor of the United States, Eytan Stibbe of Israel and Mark Pathy of Canada – who each dished out an estimated $55 million to Axiom in order to take the journey into orbit. (Axiom did not publicly disclose the specific financial details of the trip.)\n\nHere is what you should know about the upcoming Axiom spaceflight, which comes as a handful of private companies are seeking to commercialize the space beyond our planet’s surface.\n\nWhat is Axiom Space?\n\nAxiom Space, the Houston-based company overseeing the entire mission, does not build launch vehicles or rockets like some of the other players in the emerging private spaceflight industry such as Blue Origin, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic.\n\nThe company arranges so-called “private astronaut” missions to the ISS, which includes seventeen weeks of training and custom itineraries based on the individual goals of those wealthy enough to afford the trip. Ax-1 is the company’s first of these planned trips to the ISS, and late last year NASA and Axiom announced Ax-2 is targeting to launch between fall 2022 and spring 2023. In addition to its human spaceflight services, Axiom also offers on its website opportunities for companies and individuals seeking to access space for research purposes.\n\nThe Ax-1 Crew during Zero-G flight training. Courtesy Axiom Space\n\nNASA uses the term “private astronaut missions” to refer to “missions that are privately funded, fully commercial spaceflights on a commercial launch vehicle for the purpose of enabling tourism, outreach, commercial research, and approved commercial and marketing activities on the space station.” Referring to ultra-wealthy thrill seekers with the title of “astronaut,” however, has spurred heated debates over its definition online in recent years.\n\nIn January 2020, NASA selected Axiom to provide at least one habitable commercial module to be added to the ISS’s Harmony node in 2024. Axiom said it has plans to have its module be ready to detach from the station by late 2028, and operate as the first building block of a private commercial space station.\n\nAxiom’s lofty plans to build the first private space station and pioneer the commercialization of low-Earth orbit are what it sees as setting itself apart from others in the budding private space industry. The company even touts the Ax-1 mission as “an important step toward Axiom’s goal of constructing a private space station in low-Earth orbit that can serve as a global academic and commercial hub.”\n\nBuilding a commercial destination in low-Earth orbit\n\nAxiom CEO Michael Suffredini, a 30-year veteran of NASA who served as the ISS program manager from 2005 to 2015, described Ax-1 during a pre-launch news conference last week as a “precursor mission” to the company’s plans of eventually assembling and launching its fully commercial space station in orbit.\n\nWhile Axiom is partnering with SpaceX to launch its private astronauts, “SpaceX is just a taxi,” John Logsdon, a professor emeritus at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs, told CNN Business of the role of Musk’s company in this Axiom mission.\n\nLogsdon, who was the founder and longtime director of GW’s Space Policy Institute, added that he sees Axiom’s inaugural private astronaut mission as “the first step in a process that could result in one or more private space stations doing a variety of things in low Earth orbit.”\n\n“We’ve had the International Space Station in orbit, with people aboard, since the year 2000,” Logsdon added. “NASA says it will de-orbit it in 2030 or so and turn over the use of low-Earth orbit to the private sector.”\n\nAx-1 Crew (left to right) Mark Pathy, Larry Connor, Michael López-Alegría and Eytan Stibbe in SpaceX Crew Dragon during training. Courtesy SpaceX\n\nAxiom Space “is the first of the private sector ventures getting ready for that transition,” according to Logsdon. He noted that construction of the first Axiom space station modules are already underway abroad, and it is slated to be shipped to Houston for final assembly next year ahead of their tentative launch in 2024.\n\n“Like all entrepreneurial investments, there’s a high risk of failure, but a possibility, a very real possibility, of success – success in terms of economic payoffs from doing things in space,” Logsdon said. In February 2021, Axiom said it raised some $130 million from investors, adding that the “new financing will accelerate the growth of Axiom’s workforce and construction of its privately developed space station.”\n\nWhile private astronauts seeking to venture beyond Earth’s surface can potentially strike a launch deal directly with SpaceX – as billionaire Jared Isaacman did last year for his self-funded Inspiration4 mission – Logsdon says the purpose of Axiom’s mission is “fundamentally different than Inspiration4.”\n\nLogsdon said these trips are the first step in the process toward Axiom’s primary goal of constructing a commercial space station to replace the ISS. The Inspiration4 mission was “basically a tourist ride,” he added.\n\nWhile it will likely be years before opportunities to visit a commercial space station become available to more than just the wealthy, Logsdon notes that a private space station could provide benefits beyond vacations for the rich – especially if the ISS is retired as planned and scientists, engineers and other researchers look for alternatives.\n\nThe privatization of human spaceflight is becoming an increasingly crowded sector amid the rise of a handful of space tourism ventures. However, Axiom CEO Suffredini said during last Friday’s news conference that he thinks the company’s plan of creating the first commercial space station – and launching the first commercial module to be added onto the ISS in 2024 – gives the company a novel “business plan.”\n\n“We think it does put us in a good place relative to the competition, but we’re happy that there are others that are going to help us grow the LEO [low-earth orbit] economy along the way,” Suffredini said.\n\nLogsdon said he has been watching human spaceflight launches for decades and was at the Kennedy Space Center for the Apollo 11 launch that put the first humans on the moon back in 1969. While the private sector’s foray into spaceflight has muddled some of the initial intrigue, he said he’s still planning on tuning in for the launch.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/tech/spacex-ax-1-splashdown-monday-scn/index.html", "title": "All-private SpaceX astronaut mission splashes down successfully ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe first all-private mission to the International Space Station finally made its way home Monday, making a splash down landing off the coast of Florida and concluding a mission that has lasted a week longer than expected.\n\nThis mission was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space. The company books rocket rides, provides all the necessary training, and coordinates flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it — and it hopes this is the first mission of many more to come. There were four crew members on this flight — Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; and three paying customers: Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor.\n\nRecovery crews approach the Crew Dragon capsule after splashdown. SpaceX/Axiom Space\n\nThe splash down return is considered the most dangerous stretch of the mission. The Crew Dragon capsule was traveling at more than 17,000 miles per hour, and as it began the final leg of its descent, the Crew Dragon capsule’s exterior heated up to about 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit as it sliced back into the thickest part of Earth’s atmosphere. Inside the spacecraft cabin, the passengers were protected by a heat shield and the temperature should’ve stayed below 85 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe Crew Dragon then deployed sets of parachutes as it plummeted toward the Atlantic Ocean. Rescue crews waiting near the splash down site hauled the spacecraft out of the ocean and on to a special boat, called the “Dragon’s nest,” where final safety checks took place before the crew disembarked.\n\nAn infrared shot of the recovery crew. SpaceX/Axiom Space\n\nAX-1, which launched on April 8, was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but ultimately stretched to about 17 days, 15 of which were spent on the ISS.\n\nSpaceX/Axiom Space\n\nDuring their first days on the space station, the group stuck to a regimented schedule, which included about 14 hours per day of activities, including scientific research that was designed by various research hospitals, universities, tech companies and more. They also spent time doing outreach events by video conferencing with children and students.\n\nThe weather delays then afforded to them “a bit more time to absorb the remarkable views of the blue planet and review the vast amount of work that was successfully completed during the mission,” according to Axiom.\n\nIt’s not clear how much this mission cost. Axiom previously disclosed a price of $55 million per seat for a 10-day trip to the ISS, but the company declined to comment on the financial terms for this specific mission beyond saying in a press conference last year that the price is in the “tens of millions.”\n\nThe mission has been made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated. And the space agency has revealed some details about how much it charges for use of its 20-year-old orbiting laboratory.\n\nFor each mission, bringing on the necessary support from NASA astronauts will cost commercial customers $5.2 million, and all the mission support and planning that NASA lends is another $4.8 million. While in space, food alone costs an estimated $2,000 per day, per person. Getting provisions to and from the space station for a commercial crew is another $88,000 to $164,000 per person, per day.\n\nBut the extra days the AX-1 crew spent in space due to weather won’t add to their own personal overall price tag, according to a statement from NASA.\n\n“Knowing that International Space Station mission objectives like the recently conducted Russian spacewalk or weather challenges could result in a delayed undock, NASA negotiated the contract with a strategy that does not require reimbursement for additional undock delays,” the statement reads.\n\nAX-1 did not mark the first time paying customers or otherwise non-astronauts visited the ISS, as Russia has sold seats on its Soyuz spacecraft to various wealthy thrill seekers in years past.\n\nThe 11-person crew aboard the International Space Station on April 9, 2022.

NASA\n\nBut AX-1 was the first with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS. It’s also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft.\n\nThe mission has set off yet another round of debate about whether people who pay their way to space should be referred to as “astronauts,” though it should be noted a trip to the ISS requires a far larger investment of both time and money than taking a brief suborbital ride on a rocket built by companies like Blue Origin or Virgin Galactic.\n\nLópez-Alegría, a veteran of four trips to space between 1995 and 2007 during his time with NASA, had this to say about it: “This mission is very different from what you may have heard of in some of the recent — especially suborbital — missions. We are not space tourists. I think there’s an important role for space tourism, but it is not what Axiom is about.”\n\nThough the paying customers will not receive astronaut wings from the US government, they were presented with the “Universal Astronaut Insignia” — a gold pin recently designed by the Association of Space Explorers, an international group comprised of astronauts from 38 countries. López-Alegría presented Stibbe, Pathy and Connor with their pins during a welcome ceremony after the group arrived at the space station.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles Jennifer Korn", "Jackie Wattles", "Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}]}

Along with other policies announced earlier this year, it could inject more than 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) into real estate, she estimated.\n\nChinese developers listed in Hong Kong jumped 11% on average on Monday, leading the broader market higher. Longfor Properties — another top developer — jumped 17% while shares of Dexin China, a Hangzhou-based developer, skyrocketed by 151%.\n\nThe rescue package is viewed by many analysts as the strongest signal yet from Chinese authorities that a two-year crackdown on the sector is now over. In August 2020, the government began trying to rein in excessive borrowing by developers to curb runaway house prices.\n\nThe problems escalated last year when Evergrande — the nation’s second largest developer — defaulted on its debt. As the property sector crashed, several major companies sought protection from their creditors. The cash crunch meant that work on many pre-sold housing projects across the country was delayed or suspended.\n\nThe crisis entered a new phase this summer when angry home buyers refused to pay mortgages on unfinished homes, roiling financial markets and sparking fears of contagion. Since then, authorities have tried to defuse the crisis by urging banks to increase loan support for developers so that they can complete projects. Regulators have also cut interest rates in a bid to restore buyer confidence.\n\nBut the property slump persisted, as buyers backed away from the market because of the weak economy and strict Covid curbs. In October, sales by the 100 biggest real estate developers contracted 26.5% from a year ago, according to a private survey by China Index Academy, a top real estate research firm. So far this year, their sales have fallen by 43%.\n\nAlong with a strict zero-Covid policy that has squeezed manufacturing and consumer spending, the property woes have dragged on China’s economy. In the third quarter, China’s GDP grew by 3.9% from a year earlier, putting overall growth for the first nine months at just 3%, far below the official target of 5.5% set in March.\n\nWhile welcoming Friday’s measures, analysts remained cautious about the impact it would have on buyer confidence.\n\n“The property market has yet to show signs of recovery,” said Nomura analysts in a research report on Monday, adding that the latest measures may have “little direct impact” on stimulating home purchases.\n\n“Beijing’s﻿ zero-Covid strategy, despite some latest fine tuning, will continue to weigh on the property sector,” they added.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}]}

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN Business —\n\nChina’s birth rate plummeted for a fifth consecutive year to hit a new record low in 2021, despite government efforts to encourage couples to have more children in the face of a looming demographic crisis.\n\nThe world’s most populous country recorded 10.62 million births last year, or only 7.5 births per 1,000 people, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics — marking the lowest level since the founding of Communist China in 1949.\n\nThe number of births was just enough to outnumber deaths, with the population growing by 480,000 to 1.4126 billion. The natural growth rate fell to 0.034%, the lowest since China’s great famine from 1959 to 1961, which killed tens of millions of people and led to a population decline.\n\nNew births in 2021 dropped 11.6% from 12.02 million in 2020 — a gentler decline than the 18% plunge that year, from 14.65 million in 2019. Chinese demographers have warned that if the downward trend continues, China’s population could stark shrinking soon.\n\nNing Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics, told state media Monday the decline in births stemmed from a combination of factors, from “a decrease in the number of women of childbearing age, a continued decline in fertility, changes in attitudes toward childbearing and delays of marriage by young people,” including due to the pandemic.\n\nThe plunging birth rate comes as the Chinese government ramps up efforts to encourage families to have more children, after realizing its decades-long one-child policy had contributed to a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce that could severely distress the country’s economic and social stability.\n\nTo arrest the falling birth rate, the Chinese government announced in 2015 that it would allow married couples to have two children. But after a brief uptick in 2016, the national birth rate has been falling year on year, prompting authorities last year to further loosen the policy to three children.\n\nNing, the Chinese statistics official, said in 2021, 43% of the children born were the second child in a family. He said the three-child policy is expected to gradually add births, and that “China’s total population will remain above 1.4 billion for a period of time to come.”\n\nFor decades, local governments forced millions of women to abort pregnancies deemed illegal by the state under the one-child policy. Now, they are churning out a flurry of propaganda slogans and policies to encourage more births. The common incentives include cash handouts, real estate subsidies and extension of maternity leave.\n\nLast year, more than 20 provincial or regional governments amended their family planning laws, including extending maternity leave for women. For example, eastern Zhejiang province offers 188 days of maternity leave for the third child; and in northern Shaanxi province, women can enjoy 350 days paid leave for having a third child, according to state media reports.\n\nBut the policies have failed to convince many women, who worry they’ll be further disadvantaged as companies seek to avoid the extra financial burden.\n\nThe high cost of raising children is also deterring parents from having more of them, especially among the country’s growing middle class.\n\nChina’s high property prices and rising education costs, especially in big cities, have frequently been cited in surveys as the top factors preventing couples from having more children.\n\nBoth sectors have been thrust into the spotlight this year, with the debt crisis surrounding property giant Evergrande and the Chinese government’s sweeping crackdown on the private tutoring industry.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/959245/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-13-january-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 13 January 2023 | The Week ...", "text": "Chinese city offers cash for kids\n\nShenzhen, a city in the south of China, has become one of the first to propose cash incentives for people to have children.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nFor generations of Chinese parents, the success of their children has long been one of their most important goals in life – and they are known to be willing to make great sacrifices for it.\n\nAnd so when a Shanghai family refused to be taken from their home into government quarantine during the city’s sixth week of lockdown, a police officer warned them with what he thought would be a powerful threat to bring them to heel – their children’s future.\n\n“If you don’t obey the orders from the city government, you will be punished, and the punishment will affect three generations in your family,” the hazmat-suited police officer said, pointing his finger at the camera in a video posted on Chinese social media.\n\n“We are the last generation, thank you,” a young man, who is not seen in the video, replied adamantly, in an apparent suggestion he is not planning to have any kids.\n\nThe video ended there, with no indication of whether the family was eventually taken away. But it spread like wildfire on China’s internet, resonating with many young Chinese who are fed up with the increasing pressure on them to have children – from a society and government that many say has provided them with little of the material and emotional security they need to raise a child.\n\n“I laughed at first but in the end I felt a sense of great sadness. He is resisting by giving up his reproductive rights,” said a user on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform.​\n\nCarrying on the family line has long been a filial duty in traditional Chinese culture. But in today’s China, not having children – or delaying it – has become a form of soft resistance and silent protest against what many see as the disappointing reality they live in, with deep-rooted structural problems stemming from a system that they have little power to change.\n\n“It is a tragic expression of despair of the deepest kind,” Zhang Xuezhong, a human rights lawyer and former law professor in Shanghai, wrote on Twitter about the video.\n\n“We’ve been robbed of a future that is worth looking forward to. It is arguably the strongest denunciation a young man can make of the era he lives in.”\n\nOver the past decade, an increasing number of Chinese millennials have delayed – or outright rejected – marriage and childbirth, as they confront high work pressure, skyrocketing property prices, rising education costs and discrimination against mothers in the workplace.\n\nLast year, just 7.6 million Chinese couples registered for marriage – a 44% drop from 2013 and the lowest in 36 years. At the same time, the country’s birthrate dropped to 7.5 births per 1,000 people, a record low since the founding of Communist China, with nine provinces and regions registering negative population growth.\n\nThe Chinese government is worried. For decades, it had strictly enforced a one-child policy that forced millions of women to abort pregnancies deemed illegal by the state. But as China’s birthrate plummeted, demographers warned of a looming population crisis.\n\nBeijing scrapped the one-child policy in 2016 and relaxed it further last year to allow couples to have three children, with local governments churning out a flurry of propaganda slogans and financial incentives to encourage more births – but the birthrate has continued to nosedive.\n\nSome officials and policy advisers have appeared tone-deaf to young people’s demands. Last month, a law professor and delegate to the Jinzhou municipal People’s Congress in Hubei province suggested that in order to promote marriage and childbirth, the media should reduce or avoid reporting on “independent women” and the “double-income-no-kids (DINK) lifestyle,” because they are not in line with the country’s “mainstream values.” The suggestion drew a backlash online.\n\nAs the pandemic drags on, the sense of disenchantment among many of the country’s younger generation has only grown.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I want to die': Video shows scenes of desperation from Shanghai's lockdown 03:41 - Source: CNN\n\nThe increasingly frequent and stringent lockdowns – and the chaos and tragedies that arose from them – have made citizens realize how fragile their rights are in the face of a state apparatus that brooks no dissent and a callous bureaucracy trained to take orders from above with little flexibility.\n\nThat is especially so in Shanghai, which is reeling from seven weeks of stringent lockdown. In the country’s wealthiest and most glamorous city, residents have been subject to widespread food shortages, lack of medical care and forced quarantine in spartan makeshift facilities. Authorities initially separated young children from their parents in isolation – and only reversed course after a public outcry.\n\nThe mounting frustration and anger erupted on Chinese social media – and in some cases, censors struggled to keep up. Some residents protested from their windows, banging pots and pans and shouting in frustration. Others clashed with police and health workers in the streets – something rarely seen in a country where dissent is routinely suppressed.\n\nOver the past week, local officials forced residents to hand over their keys after they were taken away to quarantine, so that health workers could go in and soak their personal belongings in disinfectant – with little scientific justification for their actions or regard for private property rights.\n\nFor many residents, that was the last straw. Even their homes – their private space and last refuge – could not be spared the zealous enforcement of the government’s zero-Covid policy. Some say their lives have become dispensable in the pursuit of what officials deem the “greater good,” with residents left powerless to protect their loved ones.\n\nTo many young people, the crisis unfolding in Shanghai is setting off alarm bells. If even China’s most developed city with the largest middle-class population, the supposedly most open-minded bureaucrats and the most cosmopolitan culture could not be spared such authoritarian treatment, will other cities fare any better?\n\n“Who is willing to have children when things have come to this? Who dares to have children?” asked a user on Weibo.\n\n“Your reign ends with me. And the suffering you have caused also ends with me,” said another.\n\nThe fast-spreading anger soon attracted the attention of censors. By Thursday evening, most of the videos had been scrubbed from the Chinese internet. On Weibo, several related hashtags, from “We are the last generation” to “Last generation,” have been censored after attracting heated discussions.\n\nBut suppressing what young people want to say will not help persuade them to have children.

It is a 6.1% decrease from the previous year and the eighth consecutive year marriage rates have fallen.\n\nAt the same time, the average age of newlyweds is inching up, with nearly half of those married last year age 30 and above.\n\nThe figures reflect a trend that is increasingly a cause for concern among officials in the world’s most populous nation, home to 1.4 billion: young people, especially millennials, are increasingly choosing not to get married or have children – and even when they do, they tend to do so later in life.\n\nExperts say the knock-on effect on what is already a shrinking workforce could have a severe impact on the country’s economy and social stability.\n\nIn just six years, the number of Chinese people getting married for the first time fell by 41%, from 23.8 million in 2013 to 13.9 million in 2019, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nThe decline is partly due to decades of policies designed to limit China’s population growth, which mean there are fewer young people of marriageable age, according to Chinese officials and sociologists.\n\nBut it’s also a result of changing attitudes to marriage, especially among young women who are becoming more educated and financially independent.\n\nFaced with widespread workplace discrimination and patriarchal traditions – such as the expectation for women to be responsible for child care and housework – some women are growing disillusioned with marriage.\n\nStatistics show both genders are delaying marriage. From 1990 to 2016, the average age for first marriages rose from 22 to 25 for Chinese women, and from 24 to 27 for Chinese men, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n\nGlobal Times also pointed to increasing work pressures for young people, who face stagnating wages, a competitive job market and rising costs of living.\n\nThe decline in marriages adds to concerns over China’s looming demographic crisis as it struggles to raise a falling birth rate.\n\nIn 2014, the country’s working-age population started to shrink for the first time in more than three decades.\n\nThe following year, the Chinese government announced an end to its one-child policy, allowing couples to have two children, then increased that to three children in 2021 – but both marriage and birth rates continued to drop.\n\nChina isn’t the only country struggling with this problem.\n\nJapan and South Korea have also faced falling birth rates and shrinking populations in recent years.\n\nGovernments in all three countries have introduced measures to encourage births – such as financial incentives, cash vouchers, housing subsidies and more child care support – with limited success.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/china/china-covid-foxconn-tibet-disney-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China is caught in a zero-Covid trap of its own making | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nIt’s been little more than a week since Chinese leader Xi Jinping began his norm-breaking third term in power with a ringing endorsement of his relentless zero-Covid policy.\n\nBut the commitment to stick with it is already fueling scenes of chaos and misery across the country.\n\nIn the northwestern city of Xining, residents spent last week pleading desperately for food as they suffered through the latest of the country’s stringent lockdowns; to the west, in Lhasa, the regional capital of Tibet, angry crowds have been protesting in the streets after more than 70 days of stay-home orders.\n\nIn the central province of Henan, migrant workers have abandoned a locked-down Foxconn factory en masse, walking for miles to escape an outbreak at China’s largest iPhone assembling site. And, in the eastern financial hub of Shanghai, things are gloomy even at Disneyland – the park abruptly shut its gates on Monday to comply with Covid prevention measures, trapping visitors inside for compulsory testing.\n\nIn many other parts of the country, lockdowns, mandatory quarantines, incessant mass testing edicts and travel restrictions continue to cripple businesses and daily life, even as the rest of the world moves on from the pandemic.\n\nA woman wearing a face mask walks past a mural depicting epidemic control workers in protective suits in Beijing, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2022. Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nRenewed zeal\n\nRather than relax Covid restrictions – as some had hoped for in the lead-up to the Communist Party’s five-yearly leadership reshuffle, Chinese authorities have ramped them up after Xi’s sweeping endorsement of the strategy.\n\n“The 20th Party Congress didn’t provide a timetable for moving away from zero-Covid. Instead it highlighted the importance of sticking to the existing approach,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n\nThe congress reinforced Xi as an unrivaled supreme leader, and saw him stack the Communist Party’s top ranks with staunch allies – including those who had loyally carried out his Covid policies.\n\n“The new political ecology also provided more incentive for local governments to impose more draconian Covid control measures,” Huang said.\n\nA renewed zeal for the policy can be seen most clearly in smaller cities. While metropolises like Beijing and Shanghai can draw on their experiences of major flareups to implement more targeted lockdown measures, smaller cities with no such know-how tend to pursue zero-Covid goals in a more aggressive and extensive manner, Huang said.\n\n‘It’s simply not working’\n\nThe repeating cycle of lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing is taking a heavy toll on the economy and society. Public patience is wearing thin, and frustrations are building.\n\nOn Monday in Baoding city, Hebei province, a father wielding a knife drove through a Covid checkpoint in a desperate bid to buy milk powder for his son. Video footage of the scene and his subsequent arrest sparked uproar online; the following day local police tried to soothe tempers by saying the man had been fined only 100 yuan ($13.75) and that his child’s “milk powder problem” had been “properly resolved.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the death of a 3-year-old in Lanzhou, Gansu province, sparked another outcry, after the child’s family said lockdown measures had delayed emergency responders. Police said later the child had stopped breathing by the time officers arrived, but did not address the family’s accusations that an ambulance had been delayed. CNN has reached out to Lanzhou authorities for comment.\n\nIn another sign of how sensitive the issue has become, Chinese stocks rallied on Wednesday following unverified social media rumors that China was forming a committee to prepare an exit from the zero-Covid policy.\n\nThose rumors were quashed, however, when the Foreign Ministry said it was “unaware” of any such plan.\n\nMeanwhile, experts say they see no signs of the Chinese government taking steps that would suggest it is rethinking its approach.\n\nChinese health officials maintain that changing tack now would risk a huge surge in infections and deaths that could overwhelm the country’s fragile health care system.\n\nBeijing has so far refused to approve for use the mRNA vaccines developed in Western countries, which have been shown to be more potent than those made and used in China. Experts say China also lacks an emergency response plan to cope with surging infections.\n\nBut Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, said such catastrophic scenarios could be avoided with proper preparation.\n\nInstead of spending vast amounts of time and resources on testing, contact tracing, quarantining and imposing lockdowns, authorities should introduce more effective vaccines and antiviral therapies and boost the vaccination rate among the elderly, Jin said.\n\nWith boosted immunity, asymptomatic or mild cases could be allowed to recover at home – freeing up space at hospitals to treat more severe cases, he said.\n\n“Using lockdown and containment measures to deal with an infectious disease with such a low mortality rate and high transmissibility is no longer appropriate. The whole world has abandoned this approach – nobody can stand the cost, it’s simply not working,” he said.\n\nFear of the virus\n\nAnother hurdle to pivoting from zero-Covid is a pervasive fear of the virus among large swaths of the public, instilled by the Chinese government to justify its harsh control measures, experts say.\n\n“Authorities have demonized Covid, exaggerating its severity and mortality rate and talking up long-Covid symptoms. Many ordinary people are still very afraid of the virus, with recovered Covid patients suffering from severe discrimination and stigmatization,” Jin said.\n\nIt was partly such fears that drove thousands of migrant workers to flee in panic from the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou, he said.\n\nVideos of people traveling on foot, dragging their luggage on roads and across fields, went viral on Chinese social media over the weekend. Zhengzhou, a city of 12 million, imposed sweeping lockdown measures last month after identifying dozens of Covid-19 cases.\n\nThe Foxconn facility has been racing to control an outbreak since mid-October, though the company has not disclosed the number of infections among its workers. On Wednesday, the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone, where the Foxconn plant is located, announced new lockdown measures.\n\nAs the Foxconn exodus thrust the Zhengzhou outbreak into the spotlight, the city’s health authorities have tried to allay public fears. On Monday, the Zhengzhou municipal health commission published a WeChat article with the headline: “Covid is not that horrible, but preventable and treatable.”\n\nHuang, the expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said misconceptions about the virus would complicate matters if China did at some point decide to move away from zero Covid.\n\n“Even if in the future, China wants to change the narrative and play down the seriousness of the disease, some people might not buy into the new narrative,” he said.\n\nAs the winter approaches, experts warn that China could be hit by a new wave of infections – and a new cycle of draconian lockdowns.\n\nChina reported 2,755 local infections for Tuesday, the highest daily tally since August.\n\n“Judging from the situation in China, there will be a major outbreak sooner or later. China has deployed tremendous efforts and paid a heavy cost to prevent that from happening, but in the end, it won’t be able to stop such a highly infectious disease from spreading,” Jin said.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns-released/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump: Key takeaways from six years of former president's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSix years of Donald Trump’s federal tax returns released on Friday show the former president paid very little in federal income taxes the first and last year of his presidency, claiming huge losses that helped limit his tax bill, among other revelations.\n\nThe returns, long shrouded in secrecy, were released to the public on Friday by the House Ways and Means Committee, the culmination of a battle over their disclosure that went to the Supreme Court. They confirm a report issued from the Joint Committee on Taxation that Trump claimed large losses before and throughout his presidency that he carried forward to reduce or practically eliminate his tax burden. For example, his returns show that he carried forward a $105 million loss in 2015 and $73 million in 2016.\n\nThe thousands of pages of documents from the former president’s personal and business federal tax returns – which spanned the years 2015 through 2020 – provide a complex web of raw data about Trump’s finances, offering up many questions about his wealth and income that could be pursued both by auditors and Trump’s political opponents.\n\nHere are key takeaways from the documents reviewed by CNN:\n\nReturns shed light on questionable tax claims\n\nTrump’s returns also show the former president made several claims that auditors may question.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation, which reviewed the returns, flagged that Trump claimed a large number of questionable items on his tax returns, including eyebrow-raising amounts of interest he claims to have received from loans to his children that the bipartisan committee said could indicate Trump was disguising gifts.\n\nThe JCT argued that an auditor should investigate the loan agreements Trump made with his children, including the interest rates. If the interest Trump claims to have charged his children was not at market rate, for example, it could be considered a gift for tax purposes, requiring him to pay a higher tax rate on the money.\n\nIn each year of his presidency, for example, Trump claimed he received exactly $18,000 in interest on a loan he said he gave his daughter Ivanka Trump and $8,715 in interest from his son Donald Trump, Jr.. In 2017 to 2019, Trump said he received exactly $24,000 from his son Eric Trump, and Eric paid him $19,605 in interest in 2020.\n\nThat raises the question of whether “the loans were bona fide arm’s length transactions, or whether the transfers were disguised gifts that could trigger gift tax and a disallowance of interest deductions by the related borrowers,” the JCT said in its report.\n\n“It’s unusual to have interest in round numbers – very rare,” said Martin Sheil, former supervisory special agent for IRS’ Criminal Investigation unit. “An auditor would want to see payments, loan agreements and interest rates.”\n\nThere are also questions about Trump’s returns listing an identical amount of company expenses and income.\n\nFor example, in 2017, Trump claimed his business DJT Aerospace LLC, which operates Trump’s personal helicopter, claimed $42,965 in income. It also claimed the exact same amount – $42,965 – in expenses. In other words, every single dollar – to the dollar – that the company earned was negated by the company’s expenses, such as payroll, fuel and other items. That left the company with zero income – and nothing to tax.\n\n“Total expenses equaling total income is a statistical impossibility,” said Shiel, who added that the figures are not evidence something illegal was done. “It just doesn’t happen.”\n\nThe JCT in its report raised several similar questions. For example, it noted IRS auditors were investigating multiple so-called large unusual questionable items on Trump’s tax returns for which the regulator wanted Trump to provide supporting evidence to back up his claims.\n\nRelease comes after years-long fight\n\nThe returns were obtained by the Democratic-run Ways and Means Committee only a few weeks ago after a protracted legal battle that lasted nearly four years. The committee voted last week to release the tax returns, but their release was delayed to redact sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers.\n\nThe release of the tax returns follows a pursuit for the documents that had typically been made public voluntarily by past US presidents. Trump and his legal team continuously sought to keep his returns secret, arguing that Congress had never wielded its legislative powers to demand a president’s tax returns, which Trump said could have far-reaching implications.\n\n“The Democrats should have never done it, the Supreme Court should have never approved it, and it’s going to lead to horrible things for so many people,” Trump said in a statement following the release.\n\n“The ‘Trump’ tax returns once again show how proudly successful I have been and how I have been able to use depreciation and various other tax deductions as an incentive for creating thousands of jobs and magnificent structures and enterprises.”\n\nOther Republicans also criticized Democrats’ efforts in pursuit of the tax returns as political, with Texas Rep. Kevin Brady – the committee’s top conservative – saying the release would amount to “a dangerous new political weapon that reaches far beyond the former president and overturns decades of privacy protections for average Americans that have existed since the Watergate reform.”\n\nDuring the committee’s closed-door meeting last week, Republicans warned that the release of Trump’s tax returns by Democrats could prompt retribution once Republicans control the House next year – like going after the taxes of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\n“I had countless people tell me of things that they were concerned with President Biden’s family dealings and how they believed that him and his family is enriched because of his political power. And they are begging for oversight and accountability on that,” said Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, according to excerpts the GOP released from the meeting. “Do we need to go down all that? Is that what you all are wishing to do?”\n\nReturns show he held foreign bank accounts while in office\n\nTrump reported having foreign bank accounts between 2015 and 2020, including a bank account in China between 2015 and 2017, his tax returns show.\n\nTrump was required to report the accounts to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The filings show that the former president maintained foreign bank accounts in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and China.\n\nThe China bank account, which was reported by The New York Times in 2020, was tied to Trump International Hotels Management’s business push in the country, Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten said at the time.\n\nThe 2020 disclosure of business dealings in China came as the Trump campaign sought to portray Biden as a “puppet” of China. Biden’s income tax returns and financial disclosures showed no business dealings or income from China.\n\nThe returns also show that Trump paid more in foreign taxes than in US federal income taxes in 2017, the first year of his presidency.\n\nIn 2017, Trump paid just $750 in US federal income taxes because of large carry-forward losses that he claimed in prior years, negating virtually all of his American tax liability. Yet Trump paid nearly $1 million in taxes to foreign countries that year.\n\nThe fact that Trump paid foreign taxes isn’t in itself surprising, but it shows how Trump’s companies and businesses interests span the globe, and how those businesses are subject to local tax laws and regulations.\n\nOn his tax return, Trump listed business income, taxes, expenses or other notable financial items in Azerbaijan, Panama, Canada, India, Qatar, South Korea, the United Kingdom, China, the Dominican Republic, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, Grenada, US territory Puerto Rico, Georgia, Israel, Brazil, St. Maarten, Mexico, Indonesia, Ireland, Turkey, and St. Vincent.\n\nTrump claimed no charitable deductions in 2020\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump pledged he would donate the entirety of his $400,000 salary to charity each year. He frequently boasted about donating parts of his quarterly paycheck to various government agencies.\n\n“While the press doesn’t like writing about it, nor do I need them to, I donate my yearly Presidential salary of $400,000.00 to different agencies throughout the year,” Trump tweeted in March 2019.\n\nIf he donated his 2020 salary, he didn’t claim it on his taxes. Among the six years of tax returns the House Ways and Means Committee released, 2020 was the sole year in which Trump listed no donations to charity.\n\nTrump’s finances took a sizable hit in 2020, probably as a result of the pandemic and the lack of demand for vacations and lodging in his hotels. Trump reported large donations to charity in 2018 and 2019, helping reduce the amount he owed on millions of dollars in income he reported in those years.\n\nBut Trump posted a massive $4.8 million adjusted loss in 2020, a year, which alone wiped out his federal income tax obligation. Trump paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2020.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation raised questions about the accuracy of some enormous charitable deductions Trump claimed in previous years’ tax returns, including large and unsubstantiated cash gifts. Trump also claimed a $21.1 million deduction in 2015 for donating 158 acres of his 212-acre property called Seven Springs in North Castle, New York. That donation, which was made to a land trust, is a focus of the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal investigation of the Trump Organization’s finances.\n\nTrump’s own 2017 tax law appears to have reduced the amount he was able to deduct from tax bill\n\nTrump claimed that the 2017 Republican tax plan he championed and signed would cost him and his family “a fortune.” It’s not clear that it did, but it does appear to have limited the amount that he could claim in one part of his complex tax return.\n\nThe 2017 tax law capped the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, at $10,000 a year. In previous years, tax filers were allowed to deduct more of their SALT payments. Although the law was passed in 2017, it didn’t apply until the 2018 tax year.\n\nIn 2018, Trump listed $10.5 million in state and local taxes, but could deduct just $10,000 of that from his taxes. In 2019, Trump paid $8.4 million in SALT but was capped at $10,000. And in 2020, Trump said he paid $8.5 million in SALT but claimed the maximum allowable $10,000.\n\nBy comparison, in 2016 and 2017, Trump was able to deduct significantly more from state and local taxes. For example, in 2016 and 2017, he deducted $5.2 million each year in SALT payments.\n\nSome Democrats criticized the 2017 tax law’s SALT cap for taking aim at residents in the Northeast and the West who have some of the highest property taxes in the country. The Tax Foundation found that property tax deductions capped in 2017 had previously accounted for about a third of all state and local tax deductions. But Trump defended the provision, saying the cap was necessary even if it would hurt his own finances.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the SALT cap hurt Trump, however. Although that particular deduction was capped, Trump claimed many other deductions that limited the amount of federal income taxes he had to pay.\n\nPresidential audits\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the IRS and writing tax policy, requested the returns under the authority of section 6103 of the US tax code. Their report focused primarily on whether Trump’s tax returns during his time in office were properly audited under the IRS’ mandatory audit program for US presidents.\n\nThe committee found that the IRS opened only one “mandatory” audit during Trump’s term – for his 2016 tax return. And that didn’t take place until the fall of 2019, after Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sent a letter asking the IRS for Trump’s returns and tax information. The report characterizes the presidential audit program as “dormant.”\n\n“The research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was nonexistent,” Neal said last week following the committee vote.\n\nRepublicans on the committee argued that Democrats acknowledged it was “not necessary to publicly release the private tax information to change requirements on the presidential audit program.”\n\nA Republican dissent issued Friday warned that, “Democrats’ dangerous precedent will lead the American public to demand other people’s tax returns to be released.”\n\nLast week, the House passed a bill that would reform the presidential audit process in a largely symbolic vote before Republicans take the majority in the new Congress. The legislation is not expected to be taken up by the Senate before the new Congress is sworn in.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["David Goldman Jeremy Herb Jeanne Sahadi Maegan Vazquez", "David Goldman", "Jeremy Herb", "Jeanne Sahadi", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/business/germany-china-olaf-scholz-visit-trade/index.html", "title": "Germany's leader and top CEOs are visiting Beijing.

They were expected to meet with Chinese companies behind closed doors.\n\nThe group entered China without undergoing a mandatory seven-day hotel quarantine standard for most arrivals. Images showed hazmat-clad medical workers greeting Scholz’s jet at Beijing’s Capital International Airport to test the official delegation for Covid-19 upon their arrival.\n\nDuring the Friday morning meeting between the two leaders, Xi called for Germany and China to work together amid a “complex and volatile” international situation, and said the visit would “enhance mutual understanding and trust, deepen pragmatic cooperation in various fields and plan for the next phase of Sino-German relations,” according to a readout from state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference with Premier Li, Scholz said that Germany’s economic relationship with China had recently become “more difficult” because Beijing was making access to some of its markets more difficult.\n\n“We are seeing discussions in China tending more towards autonomy and less economic ties. And these views are ones that need discussing,” Scholz said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrives at Beijing Capital International Airport on November 4, 2022. Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nScholz’s visit — the first by a G7 leader to China in roughly three years — comes as Germany slides towards recession. But it has fired up concerns that the interests of Europe’s biggest economy are still too closely tied to those of Beijing.\n\nSince Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine this year, Germany has been forced to ditch its long dependence on Russian energy. Beijing has declared its friendship with Moscow has “no limits,” while China’s relations with the United States are deteriorating.\n\nNow, some in Scholz’s coalition government are growing nervous about Germany’s ties with China.\n\nThe tension was highlighted recently by a fierce debate over a bid by Chinese state shipping giant Cosco to buy a 35% stake in the operator of one of the four terminals at the port of Hamburg. Under pressure from some members of the government, the size of the investment was limited to 24.9%.\n\nThe potential deal has raised concerns in Germany that closer ties with China will leave critical infrastructure exposed to political pressure from Beijing, and disproportionately benefit Chinese companies.\n\nBut Germany is hardly in a position to rock the boat with Beijing as it grapples with the challenge of reviving its struggling economy. Its consumers and companies have borne the brunt of Europe’s energy crisis, and a deep recession is looming.\n\nIf the European Union and Germany were to decouple from China, it would lead to “large GDP losses” for the German economy, Lisandra Flach, director of the ifo Center for International Economics, told CNN Business.\n\nThe Kiel Institute for the World Economy estimates that a major reduction in trade between the European Union and China would shave 1% off of Germany’s GDP.\n\nGermany needs to shore up its export markets as ties with Russia, once its main supplier of natural gas, continue to unravel.\n\nWhen it comes to China, Germany won’t want to “lose also this market, this economic partner,” said Rafal Ulatowski, an assistant professor of political science and international studies at the University of Warsaw.\n\n“They [will] try to keep these relations as long as it’s possible.”\n\nPressure on Berlin\n\nAs Western countries have imposed swingeing economic sanctions on Russia, China has publicly maintained its “neutrality” in the war while ramping up its trade with Moscow.\n\nThat has triggered a backlash in Europe, where some companies are already becoming wary of doing business in China because of its stringent “zero Covid” restrictions.\n\nPressure on Berlin is also mounting over China’s human rights record. In an open letter Wednesday, a coalition of 70 civil rights groups urged Scholz to “rethink” his trip to Beijing.\n\n“The invitation of a German trade delegation to join your visit will be viewed as an indication that Germany is ready to deepen trade and economic links, at the cost of human rights and international law,” they wrote in the memo, published by the World Uyghur Congress. Based in Germany, the organization is run by Uyghurs raising awareness of allegations of genocide in China’s Xinjiang region.\n\nIt suggested Berlin was “loosening economic dependence on one authoritarian power, only to deepen economic dependence on another.”\n\nIn an op-ed published in a German newspaper on Wednesday, Scholz said he would use his visit to “address difficult issues,” including “respect for civil and political liberties and the rights of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province.”\n\nA spokesperson for the German government addressed wider criticism last week, saying at a press conference that it had no intention of “decoupling” from its most important trading partner.\n\n“[The chancellor] has basically said again and again that he is not a friend of decoupling, or turning away, from China. But he also says: diversify and minimize risk,” the spokesperson said.\n\nLast year, China was Germany’s biggest trading partner for the sixth year in a row, with the value of trade up over 15% from 2020, according to official statistics Chinese trade with Germany was worth a combined €245 billion ($242 billion) in 2021.\n\nA new flashpoint\n\nStill, the furor surrounding the Hamburg port deal is a reminder of the tradeoffs Germany has to confront if it wants to maintain close ties with such a vital export market and supplier.\n\nA spokesperson for Hamburger Hafen und Logistik (HHLA), the company operating the port terminal, told CNN Business on Thursday that it was still negotiating the deal with Cosco.\n\nFlach, of the ifo Center for International Economics, said the deal warranted scrutiny because “there is no reciprocity: Germany cannot invest in Chinese ports, for instance.”\n\nA container ship from Cosco Shipping moored at the Tollerort Container Terminal owned by HHLA, in the harbor of Hamburg, Germany on Oct. 26. Axel Heimken/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHowever, it is easy to overstate the impact of the potential agreement, said Alexander-Nikolai Sandkamp, assistant professor of economics at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\n\n“We’re not talking about a 25% stake in the Hamburg harbor, or even the operator of the harbor, but a 25% stake in the operator of a terminal,” he told CNN Business.\n\nJürgen Matthes, head of global and regional markets at the German Economic Institute, told CNN Business that critics were no longer simply weighing the business benefits of Chinese investment in the country.\n\n“Politics and economics have to be looked at together and cannot be taken separately any longer,” he said. “When geopolitics comes into play, the view of China has very much declined and become much more negative.”\n\nChina’s recent treatment of Lithuania has also deepened concerns that Beijing “does not hesitate to simply break trade rules,” Matthes added. The small, Eastern European nation claimed last year that Beijing had erected trade barriers in retaliation for its support for Taiwan.\n\nChina has defended its downgrading of relations with Lithuania, saying it is acting in response to the European nation undermining its “sovereignty and territorial integrity.” This year, after a Lithuanian official visited Taiwan, Beijing also announced sanctions against her and vowed to “suspend all forms of exchange” with her ministry.\n\nWhat’s on the table\n\nAs the German delegation touched down on Friday, they were faced with another issue, which has become the single biggest headache for companies across China.\n\n“The biggest challenge for German businesses remains China’s zero-Covid policy,” said Maximilian Butek of the German Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\n“The restrictions are suffocating economic growth and heavily impact China’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment,” he told CNN Business.\n\nAn aerial view of the urban landscape in Shanghai on Sept. 25. The city underwent a months-long Covid lockdown earlier this year.

While about 12% of total imports came from China last year, the country was responsible for 80% of imported laptops and 70% of mobile phones, Sandkamp said.\n\nThe automobile, chemical and electrical industries are also reliant on Chinese trade.\n\n“If we were to stop trading with China, we would run into trouble,” Sandkamp added.\n\nChina made up 40% of Volkswagen’s worldwide deliveries in the first three quarters of this year, and it’s also the top market for other automakers such as Mercedes.\n\nWariness among some German officials over the country’s closeness with China could filter into a more restrictive trade policy, though economic cooperation is still in both parties’ interests.\n\nIn September, Germany’s economy minister Robert Habeck told Reuters that the government was working on a new trade policy with China to reduce dependence on Chinese raw materials, batteries and semiconductors.\n\nUnidentified sources also told the news agency that the ministry was weighing new rules that would make business with China less attractive. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.\n\nBut “despite all odds and challenges, China remains unrivaled in terms of market size and market growth opportunities for many German companies,” said Butek, of the German Chamber.\n\nHe predicted that “the large majority will stay committed to the Chinese market and is expecting to expand their business.”\n\nCompanies appear to be toeing that line. Last week, BASF CEO Martin Brudermüller was quoted in Chinese state media as saying that Germans should “step away from China-bashing and look at ourselves a bit self-critically.”\n\n“We benefit from China’s policies of widening market access,” he said at a company event, according to state-run news agency Xinhua, pointing to the construction of a BASF chemical engineering site in southern China.\n\n— CNN’s Simone McCarthy, Chris Stern, Lauren Kent, Nadine Schmidt, Claudia Otto and Arnaud Siad contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh Anna Cooban", "Michelle Toh", "Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/asia/japan-tax-alcohol-competition-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Japan wants young people to drink more alcohol. It's just not sure ...", "text": "Tokyo CNN —\n\nThe Japanese government has been hit in the pocket by an unusual problem – its young people aren’t drinking enough.\n\nSince the pandemic began, bars and other premises selling alcohol have been hit hard by Covid-19 restrictions, causing sales – and liquor tax revenues – to plummet in the world’s third-largest economy.\n\nThe government’s solution? Launch a contest to find new ways to encourage young people to drink more.\n\nThe “Sake Viva!” campaign, overseen by the National Tax Agency, invites participants to submit ideas on how to “stimulate demand among young people” for alcohol through new services, promotional methods, products, designs and even sales techniques using artificial intelligence or the metaverse, according to the official competition website.\n\n“The domestic alcoholic beverage market is shrinking due to demographic changes such as the declining birthrate and aging population, and lifestyle changes due to the impact of Covid-19,” said the website, adding that the competition aimed to “appeal to the younger generation … and to revitalize the industry.”\n\nThe contest includes promotional ideas for all types of Japanese alcohol, with applications open until September 9. Finalists will be invited to an expert consultation in October, before a final tournament in November in Tokyo. The winner will receive support for their plan to be commercialized, according to the tax office.\n\nBut not everyone is on board, with the competition and tax agency receiving criticism from some people online.\n\n“Are you kidding me?” one Twitter user wrote. “Staying away from alcohol is a good thing!”\n\nOthers pointed out that it seemed inappropriate for a government agency to encourage young people to drink, and it appeared the campaign had not considered health risks or sensitivity toward people dealing with alcoholism.\n\nJapan’s Health Ministry has in the past warned of the dangers of excessive drinking. In a post on its website last year, it called excessive alcohol consumption a “major social problem” that persisted despite a recent slowdown in consumption. And it urged people with unhealthy drinking habits to “reconsider” their relationship with alcohol.\n\nA ministry spokesperson declined to comment on the tax agency’s competition when contacted by CNN.\n\nDeclining sales\n\nJapan, along with several other countries in Asia, maintained tough restrictions throughout much of the pandemic, closing public spaces and reducing business hours for restaurants.\n\nIzakayas – Japan’s version of a pub or tavern – were particularly hard hit, with the latest available figures showing sales halved from 2019 to 2020, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.\n\nWith fewer opportunities to drink in public, the rate of “household consumption” – drinking at home – “increased significantly,” the ministry said.\n\nBut young adults have stood out as the exception. About 30% of people in their 40s to 60s drink regularly, meaning three days or more per week, the ministry said – compared to just 7.8% of people in their 20s.\n\n“In this way, the decline in drinking habits year by year is thought to be having an effect on the shrinking of the domestic market,” the ministry said.\n\nIn a 2021 report, the tax agency said duties on liquor had been a major revenue source for the government for centuries, but had declined in recent decades. Japan received 1.1 trillion yen ($8.1 billion) in alcohol tax in 2021 – 1.7% of overall tax revenue, compared to 3% in 2011, and 5% in 1980.\n\nJapan lifted its state of emergency in October 2021, allowing restaurants to sell alcohol again and stay open later – but restrictions in some parts of the country remained in place until March this year.\n\nThe country’s recovery since then has been slower than expected, hindered by rising inflation, the economic impact of the war in Ukraine, and recent surges in Covid cases that have led to prolonged restrictions.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Junko Ogura", "Jessie Yeung", "Junko Ogura"], "publish_date": "2022/08/18"}]}
