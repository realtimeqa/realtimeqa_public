But as it tracked inland, extreme rainfall became the most destructive aspect of the storm for central Florida.\n\nRadar estimates suggest well over 12 inches of rain fell in just 12 to 24 hours in a wide swath from Port Charlotte to Orlando. In some of the hardest-hit locations, Hurricane Ian produced 1-in-1,000-year rainfall, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nLive updates: Rescuers pull victims from roofs\n\nA 1,000-year rainfall event is one that is so intense it’s only seen on average once every 1,000 years – under normal circumstances. But extreme rainfall is becoming more common as the climate crisis pushes temperatures higher. Warmer air can hold more moisture, which loads the dice in favor of historic rainfall.\n\nCNN Weather\n\nLocations in Florida that experienced a 1,000-year rainfall event from Ian:\n\nPlacida – just north of where the hurricane’s eye made landfall – received more than 15 inches of rain over the course of 12 hours on Wednesday. This exceeds the city’s 1-in-1,000-year rain event of 14.0 inches.\n\nLake Wales, which is east of Tampa in central Florida, reported nearly 17 inches of rain within 24 hours, exceeding its 1,000-year rain event of 16.8 inches.\n\nSeveral other locations likely experienced 1,000-year flood events based on radar estimates, including Winter Park (12 inches in 12 hours); North Port (14 inches in 12 hours); and Myakka City (14 inches in 12 hours).\n\n10% wetter\n\nHurricane Ian’s rainfall was at least 10% wetter because of climate change, according to a rapid analysis released Thursday by scientists at Stony Brook University and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nThe analysis used the same methodology as a recent peer-reviewed study that looked at the influence of climate change on the 2020 hurricane season.\n\nMichael Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley who ran the analysis, noted that the physical relationship between air temperature and water vapor would suggest that Hurricane Ian’s rainfall should have only been around 5% higher due to climate warming.\n\n“This means that the storms are more efficient at precipitating the available moisture,” Wehner said in a statement. He also cautioned that their result is a “conservative estimate.”\n\n“Climate change didn’t cause the storm but it did cause it to be wetter,” Wehner said.\n\nStronger storms\n\nScientists are very confident that climate change is increasing rainfall rates – how hard the rain is falling – and the amount of rain a storm can produce.\n\nIt’s also making storms stronger and pushing them to intensify faster. Hurricane Ian strengthened rapidly Wednesday morning as it approached Florida. The storm’s maximum wind speed increased by 35 mph in less than three hours, going from a Category 3 to a strong Category 4 in the process.\n\nDespite being squarely in hurricane territory, major hurricanes – Category 3 or stronger – are uncommon for this part of Florida. When Hurricane Ian made landfall Wednesday with maximum winds of 150 mph, it tied 2004’s Hurricane Charley as the strongest storm to make landfall on the west coast of the Florida Peninsula.\n\nThis rapid intensification – a hurricane’s winds strengthening rapidly over a short amount of time – is something scientists say is historically rare but is becoming more likely as ocean temperatures increase, giving hurricanes more fuel to strengthen.\n\n“Climate change is increasing both the maximum intensity that these storms can achieve, and the rate of intensification that can bring them to this maximum,” Jim Kossin, a senior scientist at the Climate Service, previously told CNN. Kossin noted that Hurricane Ian, which rapidly intensified before hitting Cuba and before landfall in Florida, was a good example “of very rapid intensification, and there have been many others recently.”\n\nA broken section of road and destroyed houses are seen in Matlacha, Florida, on Saturday, October 1.

Andrew West/USA Today Network In pictures: Hurricane Ian slams the Southeast Prev Next\n\nHigher storm surge\n\nStorm surge is generated mainly by the hurricane’s strong winds, which blow from the ocean toward land and push huge amounts of water beyond the coast.\n\nAnd although hurricanes are rated based on their wind speeds, storm surge is their most deadly aspect. Around 90% of hurricane-related deaths are water-related, according to the National Hurricane Center, and around 50% are caused by storm surges.\n\nIn the region south of Hurricane Ian’s eye – including the Ft. Myers and Naples areas – storm surge swelled to record levels. In Naples, water levels climbed 2 feet above record level early Wednesday afternoon before the gauge stopped working.\n\nCollier County Commissioner Rick Locastro told CNN that his county, which includes Marco Island and Naples, was hit hard by storm surge, calling Hurricane Ian “a totally different hurricane.”\n\n“We survived Irma and other hurricanes, which were more about the wind and yes, always water. But storm surge is something that we have not seen here to this intensity ever,” Locastro said. “We experienced every inch of that storm surge, in some areas well over 12 feet.”\n\nA sea level rise of only a couple of inches can make a dramatic difference in how far inland a hurricane’s surge can travel. Since 1880 – before the industrial revolution and widespread burning of fossil fuels – global sea level has risen on average 8 to 9 inches. Two-thirds of that increase has occurred in just the last two and a half decades, driven mainly by the rapid melting of the world’s ice sheets and glaciers.", "authors": ["Angela Fritz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/weather/christmas-arctic-winter-storm-wednesday-wxn/index.html", "title": "Nearly every state to be impacted by a 'once in a generation' winter ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA major winter storm and cold blast will impact nearly every state and bring what the National Weather Service is calling a “once in a generation type event” that will cripple travel on some of the busiest travel days of the year.\n\nThe strengthening storm will bring more than a foot of snow and possible blizzard conditions to the Midwest, as the weather service warns of “life-threatening” wind chills for millions.\n\nMore than 90 million people are under winter weather alerts and more than 87 million are under wind chill alerts. The alerts stretch across 37 states, dipping as far south as the Texas/Mexico border.\n\nThe number of people under winter alerts and wind chill alerts has grown to over 100 million people, or roughly a third of the US population, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe cold will stick around for Christmas weekend, making this the coldest Christmas in roughly 40 years for portions of the Plains and Midwest.\n\nLIVE UPDATES ON THE WINTER STORM FOR THURSDAY\n\nStorm timeline:\n\nWednesday: The storm will strengthen over the Northern Plains through the day as heavy snow falls across much of the Rockies, the Northern Plains and into the Midwest. Slick roads will lead to travel headaches and airport delays through places like Minneapolis, Omaha and Rapid City.\n\nThis system will bring 5 to 9 inches of light fluffy snow across the region, with “the highest amounts just north and west of the Twin Cities,” said the weather service office in Twin Cities. While snow will steadily fall across the region, the high winds won’t kick in until Thursday.\n\nDenver will go from a high of 47 on Wednesday to 10 degrees below zero by daybreak Thursday. That would be the city’s coldest day in 32 years, according to the weather service. Cheyenne, Wyoming, recently dropped 32 degrees in just eight minutes.\n\nTemperatures in the Denver metro area will drop drastically once the front passes in the next couple of hours.\n\nBy sunrise, the temperature is expected to be around 10 degrees below zero and gusty north winds will create a wind chill of around minus 25. The high-temperature tomorrow will likely not make it above zero degrees.\n\nA wind chill warning is in effect as well as a winter weather advisory. Several inches of snow will also make for difficult travel late this afternoon through early Thursday.\n\nThursday: Thursday will be the most difficult day for travel. The storm will be hitting the Midwest extremely hard with heavy snow and strong winds. Western Minnesota will face not only blizzard conditions, but potentially deadly wind chills Thursday and Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions are expected during that time with travel becoming very difficult or impossible,” said the weather service. “This event could be life-threatening if you are stranded with wind chills in the 30 below to 45 below zero range.”\n\nChicago could also face blizzard conditions with winds gusting as high as 50 mph, with 2 to 4 inches of snow forecast.\n\n“Overall, concern continues to increase in the quick development of dangerous conditions Thursday afternoon with potentially significant impacts to the evening peak travel window,” warned the weather service office in Chicago.\n\nSnowfall early Wednesday in Glasgow, Montana. Angel Enriquez\n\nAdditionally, strong winds may knock out power lines in the Midwest, especially in areas where heavy snow fell last week and is already weighing down tree branches. This will leave millions finding a way to stay warm as temperatures plummet to well below freezing.\n\nSnow could fall as far south as Jackson, Mississippi, Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee and even Birmingham, Alabama, on Thursday. Little to no accumulation is expected for most of the southern cities, however, Nashville could pick up about an inch of snow.\n\nIn anticipation of what will be a week of travel nightmares, United, American, Delta, Southwest and Jet Blue have issued travel waivers for dozens of airports across the country from the South to the Northeast, because in addition to snow covering roadways, low visibility could make air travel dangerous.\n\nAt least 1,000 flights had been canceled across the US, according to the flight tracking site Flightaware on Wednesday evening.\n\nChicago’s O’Hare International Airport leads the way, followed by Denver International and Chicago’s Midway International.\n\nCancellations at those airports could have a wider impact because they are busy hubs where travelers often change planes in order to reach other destinations. Thursday is expected to be the busiest pre-Christmas day for travel.\n\nFriday: The storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone” Thursday evening into Friday. A bomb cyclone is when a storm rapidly intensifies – and drops 24 millibars (a term used to measure atmospheric pressure) in 24 hours.\n\nThe storm is expected to reach the pressure equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane as it reaches the Great Lakes, with the weather service describing the strength of the low a “once-in-a-generation” event.\n\n“This is a case in which snow totals may not tell the whole story. Even small snow amounts, when combined with very strong wind gusts and plummeting temperatures, can cause poor visibility and slick spots on roads. The sudden arrival of these conditions can increase the danger,” the weather service explained.\n\nThe storm will be over the Great Lakes on Friday and continuing to produce heavy snow across much of the Midwest. Portions of Michigan could pick up more than a foot of snow by Friday, making travel impossible at times.\n\nBlizzard warnings are in effect for parts of the Dakotas, Montana, Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana and Michigan – where travel conditions will become difficult to impossible as the storm peaks Thursday into Friday. Major cities like Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Twin Cities and Detroit are under winter storm warnings for heavy snow and near blizzard conditions.\n\nHeavy rain will also blanket much of the I-95 corridor, adding to the travel troubles and lengthy airport delays.\n\nEven in places where the snow has ended, strong winds will continue to blow 30 to 40 mph across much of the Midwest and into the Northeast.\n\nFriday night into Saturday morning, New England will get a quick shot of snow and windy conditions.\n\nTravelers check in at Minneapolis' St. Paul Airport, Wednesday, December 21, 2022. Abbie Parr/AP\n\nLife-threatening cold\n\nPlaces that will escape the snow, won’t escape the cold. Areas from eastern Montana through the Dakotas will experience the coldest air beginning Thursday morning. Current wind chills across Montana and the Dakotas are as cold as 50 to 60 degrees below zero and will fall even further after dark Wednesday.\n\nRapid City will feel like 45 degrees below zero on Thursday morning. By Friday morning, Chicago’s wind chill will bottom out at 30 degrees below zero.\n\n“The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5 minutes,” warned the weather service office in Bismarck.\n\nEven the South will be dangerously cold. Nashville and Atlanta’s wind chill will drop to minus 11 on Saturday morning and Birmingham will feel like minus 5.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday declared a state of emergency due to the upcoming “historic low temperatures” across the state, with near zero or negative digit wind chills by midday on Friday.\n\nGreg Behrens, of Des Moines, Iowa, tries to stay warm as he makes his way on a snow-covered sidewalk, Wednesday, December 21, 2022, in Des Moines, Iowa. Charlie Neibergall/AP\n\nThe declaration will help “ensure that essential supplies, especially propane can be delivered for both commercial and residential needs,” the governor told reporters.\n\n“Communities across the state are about to see temperatures that they haven’t experienced in a decade or more,” Kemp said.\n\nThe state will be pretreating roads and bridges in anticipation of the inclement weather and officials urged residents to avoid travel if possible.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear also declared a state of emergency, with wind gusts expected to reach 40 to 50 mph on Friday and minus 10 to minus 26 degrees wind chills expected on Saturday. Beshear asked residents to stay off roads and to have a backup heat source.\n\nJackson and Birmingham will both spend more than 80 hours below freezing between Friday and Monday. Houston could sit below freezing for 46 hours between Thursday and Saturday.\n\nThe cold temperatures will stay through Christmas weekend, before finally moderating next week.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Jennifer Gray", "Aya Elamroussi", "Jennifer Gray"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/us/fema-kentucky-flood-insurance-climate-change-invs/index.html", "title": "Kentucky disaster shows how US is ill-prepared and under-insured ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Bob and Debbie Smith signed up for flood insurance years ago, they never expected the storm that transformed the little river next to their backyard into a raging, muddy torrent. They never imagined that they and their cat would need to be rescued from their front porch by a neighbor with a boat as the floodwater reached up to their chests.\n\nBut after the historic floods that devastated Eastern Kentucky last month, that insurance is now a “game-changer,” Bob Smith said. While the more than $32,000 they’re set to receive won’t make up for the renovations the couple did on their now-ruined mobile home in Letcher County, “it’s enough to give me hope,” he said. “Other people, they don’t know what they’re going to do.”\n\nThe Smiths are in an extreme minority: Only about 1% of properties in the hardest-hit counties of the state have federal flood insurance, government records show, and general homeowners insurance policies don’t cover flood damage. That means most of their neighbors are struggling to find funds to rebuild from the deluge that killed 38 people in a rural corner of the state.\n\nIn this aerial photo, mobile homes are seen washed off their foundations on Saturday, July 30, 2022, after historic rains during the week flooded many areas of Kentucky. Michael Clevenger/AP\n\nThe destruction in Eastern Kentucky is a warning for other communities around the US that once-unthinkable floods are becoming more common due to climate change. Federal flood zone maps used by the insurance industry substantially underestimate the risk in many parts of the country, and the nation as a whole is underprepared for the financial ruin left in the wake of powerful floods, experts say.\n\nThe Kentucky communities suffering from the damage – coal mining towns tucked into the bends of winding river valleys – are especially ill-equipped. They include some of the poorest counties in the US, with little funding for rebuilding or flood resilience projects.\n\n“A lot of these places have never flooded,” Donald Mobelini, the mayor of Hazard, Kentucky, told CNN. “These people will not have flood insurance. So therefore, if they lose their home, it’s a total loss. There’s not going to be an insurance check coming to help that.”\n\nIn some of the flooded counties, only a few dozen federal flood insurance policies were in effect a month before the storm, according to Federal Emergency Management Association records. Residents without insurance could be eligible for temporary rental housing assistance from FEMA and potentially other aid approved by Congress, but experts said those payments will likely only cover a small fraction of the damages.\n\nRoy Wright, the former head of the National Flood Insurance Program, which is run by FEMA, said that the level of flood insurance in the area was “nowhere near the size and scope you’d hope to see given the risk of flooding.”\n\n“The realities are very harsh for a community like this,” he said.\n\n‘No home is completely safe’\n\nSo far, the flood insurance program has paid out more than $1.4 million to insured Kentucky households affected by the flooding, according to FEMA – likely a tiny fraction of the total damage costs in the region.\n\n“No home is completely safe from potential flooding,” FEMA official Paul Huang said in a statement. “With flood insurance, survivors have peace of mind knowing they are covered in the event of a major disaster.”\n\nSome of the Kentucky families who suffered damages have been especially shocked because their homes or businesses weren’t in a FEMA-designated flood zone, so they never thought they would need flood insurance.\n\nThe Kentucky Mist Distillery, which operates out of a nearly 100-year-old building in Whitesburg’s tiny downtown, was swamped with several feet of water during the floods, leaving its gleaming steel tanks caked with mud. Colin Fultz, the distillery’s owner, estimated that the inundation caused about $150,000 in damage, between ruined equipment and lost moonshine and vodka.\n\n“We weren’t in the flood zone, so we thought we were safe,” Fultz said. “I never would have dreamed it would get that high.”\n\nA view of a flooded street in front of the Kentucky Mist Distillery, following a day of heavy rain, in Whitesburg, Kentucky, on July 28, 2022. Amber Elise Carter/Reuters\n\nA growing body of research has found that the maps that people like Fultz rely on underestimate the risk of flooding, especially as climate change gets worse.\n\nAccording to FEMA’s flood maps, about 12% of the properties in three of the hardest-hit Kentucky counties are in what the agency calls a “Special Flood Hazard Area” – the zone that would be inundated during a 1-in-100-year flood event. When homeowners get mortgages in the area, they’re required to purchase flood insurance.\n\nBut a more accurate flooding model that takes climate change into account puts 51% of properties in those counties at risk during that kind of flood, according to estimates by First Street Foundation, a climate research nonprofit.\n\nThe difference is in part because FEMA’s maps don’t fully account for the impact of heavy rainfall on small rivers and creeks like those that cover the landscape of Eastern Kentucky, according to Jeremy Porter, First Street’s chief research officer.\n\nAnd Kentucky isn’t unique: Nationally, almost 6 million properties are at risk of damage during a 1-in-100-year flood even though they aren’t in the flood zone, First Street found.\n\n“There’s a huge discrepancy between the number of people that are at risk and the people who know they’re at risk,” Porter said.\n\nIn a statement, a FEMA spokesperson said the agency’s maps use the best available technology and that First Street’s analysis may overstate flood risk. FEMA’s flood maps reflect past flooding conditions, not future risk, the spokesperson said.\n\nOther research has also raised questions about the extent of flood risk. A North Carolina State University study published in February found that almost 85% of the flood damage events reported to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration between December 2006 and May 2020 took place outside FEMA’s flood risk zone.\n\n“It’s expensive and time-consuming to update our flood maps,” said Georgina Sanchez, a researcher at NC State and one of the study’s authors. “Many of the maps are quite old … and are not accounting for the changes we’re currently experiencing due to climate change.”\n\nIn Kentucky, FEMA flood maps for three of the hardest-hit counties – Breathitt, Clay and Perry – haven’t been updated in more than 14 years, according to federal records.\n\nDustin Elam, 31, stands in his children's former bedroom after his home was destroyed by flooding in Breathitt County, Kentucky. Chris Kenning/USA Today Network\n\nClimate change forcing homeowners to make tough choices\n\nVideos and photos of flooding reviewed and geolocated by CNN show that some of the areas that flooded in recent weeks were outside the current FEMA-designated flood zone, from parts of downtown Whitesburg to stretches of homes lining river mountain valleys outside of the town of Jackson.\n\nThe storm that deluged the state has been described by meteorologists as a 1-in-1,000-year rain-event – so the FEMA map, which designates zones at risk during 1-in-100-year and 1-in-500-year floods, wouldn’t necessarily capture all the flooded areas.\n\nBut as climate change advances, “what was a 1-in-100-year flood when these maps were created might now be a 1-in-50 or 1-in-40-year event going forward,” Porter said.\n\nEven more up-to-date and accurate flood maps wouldn’t necessarily have led to far more people in Eastern Kentucky getting flood insurance because many residents don’t have mortgages that would have required them to buy it, experts said. In less affluent rural areas like the flooded Kentucky counties, new housing construction is rare, and many homes are passed on to family members instead of being sold.\n\n“If you don’t have a mortgage, regardless of whether you’re in the highest hazard zone of flooding, it is the homeowner’s choice whether or not to have flood insurance,” said Wright, the former FEMA official.\n\nKirsten Gomez, right, cries to her family member Kathy Hall, after what she calls a quiet moment to reflect on what her family has gone through in the aftermath of massive flooding, Tuesday, August 2, 2022, in Hindman, Kentucky. Brynn Anderson/AP\n\nBob Smith, the Letcher County homeowner who was rescued from his porch, said he and his wife decided to keep their flood insurance even after they paid off the mortgage on their home because they live directly adjacent to a river.\n\nA better flood insurance system would help homeowners understand their relative level of risk, instead of making a simplistic distinction between properties inside and outside of a flood zone, Wright said.\n\nFEMA has acknowledged shortcomings with its flood insurance program, and recently urged Congress to pass reforms that would allow it to update its procedures for mapping flood risk and subsidize flood insurance for low-and-moderate-income homebuyers – helping more people afford insurance in poorer areas like Eastern Kentucky. Flood insurance premiums cost about $760 annually on average, but that varies depending on risk and other factors, according to the agency’s data.\n\nThe flood insurance program “continues to operate on a construct developed over 50 years ago,” David Maurstad, a FEMA official, told a Senate committee in June, saying the agency wanted to “reform how we measure and communicate flood risk” and “ensure more Americans are covered by flood insurance.”\n\nThe Biden administration and Congressional Democrats initially included funding to improve flood maps and subsidize flood insurance for low-and-moderate-income households in their Build Back Better package. But that money was cut during negotiations, and isn’t present in the final climate-and-health spending bill that Congress passed on Friday.\n\nAngie Hatton, a state representative who lives in Whitesburg, said the lack of flood insurance was a huge challenge as her region picks up the pieces and turns to charity. “We are facing every Appalachian person’s nightmare in that we hate to ask for help, especially from outsiders,” she said.\n\nHer fear, she said, is that some of her neighbors who aren’t getting an insurance check to rebuild their damaged homes will cut their losses and leave – hastening the decline of a community whose population has already fallen steeply in recent decades.\n\n“Sometimes the family home was the thing that was keeping them here,” she said. “If that home can’t be rebuilt, they might not be coming back.”\n\nHow safe are you from flooding?

In the United States, drought and sea level rise clashed at the mouth of the historically low Mississippi River. And in South Africa, climate change made rainfall that triggered deadly floods heavier and twice as likely to occur.\n\nYet against the backdrop of these catastrophic events, this year also sparked some glimmers of hope:\n\nScientists in the US successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction that generated more energy than it used – a huge step in the decades-long quest to replace fossil fuels with an infinite source of clean energy.\n\nAnd at the United Nations’ COP27 climate summit in Egypt, nearly 200 countries agreed to set up a fund to help poor, vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters they had little hand in causing.\n\n“There was some encouraging climate action in 2022, but we remain far off track to meet our goals of reducing global heat-trapping emissions and limiting future planetary warming,” Kristina Dahl, principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN. “There must be a stronger collective commitment and progress toward slashing emissions in 2023 if we are to keep climate extremes from becoming even more devastating.”\n\nHere are the top 10 climate and extreme weather stories of 2022.\n\n10. Tonga volcano eruption and global tsunami\n\nA zoomed-in view of the Tonga eruption, taken by Japan's Himawari-8 satellite, about 100 minutes after the eruption started. Simon Proud/Uni Oxford, RALSpace NCEO/Japan Meteorological Agency\n\nWhen the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted in January, it sent tsunami waves around the world. The blast itself was so loud it was heard in Alaska – roughly 6,000 miles away. The afternoon sky turned pitch black as heavy ash clouded Tonga’s capital and caused “significant damage” along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu.\n\nThe underwater volcanic eruption also injected a huge cloud of ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, more than 30 kilometers (around 19 miles) above sea level, according to data from NASA satellites.\n\nAt the time, experts said the event was likely not large enough to impact global climate.\n\nBut months later, scientists found that the eruption actually belched an enormous amount of water vapor into the Earth’s stratosphere – enough to fill more than 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. The massive plume of water vapor will likely contribute to more global warming at ground-level for the next several years, NASA scientists reported.\n\n9. Rivers hit record lows\n\nSevere drought reveals incredible discovery at bottom of Mississippi river 00:45 - Source: CNN\n\nSearing temperatures, lack of rainfall and low snowpack pushed some of the world’s most vital rivers to new lows this year.\n\nNorthern Italy saw its worst drought in more than 70 years. The 400-mile River Po hit a record low due to an unusually dry winter and limited snowpack in the Alps, which feeds the river. The drought impacted millions of people who rely on the Po for their livelihood, and roughly 30% of the country’s food, which is produced along the river.\n\nAlso fed by winter snowpack in the Alps along with spring rains, Germany’s Rhine River dropped to “exceptionally low” levels in some areas, disrupting shipping in the country’s most important inland water way. Months of little rainfall meant cargo ships began carrying lighter loads and transport costs soared.\n\nMeanwhile in the US, extreme drought spread into the central states and gauges along the Mississippi River and its tributaries plummeted. Barge traffic moved in fits and starts as officials dredged the river. The Mississippi River dropped so low that the Army Corps of Engineers was forced to build a 1,500-foot-wide levee to prevent Gulf-of-Mexico saltwater from pushing upstream.\n\n8. US passes landmark climate law\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs \"The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022\" into law during a ceremony in the State Dining Room of the White House in August. Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nAfter more than a year of negotiations, Democrats in late July reached an agreement on President Joe Biden’s long-stalled climate, energy and tax agenda – capping a year of agonizing negotiations that failed multiple times.\n\nBiden signed the bill into law in August and signaled to the world that the US is delivering on its climate promises.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin was influential in delaying the bill’s passage. Multiple White House and Biden administration officials for months had tried to convince the senator to support the bill over dinners in Paris and ziplining in West Virginia.\n\nAn analysis suggests the measures in the bill will reduce US carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030 and would put Biden well on his way to achieving his goal of slashing emissions in half by 2030.\n\n7. Hurricane Nicole\n\n'We are in trouble here in Daytona': Coastal homes collapse into the ocean 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\nHurricane Nicole was the first hurricane to hit anywhere in the US during the month of November in nearly 40 years. The rare, late-season storm also marked the first time that a hurricane made landfall on Florida’s east coast in November.\n\nAlthough Nicole was only a category 1, it had a massive wind field that stretched more than 500 miles, coupled with astronomically high tides that led to catastrophic storm surge. Homes and buildings collapsed into the ocean in Volusia County, with authorities scrambling to issue evacuation warnings.\n\nHurricane Nicole flooded streets, destroyed power lines and killed at least five people. The storm came just 42 days after deadly category 4 Hurricane Ian wreaked havoc on the west coast of Florida.\n\n6. A breakthrough at COP27\n\nProtesters demonstrate during the UN's COP27 climate conference in November in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nNegotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed at the UN climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to set up a new fund for “loss and damage,” meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters. It was the first time wealthy, industrialized countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the US and the EU, agreed to establish such a fund.\n\n“We can’t solve the climate crisis unless we rapidly and equitably transition to clean energy and away from fossil fuels, as well as hold wealthy nations and the fossil fuel industry accountable for the damage they have done,” Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN.\n\n5. A summer of flooding\n\nSubmerged vehicles in Jackson, Kentucky, in July. Between 8 and 10 inches of rain fell within 48 hours from July 27 to 28 across Eastern Kentucky. The month was Jackson's wettest July on record. Michael Swensen/Getty Images\n\nThe summer’s series of floods started off in Yellowstone National Park in June, when extreme rainfall and rapidly melting snow washed out roads and bridges in the park, causing significant damage to the nearby town of Gardiner, Montana, at the park’s entrance. Authorities had to rescue more than 100 people from the floods.\n\nThe year also brought several 1,000-year rainfall events. A 1,000-year rainfall event is one that is so intense it’s only seen on average once every 1,000 years – under normal circumstances. But extreme rainfall is becoming more common as the climate crisis pushes temperatures higher. Warmer air can hold more moisture, which loads the dice in favor of historic rainfall.\n\nDeadly flooding swept through Eastern Kentucky and around St. Louis in July after damaging, record-breaking rainfall in a short period of time.\n\nCalifornia’s Death Valley, after a yearslong dry spell, saw its rainiest day in recorded history.\n\nMeanwhile, down south, parts of Dallas, Texas, got an entire summer’s worth of rain in just 24 hours in August, prompting more than 350 high-water rescues.\n\n4. Europe’s deadly heat wave\n\nWildfires threaten London during record-breaking heat wave 01:20 - Source: CNN\n\nEurope experienced its hottest summer on record in 2022 by a wide margin. While the heat kicked off early in France, Portugal and Spain, with the countries reaching record-warmth in May, the most significant heat came in mid-July, spreading across the UK and central Europe.\n\nThe UK, in particular, topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time on record. Stephen Belcher, the UK Met Office’s chief scientist, said this would have been “virtually impossible” in an “undisrupted climate.”\n\nThroughout western Europe, the heatwaves gravely increased wildfire risk, with one London fire official noting that the 40-degree day led to an “unprecedented day in the history of the London Fire Brigade.”\n\n3. The West’s water crisis\n\nAs water levels drop at this major lake, bodies begin to appear 03:19 - Source: CNN\n\nThe past few years have been a reality check for western states that heavily rely on the Colorado River for water and electricity. Plagued by decades of overuse and a climate change-fueled drought, the river that serves 40 million people in seven western states and Mexico is draining at an alarming rate.\n\nThe water levels in its two main reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell – have plunged rapidly, threatening drinking water supply and power generation. In late July, Lake Mead – the country’s largest reservoir – bottomed out and has only rebounded a few feet off record lows. Its rapidly plunging levels revealed human remains from the 1970s and a sunken vessel from World War II.\n\nThe federal government implemented its first-ever mandatory water cuts this year for states that draw from the Colorado River, and those cuts will be even deeper starting in January 2023.\n\n2. Catastrophic flooding in Pakistan\n\nFlood-affected people carry belongings out from their flooded home in Shikarpur, Sindh province, in Pakistan in August. Asif Hassan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFloods caused by record monsoon rain and melting glaciers in Pakistan’s northern mountain regions claimed the lives of more than 1,400 people this summer, with millions more affected by clean water and food shortages. More than a third of Pakistan was underwater, satellite images showed, and authorities warned it would take months for the flood waters to recede in the country’s hardest-hit areas.\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres said the Pakistani people are facing “a monsoon on steroids,” referring to the role that the climate crisis had in supercharging the extreme rainfall. The hard-hit provinces Sindh and Balochistan saw rainfall more than 500% of average during the monsoon season.\n\nPakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming emissions, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.\n\n1. Hurricane Ian\n\nDestruction in the wake of Hurricane Ian on October 4 in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHurricane Ian was a Category 4 storm when it made landfall in southwest Florida in late September and left a trail of destruction from the Caribbean to the Carolinas. Insured losses from Ian are expected to reach up to $65 billion, according to recent data from reinsurance company Swiss Re.\n\nThe storm first struck Cuba before undergoing rapid intensification from a tropical storm to a category 3 hurricane in just 24 hours – something scientists told CNN is part of a trend for the most dangerous storms. That same week, Super Typhoon Noru in the Philippines grew from the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane to a category 5 overnight as residents around Manila slept, catching officials and residents unaware and unable to prepare.\n\nHurricane Ian’s size and intensity allowed it to build up a storm surge higher than any ever observed in Southwest Florida, devastating Fort Myers and Cape Coral. Ian killed more than 100 people, most by drowning. It will likely be one of the costliest hurricanes on record not only in Florida, but in the US.", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/09/14/hurricane-florence-1-000-year-floods-landfall-forecast-projected-path/1302043002/", "title": "Hurricane Florence: 1,000-year floods may come to NC", "text": "RALEIGH — The eye of the storm made landfall in North Carolina early Friday, bringing the most powerful wind gusts recorded in more than 50 years and forecasts for 1,000-year floods in the southeastern portions of the state.\n\nHurricane Florence has arrived, and \"it's getting worse,\" Gov.

At this point, Hurricane Ian is tied for the strongest storm to make landfall on the west coast of the Florida peninsula, matching the wind speed of Hurricane Charley in 2004. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday Ian will rank as one of the top five hurricanes to ever hit the Florida peninsula, behind Hurricanes Andrew (1992) and Michael (2018).\n\nIan weakened to a Category 1 hurricane by Wednesday night as it moved across central Florida, churning sustained winds of 90 mph.\n\nNearly 2 million Florida utility customers were without power as of 6 p.m., according to PowerOutage.us. Officials in Cape Coral and Punta Gorda reported significant impacts, and the storm surge set records for the highest water levels ever observed in Fort Myers and Naples.\n\n“The storm surge is very significant. We’re seeing cars and boats float down the street. We’re seeing trees nearly bent in half,” Frank Loni, an architect from California staying in Fort Myers Beach for the storm, said midday Wednesday. “There’s quite a bit of chaos on the streets.”\n\nDeSantis said storm surge from Ian has hit up to 12 feet in some areas.”It is our meteorologist’s view that the storm surge has likely peaked and will be less in the coming hours,” he said.\n\nIan is expected to retain hurricane strength through the day and into tomorrow as the center of the storm moves northeast over the Florida Peninsula, passing close to Orlando and Daytona Beach, before moving back into the Atlantic Ocean Thursday afternoon. Hurricane warnings have been issued for not only southwest Florida, but also much of central Florida from coast to coast.\n\nA number of other weather advisories have also been issued throughout Florida. A flash flood emergency impacting more than 300,000 people is in effect south central Sarasota county, southeast Manatee, northwest Desoto, Hardee, and northwest Highlands counties through 10:45 p.m..\n\nAn extreme wind warning is in effect for Sebrin, Avon Park and Arcadia until 9:30 p.m. for extremely dangerous hurricane winds as the storm passes.\n\n‘The worst storm I have ever seen’\n\nWater levels in Fort Myers rose more than 6 feet over the span of seven hours and were still rising as strong winds continue to push water from the Gulf of Mexico ashore, according to CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller.\n\n“I’ve been here since the mid-70s, this is actually – by far – the worst storm I have ever seen,” Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN’s Jake Tapper.\n\nAbout 96% of Fort Myers is without electricity, Anderson told CNN’s Anderson Cooper late Wednesday. The mayor does not know how many people did not heed evacuation orders, but there are thousands currently in shelters.\n\nAnderson also emphasized that it is still unsafe to be outside and that people should stay away from floodwaters.\n\n“There’s no telling what’s in those waters, they are not safe. You know you could step on debris. You know, there’s runoff from sewers and just – it’s just not a good situation,” he said.\n\nJennifer Dexter, a spokesperson for the town of Fort Myers Beach, told CNN backup water pumps are down.\n\n“When the backup water pump system goes down, that shows you how serious it is,” Dexter said. A boil water notice went into effect due to storm surge, loss of power and damage to the backup generators for the drinking water supply.\n\nPresident Biden spoke with the mayor Wednesday, the White House said in a statement. The two leaders “discussed Fort Myers’ ongoing needs including support for the elderly members of the community, families that live in mobile homes and other community members who are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the storm,” according to a readout of the call provided by the White House.\n\nThe President also tried to reach the mayors of Cape Coral, Sarasota and the Chair of Charlotte County, Florida, but was unable to reach them and left messages instead, the White House said.\n\nHurricane Ian made landfall in Florida as a dangerous Category 4 hurricane Wednesday afternoon. Lokman Vural Elibol/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nIn Tampa, Mayor Jane Castor urged residents Wednesday to shelter in place, saying the worst of the storm is “yet to come.”\n\n“We are expecting that we’re going to get the majority of the rain and the higher winds starting about 8 p.m. and they’re going to last throughout the night,” she said. “We are still expecting widespread flooding throughout our city, and anywhere from tropical storm wind speeds to the possibly of category one hurricane wind speeds.”\n\nCastor said that officials are expecting flooding sometime in the next 24 hours.\n\n“We’re going to see the continued rain, the rain will increase dramatically and then that water is going to come back into the Bay as Hurricane Ian continues its northeasterly trajectory.”\n\nFurther south, The Olde Naples Seaport, a community of condos that overlooks the Naples Bay, was consumed by storm surge, according to video shot by Graham Pederson. Pederson experienced knee-high water trying to escape.\n\nIn another video shot from the second floor, wind is seen whipping trees and trucks nearly submerged by the water. Pederson retreated to the second floor to wait out the storm, his brother-in-law Kyle Wendel told CNN.\n\nVideo was taken from Estero Blvd in Fort Myers Beach, Florida, on Wednesday, September 28, 2022. Frank Loni\n\nDeSantis said Wednesday calls for help are coming into several counties due to the storm. The governor said emergency responders have received calls from people in evacuation zones that did not evacuate. Those calls are being logged, he said.\n\n“Local first responders will deploy as soon as it’s safe to do so,” DeSantis said. “By and large until the storm passes, they are not going to go into a situation for rescue and put their own folks at risk.”\n\nDeSantis requested Biden approve a major disaster declaration for all 67 counties in the state due to Hurricane Ian, his office said in a news release. DeSantis is also requesting that the President grant FEMA the authority to provide 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 60 days from Ian’s landfall.\n\nIan already producing record water surge levels\n\nMuch of west-central Florida and places inland face “historic” storm surge, rain and crushing winds. “This is a wind storm and a surge storm and a flood storm, all in one,” CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.\n\nImages and video have showed extensive flooding in coastal neighborhoods in Naples and Fort Myers Beach.\n\nStorm surge began rising late Wednesday morning – more than 4.5 feet above normal highest tides was recorded before noon in Naples, already higher than the previous record there of 4.02 feet from Hurricane Irma in 2017.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for flood-prone areas on the coast, and the National Weather Service warned those who stayed behind to move to upper floors in case of rising water levels.\n\nIan’s dangers still include:\n\n• Storm surge: Some 12 to 18 feet of seawater pushed onto land was predicted Wednesday for the coastal Fort Myers area, from Englewood to Bonita Beach, forecasters said. Only slightly less is forecast for a stretch from Bonita Beach down to near the Everglades (8 to 12 feet), and from near Bradenton to Englewood (6 to 10 feet), forecasters said.\n\nLower – but still life-threatening – surge is possible elsewhere, including north of Tampa and along Florida’s northeast coast near Jacksonville.\n\n• Winds: Southwest Florida is facing “catastrophic wind damage” from ongoing hurricane-force winds. Winds near the core of Hurricane Ian could exceed 140 mph, with higher gusts, the hurricane center said. Multiple locations, including Sanibel Island, recorded wind gusts above 100 mph.\n\n• Flooding rain: 12 to 30 inches of rain could fall in central and northeastern Florida – including Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville. That makes for a top-of-scale risk for flooding rainfall across this area. This amount of rain would usually be two to three months’ worth, but is now falling in less than two days, according to CNN meteorologist Gene Norman.\n\n“As this storm passes your community, understand this is still a hazardous situation” because of downed powerlines, misuse of generators and standing water, Gov. DeSantis said during a Wednesday evening news conference.\n\nWhere the hurricane is headed\n\nIan’s center is expected to move over central Florida through Thursday morning. Heavy rain and flooding also is possible in southern Florida, Georgia and coastal South Carolina. The governors of Virginia, North and South Carolina have already declared states of emergency in their respective states.\n\nStorm warnings have expanded northward to North Carolina, according to the National Hurricane Center’s 5 p.m. update. A tropical storm warning has been extended to Surf City and a tropical storm watch has been issued from north of Surf City to Cape Lookout, North Carolina.\n\nA storm surge watch has been issued north of South Santee River, South Carolina, to Little River Inlet.\n\nBecause Ian slowly approached land, the worst conditions could remain over some areas for eight or more hours.\n\n“Widespread, life-threatening catastrophic flash, urban, and river flooding is expected” across central and southern Florida, the hurricane center said.\n\nBy late Thursday, Ian is due to emerge over the Atlantic Ocean, where it could strengthen again and affect another part of the US.\n\nPrior to nearing Florida, Hurricane Ian pummeled Cuba on Tuesday, leaving at least two dead and an islandwide blackout. The US Coast Guard said it has rescued at least three people off the Florida coast, about 2 miles south of Boca Chica.\n\n“They were brought to the local hospital for symptoms of exhaustion and dehydration. Air crews are still searching,” the Coast Guard said in a tweet.\n\nAccording to US Border Patrol Chief for the Miami Sector, the agency has been searching for more than 20 migrants after the arrival of Cubans who swam to shore after their boat sank due to Ian.\n\nAfter the devastation in Cuba, more than 2.5 million people in Florida were advised to flee, including 1.75 million under mandatory evacuation orders – no small ask in a state with a large elderly population.\n\nOfficials prepare for post-storm rescue\n\nSarasota County Sheriff Deputies block the access to a downtown bridge over to the barrier islands as Hurricane Ian approaches Florida's Gulf Coast on September 28. Steve Nesius/Reuters\n\nLaw enforcement officials around the state warned that people who stayed behind in evacuation areas cannot expect rescuers to respond to calls for help during the storm when winds are high.\n\n“If you call for help, once we pull (officers) off the road … we’re not coming. … We’re not putting people in peril when (others) didn’t heed the mandatory evacuation order,” Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said Wednesday.\n\nNot everyone moved. Chelsye Napier, of Fort Myers, stayed home with her fiance and cats despite being in an evacuation zone, she told CNN Wednesday. They waited “because we don’t know anyone down here,” and ultimately decided to stay put, she said.\n\nIan's winds could be catastrophic Category 4: 130-156 mph • Most of the area is uninhabitable for weeks or months. • Power outages last weeks to months. • Fallen trees and power poles isolate residential areas. + Well-built framed homes sustain severe damage. Category 5: 157+ mph + A high percentage of framed homes are destroyed. Source: National Hurricane Center\n\n“If anything happens, we have everything that we need here. We’ve got food, we got water. We have everything that we need here,” she said. “So it’s all OK for right now. We’ll see, though, later on.”\n\nAs millions were told evacuate, 176 shelters opened statewide and hotels and Airbnbs opened to people leaving evacuation zones, DeSantis said.\n\nLocal governments and state agencies also prepared those living in nursing homes and other senior care facilities to evacuate. Florida has around 6 million residents over the age of 60, according to the state’s Department of Elder Affairs – nearly 30% of its total population.\n\nHeather Danenhower, with Duke Energy, walks around utility trucks that are staged in a rural lot in The Villages of Sumter County on Wednesday. Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel via AP\n\nAuthorities also readied services to fan out and respond to calls for rescue and then, in the aftermath of the hurricane, for recovery and repair efforts.\n\nNearly 400 ambulances, buses and support vehicles were responding to areas where the hurricane was expected to make landfall, according to the governor’s office.\n\nDeSantis activated 5,000 Florida National Guard members for Ian’s response operations, and 2,000 more guardsmen from Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina were being activated to assist.\n\nFlorida urban search and rescue teams also were prepping.\n\n“We have five state teams that are activated with additional five FEMA teams that are in play,” Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis said at a news conference Tuesday night. “We have over 600 resources to bear in addition to these out-of-town teams.”\n\nHelp is coming from out of state, too. At least 26 states have answered the call for assistance by Florida, DeSantis said Wednesday evening, including Alabama and Louisiana.\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards tweeted Wedensday his state has already sent “significant resources” to Florida.\n\n“We are also prepared to send additional help once damage assessment begins,” Edwards’ tweet read.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey tweeted her state sent Blackhawk helicopters to help. Tennessee and Louisiana also sent resources to aid in search and rescue.\n\n“If they need it and we’ve got it, then we’re going to send it,” Ivey tweeted.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Eric Levenson Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Eric Levenson", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/australia/australia-flood-relief-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Australia foods: Relief and rescue efforts continue as Sydney braces ...", "text": "Military helicopters airlifted stranded people from rooftops of flooded neighborhoods in eastern Australia and a tenth victim was found on Tuesday following days of torrential rain as the wild weather slowly shifts south toward Sydney.\n\nThe death toll rose to 10 after a woman believed in her 80s was found dead inside a flooded property, police said.\n\nFloodwater from the deluge, which began late last week, submerged several towns and bridges in Queensland and New South Wales, and was moving to the south with heavy rains and possible flash flooding forecast for Sydney.\n\nResidents stand by a flooded street in Lawrence suburb, some 70 kilometers New South Wales border city Lismore, on March 1, 2022.

It is a situation compounded by the Taliban seizing power in August 2021, which led the United States and its allies freezing about $7 billion of the country’s foreign reserves and cutting off international funding.\n\nThe situation has crippled an economy already heavily dependent on aid. Following the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year, its economy has gone into freefall with the World Bank forecasting in April that a “combination of declining incomes and increasing prices has driven a severe deterioration in household living standards.”\n\nMany of the areas' traditional houses are made of mud and other natural materials, making them vulnerable to damage.

Swiss Re noted that these losses are trending up each year at a rate of 5 to 7% over the past decade.\n\nHurricane Ian, a Category 4 storm that killed more than 100 people when it made landfall in southwest Florida in late September, caused the highest insured loss this year and was the second-costliest on record after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, according to the analysis.\n\nBut other extreme weather events, including devastating winter storms in Europe, flooding in Australia and South Africa and hail storms in the US and France contributed to the staggering toll. The so called “secondary perils,” which are those that typically bring small to mid-sized losses like hail, flood or fires, caused more than $50 billion in insured losses.\n\n“2022 has been another year of increased natural catastrophe loss activity, and demand for insurance is growing as the protection gap remains vast,” Thierry Léger, the company’s chief underwriting officer, said in a statement. “To enable the insurance industry to keep up with increasing volatility and demand, it will be key to model evolving frequency and severity trends.”\n\nAs the climate crisis accelerates, insurance losses from extreme weather catastrophes have been skyrocketing.

In Southern California, the storm was expected to peak in intensity overnight into early Thursday morning with Santa Barbara and Ventura counties likely to see the most rain, forecasters said.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Gov.

She was defying the elements not because of her job at a security company, but to feed homeless people at a nearby church, something Rowell said she does daily.\n\n“It’s not so bad if there’s no wind,” Rowell said as her umbrella got pelted by the rain and torrents of water flowed down Folsom Street. “It gets harder when the wind picks up like today. I worry about the homeless people. They’re the ones who suffer the most when the weather gets like this.”\n\nEvacuations ordered in coastal cities\n\nOfficials in Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara issued evacuation orders Wednesday as the huge storm puts the coastal areas at high risk due to potential mudslides and flooding.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders were issued for those living in burn scar areas in Santa Barbara County due to potential flooding and debris flows, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown announced during a Wednesday news conference.\n\nThe Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office issued numerous evacuation orders for southern parts of the county throughout Wednesday due to concerns over potential flooding and debris flow from storm conditions.\n\nFlight disruptions amid powerful storm\n\nWith its high winds and heavy rains, the storm is already causing flight disruptions in the Bay Area with more anticipated to come as the peak approaches.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, San Francisco International Airport has experienced 74 flight cancellations, accounting for 8% of all flights.\n\nAbout 191 flights have been delayed by an average of 35 minutes, according to Doug Yakel, a public information officer for the airport. \"Delays and cancellations are a result of both the reduced ceilings and winds,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\n\"In regards to general airport operations here at OAK, our operations team is prepared,\" a spokesperson for Oakland International Airport told USA TODAY. Passengers with flights to and from Oakland are strongly encouraged to check with their airline through their mobile app or website for updates on their flights.\n\nTravel waivers for flights disrupted by California's \"bomb cyclone\":\n\nSouthwest Airlines is offering free rebooking for flights scheduled for Wednesday, for flights to and from Oakland, Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose. The rebooking must have the same city pairs and travel dates within 14 days of the original travel date.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Delta Air Lines issued a travel waiver for flights scheduled on Thursday and Friday to or from San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento, San Jose, and Fresno. The fare difference will be waived when the rebooked travel takes place on or before Jan. 8.\n\nResidents brace for floods\n\nIn San Francisco, customers at Papenhausen Hardware were most worried about flooding, said store co-owner Karl Aguilar.\n\n“Last week a fair amount of people were focused on the roofs – small leaks, windows, things like that,’’ Aguilar said. “There was a point where it transitioned and people became much more concerned with flooding mitigation. This particular storm, it’s all flood mitigation.’’\n\nA few doors to the east, Grace Daryanani at Bulls Head restaurant has sandbags and wet/dry vacuum cleaners at the ready. Her space has flooded in big storms before but she's hoping a new outdoor dining area might divert some of the water.\n\n“Maybe that will help,\" she said.\n\nLEARN MORE:What is a bomb cyclone?\n\nWEATHER TERMS:What is an 'atmospheric river'?\n\nWind gusts as high as 80 mph\n\nForecasters warned of flood threats and issued high wind warnings in the lead-up to the storm. The National Weather Service in the Bay Area delivered a rare admonition saying the coming \"brutal\" storm system \"needs to be taken seriously.\"\n\n\"Honestly, the biggest story right now is the winds,\" said Palmer. Coastal areas could be hit with winds in the 40 to 50 mph range, while some mountain areas could get gusts as high as 80 mph.\n\nFlooding and landslides likely\n\nBecause the ground was already saturated with the more than 5 inches of rain that fell on New Year's Eve, Wednesday's storm could cause severe problems and damage in some areas.\n\n\"The main concern is the smaller watersheds and steep slopes. So mudslides, shallow landslides and urban and small creek flooding could get quite significant for a period of time on Wednesday night in some locations,\" said Daniel Swain, a climatologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nSevere weather, possible tornadoes in South\n\nThe South, too, was being hit with intense weather Wednesday. Heavy rains, flash floods and severe weather were seen in a swath across Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina.\n\nA possible tornado touched down in east Montgomery, Alabama at 3:14 a.m. on Wednesday.\n\nRodney Penn, who was home when the storm hit, said a fallen tree limb broke out the windows in his wife's car but there was no structural damage to his apartment.\n\n“It literally sounded like there were a thousand baseball bats hitting the side of the house at the same time,” Penn said.\n\nIn South Carolina, five counties were under a tornado watch Wednesday.\n\nHeavy rain in California not an end to drought in West\n\nThe extreme drought conditions California has struggled under are helping avert some possible flooding because many of the state's larger reservoirs are still quite low, said Swain.\n\n\"They have a lot of headroom right now to absorb a lot of water,\" he said.\n\nThe state finds itself in the middle of a flood emergency even as it's in the middle of a drought emergency, Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"A lot of our trees are stressed after three years of intensive drought, the ground is saturated and there is a significant chance of downed trees that will create significant problems, potentially flooding problems, potentially power problems,\" she said.\n\nWhile the rains are likely to alleviate the short-term drought in Northern California along the coast, they will do little in terms of bringing drought relief to the West as a whole.\n\n\"It won't really help move the needle in the Colorado basin but it certainly will in central and northern California,\" Swain said.\n\nMore water is on the way\n\nThere are two more possible storms also out in the Pacific, one that could arrive late Friday and run into Sunday and then another possible storm that could arrive Tuesday, Canepa said.\n\nBoth could bring higher-than-normal rain levels through the middle of January.\n\nThere's a wide range of uncertainty for next week, ranging from a couple of additional moderate storms which wouldn't cause too many problems to one or possibly more atmospheric river events.\n\nWhat's an atmospheric river?\n\nThe storm, the second of three or possibly four headed toward the California coast, is coming from across the Pacific ocean. It's what's known as an atmospheric river or, to use the term more common a few years ago, a Pineapple Express because it originates over Hawaii.\n\nThese storms bring heavy rainfall and occur when a line of warm, moist air flows from near the islands across the Pacific Ocean to the West Coast.\n\nWhen it reaches the cooler air over the western landmass, the water vapor falls as heavy rain. Atmospheric rivers are long, flowing regions of the atmosphere that carry water vapor across a swath of sky 250 to 375 miles wide. They can be more than 1,000 miles long – and can carry more water than the Mississippi River.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver and Kathleen Wong, USA TODAY; Evan Mealins and Alex Gladden, Montgomery Advertiser; Hannah Workman, The Record", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/04"}]}

Now voters face ...", "text": "Cherise Harris noticed a change in her eldest daughter soon after the family moved a block away from a 132-year-old coal-fired power plant in Painesville, Ohio.\n\nThe teen’s asthma attacks occurred more frequently, Harris said, and she started carrying an inhaler with her at all times.\n\nThe family didn’t know it at the time, but Painesville’s municipal-owned plant emits nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide – two pollutants that the American Lung Association says inflames air passages, causing shortness of breath, chest tightness, pain and wheezing.\n\n“It makes me wonder,” said Harris, who lives with her four children and fiancé. “Is that what triggered my daughter’s asthma?”\n\nUnder President Donald Trump's rule, the Painesville plant – and nearly 200 other coal-powered electric utilities like it – can emit more such pollutants, according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s own projections.\n\nThe rule is one of nearly 100 environmental rollbacks the Trump administration has pursued over the past four years to loosen regulations on everything from air and water quality to wildlife.\n\nA majority of them already are in effect; others face court challenges. All threaten environmental protections that have been in place for decades.\n\nAs Americans cast their ballots on Election Day, voters have a choice: continued deregulation that could lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions, worsening symptoms of climate change and mass species die-offs, or a reversal of those policies and a slate of new governmental restrictions.\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden, who is Trump’s main challenger in the election, has promised a plan to fast-track the country to zero carbon dioxide emissions in the electricity sector by 2035. It’s similar to a new energy emissions model released Thursday by a team of researchers at the Clean Energy Futures project who say it's possible to get to zero emissions in the electricity sector within two decades.\n\nThe team’s model shows solar and wind replacing coal and natural gas as the leading sources of electricity generation.\n\n\"When you set an ambitious target, like 100% clean energy, you see substantial improvements in air quality and major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,\" said Kathy Fallon Lambert, senior adviser at the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment (C-CHANGE) at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and part of the research team.\n\n\"That's not so surprising,” Lambert said. “But what was a bit surprising to us is that it's achievable with existing technology and the costs are moderate.\"\n\nUSA TODAY Network climate reporters, including the Times' Doug Fraser, fanned out across Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Michigan and Ohio to examine the effects of rollbacks of two key protections: One that diminishes air quality through Trump’s Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, rule; the other threatening water quality through recent changes to the Waters of the United States rule, or WOTUS.\n\nThe void of federal regulations has left some states, which are already in the midst of declining revenues due to the coronavirus pandemic, trying to maintain pre-Trump standards.\n\n“The obvious thing (the rules) do is weaken pollution standards, or weaken environmental protections,\" said Joseph Goffman, a former assistant administrator at the EPA and now the executive director of the Environmental & Energy Law Program at Harvard University. \"As they go into effect, the public is exposed to more pollution, more environmental damage, more emissions of greenhouse gases, than they otherwise would be exposed to thanks to these rules.”\n\n“But these rules do something else,\" Goffman said – what the administration really wants is to undo the law.\n\nTrump EPA officials argue the opposite, despite what scientists and activists say. Officials believe rules changes have removed burdensome regulations without a cost to the environment.\n\n“We have a really good environmental record,\" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an interview with the USA TODAY Network. Wheeler, before taking over the agency, had been an EPA employee and also a lobbyist for energy, oil and uranium processing companies.\n\n\"I would say that the Obama administration only focused on climate change and not on the nuts and bolts of what the EPA is supposed to be doing,\" Wheeler said. \"And we've been doing all of it at the same time.”\n\nEarth is on course by 2050 to be about 3 degrees Celsius warmer compared to pre-industrial times. The increase will wipe out some species, place more homes in floodplains and mean longer, more intense heat waves. There’s a race to stop carbon dioxide emissions, which trap heat in the atmosphere and fuel conditions for climate change.\n\nEven with steadily dropping emissions levels in the U.S. over decades, carbon dioxide remains in the Earth’s atmosphere for up to 1,000 years, according to NASA.\n\nAt the same time, EPA's authority has become restricted and limited for the first time in decades since landmark environmental laws were enacted, according to more than a dozen experts and former EPA staff members interviewed for this story.\n\nWith the rule changes, the “interruption of progress represents a loss of time that will never be recovered,\" Goffman said. \"Time is of the essence, in terms of dealing with climate change.”\n\nA rule to keep coal-fired plants running\n\nFor more than 100 years, coal-fired power plants have emitted carbon dioxide that contributed to climate change. Rather than reducing those emissions, the EPA under Trump implemented the Affordable Clean Energy Rule – or ACE – requiring plants to operate more efficiently.\n\nCritics say that's the wrong move.\n\nIf the plants run more efficiently, the operators make upgrades and keep them operating longer, experts said. The EPA’s own data modeling shows that this leads to emissions increases, Harvard's Fallon Lambert said.\n\n“Our primary takeaway is that it does little to nothing to address carbon pollution,\" she said. \"And in many states, you could see an emissions rebound.\"\n\nCharles Driscoll, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Syracuse University, who is also part of the Clean Energy Futures project, agreed.\n\n“ACE incentivizes the continuation of coal. So it doesn't do much in terms of carbon dioxide. It doesn't do much for sulfur dioxide,” he said.\n\nThe rule went into effect in June 2019 and took the place of the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, which sought to reduce emissions by about 32% from 2005 levels by 2030 but never took effect due to court challenges. It would have provided utilities with incentives to use renewables and low-emitting fuels more and use high-emitting fuels, like coal, less.\n\nEven without strict reduction standards, carbon dioxide emissions continue to drop, the EPA’s Wheeler said.\n\n“The prior administration, they focused almost solely on climate change at the expense of the other responsibilities of the EPA,” he said. “What they tried to do is virtue signal to foreign capitals, such as Paris, instead of focusing on something that is legally sustainable here in the United States.”\n\nThe Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, which is working to reduce greenhouse gases, saying it placed an unfair economic burden on America.\n\nThe EPA's Wheeler said he believes the courts will uphold the ACE rule and that it ultimately will reduce carbon emissions. \"The trajectory of CO2 emissions in this country is going down. And it's going down each year, and it will continue to go down.”\n\nBut it would drop little compared to the researchers’ clean energy model. Nationally under that plan, carbon dioxide emissions from energy generation would plummet 36% by 2030. They would drop 70% by 2035 before hitting 100% – zero emissions – in 2040.\n\nIn Painesville, under the Trump administration's ACE rule, EPA records show the city's coal plant would be allowed to produce more than twice as much carbon dioxide as it has emitted in any year since 2011. When the plant runs, it mostly affects a Black and Latino neighborhood nearby. Children play at a park there in sight of the plant's stack.\n\nActivists: It's profits over people\n\nAbout 30 miles northeast of Cleveland, in Ohio, Painesville's power plant burns coal only when energy use peaks and the market price soars, keeping usage to a minimum, a city spokeswoman told the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIts annual CO2 emissions fluctuated over the decade, reaching as high as about 122,000 tons in 2011 and dipping as low as to about 6,300 tons in 2018, EPA records show.\n\nThose outputs seem small in comparison to the limits allowed by the Trump rule – more than 265,000 tons annually by 2025, according to EPA models.\n\nA community of mostly Latino and Black residents living adjacent to the plant may be paying the price with their health. Since 1990, an average of 135 Ohio residents die annually from asthma, according to Ohio Department of Health.\n\nThere’s a recreation center, outdoor basketball court and playground next to the coal-fired facility, which originally opened in 1888. The playground attracts children who play near the plant and breathe in emissions.\n\n\"We always played there. We never really paid attention to it. We lived in this area most of our life,\" said Juan Jacquin, 18, whose family moved a couple of blocks closer to the plant in recent months. The odor is noticeably stronger when it runs, he said.\n\nAcross Lake Erie from Painesville, in Michigan, portions of a heavily industrialized area in and around Detroit have failed for years to meet EPA air quality standards for sulfur dioxide.\n\nUnder Trump-administration policies, EPA’s own projections show sulfur dioxide emissions will increase in Michigan by more than 35% over the next five years.\n\nThat disproportionally affects lower-income residents and people of color, many of whom live in neighborhoods in close proximity to a large oil refinery, steel and auto plants, or other factories.\n\nIn Wayne County, which includes Detroit, childhood asthma hospitalization rates are more than 62% higher than the statewide average. In 2017, the mortality rate from asthma among white Michigan residents was 7 deaths per 1 million; for Black residents, it was three times higher – 26 per 1 million.\n\n“It is obvious profits over people is the top agenda item,” said Delores Leonard, a retired educator turned environmental activist in one of Detroit’s most industrialized, most polluted areas.\n\nThe EPA predicts CO2 emissions will increase in Michigan by almost 15% over the next decade, at a time when the Great Lakes region is warming faster than the rest of the contiguous U.S., according to scientists.\n\nA clean energy model, similar to what Biden is touting, shows Michigan emitting 13.9 million fewer tons of carbon dioxide and 10,000 fewer tons of sulfur dioxide in 2035 compared to the ACE rule.\n\n“It’s so upsetting,” said Alyson Melnik, 25, a resident of the factory-lined Detroit suburb of Dearborn. “The EPA no longer stands for anything that protects the environment.”\n\nIt’s not unusual for communities of color to be located near polluting facilities in what environmentalists call \"sacrifice zones.\"\n\nDr. Aaron Bernstein, interim director of climate health and the global environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a pediatric hospitalist at Boston Children's Hospital, said air pollution in the United States disproportionately affects minorities.\n\nBlack and Latino communities are exposed to, “in some studies, 20%, maybe 60% more air pollution,\" he said at a recent conference. Yet \"they produce less. They’re responsible for less. Their behaviors in our society actually consume less goods and services and energy. They’re producing the least and are exposed to the most.”\n\nNationally, 1 in 5 children who have asthma may have developed it from breathing polluted air, Bernstein said.\n\n“I’ve seen more children not be able to breathe in my lifetime than I would like to see in anyone else’s,” he said. “The mother does not care about climate change. She couldn’t give a hoot about what’s going to happen to the planet in 50 years. She wants to know if her child is going to suffocate in front of me.”\n\nWheeler said the EPA wants to improve environmental quality, \"so that we can try to bring down the asthma rates in children. I was a child asthmatic. I think it’s very important to be working on the max attainment.”\n\nWhen asked if more stringent standards would be needed to improve air quality, he said, “The answer isn’t always just to go to more stringent standards until you get everybody to comply with the existing standards that we have.”\n\nWheeler said air pollution is down during Trump’s term in office, but according to an Associated Press analysis last year, federal data showed the nation had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier.\n\nUnder a clean energy model, estimates similar to what the Biden campaign is promoting, Ohio would emit 62.4 million tons less of carbon dioxide by 2035 compared to the ACE rule and nearly 71,000 fewer tons of sulfur dioxide would also no longer enter the air, according to the model.\n\nMarket-based solutions\n\nMany coal-fired plants will likely continue shuttering and dropping off the EPA’s regulatory list. There has been a decline in coal-powered sources because of market forces – in particular, lower-priced natural gas.\n\nAmerican Electric Power closed a coal-fired power plant in Conesville, Ohio, in May, two years ahead of schedule.\n\nIn October, Texas-based Vistra Corp., the company that owns the William H. Zimmer Power Station in Moscow, Ohio, just outside Cincinnati, announced plans to close the plant in 2027 along with other plants across the Midwest.\n\nMichigan’s two largest energy utilities, Consumers Energy and DTE, in recent months announced plans to accelerate the closure of several coal-fired power plants.\n\nConsumers Energy wants to end coal-fired power generation and reduce carbon emissions by more than 90% by 2040. DTE said it will close 11 of its 17 plants in Michigan – including three in the Detroit area – by 2023, and achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century.\n\nCoupled with market forces and more consumer support for renewable energy, the private sector is decarbonizing on its own. But that is \"not a substitute for government action,” said Michael Vandenbergh, a Vanderbilt University professor who is director of the Climate Change Research Network.\n\n“I think after (the election) if we get a Biden administration,\" Vandenbergh said, \"then what we will find is that these corporate commitments will have paved the way for government action, and will provide a gap-filling or complementary role if we get major legislation or a new regulatory program.”\n\nLegal implications of rollbacks\n\nTrump’s policies on the environment and climate have elicited stiff resistance from conservation groups and Democrats. Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than California, where Attorney General Xavier Becerra led the opposition's legal onslaught.\n\nBy mid-October, California was part of coalitions that had launched 106 lawsuits against the Trump administration, 56 of which specifically took on environmental issues.\n\nThis deluge of litigation is aimed to stop rollbacks or halt the promulgation of new, weaker regulations under the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Power Plan, the Endangered Species Act and others.\n\n“Donald Trump’s three worst enemies are the facts, the law and the science,” Becerra said.\n\nIf Biden is elected, many of those 56 lawsuits could become moot. Becerra said he could not think of any environmental policy stance the Trump administration had taken that a hypothetical Biden administration would likely defend.\n\n“A new administration could obviously change their position in litigation, and it’s not uncommon that that happens,” said Mike Landis, an attorney representing advocacy groups including the Public Interest Network and Environment America.\n\nBut the process of getting environmental laws to where they were in 2016 is more complicated and hinges on factors ranging from when the Trump administration unveiled a new policy to what the regulation does.\n\nFor example, a Biden administration could stop defending the ACE rule, which California is challenging in court. But it would be a separate matter to reinstitute the Clean Power Plan after it was repealed in June 2019.\n\n“It wouldn’t be as simple as rolling back the rollback,” Landis said.\n\nFirst, the Biden administration would have to build back the EPA's gutted staff and fix its budget, said Betsy Southerland, former director of Science and Technology at the EPA Office of Water.\n\n\"They're not going to just put things back the way they were in 2016,\" she said. \"They want to initiate aggressive new action on climate change and environmental justice. So no question, this new administration is going to be faced with a massive workload.\"\n\nErasing protections for waterways\n\nPerhaps the rules with the largest implications across states are the revisions to the Clean Water Act.\n\nIn 2015, the Obama administration expanded the federal government’s authority to regulate wetlands and washes when it adopted the regulation called the Waters of the United States rule, or WOTUS.\n\nBy scrapping that rule and adopting its new Navigable Waters Protection Rule, the Trump administration dramatically narrowed the definition of streams and wetlands that fall under federal regulation. Omitted were ephemeral streams that flow seasonally, select intermittent streams that flow after heavy rainfall and wetlands that are not adjacent to bodies of water.\n\n“Almost every single state has their own protections on waterways,\" the EPA's Wheeler said. \"So even if it's not a federal waterway, it doesn't mean it's not protected by the states.\"\n\nThe administration's changes to the waters rule leaves 18% of streams and 51% of wetlands unprotected, according to an EPA staff analysis that used data from the U.S. Geological Survey's national hydrography database.\n\nThe data was not publicized when changes to the rule were proposed. The staff analysis became public after an open records request, Southerland said.\n\nIn other parts of the country, like the arid West, the rates of unprotected waterways are closer to 80% or 90%, Southerland said.\n\nWhen asked about the percentages of waterways across the country left unprotected, Wheeler questioned the figures.\n\n“We've never completely mapped all the waterways,” Wheeler said. “It's just something that can't be quantified at this point in time. … We are mapping waters across the country, but it had never been done before for regulatory purposes. So the numbers are just estimates.”\n\nCalifornia has already sued the EPA over the change and states are reporting a loss of protections, in some cases, of most of their waterways.\n\n“The Clean Water Act is a strong law. It's withstood the test of time, and it's been protecting our waters for 40 years, and now it's not,” said Sandy Bahr, director of the Sierra Club’s Arizona chapter.\n\nIn Arizona, the Obama-era rule would have made “every wash in the state of Arizona jurisdictional because under that rule, you were categorically jurisdictional if you had a bed, bank and a high watermark,” said Cynthia Campbell, Water Resources Management Advisor for the city of Phoenix.\n\n“But the problem is that if you've ever been to Arizona, if you've ever seen our landscape, our landscape is covered with washes and alluvial flows off of our mountain ranges, that can be very small or very large,\" she said.\n\nTrying to sort out whether washes are ephemeral or intermittent will be difficult, Campbell said, \"because we're in a 20-year drought.”\n\nThe new rule could eliminate federal protections for 85% to 90% of Arizona's waterways, Campbell said.\n\nIf the state doesn’t fill in the space left by the federal pullback, developers and mining companies wouldn’t need to apply for certain permits in the future, in one instance potentially easing the way for developers who plan to build huge housing developments near the imperiled San Pedro River.\n\nAfter the change, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality began holding a series of meetings on how to fill the gaps with new state regulations.\n\nWater woes in New England\n\nThe effects of the new water rule will also be felt in the Northeast, said Heather Govern, vice president and director of the clean air and water program of Conservation Law Foundation. She sees the rule as another battle in the war between environmentalists and those defending industrial interests.\n\nIn Massachusetts, an aerial survey in 2000 found 30,000 potential vernal pools, ephemeral wetlands that are dry most of the year and only appear with spring rains. Those pools burst with life, much of it tied exclusively to these small shallow pools and are a vital part of the forest food web.\n\nIn Massachusetts and New England, the Trump move was welcomed by developers, Govern said.\n\n“Anyone building on land abutting wetlands or streams or wanting to build on wetlands and streams (benefitted),” Govern said.\n\nHundreds of scientists conducted over 1,000 research projects to form the scientific basis of the 2015 Clean Water Rule, said Curtis Spalding, a Brown University professor and a former EPA regional administrator. Previously, the burden was on the developer to show that a wetland had no connection to or impact on navigable waters.\n\n“Larger projects tend to have some political support,” he said. “State legislators, under the mistaken idea that somehow it is good for the economy to lose wetlands and compromise water quality will support them for short term gain, but a long term loss.”\n\nMassachusetts Audubon and Conservation Law Foundation joined six other plaintiffs in suing the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in April over the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which the suit called an unreasonably narrow interpretation of the Clean Water Act.\n\nIt’s hard enough to keep development from occurring in a wetland that is invisible for all but a few months of the year, but removing Clean Water Act protections made the job much harder, Govern said. Over the past couple of decades the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection has suffered cutbacks to staffing.\n\n“It’s a matter of resources,” said Govern. Even though Massachusetts has strong clean water laws of its own, there are streams and water bodies that have traditionally fallen under federal protection. Without that protection, \"it falls back onto the state.\"\n\nThe case for water: a life force\n\nA mile of stream winds through part of Donna Schwab’s 55-acre property in North Lewisburg, Ohio, located nearly 40 miles northwest of Columbus.\n\nFarmers channeled parts of the stream into a straight ditch decades ago. It's slowly recovering, beginning to wind through portions of the property.\n\n“It was a question of whether it would be covered by the ephemeral streams of the WOTUS rule,” said Anthony Sasson, a research associate at Midwest Biodiversity Institute, which monitors aquatic resources across Ohio and the Midwest.\n\nBiologists found the stream has value. Trees line the banks, providing shade again. Fish swim in pools along sections of the stream while the creek bed dries out in other portions. But the water, and life with it, exist just below the surface.\n\nThe stream, and how it’s defined, has now become a political and environmental issue under the revised WOTUS rule.\n\nIn Ohio, there are an estimated 36,000 miles of ephemeral streams like Schwab's unnamed one that are not protected under the Trump administration’s rule.\n\nOhio EPA has since moved to cover ephemeral streams and Sasson said the state's rule was an improvement over the federal rule.\n\nCritics of the regulations, including developers and coal mine operators, argue that some of the streams are so small that a person can jump from bank to bank or don’t have water in them all year. They contend the streams aren’t worth protecting and only impede farm operations and other economic development.\n\n“(It has) very little effect on water quality and we don’t feel we should have to deal with it,” said Mike Cope, president of the Ohio Coal Association.\n\nFor decades, Ohio EPA sent teams of biologists out to water basins throughout the state to take a census of the wildlife. Certain fish and bugs cannot exist when pollution is present. The wildlife assessment allows biologists to take the pulse of the stream and measure its health.\n\nThe tributaries, although small, feed into larger bodies of water.\n\n“If you take a heart in a human body, it's an important organ, right? But it can't function alone without all the tributaries, the veins and blood vessels that bring the blood to and from it,” said Schwab who retired from work as a wildlife biologist from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.\n\nSchwab's stream has never been assessed by state biologists, but when an independent group from Midwest Biodiversity Institute came to sample water quality they found the conservation work paid off. There were 17 species of fish and 43 species of insects.\n\nConservation experts say everything is connected. Wetlands and streams provide food and habitat for fish and wildlife and act to curb floods and erosion said Mažeika Sullivan, director of the Schiermeier Olentangy River Wetland Research Park at Ohio State University.\n\n\"But they also provide natural products for human use,\" he said, \"drinking water is the most important among them.\"\n\nThere are already examples that can illustrate the potential damage.\n\n\"One of the most well-known examples of connectivity, and across broad spatial scales is the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. This is largely attributed to nitrogen and phosphorus coming from fertilizer runoff from Midwestern fields, enters smaller streams,\" Sullivan said.\n\n\"They make their way to larger streams, they make their way to the Mississippi River, and then eventually down into the Gulf of Mexico, hundreds of miles away, right? This has led to harmful algal blooms, biological deserts.

It’s putting our homelands and historic sites underwater, disrupting how we harvest crops, catch fish and raise livestock. It’s raising our risks of diseases and disrupting how we run our businesses and cities.\n\nAs the planet changes, Americans are changing with it. Some will reinvent old ways to survive in a new world. Others won’t have time, or space, to adapt.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released new conclusions Monday about the warming planet that move past recent reports on how scientists know humans are largely to blame and what the changes will mean, and on to outlining what can be done now to minimize, or mitigate, global consequences.\n\nThe report is the 14th contribution from the IPCC's Working Group III, a network of 278 scientists from 65 countries who have been working since 2017 to evaluate options for limiting climate change by preventing or capturing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe previous report from the panel, released Feb. 28 by its Working Group II, focused on impacts and vulnerabilities of natural and socio-economic systems. The IPCC's current sixth cycle of expert reports began in August 2021, when Working Group I summarized the latest science on the physical basis and causes of climate change.\n\nTo compile the 3,600-page document, authors reviewed more than 18,000 scientific papers and considered more than 60,000 comments from governments and experts. Their recommendations stem from one central conclusion, stated during Monday's news conference by Jim Skea, the working group's co-chair and a professor of sustainable energy at Imperial College London:\n\n\"We are definitely not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\"\n\nMore:Population growth brings greater climate risks to metro areas, report says, but also hope\n\nLimiting the average increase in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) has been an international goal since scientists estimated, and outlined in a special 2018 IPCC report, the figure as the threshold beyond which the impacts of climate change would be more damaging, permanent and difficult to address.\n\nWith the lag in action that has occurred since, the new report estimates that the chances of that goal being met are only 38%, and even that is possible only \"when traveling the most ambitious pathway.\"\n\nThe reality, Skea said, is that the greenhouse gas emissions known to be causing global warming have never been higher. In 2019, atmospheric concentrations of these molecules — that boost average temperatures by absorbing solar energy — was 12% higher than in 2010 and 54% higher than in 1990. The most common greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, primarily emitted through the burning of fossil fuels, though methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated gases and water vapor also contribute to warming.\n\nScientists say past events can help predict next climate change 'tipping points'\n\nBut while these results lock in some daunting challenges in terms of worsening drought, intensifying storms and heat, disruptions to agriculture and supply chains and more, the report still spells out hope if changes are implemented quickly.\n\n\"There is increased evidence of climate action,\" Skea added. \"An increased range of policies and laws have enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and accelerated the deployment of renewable energy. And climate laws that result in reduced or avoided emissions are present in 56 countries covering more than half of global emissions.\"\n\nRead our climate series:Phoenix isn't what it once was because of climate change. But it's not too late to save it\n\nThe path forward, according to authors now willing to make bolder statements than those typically issued by IPCC experts previously (though not as bold as some would like), is through rapid political shifts and a revolution in clean energy and electrification.\n\n\"Visionary political decisions and concrete actions are needed for the sake of the welfare of current and future generations and our biosphere,\" said Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, during Monday's news conference. \"I hope that this information will be used by the governments in different parts of the world to proceed with mitigation.\"\n\nThe report offers four central, actionable takeaway messages for climate change mitigation:\n\nPhase out fossil fuels\n\nOne reason the new report is able to take a bolder stance on necessary actions for climate mitigation than the previous, 5th report from Working Group III is that advances in clean energy technology have made the transition to renewable sources more logistically and economically feasible than what 2014 assessments anticipated.\n\nThis development led António Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, to conclude at Monday's news conference that \"investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness.\"\n\nThe main source of the greenhouse gas emissions known to be driving rising average temperatures and cascading climate impacts is the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, primarily for transportation and energy use.\n\nThe IPCC report calls for a new goal of halving global emissions by the year 2030, and it estimates the goal can be met for less than $20 per ton of CO2-equivalent. Costs of solar and wind energy and batteries have decreased by up to 85% since 2010, the report news release reads.\n\nYet investments in fossil fuel infrastructure maintenance or even expansion continue while funding renewable energy advances lags behind, despite promising climate and economic benefits. A report summary from the climate action nonprofit Climate Nexus estimates that public, private, domestic and international financing of renewables are currently three to six times lower than they must be to limit future warming to below even 2 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"This report tells us that we're still not doing enough to cut greenhouse gas emissions,\" said Inger Anderson, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, during Monday's IPCC news conference. \"The last decade showed the highest increase in greenhouse gas emissions, even though we know the trouble we are in.\"\n\nCut and capture carbon\n\nWhile reducing reliance on fossil fuels will help cut emissions, the report is firm that other options for lowering greenhouse gas concentrations must also be pursued.\n\nThough less dense in the atmosphere than CO2, methane, or CH4, is a potent greenhouse gas. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that its warming influence is 25 times greater than that of CO2 over a 100-year period and that, in 2019, it accounted for 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nA majority of methane comes from agricultural activity, fossil fuel production and waste management. Improved use of already-available technologies to limit leaks from these sources could reduce methane emissions by 50-80%, the report's summary for policymakers suggests.\n\nWhat is Arizona not doing:The EPA released state-specific emissions reports. Arizona isn't on the list\n\nThe report also recommends that research into niche technologies for emissions reduction and carbon capture and storage continue. Trapping and removing greenhouse gases, such as CO2 and CH4, from the atmosphere or directly from their sources has enthusiastic supporters and skeptics. The IPCC report doesn't label capture and storage a silver bullet, but encourages ongoing investments into possible options for safely sequestering emitted carbon deep underground or elsewhere.\n\n\"Overall, there is substantial potential for emissions reductions,\" said Diana Ürge-Vorsatz, vice-chair of the working group and a professor of Environmental Sciences and Policy at the Central European University, at Monday's news briefing. \"But this depends on decarbonizing the power sector.\"\n\nElectrify everything\n\nIt follows that if nations phase out fossil fuels and focus on limiting greenhouse gas emissions, they will need another source of energy. The new report's summary for policymakers spells out that any chance of limiting warming to non-catastrophic levels is a future in which \"in 2050, almost all electricity is supplied from zero- or low-carbon sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage, combined with increased electrification of energy demand.\"\n\nUrban environments, where large buildings could switch to using renewable energy and public transit could run on improved batteries, are the setting in which this shift would pay greatest dividends. Shipping, air and car travel could also eventually be electrified. The report recognizes challenges in the environmental impacts of mining the critical minerals needed for electric car batteries, but puts stock in technological advances minimizing those drawbacks to full electrification.\n\n\"The energy sector accounts for about a third of all emissions and major transitions are required to limit global warming,\" Ürge-Vorsatz said Monday. \"There is untapped potential here to bring down global emissions by between 40 and 70% by 2050, but only if the necessary policies, infrastructure and technologies are in place.\"\n\nThe report's conclusion on progress toward this goal since its last report, however, was less than sunny.\n\n\"On the green scorecard, we failed loud and clear,\" Anderson said. \"The solution has to be to kickstart the transition to renewable and cleaner sources of energy. We have the knowledge and the technology to get this done.\"\n\nIn Arizona, the potential for solar energy expansion and its benefits not only for climate mitigation but also the economy and job production may be especially high, according to IPCC author and Northern Arizona University professor Kevin Gurney.\n\n\"Arizona is at the lead of what I see as the opportunity associated with climate change,\" Gurney wrote in response to emailed interview questions. \"We must be at the forefront of new green technology, better community design, and more equity in how the problem is tackled. There is an opportunity for jobs in new green technology. We must take advantage of that head-start and not allow politics and lack of vision to put us behind.\"\n\nPublic engagement can make the difference politics hasn't\n\nThough not always stated in terms as specific as the need to divest from fossil fuels, reduce emissions and transition to renewable energy, the latest IPCC report was clear on how political inaction and lack of public pressure for it have paralyzed climate mitigation more than any limitation in technology, funding or scientific knowledge.\n\n“We are at a crossroads. The decisions we make now can secure a livable future,” IPCC co-chair Hoesung Lee said in a statement released Monday. “There are policies, regulations and market instruments that are proving effective. If these are scaled up and applied more widely and equitably, they can support deep emissions reductions and stimulate innovation.”\n\nPower of the people:The power of the sun, of the people and of politics. The climate depends on all 3\n\nThis must be done with environmental justice in mind, Lee said. Recent reports from all three IPCC working groups have emphasized the many ways in which climate change is caused by higher-emitting individuals but felt most by lower-income ones. Mitigation efforts have the potential to benefit some Indigenous peoples, minority groups or other marginalized populations much less, or even have negative impacts if policy fails to keep all of humanity in mind.\n\n\"How can the world speed up emissions reductions in a just and equitable manner?\" Lee said.\n\nThe burden for change and action falls on the wealthier and more connected members of society, Ürge-Vorsatz answered, not shying away from themes that international, national and community conversations about climate change consequences have often left unsaid.\n\nActions the public can take include:\n\nSupporting movements to end fossil-fuel subsidies and drive down the costs of renewable energy technologies,\n\nReducing personal emissions by taking public transit and using less energy at home,\n\nHelping to fund sustainability research and education efforts,\n\nAnd voting for representatives who also do all of these things.\n\n\"Every urban planning decision in a rapidly growing urban area like Phoenix must be considered very carefully and with climate change as part of the menu of decision attributes,\" said Gurney, who contributed to the report's chapter on \"Urban systems and other settlements.\"\n\nGuterres, the U.N. secretary-general, distilled the essence of the IPCC's latest report on climate mitigation into this statement on Monday:\n\n\"Leaders must lead. But all of us can do our part. Demand an end to coal-fired power. Demand an end to all fossil fuel subsidies. Climate goals and plans must be turned into action, now. It's time to stop burning our planet and invest in renewable energy all around us.\"\n\nJoan Meiners is the Climate News and Storytelling Reporter at The Arizona Republic and azcentral.

World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is the defending champion; world No. 3 Jon Rahm won the 2021 U.S. Open and finished fourth at the 2018 Masters. World No. 2 Rory McIlroy, one of the most outspoken opponents of LIV and a four-time major winner, needs only a Masters win to compete golf's career Grand Slam. McIlroy finished second at Augusta last year.\n\nAnd then there's 15-time major winner Tiger Woods, who is always the center of attention no matter where he plays, but especially at the Masters, which he has won five times, most recently in 2019.

Mickelson was asked whether he felt his Masters performance won back some of those fans but didn't show an interest in answering the question. In fact, Mickelson cut off the reporter before the question was finished.\n\n\"They are separate issues,\" Mickelson said. \"Golf and the professional golf ecosystem and how that's been handled throughout my career. Two totally separate things.\"\n\nLIV Golf sent 18 players to the Masters and three registered high finishes. Mickelson and Brooks Koepka finished tied for second at 8-under and Patrick Reed was one stroke behind at 7-under.\n\nJon Rahm motivated by Spanish history, golfers Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal\n\nBy his own admission, Jon Rahm might not be playing golf had it not been for the rich history of Spanish golfers — especially Seve Ballesteros, who died in 2011.\n\nRahm, who with his Masters victory joined Ballesteros as the only golfers representing Spain to win two different majors, took home the green jacket Sunday — on the 40th anniversary of Ballesteros' second Masters win in 1983. Sunday also would have been Ballesteros' 66th birthday.\n\n\"History of the game is a big part of why I play,\" Rahm told Jim Nantz on the CBS broadcast. \"Seve is one of them. If it hadn't been for that Ryder Cup win in 1997 ... I don't know where I'd be so for me to get it done on the 40th anniversary of his win, his birthday on Easter Sunday, it's incredibly meaningful.\"\n\nRahm was also congratulated on the 18th green Sunday by Jose Maria Olazabal, who won Masters titles while representing Spain in 1994 and 1999.\n\nJon Rahm celebrates with wife, kids and receives green jacket\n\nAfter sinking his par putt on the 18th hole, Jon Rahm shared a special moment with his wife, Kelley, and two young sons just seconds after becoming a Masters champion.\n\nRahm and his family made the walk back to the clubhouse where he received his green jacket from Scottie Scheffler, the 2022 champion.\n\nRahm said it wasn't one moment that turned his way during Sunday's final round but said late charges by Phil Mickelson and Jordan Spieth lit a fire under him.\n\n\"Phil and Jordan were making birdies and finishing strong,\" Rahm told Jim Nantz on the CBS broadcast. \"They were finishing the round as we were finishing 10. So making sure I didn't put myself in difficult sports was key.\n\n\"It's not really one moment, but I would say hitting that draw perfectly on 13 was the start of it.\"\n\nBrooks Koepka: 'I was just average'\n\nBrooks Koepka said he \"was just average today\" after finishing in a tie for second place at the Masters, behind winner Jon Rahm.\n\nKoepka held a two-stroke lead to start the final round but stumbled through the front nine Sunday and allowed Rahm to overtake him.\n\n\"I didn't get any good breaks,\" Koepka said on the CBS broadcast after the final round. \"On the par threes, I hit some good shots but they ended up in bad spots, and that's how it goes sometimes. But I don't feel like I played too bad and obviously wasn't good enough. Congrats to Jon.\"\n\nKoepka finished 8-under for the tournament, tied with three-time Masters winner Phil Mickelson. Both Koepka and Mickelson left the PGA Tour for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour.\n\nJon Rahm rallies to win green jacket\n\nJon Rahm shot a 3-under 69 in the final round to win his first Masters championship, erasing a two-stroke lead held by Brooks Koepka to start the final round.\n\nRahm finished the tournament 12-under to win the second major tournament of his career. The Arizona State product also won the 2021 U.S. Open.\n\nKoepka's score was as low as 13-under before losing momentum at the end of the third round. He then faltered on the front nine in Sunday's final round to finish 8-under for the tournament. Rahm, who was consistently near the top of the leaderboard all week, took advantage to claim his green jacket at Augusta National.\n\nKoepka birdies No. 16, Rahm leads by three with two holes left\n\nBrooks Koepka made a clutch birdie putt on the par-3 16th to move into solo second place at 9-under with two holes to play. Jon Rahm led by three strokes after making par at No. 16.\n\nKoepka had a two-stroke lead on Rahm earlier in the day but faltered in the front nine, allowing Rahm to take control. Koepka did overtake Mickelson (-8) with his birdie on No. 16.\n\nMeanwhile, amateur Sam Bennett finished at 2-under for the tournament, the lowest for an amateur this week. He was in the final grouping Saturday and was 8-under after Friday's second round.\n\nRahm looks dominant, extends lead on No. 14\n\nJon Rahm extended his lead with a birdie on No. 14 to take a four-stroke lead with four holes remaining. Rahm's birdie was just the fifth one all day on the par-4 hole.\n\nRahm (-12) hit a magnificent second shot from the right of the fairway that drifted along a ridge and wound up in prime position for the Arizona State product to make a steady birdie putt.\n\nBrooks Koepka, meanwhile, made a bogey after three-putting No. 14. He sits at 7-under through 14 holes. Koepka was 13-under when third-round play resumed Friday.\n\nPhil Mickelson holds second place solo at 8-under with a round of 65 Friday.\n\nKoepka makes a mess of No. 12; Rahm stays steady\n\nBrooks Koepka's erratic play in the final round at Augusta National continued on the par-3 No. 12, when his tee shot sailed well left of the landing target on the green past Rae's Creek. He then tried to chip onto the putting surface but left it short on the fringe. He then two-putted to drop a stroke to 7-under par. More importantly, with Phil Mickelson's aggressive charge up the leaderboard earlier in the afternoon, the bogey dropped Koepka into a tie for third place, with Mickelson in sole possession of second at 8-under.\n\nJon Rahm, though, continued his clean round, landing the tee shot at No. 12 on the green. He then hit a confident putt that put his par attempt well within reach. He retained his two-stoke lead, at 10-under par.\n\nKoepka drops another stroke and Rahm does, too; Mickelson charges up the leaderboard\n\nNot only is Brooks Koepka still searching for his first birdie since No. 8 in the third round, he's simply trying to stop the bleeding. Kopeka posted his third bogey of the front nine after he had to three-putt at No. 9, to move 8-under par and fall into a tie for second place.\n\nIt could've been worse for Koepka, as Jon Rahm dropped his first stroke of the day at No. 9 when he misread the speed on his par putt. Rahm still has a two-stroke lead at 10-under as the final pairing makes the turn.\n\nAt No. 10, both Rahm and Koepka saved pars, though Koepka had to work harder for his after he misfired on his first two shots of the hole.\n\nElsewhere, Phil Mickelson started the day 1-under par and fired up the leaderboard, shooting a 65 in the final round, his lowest Masters final round ever, to finish 8-under par. Mickelson birdied five of his last seven holes.\n\nThat shot him up into a tie with Koepka for second.\n\nRahm extends lead on Koepka with 10 holes to go\n\nBrooks Kopeka (-9) is still searching for his first birdie since No. 8 in the third round, which took place earlier on Sunday because of a weather delay Saturday. And after Koepka's tee shot on No. 8 went into the pine straw, he had to punch out and scramble just to save par.\n\nThe problem for Koepka is that Jon Rahm is gaining more and more momentum, playing cleanly and finding greens. After he had parred four consecutive holes, Rahm posted his second birdie of the day at No. 8 to move to 11-under par and gain a two-stroke lead on Koepka.\n\nSpieth makes move; logjam of players tied for fourth\n\nIf not for two bogeys on the front nine, Jordan Spieth would be in contention for the lead. Still, he converted his seventh birdie of the day at No. 15 to move into sole possession of third place at 7-under par.\n\nJust below him on the leaderboard, defending champion Scottie Scheffler posted his fourth birdie of the final round, thanks to a resurgent putter, after he sunk a 40-footer at No. 11.\n\nThere are now seven players currently tied for fourth at 6-under par. Phil Mickelson has played aggressively, landing on the green in two shots on two different par-5s on the back-9.\n\nSahith Theegala is another one of those seven, after he chipped in his second shot on No. 16 to notch his seventh birdie of the day. In fact, the chip in looked eerily similar in terms of location and roll to Tiger Woods' iconic chip in from nearlthe same spot back in 2005.\n\nScheffler, though, may be in trouble after he sailed his tee shot on No. 12.\n\nA change atop the leaderboard; Hovland melts down on No. 6\n\nJon Rahm has now overtaken Brooks Koepka atop the leaderboard at Augusta National. As Koepka continues to struggle in locating his approach shots and misread his putts, Rahm has been steady, converting three consecutive pars to stay at 10-under par.\n\nKoepka, however, has bogeyed two of his last three holes, including No. 6, to drop to 9-under. As weather conditions have warmed, the green surfaces are drying and Koepka is failing to read the breaks. Overhead winds have also contributed to his iron shots missing the greens.\n\nInterestingly enough, there's a sudden logjam in a tie for third place, with four players staying four strokes off the lead. Among them, Viktor Hovland three-putted on No. 6 to double bogey and Jordan Spieth converted his seventh birdie of the day at No. 14.\n\nKoepka's lead gone after shaky putt on No. 4\n\nBrooks Koepka, who started the final round with a two-stroke lead, has seen that edge evaporate after a shaky start. He has been unsteady with his putter, pulled his tee shot on No. 1 well left and has missed with his irons.\n\nAt No. 4, Koepka's tee shot with a 5-iron found the bunker in front of the green, forcing him to spend a second shot to get it on the green. His playing partner, Jon Rahm, landed his tee shot on the green and missed a birdie putt that would've given him a co-lead. He settled for par to stay at 10-under par, but ended up in a tie atop the leaderboard anyway. Koepka, muffed his par putt and dropped a stroke with a bogey, his first of the final round.\n\nKopeka's putter lets him down and Rahm capitalizes\n\nLeader Brooks Koepka and Jon Rahm both found the greenside bunker on No. 2 and both saw their putters let them down for a gettable birdie. Rahm misread the speed and left his short, while Koepka aimed just a touch left, seeing the ball curve around the cup. Both settled for par, which marked the 12 consecutive hole that neither player had shaved a stroke off his score.\n\nOn No. 3, however, Rahm (-10) secured a birdie to cut Koepka's lead (-11) to one. Minutes before Rahm sank his short left-to-right birdie putt, Koepka was facing a downhill putt and thought it would roll faster than it did; he left it short and had to settle for par.\n\nOne player just outside to watch is Russell Henley, who birdied two of his first four holes to drop his score to 7-under par, which places him fourth and four strokes off the lead. In particular, Henley has made the charge with his putter\n\nKoepka's drive on No. 1 finds fairway ... on No. 9\n\nPerhaps it was jitters, but current leader Brooks Koepka (-11) hooked his drive off of the first tee so far left that it landed on the fairway of the ninth hole, setting up a blind second shot over the tree line. Koepka recovered well, however, and took advantage of rain-soaked greens, with his second shot landing softly on the putting surface. Koepka's lengthy birdie putt set up an easy par tap-in, which is a fortuitous conclusion, all things considered.\n\nJon Rahm, in second at 9-under, misfired on his approach shot at No. 1, having it trickle right of the green. He nearly holed his chip, though eventually saved par.\n\nViktor Hovland, who also pushed his first drive well left, saved par on No. 1 and remains third at 8-under par.\n\nSecond-to-last pairing tees off, Hovland starts round in rough\n\nIn the second-to-last pairing to tee off in the final round, Viktor Hovland -- starting at 8-under par and needing to make a charge to catch leader Brooks Koepka (-11) and Jon Rahm (-9) -- blasted his driver on No. 1 left into the tree line where the patrons were gathered.\n\nJordan Spieth's final round has been marked by inconsistency. Through seven, he has posted three birdies, two bogeys and two pars. He is currently 2-under par, tied for 21st in the field.\n\nElsewhere, Sahith Theegala almost certainly won't be able to charge up to the top of the leaderboard, but he's finishing his round strong; Theegala has three birdies on the front nine to lower his score to 4-under par, tied for 8th place.\n\nTiger Woods withdraws from Masters due to injury\n\nTiger Woods said he was in \"constant\" pain during the 2023 Masters, but the pain became too much to bear. The five-time Masters champion withdrew from Augusta National before third-round play resumed on Sunday due to injury.\n\nWoods finished the first 36 holes at 3-over on Saturday to make the cut for the 23rd consecutive time, tying the record shared by Gary Player and Fred Couples.\n\nBut he got off to a slow start to the third round on Saturday and was visibly in pain, laboring to walk in the cold and wet conditions. He recorded two bogeys and two double bogeys through seven holes, before play was suspended for the day at 3:15 p.m. ET due to a torrential downpour. He dropped to last place on Saturday at 6-over in the third round and 9-over for the tournament.\n\n-- Cydney Henderson\n\nTee times set for Sunday's final round of the Masters at Augusta National\n\nBrooks Koepka and Jon Rahm will tee off in final grouping at 2:33 p.m. as the fourth round of the 87th Masters has begun.\n\nGolfers returned to Augusta National early Sunday morning to complete the rain-delayed third round. Following a brief stoppage of play to reset the pin positions, the fourth round is now underway with players starting on the first and 10th tees.\n\nTee times for the third-round leaders:\n\nGroup 11, 2:05 p.m.: Collin Morikawa (-4), a-Sam Bennett (-4)\n\nGroup 12, 2:14 p.m.: Hideki Matsuyama (-5), Russell Henley (-5)\n\nGroup 13, 2:24 p.m.: Viktor Hovland (-8), Patrick Cantlay (-6)\n\nGroup 14, 2:33 p.m.: Brooks Koepka (-11), Jon Rahm (-9)\n\na-amateur\n\nBrooks Koepka begins Masters' final round with 2-shot lead\n\nA bogey on the par-4 17th hole cut Brooks Koepka's lead to just two shots heading into the final 18 holes at the 87th Masters. Koepka had just saved par from the sand on 16 as Jon Rahm bogeyed to see his advantage grow to three shots.\n\nBut he gave the stroke back on 17 by three-putting as the field completed the rain-delayed third round early Sunday.\n\nKoepka finished his 1-over round of 73 with a routine par on 18. Rahm also shot 73 as the two maintained their positioning from Round 2.\n\nViktor Hovland shot a 2-under 70 to finish three strokes off the lead. He'll be paired with Patrick Cantlay, who shot 4-under 68 to get to 6 under.\n\nKoepka has had the 54-hole lead in three career major tournaments. He's won all three.\n\nViktor Hovland making morning charge\n\nFirst-round co-leader Viktor Hovland of Norway struggled out of the gate in the third round, bogeying four of his first 10 holes. But he's making up for it in a big way with the round resuming Sunday morning.\n\nBeginning on hole No. 11, Hovland strung together five consecutive birdies -- including a chip-in at the par-3 12th -- to move into sole possession of third place at 8 under for the tournament, four strokes behind leader Brooks Koepka.\n\nLeaders hit Amen Corner in Round 3\n\nA bogey on the par-3 12th hole dropped leader Brooks Koepka's lead to one stroke as the Masters leaders headed into Augusta National's most famous holes Sunday morning.\n\nHowever, on the very next hole -- the par-5 13th -- Jon Rahm hit his layup shot in the far front of the green and three-putted for a bogey to drop him to 10 under. Koepka's two-putt par extended his lead back to two strokes.\n\nBrooks Koepka's lead over Jon Rahm shrinks\n\nBrooks Koepka opened the resumption of third-round play Sunday with a bogey on the par-4 seventh hole, but then went birdie, par and saved par on No. 10. Jon Rahm opened with birdies on No. 7 and the par-5 eighth and then parred the next two holes to trail Koepka by two through 10 on Sunday.\n\nWhen will play resume on Sunday at the Masters?\n\nThird round action resumed at Augusta National on Sunday at 8:30 a.m. ET. No player had completed their third round when play was called on Saturday. The fourth round is expected to begin later in the afternoon, around 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\nHow to watch the Masters on Sunday\n\nLive coverage of the Masters will resume on CBS from 2-7 p.m. ET.\n\nFeatured groups and holes can be streamed via Masters.com and ESPN+. Streaming is also available via CBSSports.com and the CBS Sports app, as well as through Paramount+.\n\nWill weather be an issue on Sunday?\n\nWeather has been a big story at the Masters, but there appears be a break on Sunday. The Weather Channel forecast calls for mostly cloudy or partly cloudy skies with only a 2% chance of precipitation. The temperatures were to be 45 as play resumed, with a high of 63 at 6 p.m. ET.\n\nPlay was called early on Friday and Saturday because of rain, and three trees came down on Friday, but no one was hurt. No precipitation is in the forecast for Monday, if play has to be extended to a fifth day.\n\nA Brooks Koepka win could be nightmare for Augusta National's leaders\n\nLIV Golf’s Brooks Koepka is having himself quite a tournament at the Masters.\n\nAll this focusing on crashing trees, sodden grass and ominous skies seems to be prolonging the inevitable: what could be a day of great angst for the powers that be in men’s golf, the day when a man who was kicked off the PGA Tour last year for taking Saudi blood money dons a green jacket as the winner of the first major of the year.\n\nKoepka, 32, still has 12 holes to play in the third round before a full 18 in the fourth round Sunday, but he certainly was in command Saturday with a four-stroke lead over Spain’s Jon Rahm. Koepka managed one birdie and five pars during the miserable cold and rain over his first six holes of the third round to reach 13-under-par for the tournament, four better than Rahm, who had a birdie, two bogeys and three pars.\n\n-- Christine Brennan\n\nMasters payout for winner\n\nThis year, the total purse of the 2023 Masters is $18 million, up $3 million from last year.\n\nThe winner will take home $3.24 million.

He hit a bogey on No. 1 and No. 2 to bring him to 6-under for the tournament. Maybe it’s the inclement weather? Maybe it’s nerves? But Bennett rebounded on No. 3 with a par.\n\nHe’s slipped to fourth place and is tied with American Phil Mickelson and Norwegian Viktor Hovland. Koepka sits atop the leaderboard at 13-under for the tournament.\n\nScottie Scheffler is seeking to defend his Masters title. On Saturday, the American star rebounded from a shaky Friday performance that left him with a score of +3. He started the third round Saturday at tee No. 10 and was able to bring his score to -1.\n\nThe 2023 Masters Tournament has been a mixed bag for members of LIV Golf competing against the PGA Tour stars they abandoned for the Saudi-backed league.\n\nFor Brooks Koepka, things couldn't be going better. The four-time major champion has his sights set on No. 5 after ending his second round atop the leaderboard.\n\nHere's the LIV golfers who made the cut at the Masters:\n\nBrooks Koepka: -12\n\nJoaquin Niemann: -4\n\nPhil Mickelson: -4\n\nPatrick Reed: -3\n\nDustin Johnson: -1\n\nHarold Varner III: -1\n\nAbraham Ancer: -1\n\nCameron Smith: Even\n\nMito Pereira: Even\n\nTalor Gooch: +2\n\nThomas Pieters: +3\n\n— Jace Evans\n\nTiger Woods made the cut by the skin of his teeth after a rain delay pushed the end of the second round to Saturday morning. This is his 23rd straight time making the cut at the Masters.\n\nThe five-time Masters champion will continue play Saturday afternoon in the third round at 1:06 p.m. ET from tee No. 10. He will play in the last wave of the day with Thomas Pieters and Sungjae Im.\n\nTiger Woods makes cut as second round wraps up\n\nTiger Woods' streak of 23 straight made cuts at the Masters came to fruition after the five-time champion finished the first 36 holes at 3-over-par. The consecutive cuts ties the record shared by Gary Player and Fred Couples.\n\nWoods began the day with a chance to play the weekend and was comfortably above the cut line when he made a birdie on the Par 5 No. 15. But he bogeyed the last two holes and had to wait for the cut line to move as Justin Thomas finished with two straight bogeys to secure Woods' spot.\n\nBrooks Koepka (12-under) goes into Saturday's action on top of the leaderboard after Friday's action was suspended due to inclement weather. He holds a two-shot lead over Jon Rahm. Amateur Sam Bennett is alone in third at 8-under, followed by Collin Morikawa and Viktor Hovland at 6-under.\n\nTiger Woods finishes second round at 3-over, outside projected cut line\n\nWoods' approach on No. 17 was an adventure as his tee shot went wide right on the par-4 440-yard hole, but battled back to get within six feet of a par, and he missed it, going back to 2-over.\n\nOn 18, another par-4, Woods hit the ball left of the fairway and was left with a 50 foot for par.\n\nWoods finishes his second round at 1-over with two birdies and three bogeys and will likely need players above him to falter to get a new projected cut line so he can play through the weekend.\n\nOn the updated leaderboard, Jon Rahm is still two shots from the lead after bogeying 16. Brooks Koepka remains the 36-hole leader at 12-under.\n\nTiger Woods makes second birdie of round, Jon Rahm inches closer to lead\n\nWoods had a chance to make up some ground on the 550-yard Par 5 15th hole, and hit the fairway on his first shot, leaving him 277 yards from the hole. He made a 27-foot put for birdie to give him some breathing room and gave the crowd a nice fist pump. On 16, one of the five holes that has played over par through two rounds, Tiger made a seven-foot putt for par and sits at +1.\n\nRahm, who finished Friday three shots off the lead, got off to a good start, making birdie on the Par 3 No. 12, and making pars on No. 13 and 14.\n\nTiger Woods resumes second round, pars first two holes to remain at 2-over\n\nWoods got through 12 holes during Friday's round and started early on Saturday trying to stay above the cut line. On the par-5 No. 13, Woods got in good position with a chance for a birdie from 15 yards out, but settled for par and remains at 2-over. On 14, he made a four-yard put to save for another par.\n\n63-year-old Fred Couples could make history\n\nIt appears that Fred Couples will be playing the rest of the weekend at the Masters.\n\nThe 1992 champion finished his second round with a bogey, leaving him at 1-over for the championship and inside the projected cut line. That would make the 63-year-old Couples the oldest player to make the cut at Augusta National, beating the mark that Bernhard Langer set during the 2020 tournament by about 3 ½ months.\n\nIt also would be the 31st career cut for Couples, trailing only Jack Nicklaus’ record of 37.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nPlay has resumed at Masters\n\nSome of the golfers who have yet to complete their second round have hit the course at the Masters on Saturday after play was suspended on Friday due to inclement weather. Tee times have not been posted for the third round.\n\nAnother LIV golfer withdraws\n\nA second golfer who plays on the LIV tour has withdrawn from the Masters. Louis Oosthuizen, who has one PGA Tour win, the 2010 British Open, won't finish the weekend due to injury.\n\nThe South African completed 17 holes of his second round and finished at 7-over, mostly likely missing the cut anyway. Kevin Na, a fellow LIV golfer, withdrew after nine holes on Thursday.\n\nSix other LIV golfers, including four who haven't completed their second round, are in danger of missing the cut, based on the projected cut line of 2-over.\n\nAugusta National takes big risk after trees crash down at Masters\n\nAugusta National Golf Club and the Masters got very lucky Friday afternoon when the three trees that crashed to the ground near the 17th hole missed dozens of fans gathered nearby.\n\nYet no more than 90 minutes after the incident, the Masters announced that ticket gates for spectators would open as scheduled Saturday morning at 7 a.m. In other words, fans will be back on the grounds in droves and it will be business as usual at the first men’s major golf tournament of the year.\n\nClearly, the leaders of Augusta National are gambling that in the midst of severe weather that is expected to continue throughout Friday evening, including heavy rain and high winds, all their other trees — thousands of them — are safe and stable and nothing like this will happen again.\n\n— Christine Brennan\n\nHow to watch the Masters on Saturday\n\nESPN is set to air the restarted second round action beginning at 8 a.m. ET. CBS will have live coverage of the Masters from 3 p.m.-7 p.m. ET.\n\nThe resumption of the second round and the third round can be live streamed at CBSSports.com, ESPN+, Paramount+, Masters Live and the CBS Sports app.\n\nWhat time does the Masters resume on Saturday?\n\nThe second round is scheduled to resume at 8 a.m. ET Saturday morning, with the third round to follow — though more rain and storms are in the forecast for the entirety of the day.\n\nKoepka is back in championship form at the Masters\n\nBrooks Koepka is back. But given which side of the professional golf schism he landed on, you better catch him while you can.\n\nEven if Koepka wins this Masters for his fifth major championship — and it’s looking pretty good with a three-shot lead in the clubhouse when officials suspended the round due to inclement weather — the next time you’ll see him (or won't see him, more likely) will be later this month in Adelaide, Australia, or the following week in Singapore. Back to the easy, breezy LIV Golf anti-grind that is so obviously beneath his talent and incapable of satisfying his hunger to be remembered as one of the greats of all time.\n\nIt would be a welcome development if golf has entered a second era where Koepka feels like a threat every time he tees it up at a big event. He’s that electric of a player and competitor. But in golf’s current fractured state, he only gets four chances a year to beat the players he most wants to beat.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nWhat other LIV Golf players are projected to make the cut?\n\nWith the cut line currently standing at 2-over par, 10 members of the LIV Golf Series would make the cut as things stand entering Saturday.\n\nKoepka, of course, is a shoo-in, and Phil Mickelson and Joaquin Niemann are in excellent shape after finishing their second rounds at 4-under. Patrick Reed also sat at 4-under with four holes remaining in his second round, while Cameron Smith was 2-under through eight holes.\n\nDustin Johnson and Harold Varner III both finished their second rounds at 1-under, Abraham Ancer is 1-under with six holes remaining, Mito Pereira was Even following the second round and Talor Gooch was 1-over with just the 18th hole to play.\n\nWhat is the Masters cut rule?\n\nThe Masters will pare down the field after the conclusion of the second round, with the low 50 players and ties qualifying for the final 36 holes.\n\nJack Nicklaus holds the record for most Masters cuts made with 37, followed by Fred Couples and Gary Player who each made the cut 30 times.\n\n— Fletcher Page, Augusta Chronicle\n\nMcIlroy crashes out at Masters, misses cut\n\nNo exit at the 2023 Masters is more surprising than that of Rory McIlroy.\n\nAs he heads home to Florida, McIlroy, who needs only a Masters win to complete the career grand slam, will be burning with fury — though not at others — after carding a 5-over through two rounds and missing the cut. He sets a high standard for himself and at Augusta National, he fell woefully short.\n\nThe world No. 2 has missed only two cuts since the 2022 Masters. One came at the FedEx St. Jude Championship in August, and he went on to win the PGA Tour’s $18 million playoff prize two weeks later. The other was last month at the Players Championship, which he followed with a strong third-place showing at the WGC-Match Play. He won’t yet care what will follow this Masters disappointment.\n\n— Eamon Lynch", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2023/04/06/masters-round-1-leaderboard-live-updates/11598485002/", "title": "Masters 2023 recap: Tiger Woods uneven, Brooks Koepka co-leader", "text": "Editor's note: Here are the latest live updates from Friday's Round 2, including Tiger Woods' tee time and more.\n\nThe 2023 Masters Tournament began with Kevin Na and 2003 champion Mike Weir teeing off first in Thursday's opening round at the famed Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\n\nBefore play in the 87th Masters officially got underway, the traditional opening ceremony had honorary starters Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson hitting drives off the first tee.\n\nFive-time champion Tiger Woods came on strong late in the first round but concluded his day with a bogey on No. 18 to finish 2-over par. Last year's winner Scottie Scheffler and three-time champ Phil Mickelson are also among the stars in the field, which includes both PGA Tour and LIV golfers.\n\nFollow along for the latest action, leaderboard updates, highlights and more.\n\nLive Leaderboard: PGA Championship Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nTEE TIMES: Pairings for Thursday's first round\n\nHow did Tiger Woods do today at the Masters?\n\nPlaying in his first competitive round since mid-February, Tiger Woods posted an uneven first round at Augusta National. Through his first seven holes, Woods recorded four pars and three bogeys, before he recorded his first birdie at No. 8.\n\nWoods had played well off the tee with his drives mostly finding the fairways. His approach irons and putter was where he was let down, often leaving himself longer putts; he averaged 1.78 putts per hole in the first round.\n\nOn the back nine, Woods bogeyed No. 11, before posting three consecutive pars. He then came on late, notching back-to-back birdies on Nos. 15 and 16. He bogeyed the final hole of the round to finish 2-over par (74). That has him — as of 4 p.m. ET — tied for 54th and hovering around the cut line, which will see the top 50 players (including ties) after the second round moving on.\n\nNotable Round 2 tee times\n\nTiger Woods will return to Augusta National for Round 2 at 12:54 p.m. ET. He'll be featured in Group 27 with co-leader Viktor Hovland, who shot 7-under (65).\n\nCo-leader Jon Rahm will tee off shortly after in Group 29 at 1:18 p.m. ET, while fellow co-leader Brooks Koepka will get started earlier in the day at 8:18 a.m. ET in Group 5.\n\nA full list of Round 2 tee times here.\n\nMASTERS:Tee times, TV, streaming info for Friday's second round at Augusta National\n\nJordan Spieth wraps up Round 1 with clutch putt to save par\n\nSpieth preserved his 3-under (69) with a clutch putt on No. 18. He finished his first round with a par putt after finding the fairway bunker on his first stroke. That’s good enough for 14th place, where he’s tied with three other golfers. It could’ve been worse after he shot a double bogey on hole No. 13. He also had 2 bogeys and seven birdies on the day.\n\nScottie Scheffler tied for sixth after one round; rookie Sam Bennett hangs with him\n\nDefending champion Scottie Scheffler got off to a good start on No. 18, hitting a 295-drive up the middle of the fairway. But a missed putt squandered a birdie. He finished No. 18 with a par, ending the first round 4-under (68). He’s one of seven players tied for sixth place.\n\nAmerican amateur Sam Bennett, who was in the same feature group as Scheffler, matched the defending champion at 4-under (68) and is also tied for sixth place. Not bad for the 23-year-old's first-ever Masters appearance.\n\nJordan Spieth and Tony Finau miss eagles on No. 15\n\nJordan Spieth and Tony Finau had a chance to make up some ground on No. 15, but they both missed an eagle opportunity by the slimmest of margins. Finau's putt came up just short and Spieth veered slightly to the right. They both finished with a birdie.\n\nFinau had a similar hiccup on No. 16. He putted for birdie, but the ball rolled right over the hole. He finished at par, keeping him at 3-under par.\n\nJason Day seals clean round with key par putt on 18; Scottie Scheffler hanging around\n\nJason Day, over his last three rounds at the Masters, had shot a combined 15-over par. Thursday, in his first round at the 87th Masters, Day played bogey-free golf and notched five birdies to finish the day 5-under (67). He's one of two players tied for fourth.\n\nMeanwhile, defending champion Scottie Scheffler hasn't had the most efficient round, needing to scramble at times to save par. Scheffler, however, is staying well within striking distance, currently at 4-under par (and tied for sixth) after birdies on Nos. 13 and 15.\n\nScheffler's tee shot on the gettable par-3 16th, though, fell long of the pin and left him some considerable work for another birdie.\n\nJordan Spieth, unraveling, finds the water ... twice in Amen Corner\n\nJordan Spieth, who raced out to a score of 4-under par through 10 holes, has started to unravel a bit on Amen Corner. Spieth bogeyed No. 11, which was actually a favorable outcome because he found the water and scrambled to keep the damage minimal.\n\nBut on No. 13, on his approach shot from the pine straw, Spieth chose an aggressive play and tried to make the green. His shot didn't get enough loft and bounced short of the green, eventually finding the creek. He had to work to set up a shorter bogey putt, which he misread, forcing a tap-in for double-bogey.\n\nAfter dropping three strokes in as many holes, Spieth now sits at 1-under par, in a tie for 27th.\n\nLIV Golf's Koepka takes co-lead spot with birdie on 18\n\nJoining a pair of European players in Viktor Hovland and John Rahm atop the leaderboard, Brooks Koepka concluded his first round in a co-lead with them at 7-under par (65). Koepka, one of the star acquisitions of the LIV Golf tour, shot up the leaderboard with birdies on three of his final four holes (Nos. 15, 16 and 18).\n\nThey find themselves two strokes up on the next closest players.\n\nKoepka is one of 18 players — including six past Masters champions — from the LIV tour who accepted invitations to play this week at Augusta National. Koepka is seeking his first green jacket. A victory by a LIV Golf player would certainly present an interesting, if awkward, moment for Augusta National and the PGA Tour, which are named in an antitrust lawsuit LIV filed in August 2022.\n\nRory gets back to even par; Koepka representing LIV Golf well\n\nWorld Golf No. 2 player Rory McIlroy's first round at the Masters has been all over the place. He birdied No. 2, bogeyed No. 3, got a double bogey on No. 7 and then birdied two of his latest three holes — Nos 8 and 10 — to climb back to even-par.\n\nAs far as the LIV Golf players in the field, Brooks Koepka has been far and away the top player. He is just one stroke off the lead as he starts the final hole of his first round. Koepka actually had a makeable birdie putt at No. 16 that just missed the pin.\n\nJordan Spieth rebounds from bogey on No. 5\n\n2015 Masters champion Jordan Spieth had a solid front-9 and is currently sitting at 4-under par through 10 holes. Spieth had dropped a stroke at No. 5 but has otherwise played cleanly, converting five birdies, on Nos. 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8.\n\nDrizzle starts to fall; Scheffler finishes front-9\n\nThe first round has seen warm and humid — though mostly dry — conditions at Augusta National. Coupled with rain earlier in the week, the greens have been amenable to low scoring, but after 4 p.m. ET hit, a slight drizzle started to fall. As of yet, it hasn't appeared to affect conditions, but as the forecast the rest of the weekend is projected rain, it will continue to bear watching.\n\nDefending champion Scottie Scheffler posted a clean and efficient, bogey-free front nine. An eagle at No. 2 and a birdie at No. 9 has him sitting at 3-under par at the turn.\n\nAlso making the turn is one of Scheffler's playing partners Thursday, amateur Sam Bennett, who has excelled in his Masters debut, and is actually outpacing Scheffler, currently at 4-under. That score ties him for the lowest-ever front nine score for an amateur at the Masters.\n\nViktor Hovland on his shirt\n\nCurrently tied atop the leaderboard, Viktor Hovland caught some attention for something else on Thursday, his colorful shirt that featured an oversized bright pink flower.\n\n\"I had nothing to do with it,\" Hovland said after his first round. \"I just wear what they tell me to wear. It’s definitely a little bit out there, but I’d rather take these than the pink pants I had last year.\"\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nA couple of low scores atop the leaderboard\n\nA pair of players, Viktor Hovland of Norway and John Rahm of Spain, have opened up a two-stroke lead on the rest of the field. Both Hovland and Rahm are tied atop the leaderboard at 7-under par (65).\n\nHovland blistered out of the gate, picking up an eagle on No. 2 and then birdies on Nos. 6, 8, 9, 11 and 13. His pace slowed, however, as he had to scramble for five consecutive pars to close his round.\n\nRahm was the opposite story; he double-bogeyed No. 1 and then slowly chipped away, going bogey-free the rest of the way. Rahm birdied four of his last six holes to climb into a tie with Hovlan\n\nWoods gains a stroke with bogey at 18, ends round at 2-over par\n\nTiger Woods had to manage a difficult second shot at No. 18, shooting out of an uneasy stance in which his left foot was on the first cut and his right foot was in a bunker. That shot eventually found a green-side bunker, from which he also had to navigate a tough stance. He set himself up with a challenging, but doable par putt that he pushed just left with too much pace.\n\nThat means Woods will have some work to do Friday, as he finishes his first round at 2-over-par (74). That left him hanging around the cut line, which will see the top 50 players, including ties, after the second round advance.\n\nAs warm and humid conditions have remained at Augusta National, scoring chances are available. John Rahm, the third-ranked player in the World Golf Rankings, made consecutive birdies at No. 15 and 16 to move up the board. A lenghty birdie putt at 17 left him with a tap-in par.\n\nRahm is currently second overall at 6-under par, one stroke behind leader Viktor Hovland, who finished his round at 7-under.\n\nTiger makes it two in a row\n\nAfter muddling through the middle of the back-9, Tiger Woods bridied his second-consecutive hole at the par-3 No. 16. His tee shot left him a manageable putt just left of the hole.\n\nWoods also converted par on the 17th hole, keeping him 1-over on the day.\n\nTiger gets second birdie of the day at No. 15\n\nThough Tiger Woods's approach iron again, following the trend of his opening round, left him a difficult birdie opportunity at No. 15, he recorded his second birdie of his Masters with a challenging but confidently-taken putt. The putt broke from left to right, but Woods read it perfectly and now sits at 2-over par, with three holes left to play. He had previously recorded his first birdie at No. 8.\n\nViktor Hovland remains the overall leader at 7-under par after notching birdie-par-par at Nos. 13, 14 and\n\nOf the LIV Golf players, Brooks Koepka is the one who has performed best thus far, recording consecutive birdies at Nos. 7 and 8. Koepka finished the front-nine bogey-free and is 4-under par.\n\nElsewhere, amateur Sam Bennett of Texas A&M has showed he's ready for the big stage. At No. 1, Bennett drained a putt of about 15 feet and then chipped in at No. 2 to start with a birdie-eagle. He parred at No. 3 and is at 3-under.\n\nDefending champ Scottie Scheffler races off to hot start; Tiger stays unsteady\n\nAfter kicking off his Masters title defense at No. 1 with a steady par, Scottie Scheffler's approach shot on the par-5 second hole, from about 245 yards, landed softly on the green within five feet. It set up a tap-in eagle meaning that — already — Scheffler has done something he didn't do last year when he won the green jacket: record an eagle.\n\nAt No. 14, Tiger Woods continued his uneven play, landing his tee shot in the rough. Though he eventually saved par — after his approach shot hit the branch of a pine and kicked out just in front of the green — Woods remains at 3-over par and needs to shave some strokes off his score if he is to make a move in the first round.\n\nScottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy start first round; Woods still at 3-over\n\nThe star power continues to make their way to the first tee, as defending champion Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy start their first rounds.\n\nTiger Woods' last three holes on No. 10, 11 and 12 were par-bogey-par.\n\nWill Zalatoris withdraws from Masters\n\nWill Zalatoris became the second golfer to withdraw from the tournament on Thursday after leaving the course minutes before his tee time. This time, it is due to a back injury.\n\nHe also withdrew from the WGC-Dell Match Play with a stomach bug and said he felt great heading into the Masters, even though he lost seven pounds due to the illness.\n\nTiger bogeys 11, now at 3-over\n\nTiger Woods missed a birdie opportunity from 17 feet on the 10th, as the shot just missed and he also got off to a good start on 11 with the driver but missed the green, hit a bunker, and had to settle for bogey. Woods is now 3-over through 11 holes.\n\nViktor Hovland still maintains the lead at 6-under. Cameron Young and Jon Rahm are at 3-under. Eight others, including four-time major champion Brooks Koepka and Fred Couples, the 1992 winner, are four shots off the lead.\n\nWoods finishes front nine at 2-over, Hovland increases lead\n\nTiger Woods finished his first nine holes with a 38, good for a score of 2-over with a birdie-par finish.\n\nPhil Mickelson went par on his first hole, but Viktor Hovland made two straight birdies at No. 8 and 9 and now is at 5-under for the tournament, good for a two-shot lead. Scott Stallings has completed his round and is at 2-under after a birdie on No. 18.\n\nTiger hits first birdie, Phil Mickelson tees off, Hovland takes lead\n\nOne of the early storylines of the tournament is how well the golfers on the LIV tour will do in the tour's first major. One golfer, Kevin Na, has already withdrawn from the Masters after only finishing nine holes. Phil Mickelson, one of the most popular players on the LIV Tour, has teed off for his first round.\n\nWoods finally got on the right side of a hole and birdied the par 5 No. 8 and now is at 2-over.\n\nOn the leaderboard, Viktor Hovland has a one-shot lead at 4-under over Shane Lowry.\n\nTiger Woods 3-over through 7 holes\n\nWoods had a chance to get his first birdie but instead two-putted the par-3 sixth. On the seventh, he was 20 feet from a birdie shot but again ended the hole with a bogey. He is struggling and now sits at 3-over-par.\n\nViktor Hovland has joined Cameron Young at the top of the leaderboard at 3-under after he birdied the par-3 sixth hole. Canada's Mike Weir was the first golfer to finish his round as his playing partner Kevin Na withdrew earlier in the tournament. Weir finished his round with a 72, good for even par.\n\nTiger Woods struggling, Cameron Young surges to lead\n\nCameron Young, who is making his second Masters appearance, birdied his first three holes and is leading the way early.\n\nThe scores are slowly falling as now there are seven golfers within striking range at 2-under, including 2013 Masters champion Adam Scott, and Sergio Garcia, the 2017 champion.\n\nWoods continues to chug along and after bogeying the 5th hole, now sits at 2-over.\n\nSurprising leaders at the top, Tiger 1-over through three holes\n\nAdrian Meronk from Poland has two bogeys and two birdies and is currently 2-under. He is joined by Norway's Viktor Hovland, who eagled the par-5 second hole after a par on the first hole\n\nWoods has hit two of the first three fairways first two holes and on the third hole, he badly missed the cup from eight feet out and had to settle for a bogey.\n\nTiger Woods tees off, pars first hole\n\n\"Fore please. Tiger Woods, now driving,\" started the five-time champion's tee time for the 25th time at Augusta National. On his first shot on the Par 4, 445-yard hole, Woods used his driver and hit the fairway down the right center to get off to a good start. He continued to play the course and ended up about 40 feet for a birdie on his second shot. He chipped in for par on the first hole.\n\nHow to watch Tiger Woods in first round of 2023 Masters\n\nFans will be able to watch Tiger Woods entire round on ESPN+ as coverage will follow his featured group. ESPN will broadcast live 2023 Masters Tournament coverage at 3:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThe 2023 Masters can also be streamed on the ESPN app, Masters.com and fuboTV.\n\nJumbled leaderboard at the top\n\nSeven players are currently atop the leaderboard at 1-under, Scott Stallings, Louis Oosthuizen and Patrick Reed. So far, the par-5 second hole has been the favorite as several golfers have scored well on Pink Dogwood, which is measured at 575 yards.\n\nKevin Na withdraws\n\nNa was in the same group as Mike Weir, but withdrew from the tournament after nine holes due to illness. Na had five bogies and two birdies during his short round. There are now 17 LIV golfers remaining in the field.\n\nHow many times has Tiger Woods won the Masters Tournament?\n\nTiger Woods has won the Masters Tournament five times. His last victory came in 2019 as he captured his 15th major golf championship.\n\nTV schedule for 2023 Masters\n\nThe first and second rounds of the 2023 Masters will be broadcast on ESPN. The main coverage will begin at 3:00 p.m. ET.\n\nThis weekend, the 2023 Masters coverage will shift to CBS. The coverage will begin at 3:00 p.m. ET on Saturday and the final round will begin at 2:00 p.m. ET on Sunday.\n\nMike Weir, Louis Oosthuizen among early leaders\n\nFormer Masters winners Mike Weir and Louis Oosthuizen are among those atop the early leaderboard at one-under par. Weir won the 2003 Masters and Oosthuizen was the 2012 Masters winner.\n\nThere are currently eight players tied at one-under par so far.\n\nAmateurs in 2023 Masters\n\nThere are seven amateur golfers in the 2023 Masters field.

This time, it’s the iconic 13th. It’s a move that has been talked about since Augusta National Golf Club bought land from neighboring Augusta County Club in 2017. This year, it’s a reality.\n\nOn the course, it’s one of those years that the top players in the world are peaking at just the right time for the Masters. They are the new Big Three; Defending champion Scott Scheffler, Jon Rahm and Rory McIlroy. This is McIlroy’s ninth try to complete the career Grand Slam. He’s coming off his best finish here, a solo second last year thanks to a final-round 64.\n\nLIV's First Big Moment at Masters? The Champions Dinner\n\nSome former champions, such as Fred Couples, have expressed their displeasure with the breakaway LIV Golf tour. Since last year’s Champions Dinner, six former champions have joined the league and are expected to be in attendance Tuesday night.\n\nLive Leaderboard: PGA Championship Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nThat includes three-time champion Phil Mickelson, who skipped the dinner and the tournament last year in the wake of comments critical of the PGA Tour and his support of LIV. He joined LIV in June, and was followed by former Masters champions Bubba Watson, Dustin Johnson, Sergio Garcia, Patrick Reed and Charl Schwartzel.\n\nScheffler, who will host the dinner as the defending champ, joked with Watson that maybe there should be a separate table for the LIV golfers. Nick Faldo, a three-time champ, joked that perhaps it might be wise to use “plastic knives and forks.”\n\nIn all, there are 18 LIV golfers in the Masters field, including four-time major champion Brooks Koepka. All of them have been sensitive to criticism that, because they are banned by the PGA Tour and have only played three events this season (including one in Orlando that ended Sunday), they might have lost their edge. They also play 54 holes tournaments, not the normal 72.\n\nThe PGA Tour has banned LIV members from playing its events. But the four majors, including the Masters, are allowing those who qualified to play.\n\nLIV GOLF:What Cameron Smith, others have said about 2023 Masters\n\nGOLFWEEK: All the latest news from the Masters and around the links\n\n“Most of us will get four cracks at it this year (in the major championships), and hopefully we get maybe a win out of it,” said Cameron Smith, the current British Open champ and LIV’s highest player in the world rankings. “Maybe we just show a really hearty effort. I think for us, internally, there’s a lot of chatter going around about, 'These guys don’t play real golf anymore.' And I think it’s (crap) to be honest. And we just want to show people that.\"\n\n\"I think there is a big rivalry right now between the Tour and LIV,\" said Joaquin Niemann, another LIV member. \"I think there is a lot of players that – I don't know if they don't like us or they don't like the decisions that we take – but it's going to be fun.\"\n\n\"I think it's going to be more fun knowing that they hate us,\" Niemann said. \"Then go to the majors and beat them.\"\n\nWill Augusta National pair them all together? It’s doubtful. The former champions are normally paired with amateurs. Will the fan reaction be muted?\n\nAnd what if a LIV golfer wins? That could very well happen, especially since Smith is unquestionably one of the game’s top players. He’s shown he can win here, with top-10 finishes in each of the past three years. He tied for second in 2020, becoming the first golfer in tournament history to break 70 in all four rounds, tied for 10th in 2021 and tied for third last year.\n\nLucky, or Unlucky, New 13th Hole at Augusta National?\n\nBack to the lengthening of the 13th hole. The tee was moved straight back and up the hill 35yards, making it play at 545 yards. It will be more difficult for players to draw their ball around the dogleg right corner on the par-5. That means fewer player will go for the water-guarded green in two shots, and eagles will be rarer. But there were only three there last year.\n\nLast year, when the other second-nine par-5, the 15th, was lengthened by 20 yards to 550 yards, there was zero eagles recorded.\n\nThe change on No. 13 puzzles two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson.\n\n\"It will change the hole,” Watson said. “It's now driver (off the tee) and maybe a long iron into the green. Will they take out trees on the bend? That'll determine how much harder it is when it comes to going for it in two. There's probably going to be a lot more lay-ups. A few years ago, they wanted the roars back on Sunday. Now you're taking away the roars? That's kind of weird.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/masters/2023/04/04/tiger-woods-2023-masters-tuesday-press-conference/11599317002/", "title": "Tiger Woods at 2023 Masters: What he said in Tuesday press ...", "text": "All eyes are on Tiger Woods at the Masters.\n\nCan Woods win a sixth time at Augusta National Golf Club and claim a 16th career major championship?

Just being able to enjoy my time here and the memories.\"\n\nTIGER AT 2023 MASTERS:Five-time winner prepares at Augusta National\n\n2023 MASTERS:Tee times, pairings, and groupings for Thursday's first round\n\nWoods was forced to undergo emergency surgery to repair his right leg and ankle. He spoke Tuesday about the \"hardware\" now inserted in his right leg, which Woods said was \"a lot\" of implant material.\n\n\"My mobility is not where I would like it,\" Woods said. \"I'm very lucky to have this leg. It's mine. Yes, it has been altered and there is some hardware in there. But it's mine. It has been tough and will always be tough. It's one of the reasons I can't play as many tournaments as I would like. But that's my future and I'm OK with that.\"\n\nRory McIlroy will 'definitely' win a Masters title\n\nWoods said current world No. 2 Rory McIlroy will \"definitely\" win a Masters tournament during his career.\n\nMcIlroy is a Masters championship short of completing a career grand slam, a feat only achieved by five golfers in history (Woods is one of them). He finished second to 2022 champion Scottie Scheffler and is considered one of the favorites for the 2023 title.\n\nGREG NORMAN:If LIV golfer wins Masters, the rest will be waiting on 18th green to celebrate\n\n\"It's just a matter of time,\" Woods said when asked if McIlroy will add a Masters win to his career. \"Rory has the talent, the game, all the tools to win here. A lot of things have to happen to win at this golf course. A lot has to go right. I think Rory has shown over the years that he's learned how to play this golf course. He's been there, last year he made a great run.\n\n\"Whether it's this year or next or whenever it comes, he will get it done and have a career grand slam. It will definitely happen.\"\n\nWoods hints at PGA Champions Tour in future\n\nThe 47-year-old has been vocal that walking has been his biggest handicap since the accident. Even McIlroy said Tuesday that Woods can hit all the shots but doesn't have the walking endurance to play as much as he'd like.\n\nWoods might have referenced a future in the PGA Champions Tour when asked about his walking limitations on the course.\n\n\"The difficulty for me is going to be walking going forward,\" Woods said. \"It is what it is. I wish it could be easier. I've got three more years before I get a little buggy out there and be out there with Fred (Couples). But until then, no buggy.\"\n\nThe PGA Champions Tour, where Couples competes, is open to players who are at least 50 years of age and who meet other eligibility requirements. Players also have the ability to use golf carts as they navigate the course.\n\nJohn Daly used one and even brought it to the 2019 PGA Championship. At the time, Woods was not impressed.\n\n“Well, I walked with a broken leg,\" Woods said in reference to his 2008 U.S. Open appearance in which he walked 72 holes with a double stress fracture of his left leg.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/04"}]}

The RNC’s Site Selection Committee will then travel to the final three cities to further determine the feasibility of a large-scale event, including space for the convention events, hotels, ease of travel and breadth of corporate sponsorships, the spokesperson said.\n\nWhere a political party hosts its national convention is widely seen as a symbolic choice that offers the party a chance to both build infrastructure in a key swing state and message to important subsets of voters. Most conventions have been held in swing states over the last three decades, but some political operatives from each party believe the significance of a convention site is often overstated.\n\nPolitico was the first to report that the Republican list is down to four cities.\n\nIn 2020, Republicans held some official convention events in Charlotte, North Carolina, their original host city, despite the city stopping the full-scale event due to the coronavirus pandemic. Many of the primetime addresses were delivered from Washington, DC.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats chose to largely scrap all events in Milwaukee, the city they had selected to host the event that year, and moved the events to a virtual setting or from a stage near then-candidate Joe Biden’s home in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nBy selecting either Pittsburgh or Milwaukee, Republicans would be centering their 2024 messaging in major cities within key swing states. Biden narrowly defeated former President Donald Trump in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in 2020. Both states also will feature high-profile Senate races in 2022 and will likely once again be key presidential battlegrounds in 2024.

The Chicago Bulls star captivated the nation from his college days at North Carolina and used his professional career to break through barriers of what a basketball player could be. Jordan became a global icon in his 15-year NBA career and continues to be an international sensation.\n\nThis was all before the dawn of social media.\n\nToday’s basketball stars, including Kevin Durant, Candace Parker, Damian Lillard, Breanna Stewart and the NBA’s new scoring king, LeBron James, have built fanbases through excellence on and off the court. The importance of a personal brand continues to increase. But Jordan literally created his own brand.\n\nAs the six-time NBA champion celebrates his 60th birthday on Friday, here are 60 facts about his basketball career, pop culture influence and life beyond the hardwood:\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nMichael Jordan's early days\n\n1. Michael Jordan was born on Feb. 17, 1963 to James and Deloris Jordan. The couple was living in Brooklyn, New York, at the time, but moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, a few years after he was born. Jordan has two older brothers, an older sister and a younger sister.\n\n2. Michael Jordan was motivated as a child by his brother, Larry, who also played basketball. They both wore No. 45 jerseys, but when they played on the same team, the younger brother had to pick a new number. So he cut 45 in half and rounded up to No. 23. He carried it through college, the NBA and into icon status.\n\n3. The only time Michael Jordan wore 45 after committing to 23 was after the return from his first retirement in March of 1995. He finished out the regular season and the first round of the playoffs in the new number before struggling in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals and deciding he had better luck in No. 23.\n\n4. Michael Jordan was very close with his father, James. In “The Last Dance,” he revealed that he was suspended three times during his ninth grade year and his father put him back on track.\n\n“My father pulled me aside that summer,” he shared, “and he said, ‘Look, you don’t look like you’re headed in the right direction. If you want to go about doing all this mischievous stuff, you can forget sports.’ That’s all I needed to hear. It was like from that point on, it was tunnel vision.”\n\n5. His sophomore year, Michael Jordan didn’t make the varsity basketball team at Laney (N.C.) High School. The experience gave him reason to not ever be left off a team again.\n\nMichael Jordan's legend starts at North Carolina\n\n6. As a freshman with the North Carolina Tar Heels, Michael Jordan hit the game-winning jump shot in the victory over the Georgetown Hoyas to win the 1982 national championship.\n\n“That turned my name from Mike to Michael Jordan,” he said in “The Last Dance.” “It gave me the confidence that I needed to start to excel at the game of basketball.”\n\n7. Michael Jordan received his degree from the University of North Carolina in 1986 when he returned to complete his classes after breaking his foot. He majored in geography.\n\n8. Michael Jordan wore a pair of North Carolina practice shorts under his Chicago Bulls shorts for every game.\n\nMichael Jordan dominates the basketball world\n\n9. Michael Jordan was selected by the Chicago Bulls as the No. 3 overall pick in the 1984 NBA draft. Ahead of him was Hakeem Olajuwon by the Houston Rockets and Sam Bowie by the Portland Trail Blazers. Other stars in the draft class included Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers and John Stockton of the Utah Jazz.\n\n10. Michael Jordan was named the 1984-85 NBA Rookie of the Year. He finished his first season with the Chicago Bulls starting all 82 games with a stat line of 28.2 points per game, 6.5 rebounds per game and a .515 field goal percentage.\n\nWRITING HISTORY:Longtime Chicago Bulls writers share favorite Michael Jordan stories\n\n11. Michael Jordan broke his foot in his second season. He powered his way through rehab to return to top shape.\n\n12. Michael Jordan’s highest-scoring game was when he racked up 69 points in a 117-113 overtime win against the Cleveland Cavaliers on March 28, 1990. He scored 60-plus points five times in his career.\n\n13. The legacies of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson weighed heavily on Michael Jordan early in his career since he was known as a scorer, but not a winner. The 1991 NBA Finals in which the Chicago Bulls defeated the Los Angeles Lakers was a big relief to the rising star, who won his first of six championships.\n\n14. Michael Jordan only packed one suit when the Chicago Bulls traveled to play the Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls failed to clinch the title in Game 5 at home.\n\n“We going back to win one game,” he recalled telling the team in “The Last Dance.” “I’m not going there to play two games.”\n\nHe scored 33 points in Game 6 as the Bulls won their third straight title, becoming the the third team in NBA history to accomplish a three-peat.\n\n15. Michael Jordan announced his first retirement in 1993 after the death of his father.\n\n16. On March 18, 1995, Michael Jordan shocked the world when he returned to basketball. He shared the news with an often-imitated, never duplicated two-word fax, “I’m back.”\n\n17.

Wilson High School Principal Gary Horton told WAFF-TV the removal of some of the stall doors in the boys’ restroom comes two weeks after a student vaping in the bathroom passed out. He says students sneak off to vape every day in the bathroom. Parent Rachel Munsey says she doesn’t agree with the tactic, saying the school took away the “only private place … they can do their business.” Parent Brandon Campbell says the school should instead use hallway monitors. Horton says the door removals could be temporary while the school figures out another solution.\n\nAlaska\n\nNome: Alaska Native women say the Nome Police Department has a history of failing to conduct full investigations on rape complaints. Nome police data show that from 2008 through 2017, just 8% of calls about sexual assaults against adults resulted in an arrest. Nome’s prosecutor says limited resources make it hard for police to respond to calls of all kinds. Survivors and advocates contend that Nome police pay less attention and investigate less when sexual assaults are reported by Alaska Natives. More than half of Nome’s population is Alaska Native, but all of its police department’s sworn officers are non-Native. This year the City Council approved the hiring of the police department’s first victims advocate and passed an ordinance to create a civilian oversight committee to monitor police conduct.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The cost of a gem and mineral museum under construction – set to be among the largest in the world – has grown by $3.25 million, and officials say they would, in a worst-case scenario, sell part of their collection to cover expenses. The University of Arizona’s Gem and Mineral Museum will be housed in part of the historic Pima County Courthouse. The university asked the Arizona Board of Regents to approve spending for the increased costs, which officials attributed to rising labor and material expenses. The regents voted to accept the changes Aug. 22. With the increase, the cost of the project has grown to $12.9 million, and so far the museum has raised $4 million, says Robert Downs, curator of the Gem and Mineral Museum, who anticipates the museum will receive enough in donations to cover the full cost and avoid the last resort of selling gems and minerals.\n\nArkansas\n\nCamden: Lockheed Martin has broken ground on the first part of a $142 million expansion at its southern Arkansas facility that is expected to create more than 300 new jobs. Company executives and state officials broke ground Tuesday on the new Long Range Fires Production Facility at the site in Camden. Lockheed Martin and Gov. Asa Hutchinson in June announced the expansion of its facility, which will add 326 new jobs by 2024. Approximately 650 employees currently work at the Lockheed facility. Construction for the 70,000-square-foot Long Range Fires facility is slated to be completed in the beginning of 2021.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Athletes at colleges in the state could hire agents and sign endorsement deals under a bill the Legislature sent to the governor Wednesday, setting up a potential confrontation with the NCAA that could jeopardize the athletic futures of powerhouse programs like USC, UCLA and Stanford. Gov. Gavin Newsom has not said whether he will sign it. But the NCAA Board of Governors is already urging him not to, sending him a letter Wednesday saying the bill “would erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletics” and have drastic consequences for California’s colleges and universities. The bill would allow student-athletes to hire agents and be paid for the use of their names, images or likenesses. It would stop California universities and the NCAA from banning athletes that take the money.\n\nColorado\n\nTrinidad: Gov. Jared Polis says Fisher’s Peak and the former ranch land surrounding it will become Colorado’s newest state park. Polis’ office said in a statement that the Nature Conservancy and The Trust for Public Land plan to transfer the 30-square-mile property near Trinidad to public ownership, with the goal of opening access by 2021. Polis signed an executive order during a ceremony Thursday. Trinidad Mayor Phil Rico tells the Gazette that access to the 9,633-foot Fisher’s Peak has long been a dream among residents. The Trust for Public Land and the Nature Conservancy last year pledged the $25 million needed to buy the former Crazy French Ranch after the state put down an initial $14.5 million. It will be Colorado’s 42nd state park.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State health officials are urging residents to minimize outdoor activities in the evening to avoid mosquitoes carrying eastern equine encephalitis. The Department of Public Health issued the guidance Wednesday. The virus has been identified in mosquitoes in 12 eastern Connecticut towns and in horses in two other towns. In one town, Groton, school outdoor activities have been restricted because of concern about the virus. Mosquitoes are most active from dusk to dawn. State health officials say the mosquitoes that carry the virus are active until the first heavy frost.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The deadline is nigh for anyone hankering to be the state’s chief justice. Applications from candidates seeking to replace retiring Chief Justice Leo Strine Jr. are due by noon Friday. Delaware’s Judicial Nominating Commission will then interview the applicants, who will be considered simultaneously for a potential derivative vacancy on the Supreme Court if one of the sitting justices is nominated to be chief justice. Strine announced his planned resignation in July, less than halfway through his 12-year term. He plans to step down Oct. 30. The state Senate must confirm judicial appointees and has scheduled a special session for Nov. 7. Before becoming chief justice, Strine served as legal counsel to then-Gov. Tom Carper and spent more than 15 years as a judge on Delaware’s Chancery Court.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital has hit or surpassed the 90-degree temperature mark a total of 54 days so far this year through Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. On average, D.C. sees 36 days of 90-plus temperatures for the entire year. Last year, the city recorded 42. The record is 67 days above 90, hit in both 2010 and 1980. This past July was the ninth warmest on record in the district, tied with 1955. All the temperatures were taken by the National Weather Service at Reagan National Airport.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: A 7-year-old boy made national headlines when he emptied his savings to help feed Hurricane Dorian evacuees. Now Mickey is paying it forward. Jermaine Bell saved for a year to visit Disney’s Animal Kingdom, but when he saw the terrifying storm, he decided to use his trip money to buy hundreds of hot dogs, chips and bottled water for evacuees. He had been visiting his grandmother in South Carolina at the time. He waved a sign by the road and passed out refreshments to drivers fleeing the city. On Sunday, he found Mickey Mouse and several characters on his Jacksonville doorstep, holding balloons. They gave him a “Lion King”-themed cake to celebrate his 7th birthday and a VIP getaway for later this month.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Another former building of historic Morris Brown College has burned. Atlanta Fire Rescue says it responded Wednesday night to the fire west of downtown. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the fire engulfed Furber Cottage, a onetime Morris Brown dormitory built in 1899. The college sold Furber and much of its remaining property in 2014 while in bankruptcy. Firefighters say the structure was too unstable to enter. No injuries were reported, and the cause is unknown. Furber, along with three other buildings once part of Morris Brown, was listed in 2016 as among Georgia’s most endangered historic sites. Gaines Hall, another one of the four buildings listed, was damaged by fire in 2015. Morris Brown lost its accreditation in 2002. The school remains open and is trying to regain accreditation.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s supply of doctors is the lowest since 2015 as older physicians retire and younger practitioners move elsewhere for higher pay. News organizations report workforce data shows there are now 2,819 active physicians in Hawaii, a decrease of 108 full-time doctors over the past year. A survey by the University of Hawaii Burns School of Medicine indicates the state needs at least 3,481 doctors to care for the aging population. The school’s Hawaii/Pacific Basin Area Health Education Center says a quarter of the state’s doctors are 65 and older. Center Executive Director Kelley Withy says physicians are finding opening their own offices too expensive. Withy says a new fixed payment transformation system that reduces the money earned per patient also makes the business “challenging” for doctors.\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: Seven jail inmates have filed tort claims against Canyon County because they say deputies gave them used razors to shave. The Idaho Press reports that the inmates say a deputy pulled the used razors from a biohazard waste box before handing them out to inmates to use and that all seven of the inmates tested positive for hepatitis C following the incident. The virus attacks the liver, and it is easily spread through contact with contaminated blood. The inmates say they suffered damages in an amount likely to exceed $500,000. Canyon County has until the end of November to decide whether to respond to the tort claims. If the inmates are unhappy with the response at that point, they will be able to file lawsuits against the county.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The fate of one of the oldest Greek Orthodox churches in the nation has become clear. The sale of Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church for $2.5 million to Universal Life Church was approved Tuesday by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge. The congregation of Holy Trinity will now have 75 days to vacate the building. The Chicago church’s future hung in the balance after financial woes put it on the verge of closing for good. Church officials said a bank rejected a loan request after the church was unable to secure $1.6 million in needed pledges. Holy Trinity avoided foreclosure late last year after an anonymous donation. But an issue with the money arose, forcing the church to go up for sale again. Officials say Holy Trinity is the second-oldest Greek Orthodox church in the United States.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The History Channel has dropped out of a planned documentary on John Dillinger that would have included the proposed exhumation of the 1930s gangster’s Indianapolis gravesite. A&E Networks spokesman Dan Silberman says The History Channel is no longer involved in the Dillinger documentary. Silberman says network officials won’t comment on the reasons for the withdrawal. The planned exhumation of Dillinger’s grave has become the subject of a lawsuit. Crown Hill Cemetery officials objected to the exhumation, prompting Dillinger’s nephew, Michael C. Thompson, to sue the cemetery. Thompson is one of two Dillinger relatives who obtained a state permit to exhume the gravesite, saying they have evidence Dillinger’s body may not be buried there. An Oct. 1 hearing is scheduled in the exhumation lawsuit.\n\nIowa\n\nBondurant: A small school district won’t be getting nearly $900,000 it wanted to spend as part of this year’s budget because officials have learned the budget revenue was in part based on an erroneous tax valuation from the county assessor’s office. The Polk County assessor’s office had included in the tax base figures for the Bondurant-Farrar school district a fourth building at Facebook’s giant data center in Altoona. But the $52.4 million building was exempted from taxation for 20 years as part of a development agreement the social media giant signed with the city and the Iowa Economic Development Authority. Exemptions also were granted for the center’s first three buildings. Facebook spokeswoman Melanie Roe says the company learned about the error just a few days ago.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: The Kansas and Missouri affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union say they have reached a settlement with the Federal Bureau of Prisons that allows an inmate to receive a drug used to treat his opioid addiction. The ACLU said in a news release Wednesday that the settlement allows the federal prison in Leavenworth to give inmate Leaman Crews a drug used to keep life-threatening withdrawal symptoms at bay. A federal lawsuit filed on his behalf last week sought to compel prison officials to treat his addiction with buprenorphine. Kansas ACLU Executive Director Nadine Johnson says Crews was their primary concern, but the narrow agreement focusing only on him isn’t sufficient. She says they look forward to seeing a prison policy that respects what doctors are recommending in these cases.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: Fort Boonesborough State Park is hosting its annual 1778 Siege of Boonesborough weekend this month. Events at the Madison County park will include a battle reenactment on the afternoons of Sept. 28 and 29 and a night battle at dusk on Sept. 28. The event commemorates the 1778 attack on the fort by Native Americans and French Canadians during the Revolutionary War. The settlers in the fort refused to surrender, and the attackers gave up and left. There will be militia and settlers’ camps, a Native American village, merchants, traders, pioneer skills demonstrations and food. This event is free with regular fort admission of $8 for adults and $5 for children.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Officials have voted to require new commercial parking surfaces to use porous pavement in this city where flooded streets are a common sight. The Times Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports the City Council last week unanimously ruled in favor of the pavement ordinance, which allows rainwater to flow into the soil below. Council members say the pavement won’t solve the city’s problem with flooded streets, but it will lighten the burden placed on the city’s drainage system during heavy rain. The pavement can clog if not washed regularly, so the city recently outfitted some work trucks with power-washing attachments. The ordinance comes more than a year after the city’s code was amended to require that some developments keep the first 1.25 inches of storm rainfall out of the city’s drainage system.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: Acadia National Park officials say they have some leeway in regulating so-called e-bikes following an Interior Department directive to treat them the same as regular bicycles. Superintendent Kevin Schneider tells the Bangor Daily News the park has the authority to ban or restrict e-bikes to protect users and natural resources or to balance other objectives. Thus, it remains to be seen whether bikes with electric motors will be restricted on the park’s popular carriage roads. David MacDonald, president of Friends of Acadia, says the Rockefeller family that donated the roads specified that there be no motorized vehicles. But Matt Horton, a member of Acadia’s advisory commission, says the Rockefellers were opposed to combustion engines. He said those are much different from e-bikes. The park has 30 days to propose rules.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: An attorney representing Maryland’s four historically black colleges is urging the state to settle a long-running lawsuit over disparities in programs for $577 million “over a reasonable period of time.” Michael Jones wrote Tuesday to lawmakers, after mediation failed in July. Jones notes that Mississippi settled its HBCU case nearly 20 years ago for about $517 million. Jones says that is about $791 million in today’s dollars. Jones says if Mississippi could afford that, “surely Maryland can afford a lesser amount to remedy its constitutional violation.” The colleges say the state underfunded them while developing programs at traditionally white schools. A federal judge ruled in favor of the HBCUs in 2013, saying the state unnecessarily duplicated programs. The state proposed a settlement last year of $100 million over 10 years.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nScituate: Experts say another minke whale has been found dead in state waters. The New England Aquarium says the 22-foot, sub-adult whale was found dead rolling in the surf off Scituate on Monday. The aquarium’s Marine Animal Rescue Team responded and determined the whale had likely died within the past couple of days, but because it had been significantly scavenged by sharks, a full necropsy could not be completed. The carcass showed had no evidence of marine gear interference or evidence of any other human interaction. Over Labor Day weekend, another dead minke whale washed up in Duxbury. In 2017 and 2018, a greater than normal number of minke whales died along the U.S. East Coast. In response, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared an unusual mortality event for the species.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Mercedes-Benz USA is asking a judge to protect it from legal action over its use of images of outdoor murals in Motor City in social media posts. The company says four artists threatened to file a lawsuit after their works appeared last year in Instagram posts about the G 500 Series truck. Mercedes-Benz removed the posts, although it insists it didn’t infringe on copyrights and was entitled to fair use of the murals. The company accused the artists of engaging in an “aggressive shakedown.” James Lewis says Mercedes-Benz “defamed” his mural by posting it slightly out of focus. He says it’s a “sacred piece” honoring African women. Detroit federal Judge Avern Cohn on Wednesday rejected a request by the artists to dismiss three lawsuits by Mercedes-Benz.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji: A summer of heavy rains has caused a rise in cases of a rare fungal infection in northern Minnesota. So far this year, more than 45 people and 150 animals have been diagnosed with blastomycosis. Last year, only 31 human cases and fewer than 100 animal infections were reported by this time. An epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health, Malia Ireland, tells Minnesota Public Radio News the infections are caused by fungi living in the ground. Ireland says flooding has moved land around, exposing spores to the air. The fungus thrives in moist ground, especially in wooded areas near rivers and lakes. Most of the cases were reported in northern Minnesota. Most of the animal cases are dogs, which dig their noses in the dirt.\n\nMississippi\n\nTylertown: Some students say they won’t be returning to class while they protest the removal of their prayer group from school hours to after school. News outlets report students at Tylertown High School walked out of class Wednesday and won’t return until their faith-based program, First Priority, is reinstated to its normal time, during school hours. Student Tyasia Shackleford says First Priority has existed for 15 years and meets once a month to praise God. Student Kaitlynn Brown says students “want to celebrate God,” and the school took that away. It’s unclear why the program was removed from school hours. Walthall County School superintendent Wade Carney says all student-led organizations cannot meet during instruction time. He says they can meet before or after school.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A Catholic priest says “fornication,” not pregnancy, was the problem in the case of a teacher who alleges she was fired from a Catholic school because she was pregnant and unmarried. The Kansas City Star reports the Rev. Joseph Cisetti testified Wednesday that he “praised” the decision of former St. Therese School teacher Michelle Bolen not to have an abortion but told her she violated her contract. Cisetti said that “sexual relations must take place exclusively in marriage.” He said he favored offering Bolen a contract, while the school’s then-principal didn’t. He said he was concerned about dismissing her because it might create an environment that would be conducive to abortion. Bolen said administrators concocted non-pregnancy-related reasons to justify not renewing her contract in July 2015.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Wildlife officials say feral hogs from Canada encroaching on the state’s northern border are a serious concern for farmers and others. Daily Inter Lake reports the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services division says there have been multiple reports of feral hogs near the border. An official says eight mature pigs were discovered in Canada directly above Montana’s Lincoln County this summer. Wildlife Services, the Montana Invasive Species Council, the National Feral Swine Program, and the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks department say the pigs could do widespread damage. Officials say the pigs are “rototillers” that root for food and wallow in farms, fields and forests, leaving terrain unrecognizable. The pigs may also spread diseases affecting livestock and other animals.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: City leaders are backing a proposal to restore an open-air theater in Harmon Park. The City Council heard about the plan for the Sonotorium at Tuesday’s meeting. The Kearney Hub reports Councilman Randy Buschkoetter said it says a lot about the community that members wish to preserve the landmark built in 1938. A group led by Kearney High School band director Nathan LeFeber plans to raise $683,000 to construct a roof over the stage and upgrade the structure’s lighting and sound system and backstage rooms. The city has committed $5,000 to cover the costs of structural tests and conceptual plans.\n\nNevada\n\nWadsworth: Federal officials are making fish-friendly modifications to a northern Nevada dam that for more than a century has blocked off spawning grounds for a threatened trout species that once migrated 120 miles upstream to the alpine waters of Lake Tahoe. Officials for the Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service and Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe broke ground Tuesday for a $23.5 million fish-passage project to help Lahontan cutthroat trout navigate the Truckee River’s Derby Dam about 20 miles east of Reno. It’s expected to be completed next year. Fish screens in a bypass canal longer than a football field will allow the trout – once believed to have gone extinct – to get past the high-desert dam for the first time since it was built in 1905 to divert water to farmers and ranchers.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College has become the latest university to allow students to easily change their name or gender identity in directories, on identification cards and elsewhere across the Ivy League campus. Transgender and nonbinary students have been able to request IDs and directory listings that reflect their preferred names for more than a decade, but the new policy announced Wednesday allows them to log on to the college’s information system and make changes on their own. Chosen names also will be allowed to appear on transcripts and diplomas. Campus Pride, a nonprofit organization that promotes LGBTQ-friendly learning environments, tracks such policies. It says most of the other seven Ivy League schools also provide students with a simple process to change their names or gender identities on university documents.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Gamblers wagered more than $293 million on sports in the state in August, helping Atlantic City’s casinos win 13% more than they did a year ago. Figures released Thursday by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show the nine casinos won nearly $339 million for the month, assisted by sports betting money. The Borgata won nearly $80 million and had the best month at slot machines since it opened in 2003. The two newest casinos also fared well in August. Hard Rock retained the No. 2 spot in the market with nearly $41 million, up nearly 31% from a year ago. And the Ocean casino had the best month in its short history, with more than $25 million, up more than 25% from a year ago.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nGallup: A western New Mexico high school is becoming a tiny house factory to build affordable housing in a city near the Navajo Nation. The Gallup Independent reports that Hiroshi Miyamura High School in Gallup will begin a program to teach students about building tiny homes and the business behind them. Principal Jack McFarland says the program will provide real results and hands-on learning for students. He says the goal is to build about two tiny houses a year. The houses will be sold at auction at the end of the year to help recoup the costs of the project and help plan for the following school year.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A state law that went into effect Thursday lengthens the waiting period on certain gun purchases from three days to 30 days. Gov. Andrew Cuomo approved the measure in July and issued a statement Thursday saying the change will save lives. He also called on the federal government to pass universal background checks. The Democrat said New York has taken action “while the federal government turns a blind eye to the scourge of gun violence ripping our nation apart and continues to allow this bloodshed to take parents and children away from their families.” The law applies in cases where a federal background check returns an inconclusive response on a potential firearm purchaser. Extending the state waiting period will give federal authorities more time for the background checks.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: The mayor wants the public’s input on a proposed Civil War history center. The Fayetteville Observer reports Mayor Mitch Colvin is calling for a special City Council meeting to gauge support. He says the $7.5 million the city would have to invest in the project could be put to better use than the proposed North Carolina Civil War & Reconstruction History Center. Colvin, who is black, says he no longer backs the project, and he says a growing number of the city’s black residents are expressing concerns about it. Troy Williams, a criminal defense investigator and radio co-host, supports the center and accuses the mayor of stirring up opposition. Williams, who also is black, says the center will tell the truth about the war.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Department of Agriculture has confirmed the presence of a Palmer amaranth plant in a seventh county in the state. The agency said Wednesday that it found the plant in Emmons County, in the south of the state, just weeks after finding it in nearby Grant County. The Bismarck Tribune reports Palmer amaranth can grow up to 7 feet and resist herbicides. Purdue University research shows the plant’s heavy infestation can cut soybean yields by as much as 79% and corn yields by up to 91%. Brian Jenks, a North Dakota State University weed scientist, says this summer’s weed discoveries were in fields with millet. Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring says producers should monitor millet plantings for Palmer amaranth to avoid infestation.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: The school district is apologizing for posting photos that showed students with fake blood stains during an active shooter drill. Officials with the Toledo Public Schools say the photos have been removed from a Facebook post that prompted complaints. The Blade newspaper reports the photos showed high school students looking lifeless and others with red marks resembling blood on their clothes and bodies. Some people commented that they found the photos disturbing. A school spokeswoman said the district takes safety very seriously and apologized if anyone found the post inappropriate.\n\nOklahoma\n\nLawton: Officials say a house explosion that left one man dead and was initially investigated as a homicide is now considered an accident. The state Fire Marshal’s Office says the Aug. 24 blast killed chiropractor Anthony Ferrara of Cache, who operated a chiropractic clinic in Lawton and owned the vacant home about 78 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. Comanche County Sheriff Kenny Stradley told the Lawton Constitution that although there was no electricity, natural gas or propane connected to the house, a “combustion fluid” was inside the home and ignited. Stradley says there is no indication a fire was intentionally started, and investigators are waiting for the fire marshal to determine the cause of the explosion.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Officials say a diminutive fish species native only to one spring in Eastern Oregon is set to be removed from the federal list of endangered species. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the Foskett speckled dace is one of several fish species that have seen comebacks in recent years. It was proposed for removal last year. The Foskett speckled dace was first listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1985 after biologists realized it only existed in one location at a remote spring and was extremely vulnerable to habitat loss. The Bureau of Land Management purchased over 150 acres surrounding the spring east of the town of Lakeview. Federal officials worked to protect the population at Foskett Spring and introduced the fish at a second location.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The state Supreme Court was asked Wednesday to outlaw the death penalty because of what critics call the cruel and arbitrary way it’s applied to poor and black defendants. More than half of the 441 death sentences handed down since the death penalty was reinstated in the late 1970s have been deemed flawed and overturned, Assistant Federal Defender Timothy Kane told the court. Among the 155 from Philadelphia, the reversal rate is 72%. “The reliability of the system as a whole is cruel ... and the systemic problems affect every case,” Kane argued before an overflow crowd at Philadelphia City Hall. Statewide, just under half of the current death row inmates in Pennsylvania are black, compared to 11% of residents. The average appeal in Pennsylvania takes 17 years, straining the resources of the court system, critics say.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A new study estimates the state’s greenhouse gas emissions are higher than previously calculated. Brown University’s Climate and Development Lab and the Stockholm Environment Institute calculated emissions in 2017 were about 45% higher than estimated in Rhode Island’s climate planning study. The study released Thursday was based on updated science on methane leakage from natural gas infrastructure and its short-term impacts. The researchers suggest shifting to electric cars and heating systems, insulating homes, getting rid of old appliances and expanding offshore wind development. Climate lab director Timmons Roberts says the study’s ideas can be applied to other states because the big picture is largely the same, due to natural gas leakage.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Reality television star and ex-state treasurer Thomas Ravenel has been fined $500 after taking a plea deal to charges he assaulted a former nanny. Ravenel was initially charged with misdemeanor second-degree assault and battery after the nanny said the former “Southern Charm” star dropped his pants and fondled her at his Charleston home in January 2015. Ravenel pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and battery. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended if he pays a $500 fine. WCSC-TV reports Ravenel said in court Wednesday that he tried to kiss her and grabbed her arm, and he was wrong. Prosecutors say the woman agreed to the deal. Bravo took Ravenel off “Southern Charm” after his arrest. Ravenel pleaded guilty to cocaine charges in 2007 and resigned as state treasurer.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A South Dakotan has created a new online site where livestock producers can contract to sell their cattle. Kim Ulmer, who owns a livestock and machinery marketing company in Huron, says he created the American Mercantile Exchange in response to volatile market conditions. The first contract sales on the American Mercantile Exchange were made Sept. 3. Ulmer tells the Aberdeen News four loads of cattle were up for sale, and all four sold. Ulmer says sales will be limited to cattle that are close to sale weight until the mercantile has a larger database of buyers and sellers. He says selling cattle through his exchange is different from an auction barn because it eliminates the need for farmers to take the cattle to auction and sell on a particular day.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge has blocked the state’s new restrictions for registering voters from taking effect Oct. 1, saying Thursday that any benefit of the law won’t likely outweigh its potential harm. The ruling, for now, sets aside a law that goes beyond other states by fining groups that pay workers when too many incomplete registration forms are submitted. The law would also criminalize intentional infractions of a new set of rules, exposing voting advocates to misdemeanor charges. Voter registration groups who sued said the law has already curtailed their ability to enroll voters in communities of color and other historically disenfranchised groups. U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger picked apart the law in an order earlier this week, saying efforts to restrict voter registration drives to try to preserve election commission resources are akin to “poisoning the soil in order to have an easier harvest.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Eleven protesters have been arrested after they rappelled from a busy highway bridge over the Houston Ship Channel, closing the vital artery for hours. The Coast Guard said the closure came after the protesters were spotted Thursday afternoon dangling from the Fred Hartman Bridge near Baytown. The demonstrators were Greenpeace USA activists protesting the use of fossil fuels. They suspended themselves from a bridge ahead of Thursday night’s Democratic presidential debate in Houston. Firefighters rappelled to the protesters Thursday evening and lowered them to boats below. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez says 12 activists serving as spotters on the bridge also were arrested. The Port of Houston, located along the ship channel, is home to the largest petrochemical complex in the U.S.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state Supreme Court has ruled that partisan state school board elections are constitutional, overturning a 2017 district court decision. High court officials say the Wednesday ruling reinstates a 2016 law meaning people who want to run for the state Board of Education can file as partisan candidates beginning in 2020. The state Board of Education is composed of 15 members who are elected to four-year terms, with elections occurring every two years. Proponents of partisan elections say political party mechanisms were needed to adequately vet school board candidates, a move lawmakers had intended under the now-reinstated law. Current and former members of the state school board and some educational organizations say the ruling could lead to an educational system driven by a single political ideology influencing curriculum and policy.\n\nVermont\n\nLyndon: Vermont State Colleges officials are holding meetings at campuses to get input as the system charts its future amid declining enrollment, low state support and other challenges. An overflow crowd of students, faculty, alumni and community members shared their worries, suggestions and criticisms at a passion-filled meeting at Northern University in Lyndonville on Thursday. They expressed concerns about the school’s growing online classes and whether the programs and school they cherish will continue. They pointed out that the college – originally Lyndon State College – only recently went through a transformation in joining with Johnson State College to become Northern Vermont University. State Colleges Chancellor Jeb Spaulding told the crowd there is no proposal to close a campus or become all Northern Vermont University Online.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia has launched a live “elk cam.” The Department of Game and Inland Fisheries says the elk cam will run annually from mid-August through November. Elk rut peaks between late September and early October. During the fall rut period, elk are highly social and stay in large harem groups out in open areas. Three viewing stations are now open on Buchanan County Industrial Development Authority property, located near Poplar Gap Community Park. The Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and the Kentucky Wildlife Resources Foundation restored 75 elk from Kentucky to Buchanan County between 2012 and 2014. The population has grown to an estimated 250.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: As the area tries to tackle its homelessness crisis, an official wants to expand a strategy of buying long-distance bus tickets for people living on the streets. The concept of sending homeless people out of town to where they say they’re from or may have support has been in place for decades in parts of the U.S. The city of Seattle and community organizations already offer free bus tickets as part of their broader approach to helping homeless people. King County council member Reagan Dunn wants to go a step further by spending $1 million to create a stand-alone bus ticket program that will emphasize “family reunification.” Critics say Dunn’s idea won’t realistically address chronic homelessness.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRainelle: Police say three protesters who chained themselves to equipment at the Mountain Valley Pipeline have been arrested. WOAY-TV reports someone called 911 Tuesday morning and said about 15 protesters were blocking the road by the pipeline near Rainelle. Officers say three other people were chained to three excavators with their arms encased in steel pipes up to their elbows. Police say the three protesters had the ability to unchain themselves from the equipment but refused. Members of the Rainelle and Clintonville fire departments were called to remove them. Officers arrested a fourth person they say refused to get out of the road. All four were charged, arraigned in Greenbrier County Magistrate Court and released on bond.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An appeals court has reduced compensation for a man who got into a legal battle over bedbugs. According to court documents, Steven Stack rented a bedbug-infested room in La Crosse from Donald Lecheler, who planned to solve the problem by moving the kitchen oven around the house, hoping to increase the temperature and kill the bedbugs. Stack said that would create a fire hazard and moved out. Stack filed a lawsuit in 2018 alleging Lecheler didn’t return his security deposit, he had to replace his mattress and clothes, and he suffered emotional distress. A judge awarded him $2,000. The 4th District Court of Appeals reduced Stack’s award Thursday to $1,000, saying Stack failed to show he suffered extreme emotional distress.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Campbell County school district trustees have decided to move forward with developing a policy that will allow armed school staff for security. The Gillette News Record reports the decision Tuesday to move forward with a policy for concealed carry staff, along with other safety procedures, followed a long and divisive comment period in which educators, parents, law enforcement and veterans spoke out. Not everyone agreed about arming school staff in the city limits, but they did agree safety was an issue and advocated for adding more school resource officers. They also agreed on the need for continued discussion. Officials say it will take at least two months to come up with a policy that will then be presented to the school board for a final decision.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2017/05/17/jozy-altidore-desperate-world-cup-return/101796738/", "title": "U.S. forward Jozy Altidore desperate for World Cup return", "text": "Martin Rogers\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nWith two pivotal World Cup qualifiers fast approaching for the United States men’s national team, Jozy Altidore's thoughts are rooted in the present and future of American soccer.\n\nAltidore is set to again lead the attacking line when the U.S. faces Trinidad and Tobago on June 8 in Denver, followed three days later by a greatly anticipated trip to Mexico’s Estadio Azteca to take on the team's fiercest rival.\n\n“We know that now is the time to deliver and we are ready to do that,” Altidore told USA TODAY Sports in a telephone interview.\n\nThe U.S. sits in fourth place in the final CONCACAF qualifying stage, on four points, with six games remaining.

We are playing with more freedom and expression and we are ready to go.”\n\nThe U.S. suffered a frustrating start to this qualifying phase, losing at home to Mexico and 4-0 in Costa Rica, results that led to the firing of former coach Jurgen Klinsmann. Things quickly improved under Bruce Arena, with a 6-0 victory at home to Honduras in March being followed by a hard-fought 1-1 tie in Panama.\n\nYet much as Altidore knows how key short-term results are in order to clinch a place at next summer’s World Cup in Russia and thereby continue the sport’s momentum in this country, he is also casting an eye to some of the fundamental issues that may be standing in the way of deeper growth.\n\nDespite some solid efforts from U.S. Soccer, the sport remains expensive to play at the junior level, both in terms of participation fees and equipment. Altidore said that as a youngster growing up in Boca Raton, Fla., he received a coaching discount. “Otherwise I would have had to play another sport,” he said.\n\nAlong with Bay Area businessman Bejan Esmaili, Altidore is the driving force behind footymarket.com, a new online soccer marketplace aimed at helping under-served youngsters obtain near-new soccer cleats at reasonable prices. The soccer fashion market has reached a point where the newest cleats retail for up to $300. Not quite $495, the figure being charged by basketball loudmouth LaVar Ball’s Big Baller Brand, but not far from it.\n\n“It is very tough for these kids and their parents,” Altidore said. “A young soccer player can have the newest pair of boots and then before you know it suddenly it is already outdated.\n\n“As a kid I was outgrowing my shoes so quickly. I would be getting down there with superglue or whatever else to make it fit and work, my dad would find a way, my mom would be stitching them up. I didn’t want to break my parents’ back.\n\n“My parents would get me a good shoe, I would clean them and look after them, but I’d still be growing out of them in no time.”\n\nThe Footy Market project encourages parents and children to either donate cleats, balls or clothing that are no longer needed through the website, or to offer the items at affordable prices. There are also plans to auction off memorabilia, with the proceeds going to soccer-themed charities.\n\nAltidore said he believes that for American soccer to take another significant leap, making it easier for struggling families to put their children into the game is a must.\n\n“We are a country that is always growing and learning in soccer,” he said. “If we can make sure these kids have every opportunity to fulfill their potential then it will benefit the game as a whole and maybe some of these kids can make it all the way.\n\n“We hope this is something that can ease the burden. We hope it can take a load off the parents and eliminate any reason why a young player shouldn’t be comfortable and have every chance to succeed.”\n\nAltidore has long had a strong social conscience. His family originates from Haiti, and he has made trips to that country to provide aid along with musician Wyclef Jean.\n\nOn the soccer front, Altidore is desperate to get back to the World Cup after suffering a demoralizing injury in the opening game of the 2014 tournament in Brazil and playing no further part.\n\n“I am itching,” he said. “I missed (most of) the last one and I think about it every day. People always talk about the location of a World Cup, is it going to be ready, will it be good? I don’t care. I just want to be there, to play there and if we can get some results, help the country come together behind the team.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/17"}]}

In that period, nearly every individual item got more expensive, with some categories seeing dramatic increases. Eggs spiked 33.1%, flour jumped 19.2% and chicken went up 18.6%. Milk got 16.4% more expensive, and fruits and vegetables were 8.1% pricier.\n\nRestaurant menu prices grew 7.7% in that time period.\n\nMany grocery items got more expensive in May. Michael Nagle/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nPrices have been rising across the board this year, and inflation surged to a new pandemic-era peak in June, with US consumer prices jumping by 9.1% year-over-year. The June increase was largely caused by a jump in gasoline prices, which were up nearly 60% from the year before. Americans saw record-high gas prices last month, with the national average topping $5 a gallon.\n\nWhen it comes to food, an “unfolding avalanche of problems” has led to higher prices, said Rob Fox, director of the knowledge exchange division at CoBank, which provides financial services to agribusinesses.\n\nTo name a few: Tight milk supplies contributed to a surge in some dairy prices. Avian flu has been hiking up the cost of eggs. Commodities such as wheat and corn were driven up by bad weather and the war in Ukraine. Add to that higher wages and packaging costs, and you get highly elevated food prices.\n\nWhat changed in the grocery store in May\n\nFrom May to June, adjusted for seasonal swings, a number of grocery items got more expensive.\n\nFlour prices jumped 5.3%. Butter got 4.8% pricier and margarine went up 6.8%.\n\nFresh biscuits, rolls and muffins popped 3.5%, while fresh-baked cakes and cupcakes rose 2.9%. Shoppers looking to satisfy their dessert cravings had to pay more in the frozen aisle, too — ice cream got 4% more expensive and frozen and refrigerated bakery products got 2.9% pricier. Sugar rose 2.1%.\n\nBut there was some relief at the checkout counter, especially in the meat department. Beef and veal prices fell 2.3%, pork dropped 1.6% and bacon went down 1.9%. Hot dogs were an outlier, however, getting 4.5% more expensive.\n\nIn the fresh produce section, citrus fruits took a 4.5% dip.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBut there are signs that prices could start to fall.\n\n“My prediction is that we are right now at peak inflation at the consumer level,” Fox said. Partially that’s because food producers’ input costs, which were trending upward last year, peaked earlier this year and have been falling, he said.\n\nPlus, consumers may start restricting their purchases or choosing lower-priced options when possible, cutting demand and — eventually — leading to lower prices.\n\nPreliminary survey data released by the University of Michigan last month showed that consumer sentiment slumped to a record low between May and June, suggesting that some shoppers may begin to change their spending habits.\n\nIf prices do start to fall, it won’t happen right away, Fox noted, saying it could take another six to nine months for prices to decline. Even then, he doesn’t expect price tags to dip below the levels seen this time last year.\n\n— CNN Business’s Lucy Bayly and Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/business/chicken-prices/index.html", "title": "Chicken prices are finally starting to fall | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nOver the past year, as some meat prices have fallen, chicken prices have remained stubbornly high. Strong demand, supply issues and even breeding problems with under-performing roosters kept the pressure on. The supply shortage even had some restaurants, like Wingstop, experimenting with less popular items like thighs.\n\nBut now conditions are finally easing, paving the way for price declines ahead. In the year through October, not adjusting for seasonal swings, chicken prices had jumped 14.5%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBut in October, prices fell 1.3% from the month before. And promotions and deals are right around the corner.\n\nThe poultry industry has been able to work through one of the issues that slashed supply last year — a poor choice of rooster that led to fewer chicks than expected.\n\nChicken prices are finally falling. Apu Gomes/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn May 2021, poultry giant Tyson explained it was short on chickens because of disappointing results with the type of breeding rooster it had picked.\n\n“We’re changing out a male that, quite frankly, we made a bad decision on,” Donnie King, then Tyson’s chief operating officer and group president of poultry, said at the time. There was an “unexpected decline” in hatchings earlier that year because of the type of roosters it used, King, now the CEO, explained.\n\nTyson wasn’t the only one with the problem, noted Christine McCracken, executive director of animal protein at Rabobank. “If you look across the industry as a whole there were productivity issues that challenged several operators,” she said.\n\nSince then, producers “have gone back to a more traditional bird,” she said.\n\nWhy chicken prices were high\n\nBut the roosters don’t bear all the blame. Chicken processors were caught off guard by the sudden bounceback in foodservice demand in 2021 after mass restaurant closures in 2020, explained Grady Ferguson, senior research analyst at Gro Intelligence, an agricultural data analytics firm.\n\nThe decision to cut supply in 2020 affected flock sizes in 2021 — you can’t shrink a chicken flock overnight. Effectively, producers made a bet in 2020 that demand would still be down in 2021, and anticipated that smaller supply would be sufficient, he said.\n\nBut in 2021, demand came roaring back. Because of that, chicken producers were “under-supply [and] unable to meet the demand of this unexpectedly white hot, post-isolation demand” for chicken, said Ferguson.\n\nPrices start to fall\n\nWith supply and demand in better alignment, wholesale prices have been falling in recent months, and prices in the grocery store have started to follow.\n\nIt takes some time for lower wholesale prices to reach consumers.\n\nPartially, that’s because of long contracts that protect buyers and sellers from volatility. It’s also because wild price swings in the grocery store would be jarring to consumers, so retailers prefer to move prices steadily up or down rather than stick closely to what’s happening in the wholesale market.\n\nStill, a decline in wholesale prices eventually leads to a decline in retail prices, which is starting to happen.\n\nThe decline marks a welcome turnaround from the higher chicken prices this year, which have added an extra stressor in the grocery store for consumers who have been turning to chicken as a more affordable alternative to beef and other pricy cuts of meat.\n\nChicken is still cheaper compared to beef or pork when you look at sticker prices, said Jayson Lusk, head of the department of agricultural economics at Purdue University.\n\n“If [consumers are] being pinched, their real spending power is falling, poultry is going to look like a good option.” And more grocery stores will likely start to offer more promotions on chicken after the holidays.\n\nThis time of year, shoppers typically look for roasts, stew meat, sausage and, of course, turkey. Retailers may offer promotions on such seasonal foods to get customers in the door.\n\nBut customers just aren’t that interested in chicken, and so it doesn’t make sense to offer promotions on the item at the holidays.\n\nBut that will likely change early next year, said Rabobank’s McCracken, once the holidays have passed and people have made fresh resolutions,\n\n“Everybody shifts back to leaner, healthier meats at the beginning of the year,” she said. That means deals are ahead.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/economy/gas-prices-falling-inflation/index.html", "title": "Gas prices have fallen. Here's why inflation hasn't | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nGas prices have been trending downward for more than 50 consecutive days, giving drivers some much-needed financial relief at the pump.\n\nBut nobody’s popping the champagne just yet. While gas prices have played a large role in the current bout of historic inflation, analysts warn that a number of factors remain that will keep overall prices from falling any time soon.\n\nOil outlook remains murky\n\nPrices at the pump might be lower now – the average cost of a gallon of gas is down almost a dollar since the June peak – but the longer-term outlook for oil suggests low inventories that will keep prices elevated.\n\n“Russia-Ukraine is a factor but… we had tight supplies coming into this,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “We’d love to see the conflict in Russia and Ukraine end. But I think we still are faced with a global economy that is short of oil in the near term.”\n\nAside from Russia’s war with Ukraine and the sanctions that have disrupted its oil exports, the unwillingness – or inability, according to some oil analysts – of members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to significantly increase production is limiting how much additional oil is coming onto global markets. The oil group and its partners, known as OPEC+, last week announced a small output increase of 100,000 barrels a day for September, less than the market had expected.\n\nOne other factor is the hesitancy of US producers to sink big money into extracting and – more critically – refining fossil fuels when long-term policy goals suggest diminishing returns in the face of a shift to renewable energy.\n\n“There is a structural problem with the oil and gas industry and that has to do with refining capability,” said Jeff Klearman, portfolio manager at ETF company GraniteShares. “Oil companies, not just in the United States but globally, have not expanded refining capacity. That continues to pressure gas prices.”\n\nPeter McNally, global sector lead for industrials, materials and energy at investment firm Third Bridge, said there was “misunderstood criticism” of refiners’ swelling profits, pointing to investments being made to convert existing refining facilities to process biofuels. “These companies are investing for the energy transition,” he said.\n\nHousing keeps getting pricier\n\nHousing is a big part of the average family’s budget, and it’s also a big part of the basket of goods and services the government uses to calculate inflation. The way the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the cost of housing makes it a highly influential piece of the Consumer Price Index. Shelter costs include owners’ equivalent rent and rent of primary residence, which captures how much both homeowners and renters pay to live in their homes. Shelter comprises about a third of the overall CPI, and makes up around 40% of core CPI, which excludes prices for food and energy.\n\n“What is important is housing,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “While we have been seeing new and existing home sales start to decline, prices have not been coming down because there’s still more demand than there is supply.”\n\nExisting home prices hit a new record high of $416,000 in June, up 13.4% from a year ago. A February report from Realtor.com found that at the median, renters earning the typical household income for their area are paying nearly 30% of their income on rent, a threshold policymakers consider “rent-burdened.”\n\nAlso, the double whammy of higher prices and elevated mortgage rates continues to push homeownership out of reach for many, with more and more families forced onto the sidelines as the impact of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes pushes up the cost of purchasing a home.\n\n“Prices for housing will likely remain elevated and in a sense, keep high inflation higher for longer,” Stovall said.\n\nWarped demand and worker shortages\n\nSince the pandemic, a surge in demand for physical goods has thrown supply chains entirely out of whack, snarling logistics and triggering huge price distortions.\n\n“Inflation is primarily caused by excessive demand chasing too few goods,” said David Dollar, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThis demand ran headlong into factory shutdowns in China, triggering cascading maritime traffic jams at Pacific ports. When vessels docked, there weren’t enough workers to unload the cargo or drive the trucks that would transport it first to warehouses, then to consumers.\n\n“The overall demand for merchandise went up quite dramatically, so we were suddenly asking our system to handle a lot more stuff,” Dollar said. The result was chaos, and a sudden clamoring for workers – at any price.\n\n“The lack of truckers reflects [that] we need more workers than we actually have, and that’s being resolved through higher wages,” Haworth said. As of June, there were more than three-quarters of a million additional workers in the transportation and warehousing sectors than before the pandemic.\n\nSalaries and stimulus\n\nEconomists expect wage gains, which have been hovering at just above 5% on an annualized basis, to moderate through the rest of the year. But employers are still facing an acute shortage of workers, putting pressure on businesses to offer competitive salaries to attract and retain talent.\n\nThere were 10.7 million unfilled jobs in June, the BLS reported last week. While down from a record 11.7 million in April, that’s still almost two open positions for every American worker without a job.\n\n“What we’re not yet clear about is, what is the new post-pandemic normal when it comes to demand? For now, it looks like wage pressures are here for a bit,” Haworth said.\n\nThat’s because unlike supply-chain snarls or even whipsawing commodity prices, inflation that creeps into wages is not easily undone. Even if companies can pay less for components or raw materials, they are unlikely to implement pay cuts, so inflation lingers.\n\n“It’s highly correlated to wage growth. That’s not to say higher wages are a bad thing,” Haworth said. “When people have more money, they can buy more things. But if there’s not actually more things, prices go up. Ultimately, that does translate into some pressure for prices on everything else.”\n\nRecent wage gains are coming on the heels of fiscal and monetary policies that contributed to an economy awash in liquidity as a result of stimulus payments to individuals and businesses, as well as quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve.\n\n“They injected a ton of money into the system,” Klearman said. Like higher wages, all this cash – and too few goods to spend it on – is another contributor to price hikes consumers are experiencing on everything from cars to camping equipment to cookies.\n\nLight at the end of the tunnel?\n\nDespite expectations that inflation will likely stick around into 2023, there are some bright spots.\n\nIn addition to paying less to commute and run errands, Stovall says high-flying airfares could come back down to earth, and supermarket shoppers could see some grocery costs fall slightly if producers or distributors don’t have to pay as much for transportation in order to get their goods onto shelves. “You could start to see some food price competition start to enter the marketplace as the cost of transportation input starts to come down,” he said.\n\nWhile supply chain snarls remain in some sectors – General Motors told investors on its quarterly conference call last month that it made 95,000 vehicles over the preceding quarter that can’t be finished, or sold, because the company can’t get the parts it needs to finish them – there is a sense that the earlier period of gridlock is easing.\n\nThere have also been some recent high-profile instances of retail markdowns: Walmart and Target both said they have had to slash prices to unload large amounts of unsold inventory that has lingered on shelves as Americans have shifted their spending back to services like dining out and live events.\n\nThere is also renewed, albeit uncertain, hope that President Joe Biden will roll back one or more tranches of the punitive tariffs Trump slapped on China in what experts agree was a largely failed bid to force Beijing to purchase more American agricultural products and other key exports.\n\nAn analysis by the Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that, over time, rolling back Trump-imposed and other tariffs could pare inflation by as much as 1.3 percentage points, saving the average American household close to $800 a year.\n\n“It would certainly be smart to remove the tariffs now,” Dollar said. “They’re not meeting any objectives and they’re being paid for by American households.”", "authors": ["Martha C.

The question is what shape that recession will take.\n\nRecessions and recoveries come in shapes and sizes as varied as the alphabet. Perhaps that’s why economists have come to name different kinds of economic downturns after letters.\n\nBut predicting which letter will match the situation isn’t quite as easy as ABC. This looming recession is particularly complicated.\n\n“Whether it’s Covid in Asia or what’s going on in Ukraine or what’s going on with energy, it’s one thing after another,” said Nick Tell, CEO of investment bank Armory Group.\n\nThe component of this potential downturn that’s unlike others is “the psychological impact on the workforce from Covid and the enormous amount of subsidies that were introduced into the economy,” said Tell. The resulting labor shortage is something that hasn’t been seen outside of a wartime recession.\n\n“When you look at job openings relative to the number of unemployed individuals we’re certainly in uncharted territory here,” agreed David Lebovitz a global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “I’ve never really seen it like this in my lifetime.”\n\nBut “components of what’s going on are reminiscent of past recessions,” said Tell.\n\nSo if we’re bound for a recession, what form will it take?\n\nU-shaped\n\n“I think we’re going to have a U-shaped recovery, which is one we haven’t seen in a long time,” said Tell.\n\nA U-shaped recession signals a steep decline, with a bit of a long struggle at the bottom before recovery. These are painful recessions that last a year or two and are caused by a number of coinciding factors. The stagflation, oil crisis and stop-and-go Fed response between 1973-75 caused a drawn-out U-shaped recovery.\n\nSimon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, compared this type of recession to being stuck in a bathtub. “You go in. You stay in. The sides are slippery. You know, maybe there’s some bumpy stuff in the bottom, but you don’t come out of the bathtub for a long time,” he said.\n\nThe economy will need to slow down for a while before the workforce and unemployment return to a normal level, said Tell. When that finally does happen, things will revert back to normal, but it might take a few years.\n\nV-shaped\n\nA V-shape recession is just what it sounds like: A sharp decline with a clear bottom and then a sharp incline. This type of quick and complete recovery is considered a best-case scenario when it comes to recession. Sometimes the fall into recession is steeper than the climb back up towards recovery, like a Nike swoosh.\n\nThese usually represent a recovery from recession based on one-time shocks, like the two-month-long 2020 Covid recession.\n\nLebovitz is hopeful that if there is a recession, it will be V-Shaped and only last a few quarters. One of the things that we always look for and try to gauge is some sort of imbalance,” he said. “There was an imbalance in equity valuations during the tech bubble, and an imbalance in housing in the run up to the financial crisis of 2008. Looking at the economy today, we don’t see any significant imbalances that would lead to a serious downturn in the economy.” The next recession, said Lebovitz, will be relatively mild.\n\nLebovitz recommends that investors stay the course over the next 12 to 18 months. “We don’t suggest selling when you’re already down 20%,” he said. Still, investors should take this as an opportunity to rebalance their portfolios and to make sure that their broader house is in order.\n\nW-Shaped\n\nThe dreaded double-dip recession. This occurs when an economy moves beyond a recession into recovery and then falls right back into another recession. A W-shaped recovery is particularly painful to investors who jump back into what they believe to be a recovered market before plummeting to another bottom.\n\nIn 1980, the economy had a short six-month recession and recovery followed by a 16-month downturn that stretched all the way from mid-1981 to late-1982. If the Federal Reserve isn’t aggressive enough in raising interest rates, some analysts say, this could happen again.\n\nL-Shaped\n\nAn L-Shaped or “hockey stick” recession is what economists want to avoid at all costs. It means a plunge in growth for a very long time, and we often creep out of ‘R’ word territory into ‘D’ word territory: Depression. It usually means large numbers of workers remain unemployed for significant periods of time and that capital goods are sitting idle.\n\nThe Great Depression in the 1930s had an ‘L’ shape, and some economists argue that the Great Recession of the late 2000s was the same, it took six years after the crisis for GDP to return to 2007 levels. Some called it a “barbecue recovery”: low and slow.\n\nK-Shaped\n\nA K-shaped recovery is what happens when separate communities recover from economic downturns at varying rates. Some sectors of society may experience renewed growth while others continue to lag behind.\n\nThese changes are usually defined by industrial, wealth and geographic differences and are exacerbated by increased rates of income and wealth inequality.\n\nWhile the 2020 recession recovery can be described as V-shaped, many point out that it was actually two-pronged. Low-income Black and Hispanic families saw the fastest depletion of their savings during the pandemic, for example.\n\nMany who worked in white-collar jobs recovered quickly from the 2020 recession as the government handed out stimulus payments and stocks and home prices appreciated. Those without savings and who worked service jobs continued to suffer. Employees receiving the lowest wages were the most likely to lose their jobs in nearly every sector of the economy between 2020 and 2021, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n“The lowest average wage establishments and the lowest earning workers have borne the brunt of the recession induced by the Coronavirus pandemic,” wrote economists at the BLS. “The lowest wage establishments and the lowest wage workers both saw the steepest initial declines in employment at the start of the recession and experienced the slowest subsequent recovery in employment.”", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/business/chocolate-sales-ctrp/index.html", "title": "Chocolate is having a moment | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nBetween warnings of a recession, high inflation and layoff fears, the news is bleak. Why not have some chocolate?\n\nChocolate makers are reporting booming sales as stressed out customers reach for something sweet to take the edge off.\n\nIn the third quarter, sales of Hershey’s (HSY) chocolates, which include Reese’s, Kit Kat and Hershey bars, jumped 12.6% in retail. Mondelez (MDLZ), the global snack brand that makes Toblerone, Cadbury and others, said its chocolate sales grew 9.3% in the quarter.\n\nChocolate, like many comfort foods, got a boost during the pandemic. But unlike other categories such as pizza, where interest fell off as employees returned to the office and kids went back to school, chocolate is still growing — thanks in part to demand from stressed out consumers.\n\n“Chocolate grew in 2020 and has maintained that growth, something many industries were not able to do,” according to a 2022 report from the research firm Mintel. “Increased at-home occasions, the need for fun and relief from stress, and the availability and convenience of chocolate all contributed to this upward trajectory.”\n\nIn the year through October 30, chocolate sales hit $17.7 billion in US retail, according to data from market research firm IRI, up from $14.6 billion for the year in 2019.\n\nChocolate sales are booming. Adobe Stock\n\nOne reason for the growth is higher prices for groceries and snacks, including chocolate. The increase isn’t affecting sales too much — shoppers are not that sensitive to changes in the price of chocolate, said Dan Sadler, principal of client insights at IRI, who has expertise in the confections market and tracks price sensitivity.\n\nIn the second quarter, IRI found that elasticity for chocolate was about -.4. That means that a 10% increase in prices would result in only a 4% drop in sales by volume, Sadler explained.\n\n“You can raise that price, and you’ll see a little bit of a hit to volume, but not a whole lot, not like you will in some other categories,” he said.\n\nEven chocolate makers have been surprised by how well demand is holding up.\n\nElasticity “remains below expectations,” said Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put during a recent analyst call discussing the company’s third-quarter results, lower even than before Covid. “We see consumers saying that chocolate is really something they cannot live without.”\n\nHershey raised its net sales and earnings outlook for the year on November 4th, when it reported third-quarter results that exceeded its expectations.\n\n“Our products remain an affordable treat for families and for consumers,” said Hershey CEO Michele Buck during an analyst call. “We know that part of that is they want to reward themselves when times are tough. They also use these products to relieve stress. And we think that those trends will continue.”\n\nCustomers are making some changes, she noted, like shopping at value channels or choosing value packs.\n\nIt’s not s’mores without Hershey\n\nCompanies like Mondelez and Hershey are largely spared competition from store brands, or private label, which are gaining ground as grocery prices rise.\n\nAccording to IRI, just 2.7% of the US chocolate retail market is made up of private label, while that portion is much higher in other categories. In dairy milk, for example, store brands account for about 62% of sales. Even in salty snacks and non-chocolate candy, private label share is at 4.8%.\n\nShoppers are “brand specific” when it comes to chocolate, Sadler said. “You’re gonna make s’mores with a Hershey bar, you’re not going to substitute with something else.”\n\nMondelez benefits from that kind of brand loyalty, as well. “Shoppers continue to say they are much less likely to switch to private label in chocolate and biscuits compared to other categories,” said Mondelez’s Van de Put during the call.\n\nEventually, higher prices may hit the chocolate category. IRI is seeing volume sales start to dip, Sadler noted, suggesting that consumers are becoming more price sensitive.\n\nAnd though private label sales pale in comparison to national brands, they are also growing at a faster clip than branded chocolate.\n\nIRI’s data shows that private label sales rose 16% in the year through October 30 compared to the year before, while national brands grew by 8.8%.\n\nStill, chocolate isn’t going anywhere. The sweet’s “position as an accessible indulgence will help shield it from significant impacts,” Mintel’s report said.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/economy/inflation-markets-economy/index.html", "title": "When will price increases end? Probably never | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA dollar just isn’t worth what it used to be.\n\nAt the grocery store, you’re getting about 11 cents less than you did just a year ago. That dollar covers 15 cents less on utility bills and it’s worth six cents less on your rent and housing costs. That adds up to a pretty decent chunk of change.\n\nIt also explains why, as prices go up across the board, inflation is now a top concern for Americans.\n\nThe rate of inflation is nearly as high as it was in the early 1980s. According to the latest report July from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it was 8.5% but would have been even higher if not for falling gas prices.\n\nSo when will price increases end? The answer is probably never. But that’s not a bad thing, as long as the increases aren’t too high.\n\nIt’s not just the US facing that problem. In almost every advanced economy in the world, the average annual rate of inflation in the first quarter of this year was at least twice what it was last year.\n\nPeople all around the globe are facing tough decisions about how to stretch their paychecks. Wages and salaries declined 3.5% over the past year, after adjusting for rising prices.\n\nWhy some inflation is good\n\nInflation doesn’t end, it just gets less bad. And, in fact, we don’t want it to end entirely.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, the US central bank tasked with lowering the rate of inflation through a series of interest rate hikes, is aiming for a target of around 2%. That means that prices will still rise, just not nearly as much.\n\nWhen people say inflation is easing, they don’t mean that groceries are getting cheaper. They mean that they’re not going up as much each month. It’s very rare to enter a deflationary period, and the government likes to avoid it if possible as it usually indicates that the economy is cooling way too rapidly.\n\nSo yes, inflation will continue on for a very long time, but you won’t notice it as much. Between the start of 1991 and the end of 2019, year-over-year inflation averaged about 2.3% a month. Those are ideal increases, the kind that cost of living raises can keep up with, the kind of “in my day a soda only cost a nickel” increases that become obvious only over long swaths of time.\n\nThat doesn’t mean some prices won’t come down, of course. The price of gas, for example, has fallen significantly over the past two months. Food prices could also fall. Food and gas prices are more volatile than other expenses because they’re impacted by outside factors like supply chain issues and Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Federal Reserve can’t do much to control them, and they tend to swing in both directions.\n\nBut for the most part, prices of goods will remain higher, and consumers won’t feel relief until their wages catch up to the new prices. Over the last four decades, there hasn’t been any deflation in core goods, which exclude food and energy, said Nick Roussanov, a professor at Wharton finance. Durable goods and services, like cars, appliances and education, rarely come down in price.\n\nThe Fed is now trying to shorten the length of time it takes for wages to catch up to these new prices. The longer it takes for that to occur, the more likely it is that Americans dip into their savings or take on credit card debt. It’s already happening: Over the past year, credit card debt has jumped by $100 billion, or 13%, the biggest percentage increase in more than 20 years.\n\nThe reason for optimism\n\nInflation won’t continue at the current pace forever. Most economists predict that it will come down to that target rate of 2% by 2024.\n\nSo yes, things will continue to be painful, but they won’t be anything like the bring-a-wheelbarrow-of-money-to-purchase-a-loaf-of-bread inflation crises we learned about in history class. No one is worried about hyperinflation, at least not in the United States.\n\nThat’s not to say that high inflation won’t stick around for a while.\n\nSome economists think that inflation could remain at a slightly elevated at 3% to 4% for decades. Boomers are retiring, and birth rates are decreasing. That’s squeezing the labor force, says former UK central banker Charles Goodhart, and we’re entering an era full of worker shortages, which means elevated prices. Central bankers are paying attention to the theory. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly has said immigration restrictions might need to be reexamined in order to fix the problem.\n\nThere have been long periods of elevated inflation in the US before: In the 1970s the US economy suffered three recessions during which the underlying inflation problem never went away. But monetary policy has shifted since then. In that same decade, central banks had multiple objectives: high output and employment and price stability. Today, the Fed tends to prioritize price stability over those other mandates. That means Fed Chair Jerome Powell has a mandate to increase interest rates until inflation falls, even if the economy falls along with it.\n\nA global crisis\n\nThe US is likely safe from hyperinflation: To be sure, prices are elevated, but not unprecedentedly so and they eased last month.\n\nStill, other countries are suffering. Inflation in Argentina is sitting at a 20-year high of over 70%, and the country’s central bank has raised its main rate of interest to 69.5% as it tries to contain soaring prices. Turkey’s annual rate of inflation, meanwhile, hit almost 80% in June — its highest level in about two decades.\n\nLong-term elevated prices tend to plunge some countries into periods of instability, which in turn raise food and gas prices globally. They also impact developing nations more severely and, according to a UN report, could upend the progress made over the past decade to fight climate change.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/business/jell-o-america-dessert-ctpr/index.html", "title": "How Jell-O lost its spot as America's favorite dessert | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nWay in the back of the grocery store, at the end of the sleepy baking aisle, sits a brand decades past its prime: Jell-O gelatin.\n\nToday, Jell-O is served to patients at hospitals. Or schoolchildren throw it around during food fights at lunch and college kids swallow it down with alcohol shots. Others associate Jell-O with the disgraced comedian Bill Cosby, who was the face of the brand for 30 years. Jell-O molds and now-defunct flavors like Italian salad and mixed vegetables are in recipe books for “nauseating” foods.\n\n“Jell-O is kind of associated nowadays in our culture with illness and frailty and vulnerability. So it certainly doesn’t have the fun associations that it did when I was growing up,” said Rachel Herz, a neuroscientist and the author of “Why You Eat What You Eat.”\n\nJell-O revolutionized dessert. But it mostly sits at the end of the sleepy baking aisle or in the back of the cupboard these days. Gabby Jones/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut Jell-O once gave middle-class consumers access to a luxurious food that had only been accessible to the wealthy. Then Jell-O turned into a salad, a staple dish of the mid-twentieth century, and morphed into a fun snack for kids. It was adaptable and versatile. Jell-O became a figure of speech and the state food of Utah, where the state’s large Mormon population is known for its devotion to the product. Jell-O even went to space.\n\nIt was this country’s national dessert, eaten by presidents at the White House, depicted in advertising by leading actors and artists, and a symbol of Americana.\n\nJell-O “displays so many elements of the American character,” wrote Carolyn Wyman in her 2001 book “Jell-O: A Biography.” Jell-O is the “food that most resembles a toy.”\n\nBut how did a brand once marketed as “America’s Most Famous Dessert” become an afterthought today?\n\nA dessert for the rich\n\nThe genius of Jell-O was to transform an elegant, complex dessert and make it cheap and easy to make.\n\nDesserts with gelatin, which is essentially purified glue, have a luxurious history. During the Victorian era in Europe, decorative gelatin molds were a symbol of high society and served to royalty. Gelatin desserts were for the elite who had cooks and servants to labor through the elaborate and time-consuming process of making gelatin, often extracted from the feet of calves or other animal parts.\n\n“If ever there was a food calling out for a convenience product solution, it was gelatin,” Wyman wrote.\n\nIn 1897, Pearle Wait, a carpenter in LeRoy, a small town outside of Rochester, New York, found an answer to the problem. Wait, who dabbled with developing cough remedies and teas, added flavoring and coloring to granulated gelatin, a flavorless food ingredient.\n\nWait came up with a sweet, flavored powder that could be added to boiled water, cooled, and was ready to serve. The first flavors of his product, which were extracted from natural fruits, were orange, lemon, strawberry and raspberry. (It’s not known exactly how he added the colors.)\n\nAn early print advertisement for Jell-O. The brand used recipe books and print ads to popularize the name Jell-O. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nWait trademarked a name for his invention, Jell-O, based on an idea from his wife May. How she landed on the name has been lost to history, but some historians believe it was inspired by the product Grain-O, a substitute for coffee, that was also made in LeRoy by the Genesee Pure Food Company.\n\nWait couldn’t get his new product off the ground. In 1899, he sold the rights to Jell-O to Genesee for $450.\n\nJell-O’s fortunes quickly changed under Genesee. Orator Woodward, the owner of the company, turned over the advertising, which was in its nascent stages, to ad firms in New York.\n\nThe advertising, targeted at women in magazines like Ladies’ Home Journal, stressed how easy the new product was to make — and for only 10 cents, about the cost of a loaf of bread.\n\nGenesee tried to turn Jell-O into a brand consumers would ask for by name, and salesmen would go door-to-door to local grocers to persuade them to place ads of Jell-O in windows and behind the counters. The ads, depicting fancy Jell-O molds in startling new colors, stood out. Jell-O also distributed free recipe books, a new marketing strategy at the time.\n\nBy 1907, Jell-O sales crossed $1 million.\n\nJell-O Girl\n\nEarly Jell-O advertising depicted women as inept, needing the help of a simple recipe like Jell-O.\n\n“How often some ingredient is forgotten or not rightly proportioned and the dessert spoiled,” ran another ad. “I couldn’t keep a house without Jell-O.”\n\nEarly ads emphasized the beauty and glamor of these desserts that were formerly unattainable to the average household, said Wendy Woloson, a historian at Rutgers University-Camden who studies consumer culture in 19th-century America. “Even you can serve this dessert to your family, without the use of a servant.”\n\nJell-O “was able to democratize access to a dessert that had formerly been a high end luxury type of dessert only available to the rich,” Woloson added. “That was really significant.”\n\nIn 1904, Jell-O introduced the Jell-O Girl, which helped reinforce the idea that children loved Jell-O and that it was so simple to make a child could do it.\n\nThe Jell-O Girl was the face of the brand for almost 40 years. Rose O’Neill, a famous artist who created the Kewpie doll, created “Jell-O and The Kewpies” ads for the brand featuring the dolls and the Jell-O Girl.\n\nA 1919 ad with the Jell-O Girl, the face the brand for nearly 40 years. Niday Picture Library/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nBy 1925, Geneese sold Jell-O to the Postum Cereal Company (which would eventually become the giant General Foods and is Kraft Heinz today) for $67 million.\n\nJell-O salads\n\nJell-O shifted during its next phase.\n\nDuring the Great Depression and World War II era, Jell-O was pitched as an affordable food, a way to turn a few ingredients into a family meal people could use to stretch their dollars.\n\nAgain, Jell-O leaned on new advertising to stand out.\n\nIt was one of the first companies to advertise on radio, sponsoring popular comedian Jack Benny’s radio program in 1934. Benny popularized the jingle “J-E-L-L-O” to millions of listeners and it was one of the most successful partnerships in radio advertising history. “Jell-O again! This is Jack Benny talking.”\n\nAlthough Jell-O initially was marketed primarily as a sweet dessert, it took on a new life as a savory salad, driven in part by the introduction of lime Jell-O in 1930.\n\nA 1950's magazine advertisement for Jell-O salads, a staple dish of mid-century America. Advertising Archive/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\n“Jell-O Salads, Welcome! say the women of America!” read an early ad displaying Jell-O as a salad.\n\n“Shimmering…luscious…Jell-O salads are making this a salad nation!” said another ad in The Farmer’s Wife magazine.\n\nJell-O congealed salads, often made with fruits, vegetables, Cool whip or other foods, were used to show off at dinner parties and a form of creative expression.\n\nJell-O released flavors such as seasoned tomato, celery, mixed vegetable and Italian salad, and Jell-O salads were a colorful way to use leftovers in side dishes. In 1955, the company introduced the slogan “A Jell-O salad makes the meal.”\n\n“The Jell-O salad really hits the American sensibility and palate perfectly. Americans have a longtime sweet tooth,” said Laura Shapiro, a culinary historian and author of “Perfection Salad” about women and cooking at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\n“This is the most American thing of all. Nobody but us thinks that a salad is a red molded strawberry flavored thing on a lettuce leaf. But that was one of the big attractions of Jell-O – you could eat a dessert and call it a salad.”\n\nJell-O was marketed as a light, satisfying ending to a meal even if people were stuffed – typified by its successful 1960s campaign slogan “There’s always room for Jell-O.”\n\nA Jell-O salad with whipped cream, garnished with olives. Constance Bannister Corp/Getty Images\n\nBut as more Americans traveled and global cuisines entered the mainstream, the simplicity of Jell-O salads became a downside. Julia Child brought French cooking to American kitchens, and Jell-O seemed bland.\n\n“Upscale becomes the new mainstream and Jell-O salads moves into a niche,” Shapiro said. “Jell-O salads started to look unsophisticated and kind of an antique. They started to look a little silly.”\n\nJell-O sales peaked in 1968 and then begin a decline of about 2% of a year for two decades, according to Jell-O biographer Wyman. By 1987, the company sold about half as many boxes as it did two decades prior.\n\nCosby\n\nWith Jell-O salads becoming less popular, the brand looked for its next hit.\n\nBut it had a problem: With the increase in women entering the workforce, families weren’t sitting down for as many meals and eating dessert like they once did. And new, ready-to-eat foods were hitting the market that were more convenient.\n\nWhat was once considered a quick and easy dessert now took too long to make for consumers, especially moms, Jell-O’s longtime target customer.\n\n“It was starting to be looked at as a chore in the mid 1980s,” said Chris Becker, who led the Jell-O account at Young & Rubicam, Jell-O’s longtime advertising agency. “It was perceived as old-fashioned and was creating dust in the cupboard.”\n\nJell-O began to pivot into new products such as single-serve cups, ready-to-eat Pudding Pops and frozen Gelatin Pops. It transitioned from targeting moms to marketing the product as a snack for kids and one time-starved parents could bond with their kids over making together.\n\nIn 1990, Jell-O launched a new product that would transform the brand: Jigglers. It was based on a recipe that used four times the usual amount of Jell-O and could be cut into squares. Jell-O launched a marketing blitz, with supermarket displays, Jiggler giveaways and ads with Bill Cosby.\n\nCosby had been working with Jell-O since the 1970s as the face of Jell-O’s pudding lineup, but Jigglers was the first gelatin commercials he appeared in. An ad showed Cosby and kids at a formal dinner tossing their spoons to eat the new Jigglers “with our bare hands.”\n\nCosby “brought that advertising to a different level,” Chris Becker said. “He became the brand.”\n\nWhile no longer the powerhouse it once was, Jell-O continued to innovate to meet changing consumer tastes.\n\nJell-O shifted to single-serve cups and more convenient options as competition for snacks and desserts grew. Richard B. Levine/Newscom/ZUMA Press\n\nKraft in the early 2000’s shifted the focus of Jell-O’s advertising away from kids and toward adults. It pitched sugar-free Jell-O, for example, as a treat for Atkins dieters. But as the Atkins diet slipped in popularity, it took Jell-O down with it.\n\nJell-O sales fell 19% from 2009 to 2013 to $753 million, the Associated Press reported at the time. Jell-O’s sales have stagnated since. In 2022, they were $688 million, according to IRI.\n\nReviving Jell-O\n\nJell-O has slumped in recent years because of competition and a lack of investment in the brand.\n\nKraft tried to restart its Jell-O business when it split into two companies in 2012, said Erin Lash, an analyst at Morningstar.\n\n“It never seemed to get off the ground in terms of resonating with consumers and getting over the overhang of being an unhealthy snack,” she said.\n\nBut perhaps Jell-O’s decline had less to do with the perception that it’s unhealthy than changes in consumers’ lifestyles. New salty and sweet convenience snacks with exciting tastes have emerged. Big brands, including Jell-O, have faced competition from a proliferation of startups and direct-to-consumer brands.\n\n“Over the course of the last 10 years, you’ve had a period where social media and online commerce has made it easier for smaller, niche startups,” Lash said. “Consumers have been more willing to purchase brands that they were unfamiliar with.”\n\nJell-O's sales have stalled over the past decade. Kraft Heinz, its parent company, says the brand will undergo a reinvention next year. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nJell-O has also become a smaller focus at Kraft Heinz, its parent, she said, and is a tiny piece of its business. Kraft Heinz’s “easy indulgent desserts” business, which includes Jell-O, makes up just 4% of the company’s total sales.\n\nJell-O has little presence on Instagram, TikTok and social platforms that are crucial to reaching younger shoppers. It also doesn’t advertise on television to try to reconnect Baby Boomers with the brand.\n\nBut Kraft Heinz said big changes are coming to Jell-O next year.\n\n“Jell-O is a beloved family brand with an incredible amount of opportunity,” Emily Kerschner, the vice president of marketing and strategy at Kraft Heinz, said in an email.\n\nNext year, Jell-O will “undergo its first brand renovation” in a decade and increase its advertisement spending, she said. It’s also exploring adjusting the recipe to reduce sugar.\n\nJell-O still remains a cultural curiosity, said Lynne Belluscio, the former director of the LeRoy Historical Society and the curator of the Jell-O Museum in the brand’s birthplace.\n\n“We have people come through and they say, you know, I really like Jell-O.

Peterson Foundation, an organization focused on raising awareness to the fiscal challenge.\n\nKelly pointed out that rising borrowing costs will limit how much money Washington can spend on other priorities like climate change.\n\nSkyrocketing pile of debt\n\nThe federal government now owes almost $8 trillion to foreign and international investors, led by Japan and China. Eventually, that will need to be paid back, with interest.\n\n“That means American taxpayers will be paying for the retirement of the people in China and Japan, who are our creditors,” said Kelly.\n\nThe $30 trillion national debt figure is somewhat inflated by the fact that a chunk of the money is owed by the government to itself. This is debt held in Social Security and other government trust funds. So-called intragovernmental holdings total more than $6 trillion.\n\nStill, the national debt has skyrocketed in recent decades, driven up in part by the 2008 financial crisis and then the pandemic.\n\nTotal debt outstanding stood at $9.2 trillion in December 2007 just as the Great Recession was beginning, according to Treasury data.\n\nBy the time former President Donald Trump took office, the national debt stood at nearly $20 trillion.\n\n“Covid exacerbated the problem. We had an emergency situation that required trillions in spending,” said Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peterson Foundation. “But the structural problems we face fiscally existed long before the pandemic.\n\nEven before Covid, Trump presided over a sharp increase in the national debt, highlighted by the massive tax cuts enacted in late 2017 – at a time when the US economy was booming and needed no fiscal stimulus. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will add $1 trillion to $2 trillion in federal debt between 2018 and 2025, according to the Tax Policy Center. The center notes that the impact will be even larger if some of the temporary tax cuts are extended.\n\nPolitical polarization\n\nPeterson said the principal drivers of the “dangerous fiscal situation” remain an aging population and elevated healthcare costs. He blamed Republicans and Democrats alike for running up the national debt.\n\n“Our current fiscal posture is a result of many years of fiscal irresponsibility from both parties. What’s required to get us out of this situation is honesty and leadership from our elected officials,” Peterson said.\n\nYet there has been virtually no progress in Washington in addressing the national debt ,and the two parties remain deeply divided over many issues.\n\n“The polarization of our government and, to some extent, our population, makes implementing solutions more difficult,” said Peterson. “If we don’t get our fiscal house in order, all these other concerns like climate, inequality and national security will be made more difficult.”\n\nAbout two-thirds (67%) of Americans in a CNN poll in December said government spending is a major problem for the nation’s economy, below rising costs for food and everyday items (80% said that was a major problem) and roughly on par with the pandemic (65% said Covid is a major problem).\n\nThere is a wide partisan gap on this issue, with 90% of Republicans calling government spending a major problem, compared with 70% of independents and 44% of Democrats.\n\nIn 2020, total public debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) surpassed 100%, years ahead of schedule. For context, Japan’s debt-to-GDP is well beyond 200%.\n\n‘Addicted to government debt’\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently acknowledged the fiscal situation can’t continue on the current trajectory.\n\n“We’re on an unsustainable path,” Powell told lawmakers last month. “Debt is not at an unsustainable level, but the path is unsustainable – meaning it’s growing faster than the economy, meaningfully faster than the economy. We have to address that over time. We will address it over time. And the better way to do it is soon.”\n\nBut that won’t be easy – or politically popular. And it will be complicated by the Fed’s planned interest rate hikes.\n\nEven though the national debt continues to hit new milestones, the federal government’s interest payments as a percentage of GDP are lower today than in the past. And that gives confidence to many economists that this is not an immediate crisis.\n\nIn 2021, interest as a percentage of GDP stood at 1.5%, compared with 3% in the early and mid-1990s, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.\n\n“I don’t see a short-term meltdown here,” said Kelly, the JPMorgan strategist.\n\nBut he said it still makes sense to reduce the national debt – gradually.\n\n“You don’t want to do it too quickly. This is an economy that is addicted to government debt,” Kelly said. “But the danger is that it keeps growing until eventually it does cause a huge problem.”", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/11/14/group-recent-princeton-grads-winning-lotteries-across-u-s/6254098002/", "title": "A group of recent Princeton grads is winning lotteries across U.S.", "text": "A group of recent Ivy League graduates is making a run on lotteries across America.\n\nSo far they’ve won more than $6 million from lotteries in Indiana, Missouri, Washington and the District of Columbia.\n\nExactly how they’re doing it – and how much they are profiting, if any – remains a mystery.\n\nThe unusual winning streak first came to light in Indiana after the apparent leader of the group, a 27-year-old Princeton University graduate named Manuel Montori IV, cashed in 61 winning Hoosier Lottery scratch-off tickets on a single day in September.\n\nAll of the winnings came from the same game, $7,000,000 MEGA CA$H, which sells for $30 a ticket. Most of Montori’s winners were for $1,000, but three were for $10,000, bringing his total haul to $88,000.\n\nBut that was just one day. Just one state.\n\nThe second gentleman:Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff breaks gender stereotypes\n\nRestaurants, stores struggle to survive:So why are many boosting spending, hiring workers?\n\nMontori has been on an 18-month winning streak, or so it would appear. It includes much larger paydays and is part of a scheme that includes at least three other Princeton alumni: Matthew Gibbons, Hannah Davinroy and Zoë Buonaiuto. All of them are associated with an obscure company Montori founded last year called Black Swan Capital LLC.\n\nTheir biggest payday came a week after the Hoosier Lottery bonanza. Montori collected a $5 million top prize from a scratch-off ticket in Missouri on Oct. 6. Other winnings identified by IndyStar include:\n\n$121,000 Davinroy collected from the Missouri Lottery in September.\n\n$1 million Davinroy collected on behalf of Black Swan from the DC Lottery on Dec. 16, 2019.\n\n$100,000 Montori collected from the DC Lottery on March 25, 2019.\n\nThey also had a 1-in-5 shot at another $1 million in a Hoosier Lottery second chance drawing at the Indiana State Fair last year. Gibbons was one of the finalists selected from players who submitted non-winning tickets. He didn't win that one, but did collect a $500 consolation prize.\n\nIt’s a good bet, however, they’ve had other big paydays that haven’t come to light yet.\n\nTheir record raises several questions. Are Montori, Gibbons, Buonaiuto and Davinroy really that lucky? Have they found a way to beat the lottery at its own game? Or are they investing far more money than they are winning in a scheme doomed to fail?\n\n'They would clean us out'\n\nIn Indiana, the group appears to have gone on a frenzied buying spree in the final months of the MEGA CA$H game.\n\n“Basically, they would clean us out,” said Darian Crites, a manager at Smoke ‘n’ Lotto in Bloomington, which sold one of the winning $10,000 tickets Montori claimed in September.\n\nShe said two women who identified themselves as Hannah and Zoe were involved in purchasing as many as 400 tickets at time during several visits that began in May. They said they were working for a man conducting a study and the results would later be shared on YouTube.\n\nAfter emptying the store’s inventory on their initial visit, Crites said one of the women asked to be notified when a new supply of tickets arrived. The woman would then return to buy up the new tickets. The pattern continued until the lottery informed the store that the game was sold out.\n\nUltimately, they purchased about 1,600 tickets at a cost of $48,000, Crites estimated.\n\nAnd that was just at her store.\n\nThe other 60 winning tickets Montori cashed in were purchased from more than four dozen different gas stations, liquor stores and other lottery outlets all over Indiana, the Hoosier Lottery website shows. If they purchased similar amounts at each store, Montori and his group would have spent at least $2.3 million. And that doesn’t account for the time, travel or people needed to scoop up tickets from places as far flung as Mishawaka, Corydon, Indianapolis, Richmond and Terre Haute.\n\nA winning $7 million ticket might have made Montori and his friends rich. But without the top prize, the group’s expenses may very well have exceeded its winnings in Indiana. Without knowing the size of the initial outlay, it’s impossible to know.\n\nIn other states, however, the group appears to have struck pay dirt.\n\nThis summer in Missouri, two women snatched up thousands of $5,000,000 Cash Extravaganza tickets during a series of visits to Break Time, a convenience store and gas station near a busy I-70 interchange in Columbia.\n\nThe spree unfolded as the lottery was preparing to close the game. It had been in operation for several years, but at least one of the three top prize tickets remained unclaimed as the clock ticked down.\n\n\"I know they were buying 20 books a day, three times a week here,\" said a store manager who asked that her name not be used. \"It was several weeks.\"\n\nEach book included 20 scratch-off tickets, which sold for $20 each. That meant the women were dropping $8,000 a visit. The manager said they paid with cash or cashier's checks, and they weren't just buying at Break Time.\n\n\"They were doing the same thing I think at least at two other stores,\" she said. \"And I think there's another store in another town that they were doing it, buying from them, too.\"\n\nThis time, the gamble paid off. Big. They found the unclaimed $5 million winner. And Montori swooped in to collect.\n\n'Needle in a haystack'\n\nThe group’s activity bears the hallmarks of a longstanding strategy for improving the odds to beat scratch-off games. The approach relies on publicly available data on ticket sales and unclaimed prizes to determine if and when it is advantageous to jump in and buy up tickets, several lottery experts and statisticians told IndyStar.\n\nThe Hoosier Lottery, for example, updates its website daily with information about how many prizes have been claimed for each scratch off game.\n\n“I think a good analogy is that needle-in-the-haystack type of thing, where the more information you have, the more hay you're likely to be able to remove, to where your chances of finding the needle are much, much better,\" said Jeffrey C. Miecznikowski, a professor in the Department of Biostatistics at SUNY University in Buffalo, New York. “I think that's most likely what's going on here.”\n\nBut pulling such a plan off on a large scale, he said, takes a gambler’s nerve and a fat bankroll.\n\nThat may be how Black Swan Capital, LLC, fits into the picture.\n\nMontori and Gibbons registered the corporation in Delaware on June 27, 2019. Buonaiuto's LinkedIn page and other online sources list her as portfolio manager and director of operations from April to October. The business address listed in a report filed in January is a nondescript, white frame house next to a cemetery in Princeton. It is the same address Montori used to register to vote.\n\nThe company is classified as an open-end investment fund. If its name is any indication, the Princeton grads appear to believe they’ve found a formula for playing the odds that could shake up the lottery industry. In the world of economics, the term “black swan” refers to an extremely rare and highly consequential event that is easily explainable, but only in hindsight.\n\nBlack Swan Capital first comes up in connection with the lottery winnings in a news release from the DC Lottery in December. It shows Davinroy posing with a giant $1 million check made out to the company. The winning ticket was purchased at the same liquor store as a $100,000 winner Montori cashed in nine months earlier.\n\nBeyond that, little is known about the company.\n\n'Call me back in a year'\n\nMontori and his Ivy League chums aren’t talking about their lottery gambit. All four have avoided interviews and generally kept a low profile regarding their winnings across the country.\n\nMontori appears to have posed for just one of the ubiquitous jackpot winner photographs. In a promotional shot for the DC Lottery, he has a big grin as he holds an even bigger check. He is wearing a black t-shirt and dark-rimmed glasses with a faint beard and hair down near his shoulders.\n\nPublic records and social media sites indicate Montori has lived in Florida and New Jersey and is the son of a prominent Peruvian businessman who lives in Florida. He has no obvious connection to Indiana or other locations where he’s won big lottery prizes.\n\nHe attended the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, one of America’s most elite boarding schools and alma mater of President Franklin Pierce, 19 U.S. senators and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. He was co-president of the Republican Club and on a four-member team that won the Yale University Economics Association's annual High School Economics Competition during his senior year.\n\nAt Princeton, he majored in philosophy. He graduated in 2017 and landed a job as an analyst at the Princeton University Investment Company, which manages the New Jersey school’s endowment.\n\nMontori did not respond to phone and email messages from IndyStar. Attempts to reach him through his family and Gibbons were unsuccessful.\n\nIt was at Princeton where Montori appears to have met his partners in the lottery scheme. Like him, they're young, smart and come from affluent backgrounds.\n\nGibbons, 26, is from Short Hills, New Jersey, and was an Eagle Scout. He was elected president his senior year at Delbarton, a private Benedictine preparatory school for men in Morristown, New Jersey, where he played golf and was an Advanced Placement Scholar. He majored in computer science and history at Princeton, then went to work for ZX Ventures, a New York City investment banking company.\n\nHe declined comment when contacted by phone on Nov. 2. \"I'd rather not speak to a reporter,\" he said. He locked down his LinkedIn page later that day.\n\nDavinroy, 25, was an honor student and captain of the track team her senior year at Centaurus High School in Lafayette, Colorado, a wealthy suburb about 10 miles east of Boulder. She studied physics at Princeton, graduating with Montori and Gibbons in 2017. She then got a job in New York at BloombergNEF, which provides research on clean energy, advanced transport, digital industry, innovative materials and commodities.\n\nShe did not respond to a phone message or attempts to reach her through family and social media.\n\nBuonaiuto, 29, attended Piedmont High School in the San Francisco Bay area and studied history and French at the University of California, Los Angeles. She entered a graduate history program at Princeton in 2013 and earned her Ph.D. in 2018.\n\nShe declined to comment when contacted by phone. “Call me back in a year,” she said. “I'm happy to talk to you in a year. ... It’s exciting.”\n\n'Shooting in the dark'\n\nEven if the group developed a system for using public information to improve their odds, experts expressed skepticism that it could result in reliable profit.\n\nFor example, the odds of winning the $7 million jackpot in the Hoosier Lottery scratch-off game was about one in 2,691,807. Even if the group improved those odds and purchased thousands of tickets, they would still face a significant risk of missing the jackpot.\n\n“That would still be shooting in the dark with better odds, but not with a real strategy for winning,” said Phillip Stark, a statistics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies lottery odds. “Somebody doubled their odds, but they haven't made their odds into a reasonable investment.”\n\nHow much players can improve their odds \"depends a lot in terms of how much information you're bringing into the problem,\" said Miecznikowski, the SUNY biostatistician.\n\n\"To win multiple jackpots, I think it's incredibly rare. But there's a lot of variables that go into that in terms of how many tickets are they buying and so on,\" he said. \"I don't know how they're doing it, but they must have access to information most likely that the average person doesn't ... my guess is that (lotteries) are not putting out enough information that you could use some fancy data science algorithms to figure this out.\"\n\nThe lotteries, however, do not seem concerned about the group’s winning streak.\n\n'Nothing out of the ordinary'\n\nThe four participants have not been accused of any crime. In fact, lottery officials in Indiana, Missouri and the District of Columbia told IndyStar that Montori and Davinroy, like all major prize winners, were vetted before receiving their winnings.\n\n\"We have not conducted an investigation that fell outside our standard clearance processes for big winners.\" Wendy Baker, communications manager for the Missouri Lottery, said in an email to IndyStar last week.\n\nLottery officials said there is nothing wrong with players using data about the number of prizes outstanding during the lifetime of scratch-off games, which is regularly updated online.\n\n\"We do it so that there's transparency to our players, so they understand what tickets that they're playing and what money still left on those tickets. It's an industry standard,\" explained Nicole G. Jordan, director of marketing and communications for the DC Lottery.\n\nJordan said the information also can be a resource for players, if they choose to use it. \"Some people are better gamblers,\" she said. \"So they're looking to see what top prizes are still available.\" It is not uncommon for some players to buy large numbers of tickets, she added, but the amount purchased by the Black Swan group is not something most individual players could do.\n\nAnd just because a prize hasn't been collected doesn't necessarily mean the ticket is still in the field, said Baker, the Missouri Lottery spokeswoman.\n\n\"Until a Scratchers top prize is actually claimed at one of our offices,\" she said, \"we don’t know if a top-prize ticket has been sold or whether it’s sitting in someone’s safe deposit box or has even accidentally been thrown away.\"\n\nJulie Henricks Mahurin, director of public relations for the Hoosier Lottery, said Montori’s 61 claims were received and approved “consistent with our statute and administrative rules.”\n\nShe said it’s not uncommon for a player to submit several winning tickets. There are several potential explanations, such as tickets being purchased over an extended period and/or an individual claiming on behalf of a group.\n\n“There was nothing out of the ordinary on the way this game was designed,” she said. “As is indicated on each ticket and on the Hoosier Lottery website, scratch-off tickets with higher price points (such as the $30 ticket you mention) tend to have better overall odds.”\n\nAt this point, it’s impossible to know exactly how much Montori and his pals have profited from the $6 million they’ve collected so far. They appear to have spent tens of thousands of dollars, if not much more, and may have lost money in Indiana.\n\nThe answer, like the explanation of a Black Swan event, will apparently only be revealed by the benefit of hindsight.\n\nContact Tim Evans at 317-444-6204 or tim.evans@indystar.com.

If so, what does that mean for the rest of American consumers?\n\nStock market volatility, inflation and concerns about rising interest rates could soon slow all parts of the economy — even demand for luxury goods.\n\nGary Friedman, the CEO of high end furniture retailer RH (RH), said in its earnings call last week that “we have experienced softening demand in the first quarter that coincided with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February and the market volatility that followed.”\n\n“I don’t think anybody really understands how high prices are going to go everywhere, in restaurants, in cars and everything,” Friedman said, adding that those increases will hurt all consumers and that companies like his are going to be in a “tricky space.”\n\nShares of RH, which Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) owns a stake in, plunged on the cautious comments and weaker outlook.\n\nOther companies that cater to wealthier consumers are also starting to warn that demand could be hit by all the worrisome headlines.\n\n“The market is experiencing unprecedented volatility from the heightened impacts of a number of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. These include the war in Ukraine as well as inflationary pressures, which impact both our own business and the overall consumer spending,” said Stefan Larsson, the CEO of PVH (PVH), which owns the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands and licenses the Michael Kors and Kenneth Cole New York brands.\n\nLarsson added that the company will “continue to navigate ongoing pandemic headwinds, particularly supply chain and logistics delays, especially in North America, in addition to the recent virus resurgences in Asia.”\n\nBut some Wall Street analysts are still optimistic that luxury companies will continue to do well.\n\n“Luxury brands should outperform, as they will likely continue to have pricing power, which will keep margins elevated, and they could see a boost if international travel returns to pre-pandemic levels,” said Zachary Warring, an analyst with CFRA Research.\n\nWarring specifically cited pricey parka maker Canada Goose (GOOS) and athleisure apparel giant Lululemon (LULU) as two companies that could do well even if inflation worries persist. Lululemon (LULU) shares soared last week after the company reported strong earnings.\n\nWorries about a major slowdown in the US could be overblown as well.\n\n“We don’t buy the gloomy scenarios for luxury just yet,” Erwan Rambourg, global head of consumer and retail research at HSBC, said in a report last week. “We are surprised to hear some talk of dire sales decline scenarios in the US, given continued evidence of a good appetite for luxury brands.”\n\nRambourg said that LVMH (LVMHF), the luxury goods giant that bought Tiffany early last year and also owns Louis Vuitton and Dior, should impress investors when it reports earnings later this month. Rambourg said that sales in most of the world should be solid, with the notable exception of China.\n\n“The only market for which we expect moderation of growth to be a bit visible is mainland China,” Rambourg added, pointing out that Covid-related lockdowns could hurt luxury demand there.\n\nBut Rambourg also didn’t rule out the possibility of a global market and economic slump eventually hitting luxury sales. He said in the report that a recession, a sharper drop in stock prices and a prolonged conflict in Ukraine are the key risks facing high-end consumer companies.", "authors": ["Paul R.

Here's what to do", "text": "CNN —\n\nAre you burned out?\n\nIf these three symptoms apply to you – a total lack of energy, a decline in your sense of belonging and a plummeting self-esteem – you could be a victim of burnout, experts say.\n\nBurnout can impact your ability to pay attention and retain memories, according to experts. Adobe Stock\n\nAfter two years of living in a simmering pool of pandemic stress, you could feel stretched to the max. Stay in that state long enough – or at a level of intensity such as that facing doctors and nurses working with the dying in Covid-19 wards – and it may even change your brain.\n\n“You notice things like being more irritable, more destructive, less motivated, less hopeful,” said Amy Arnsten, a professor of neuroscience at Yale School of Medicine who studies the neural mechanisms of burnout.\n\nUnderstanding how your brain reacts to burnout can be helpful, as it shows people many of their reactions are part of a “natural phenomenon,” Arnsten said.\n\n“I am not a bad person – this is just how the brain changes with chronic stress. It’s doing it to try to protect me, even though in this situation, it’s making it worse,” she said.\n\n“Having that kind of insight and perspective can break the vicious cycle where you’re blaming yourself for not being better.”\n\nYour brain on burnout\n\nChronic stress has long been known to contribute to mental and physical diseases, and now researchers are able to capture what happens to the brain.\n\n“One of the most striking (effects) is thinning of the gray matter of an area of the brain called the prefrontal cortex,” Arnsten said. “It helps us to act appropriately. It gives us insight about ourselves and others. It gives us perspective. It allows us to do complex decision-making and to be able to have thoughtful, abstract reasoning rather than concrete or habitual responses.”\n\nBy weakening that area, experts say burnout can impact our ability to pay attention and retain memories, making it harder to learn new things and increasing the risk for mistakes.\n\nThat’s not all. Burnout can enlarge the amygdala, which is the part of the brain responsible for our “fight-or-flight” response when in danger, researchers have discovered.\n\n“It’s a double whammy. At the same time the prefrontal cortex is getting weaker and more primitive, the brain circuits that generate emotion like fear are getting stronger,” Arnsten said. “You start seeing the world as harmful even when it’s not.”\n\nCan you reverse these changes in the brain once they occur? Studies in mice show it’s possible, and a 2018 study in people found cognitive behavioral therapy for burnout reduced the size of the amygdala and returned the prefrontal cortex to pre-stress levels.\n\nResearch in people also shows we can keep the damage from occurring in the first place – if we feel we are in charge.\n\n“If you feel like you’re in control of the stressor, then there aren’t these toxic brain changes,” Arnsten said. “If you feel out of control it leads to chemical changes in the prefrontal cortex that weakens the connections, and over time actually erode those connections away.”\n\nWhat is burnout?\n\nBurnout presents with three major symptoms that can intertwine in unique ways for each person, experts say.\n\n“One of them gets most of the attention. It’s exhaustion,” said Kira Schabram, an assistant professor of management in the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington.\n\n“You wake up in the morning and you say, ‘How am I going to get out of bed and go to work?’”\n\nMany employers attempt to fix workplace burnout by offering employees time off to rest and rejuvenate. While that’s absolutely necessary for recovery, Schabram said, it may not be enough.\n\n“The problem is there’s two other dimensions,” she said. “Inefficacy, or feeling like you’re not really accomplishing things anymore, and cynicism, or a sense of alienation, either from the work itself or from other people.”\n\nSending employees home to rest without giving them tools to address the other two symptoms may be ineffective, Arnsten said\n\n“The problem is cynicism as a sense of alienation,” she said. “Now I’m sending you home. You’re spending even less time feeling like you’re connecting to your patients or your coworkers. So that’s where it gets tricky.”\n\nYou are resilient\n\nThe good news is that studies show you can recover from burnout, experts say. First, give yourself grace.\n\n“If it’s exhaustion, give yourself permission to engage in self-care, right? Take a nap. Take a day off. Call in sick,” Schabram said.\n\nTry to do healthy activities as part of that self-care, such as “trying to get to sleep and eating healthy foods not high in sugar,” Arnsten said.\n\n“Alcohol is what people often reach for to relieve the stress, but it actually makes you feel worse the next day … and the same thing with benzodiazepines like Valium. But the healthier physiological activities (like) exercising and meditation that give you perspective can be really helpful,” Arnsten said.\n\nWhen it comes to addressing the sense of alienation that comes with burnout, Schabram said the solution may seem counterintuitive.\n\n“What we find is having compassion towards others helps restore that sense of belonging,” she said. “Become someone’s mentor. Start volunteering. What we find is that those acts of doing something kind for someone else really pulls you out of that sense of alienation.”\n\nAnd don’t forget to be compassionate to yourself, Schabram added: “We found both other-compassion and self-compassion help with burnout.”\n\nSelf-care and doing for others can also help with feelings of self-worth, by boosting your sense of accomplishment: “I took a cooking class or I picked up yoga for myself or I mentored someone else,” Schabram said.\n\nAnd studies show those activities don’t need to be massive or time-consuming to reduce feelings of burnout, she added.\n\n“Even really small gestures had an effect the next day,” she said. “Giving someone a compliment, taking them out for a five-minute walk to get a coffee, we see that that pushes the dial on next day burnout.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/health/staff-shortages-childrens-hospitals/index.html", "title": "Staff shortages make patient surges harder for children's hospitals ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAmid a surge of respiratory infections, children’s hospitals across the United States are so busy that some had to set up tents to handle patient overflow.\n\nThe viruses are partly to blame for overwhelmed hospitals and packed emergency rooms, but for some, the problem is staffing: Many hospitals have empty beds, but not the people to care for someone in them.\n\n“We’re extremely overwhelmed,” said Dr. Rishi Lulla, director of pediatric hematology/oncology at Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. “We’re doing the best that we can to try to use the resources that we have, expand where we have capacity to expand and serve the most vulnerable kids.”\n\nNationally, about 80% of pediatric hospital beds are occupied. But it’s much worse in certain areas: In Rhode Island, for example, beds are 99% full.\n\nSeasonal respiratory viruses fill children’s hospitals every year, but the number of beds that are full now is well above the average.\n\nOver the past couple years, only about two-thirds of pediatric beds have typically been in use – and that includes the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDriving much of the current need for beds at children’s hospitals is a spike in cases of RSV, which are 60% higher than at 2021’s peak. The early start to the flu season and an increase in other respiratory viruses are compounding the need for care, on top of all the usual demands like kids with broken bones or asthma attacks.\n\nChildren’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, warned last week that “this surge in illness is exacerbated by the national healthcare workforce shortages.” A child with a life-threatening emergency will not wait, the statement said, but “families who come to us with non-urgent issues will experience long waits to be seen.”\n\n“The wait times in county emergency departments and children’s hospitals are stretching to longer they’ve ever been,” said Dr. Meghan Bernier, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n\nComplicating the issue is that the staff shortage problem isn’t new and won’t be solved quickly. US hospitals have been dealing with it for years.\n\nMissing nurses the most\n\nThe country needs more doctors and technicians, as shortages are growing in both areas, experts say – but the lack of nurses may be the biggest gap that needs to be filled.\n\nA 2022 analysis found that the total count of nurses in the US decreased by more than 100,000 from 2020 to 2021, the largest drop observed over the past four decades. Many who left were under the age of 35, and most worked at hospitals.\n\nIt’s a particular problem for children’s hospitals.\n\n“The pediatric ICU specialty … is highly specialized and a difficult to recruit role in hospitals today,” Katie Boston-Leary, director of nursing programs at the American Nurses Association, told CNN in an email.\n\nWhen new staffers come in, it costs more to train them. Everyone who works with children needs an additional layer of training beyond what they would get in standard nursing school. That narrows the pool of people eligible to work in these hospitals, too.\n\nThere’s also a serious problem with turnover. Nurse turnover is up 50% across the country since 2019, according to Mark Wietecha, CEO of the Children’s Hospital Association.\n\n“Some of our nurses became (traveling nurses); some retired early; some were poached by our adult hospital colleagues,” he said. “We lost people, and costs are way up.”\n\nThis high demand means hospitals have to pay more to retain and hire nurses. And working with children is labor intensive, taking up more of staffers’ time.\n\nTemporary tents to create additional capacity can help in the short term, but the country will probably see some of the same surge capacity problems with RSV next year and the year after that, Wietecha says. He thinks it will take a government effort to fix the problem.\n\n“We know that there’s a train coming down the tracks. The government has been responsive at a level, but why don’t we have a road map for pediatric surge?”\n\nFull children’s hospitals are just one example of a larger problem, Boston-Leary said.\n\n“We have a nurse staffing crisis, and we need a whole-of-government response to address this public health crisis,” she said.\n\nLulla said his hospital in Rhode Island is “aggressively recruiting” to increase staff where it can, but it is competing with other hospitals, home health organizations, nursing homes and doctor’s offices that are also short-staffed.\n\n“We’re doing the best that we can to try to use the resources that we have,” he said.\n\nLonger waits and more mistakes\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated staff shortages across the health care industry, with people forced out by burnout, trauma and exhaustion, according to research from HHS. But even before 2020, stress and burnout were “already significant problems.”\n\nDuring the pandemic, many staffers who weren’t dealing directly with Covid-19 were furloughed or saw their hours cut because so many people weren’t going to medical appointments or having elective surgeries, particularly during lockdowns. Some of that staff never returned.\n\nA lack of staff doesn’t just mean long wait times to get a hospital bed. It can threaten patient safety, said Dr. Marcus Schabacker, president and CEO of ECRI, an independent nonprofit focused on health-care safety and technology.\n\nStaffing shortages top the institute’s list of patient safety concerns for 2022.\n\n“The higher the work volume, the higher the stress level, the more likely we’re going to make a mistake,” Schabacker said.\n\nHospitals have tried to put systems in place to catch potential mistakes, “but these redundant systems are stretched too,” he said.\n\nWith pediatric patients, a small mistake could quickly become catastrophic.\n\n“The margin of error in peds is just smaller, right? So their systems are much more fragile,” Schabacker said. “When we talk about medication, their systems, their body system, organ system, just has much less margin for error.”\n\n‘A self-perpetuating shortage’\n\nMany of the experienced nurses working now probably won’t be in the near future. Nearly 20% of RNs are 65 or older, the largest age group in the profession, according to the National Nursing Workforce Study.\n\nA 2019 survey from the US Registered Nurse Workforce Report Card and Shortage Forecast projected that a shortage of registered nurses would spread across the country through 2030.\n\nNursing colleges are not expanding capacity to meet the increased demand as the US population ages and are unlikely to grow enough to replace retiring nurses. In 2019, more than 80,000 qualified applicants were turned away, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.\n\nOne reason is a lack of instructors. Faculty members are aging out, studies show, and although it requires an advanced degree, teaching often pays less than working as a nurse.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“It’s a self-perpetuating shortage in some ways where, if you don’t have enough nurses to be working the wards, you don’t have capacity for them to be training the next round of nurses,” said Katherine Baicker, an expert on the economic analysis of health policy and dean of the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. “And in a world where you’re not actually expanding the supply, you end up with a sort of beggar-thy-neighbor competition for these scarce professionals.”\n\nBaicker thinks technological advances could help. The rise of telemedicine has answered some demand issues, but “it doesn’t solve the problem: that we fundamentally need more supply of nurses and physicians and the whole health-care work force.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/11/01/burnout-rates-up-women-middle-managers/10655108002/", "title": "Burnout rates are up, especially among women and middle managers", "text": "After a year and a half as a supply chain manager, Jill Shaffer was feeling burned out.\n\nThe 49-year-old had been putting in 50 hours a week at her job in the cannabis industry, working a typical eight-hour day in the office only to spend her evenings at home catching up on emails and texts. She began to question her position when she noticed her physical and mental health deteriorating.\n\n“It was just a lot of exhaustion. Not really caring about much else other than my job. My eating habits were terrible. I gained like 50 pounds in the last year and a half,” she told USA TODAY. “It just got to the point where I was like, OK, enough. I have to do something about this.”\n\nWhat is burnout?:It starts with work and while self-care can help, it isn't just your problem to solve\n\nShaffer is among a growing number of workers coping with an overwhelming amount of stress.\n\nGlobal burnout rates were up 8% between May and August, according to a new report from Slack’s Future Forum consortium. The number of burned-out employees is especially prevalent in the U.S., where more than 2 in 5 workers say they’re burned out.\n\nThe Future Forum report noted that a lack of flexible work and ballooning stress among executives are some of the factors contributing to burnout.\n\n“We're seeing some pretty major shifts, some of which is related to the kind of growing stress that's on executives,” said Brian Elliott, executive leader of Future Forum. \"That's actually causing some of the ripple effects that we're seeing, particularly around burnout.\"\n\nWhat is burnout?\n\nBurnout, a syndrome caused by chronic workplace stress, can lead to feelings of exhaustion, increased mental distance from a job and reduced professional efficacy, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIt's a growing challenge in the workplace, especially among women, younger workers and middle managers, according to Future Forum’s August survey of more than 10,700 workers in six countries.\n\nThe report found women are 32% more likely to experience burnout than men, and employees under the age of 30 are 29% more likely to experience burnout than their older counterparts.\n\nWhile women may feel more burned out because they tend to juggle more responsibilities at home, Elliott said younger workers are likely experiencing more stress due to issues with the broader economy.Research shows they tend to suffer the highest increases in unemployment rates during recessions.\n\nAs for middle managers like Shaffer, burnout risks are exceptionally high at 43%, compared to 37% for senior management, 40% for individual contributors and 32% for executives.\n\nJob fatigue:Am I suffering from burnout at work? Ask HR\n\nWomen in the workplace:Report finds more women leaders are leaving their jobs. Here's why.\n\n“One way to think about it almost is that middle managers themselves are the rope in the game of tug-of-war between what executives want and what teams want,” Elliott said.\n\n'I couldn’t function'\n\nAs stress levels in the office rise, so does turnover. Future Forum found people who are burned out are three times more likely to look for a new job in the coming year.\n\nThese employees are more likely to go after positions with flexible work. The report found that 94% of desk workers want schedule flexibility and 80% want location flexibility.\n\nThat holds true for Emily Muhoberac, 30, a former startup chief operating officer who said burnout pushed her to move on from a company she helped grow from the ground up.\n\nMuhoberac said after weathering the first few tough months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company went straight into an acquisition. The pressures at work began to mount, and Muhoberac said she felt as though she didn’t get a chance to catch her breath between the two major events as she put in 60-plus-hour weeks.\n\nShe said the burnout kicked off a downward spiral that eventually revived her binge eating disorder.\n\nStressed at work?:Here are ways to deal with burnout\n\nBurnout:Doctors, nurses risked their lives to battle COVID. Now they're facing a mental health crisis\n\n“The pressure started to build to where emotionally, I couldn’t function,” she said. “I was going home and eating as much ice cream as I could get my hands on and then repeating the same cycle for the last year until it got to the point where I realized that I became suicidal. I just didn’t want to do any of it anymore and it didn’t feel worth it.\"\n\nMuhoberac has already interviewed for a couple of jobs but says she’s in no rush to move into her next role. She’d rather take the time to recuperate and find the right fit.\n\nFor her, that’s a job with a four-day workweek that is fully remote.\n\n“Only just now, as I’m moving out of my role, as I’m really figuring out what’s next, do I really feel like I’m a human being,\" she said. \"(I need a job that) prioritizes my well-being over the well-being of the business.\"\n\nYou can follow USA TODAY reporter Bailey Schulz on Twitter @bailey_schulz and subscribe to our free Daily Money newsletter here for personal finance tips and business news every Monday through Friday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/economy/great-resignation-uk-australia-europe/index.html", "title": "The Great Resignation is taking root around the world | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nIn the past 12 months, a record number of Americans have quit their jobs, and workers around the world have been paying attention.\n\n“The Great Resignation is people saying, ‘Whatever the situation is, I want better,’” Patrecia Ming Buckley told CNN Business. The 35-year-old, who is based in Sydney, made the decision to leave her job at the consultancy EY last August.\n\nTwo years since Covid-19 disrupted lives around the planet, the United States doesn’t have a monopoly on the factors driving “The Great Resignation.” Dissatisfaction with working conditions, uninspiring jobs and bad bosses has gone global, as has a desire to seek out a better deal from companies short on staff.\n\nThe data for other markets often lags. But the latest figures now show that resignations have jumped in the United Kingdom, Australia and France, too. And while experts say a wave of quitting hasn’t materialized in countries like Germany and Singapore, surveys indicate workers there are also eying the exits.\n\nA December survey by jobs site Indeed of roughly 1,000 workers in Singapore found that almost half of respondents were unsure if they’d stay in their current positions over the next six months. Nearly a quarter intended to leave their employer in the first half of this year. LinkedIn data for January showed a notable increase in the number of workers switching industries in Spain, the Netherlands and Italy compared to early 2021.\n\nAnd in a study of workers commissioned by messaging company Slack, which covers Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Japan and France, openness to looking for a new job has ticked up every quarter since June.\n\nPeople walk through the lobby of an office building in London in June 2021. Hollie Adams/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“It’s this recalibration that people have had where they’re rethinking the role of work in their lives,” said Brian Elliott, a senior vice president at Slack who heads up the Future Forum initiative. “They’re rethinking — not only in terms of things like compensation — but also, clearly, things like flexibility, purpose, balance.”\n\nWhere’s the wave?\n\nAnthony Klotz, a professor of business administration at Texas A&M University who’s credited with coining the phrase “The Great Resignation,” identified trends in late 2020 that he thought could catalyze a transformation of the US labor market.\n\nThere was a backlog of people who wanted to leave their jobs, since people largely stayed put during the initial phase of the pandemic. Reports of burnout were widespread. People were asking big questions about the purpose of life while sitting on large piles of savings. And there was the potential for friction as those who had been working remotely and now prioritized flexibility were called back into the office.\n\nThe theory was spot on: In 2021, 47.8 million workers in the United States left their jobs voluntarily, the highest number since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started tracking full-year data in 2001. The number of quitters remained elevated in January and February of this year.\n\nIn some cases, people left the labor market to care for children or elderly relatives. Shortages of workers in industries like retail and hospitality boosted demand for labor, encouraging people to leverage a competitive market for a role with better benefits or pay. People in desk jobs, who were tired of long pandemic hours and Zoom meetings, started to decide they’d had enough.\n\n“I was wearing way too many hats for one person,” said Bobbi Conclin, who quit her job in purchasing and sales at Cintas last month. The 25-year-old, who is based in New Jersey, said she was burned out from working 10- to 12-hour days, and started a new role at an e-commerce company days later.\n\nThe factors Klotz identified aren’t exclusive to the United States. But debate has been heated over whether the Great Resignation has arrived in other job markets.\n\nMorning commuters in the business district of Singapore in February 2022. Lauryn Ishak/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“We are seeing a ‘Great Reshuffle’ rather than a ‘Great Resignation,’” Josh Frydenberg, Australia’s treasurer, said in a speech last month.\n\nIn a Facebook post earlier this year, Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower said that despite “speculation that Singapore could see a similar ‘Great Resignation’ wave,” its “statistics show otherwise.” The country’s resignation rate was 1.7% at the end of last year, slightly below pre-Covid levels. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has emphasized that EU countries are not “experiencing anything like The Great Resignation.”\n\nIn Europe, many governments made extensive use of short-time work programs, which encouraged struggling companies to retain tens of millions of employees but reduce their working hours. The state then subsidized a portion of their pay. This differed from the approach in the United States, where workers received benefits after they were fired or were mailed stimulus checks that padded their savings regardless of employment status — and may have helped reduce turnover.\n\n“Across Europe, for the most part, people stayed with the employers they had,” said Guillaume Menuet, the head of investment strategy and economics for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Citi Private Bank.\n\nBut there have been signs of churn. In France, the number of resignations during the third quarter of 2021, the most recent data available, was the highest on records dating back to 2007.\n\nAustralia’s government said last month that 1 million workers began new roles in the three months to November 2021. The rate of job switching is almost 10% above the pre-pandemic average.\n\nAnd in the United Kingdom, the rate of employed people aged 16 to 64 moving from job-to-job was at an all-time high of 3.2% between October and December.\n\nYet Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, thinks claims that the Great Resignation has crossed the Atlantic are overdone, noting this rate is only slightly higher than it was in the early 2000s.\n\nDiscontent is growing\n\nIt’s clear Americans aren’t the only ones thinking differently about work.\n\nJoan Pons Laplana, a 47-year-old in Sheffield, England, quit his job as a senior nurse in the National Health Service nearly a year ago. He’s now working as a teacher, training people from disadvantaged backgrounds so they can find jobs in the NHS.\n\nLaplana said he felt guilty leaving a profession he loved at a time when hospitals were facing a huge shortage of resources. But when he was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder after working in intensive care during the first two Covid waves, he knew it was a decision he had to make to preserve his mental health.\n\nJoan Pons Laplana, who lives in Sheffield, England, quit his job as a senior nurse in the National Health Service in April 2021. Joan Pons Laplana\n\n“The idea of your mortality — that you could be next — was very present,” he said. On top of that, he was often the only person to care for dying patients and communicate with their grieving families. “Day by day, it had a toll.”\n\nThibault Prat, a 28-year-old in Paris, France, has given notice and is leaving his job buying and selling electricity in May after almost five years. He said he’s been working long hours, especially as the price of electricity has soared.\n\nHe also became frustrated that he wasn’t producing anything in his job, and didn’t want to plug numbers into Excel spreadsheets as society struggled with issues like the pandemic and the climate crisis.\n\n“There was a growing gap between my beliefs and my job that I couldn’t live with any more,” he said.\n\nPrat said he plans to take a few months off before looking for a job in another part of the industry such as the nuclear sector.\n\nSurveys of workers indicate that Prat won’t be alone in evaluating his options. The Future Forum report published in January found that 53% of workers in France and 55% in Germany and Japan are open to looking for new jobs in the next year. That number rises to 64% in Australia and 60% in the United Kingdom.\n\nChange on the horizon?\n\nThis willingness to seek out new opportunities comes as job openings remain elevated, and employers in a number of industries are willing to pay more to recruit workers. In the United Kingdom, where a reformation of the labor market related to Brexit is also unfolding, there are now 4.4 vacancies for every 100 jobs — an all-time high.\n\n“With such a big talent shortage in the UK right now, people are fairly confident and prepared to move jobs,” said Mark Cahill, UK and Ireland managing director of the staffing firm ManpowerGroup.\n\nSingapore’s Ministry of Manpower also indicated that it’s bracing for more resignations in the coming months.\n\n“In sectors with lower-paying jobs, people could move out due to better opportunities. In growth sectors where there is strong demand for labor, recruitment and resignation rates will be expectedly higher,” the agency said in January.\n\nIn Australia, the government said workers who moved jobs typically got pay bumps of between 8% and 10%.\n\nMariano Mamertino, senior economist for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at LinkedIn, said the labor market in Europe is also expected to get stronger this year, which could give more people the opportunity to change roles. About 58% of Europeans say they’re considering changing jobs this year, according to a LinkedIn survey of approximately 9,000 workers — though it was completed before Russia invaded Ukraine, which economists have warned could push the region into a recession.\n\nCommuters wait on the platform at Auber RER train station in the financial district in Paris in January 2022.

A survey of more than 9,500 nurses by the UK’s Royal College of Nursing published late last year found that 57% of respondents were thinking about leaving their jobs or actively planning to leave. The top reasons given were feeling undervalued and feeling exhausted.\n\nMing Buckley, the Sydney-based worker who left EY — one of the “Big 4” accounting firms — said mental health also played a big role in her decision to depart.\n\n“I just started to feel like I was part of a big machine,” she said. “I never saw myself as someone who would be part of the race to climb the corporate ladder.”\n\nShe took a few months off and recently started interviewing. This time, she’s looking for a part-time role at a nonprofit — something that aligns more closely with her values, and will allow her to launch a coaching and mentoring business on the side. It’s an epiphany — helped along by the pandemic.\n\n“I don’t think people woke up one day and were super unhappy with their jobs,” Ming Buckley said. “I think it’s been building for years and years and years.”", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/05/us/teacher-prep-student-shortages-covid-crisis/index.html", "title": "Teachers are leaving and few people are choosing the field.

One of the last three students in the program, she will graduate in spring.\n\nOklahoma City University officials announced they were suspending the programs in 2020 after a worrying pattern of declining enrollment – one that’s part of a national trend.\n\nUS teacher prep programs have reported shrinking enrollment numbers over at least the past decade. Experts are sounding the alarm: The educator profession – a critical cornerstone of American life – is in crisis.\n\n“As more and more teachers retire, we need to have others fill that role and right now, the numbers are not looking good for us,” said Heather Sparks, director of Teacher Education at Oklahoma City University. “It’s heartbreaking to watch.”\n\nLauren Reynolds, 29, said she was heartbroken after the announcement of her program's suspension. Courtesy Lauren Reynolds\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated the existing problems. Fears of catching Covid-19 and enforcing pandemic protocols are additions to the long list of challenges teachers face daily – from low pay and often little regard from their communities, to growing numbers of school shootings and legislative requirements about what and how to teach. Many educators have walked away in recent years and amid a dire shortage, few people want to fill their spots.\n\n“I was driven almost because of that,” Reynolds, 29, said. “I want to do right by our kids.”\n\nWhile some say it’s too early to know the specific impacts of the pandemic, Lynn Gangone, president and CEO of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) told CNN the numbers already show Covid-19 further dissuaded Americans from going into teaching. In fall 2020 and 2021, about 20% of institutions surveyed by AACTE reported the pandemic resulted in a decline of new undergraduate enrollment of at least 11%. Roughly 13% of institutions reported “significant” declines in the number of new graduate students. Regional state colleges and smaller private institutions – often found in rural communities – have seen the steepest declines.\n\n“I don’t know how bad it’s going to have to get before we realize as a country that if we don’t invest in education … we will not have anyone in the classrooms to teach our children,” Gangone said.\n\nA substitute teacher at a Las Vegas middle school works with three classes of students at the school library in December 2021. Bizuayehu Tesfaye/AP\n\nWhat’s driving aspiring educators away\n\nPriscilla, a northern California student teacher who did not want to use her full name for fear of the impact it may have on her career, has wanted to be a teacher since she was a teenager – but as she prepares for the test to get her credentials this spring, she worries about how long she’ll be able to cope with today’s demands of being in a classroom.\n\n“There’s just so much more that’s being asked of teachers now,” she said. “It’s just like, ‘am I going to burn out in my first year?’ I hope not.”\n\nCovid-19 compounded existing struggles and added new hurdles for aspiring educators. Some missed in-person classroom experiences that serve as a valuable tool to prepare them for their student-teaching placements and the workforce. Others are diving into their first classroom experience by trying to figure out how to keep their students engaged after many became accustomed to tuning out after hours on electronic screens. Priscilla said much of her first year as a student teacher has involved reviewing past material to get her class up to speed. All while worrying about contracting Covid-19.\n\n“At this point, it’s more of when am I going to catch it,” Priscilla said. “I’m currently substituting for my (supervising) teacher because she and her family caught Covid.”\n\nBut even before the pandemic, the teaching profession struggled to attract new people: It promised high stress and low pay, and despite the scores of stories highlighting the often life-changing impacts teachers can have on their students, educators in the US have long felt unappreciated and disregarded.\n\n“I think the perception of teaching is that there is little respect and little pay for the amount of work that has to be done,” Priscilla said, adding that while her family values education, they attempted to dissuade her from pursuing teaching. “It’s not as prestigious as something else, like maybe a doctor, or a nurse.”\n\nOklahoma teachers rally at the state capitol on April 2, 2018 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. J Pat Carter/Getty Images\n\nResearch from the National Education Association found the average classroom teacher salary during the 2020-2021 school year was just over $65,000. Some of the lowest paying states – offering an average salary of less than $50,000 – include Florida, Mississippi and South Dakota, according to the research. California, Massachusetts and New York, the highest paying states, offered an average of more than $85,000.\n\nThe little compensation remains among the biggest challenges in recruiting future teachers, especially when combined with the costs of acquiring the necessary credentials added on to student loans.\n\nSabreena Shaller, a 22-year-old graduate from Millersville University and student state president for the Pennsylvania State Education Association, said her early education and special education degree came with hefty price tags, from the costs of standardized tests to transportation during her field experience – which included frequent Uber rides to the classrooms she was placed in during her freshman year before she decided to pay for a spot for her car on campus. Other classmates, Shaller said, struggled to find transportation means.\n\n“We don’t just need those economically privileged students as our teachers, we need the teachers who also had a struggle growing up financially, because those are the teachers that our students also need,” Shaller said. “But we gatekeep our education programs for those people who can afford to be a teacher.”\n\nWeary of the high demands, Sabreena Shaller, 22, is hesitant about looking for a job inside a classroom for now. Courtesy Sabreena Shaller\n\nAnd it’s not just socioeconomic diversity the field is in desperate need of, experts say. In 2017-18, nearly 80% of public school teachers were White, 9% were Hispanic, 7% were Black and 2% Asian, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\n“Many students of color don’t see themselves in the current teachers,” said AACTE’s Gangone.\n\nAnd a recent legislative push in states across the US to mandate what can – and can’t – be taught in classrooms is not helping, Gangone said. A new study found more than 17.7 million public school students in the US have had their learning restricted when it comes to teaching concepts related to race, racism and gender.\n\n“The financial cost, but also the emotional cost of having to constantly battle and fight for our youth, for our children can be exhausting,” said Sharif El-Mekki, CEO of the Center for Black Educator Development.\n\nThe problem is nothing new, El-Mekki said, and even prior to debates flaring up around Critical Race Theory (CRT), educators of color long felt policed about what they could teach, which was a deterrent for aspiring teachers.\n\nIt’s important that “educator prep programs understand the whole package of what it costs and make sure that they’re providing support, but then also that districts provide ecosystems that are safe, supportive and sustainable,” El-Mekki added.\n\nCritical race theory debate heats up in schools across US 04:07 - Source: CNN\n\nExperts say it’s time for a big change\n\nSome college leaders say if there’s a silver lining, it may be that the pandemic has made apparent that it’s time for a drastic shift in how America’s teachers work – and how to draw more in.\n\nArizona State University’s Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College has seen enrollment in teacher prep programs increase every fall since 2017, according to data provided by the college. University officials partly attribute the rise to a state-funded scholarship that allows young educators to finish their program debt-free if they commit to teaching in schools across the state for a certain amount of time. (Other universities, like the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s program, have similar offers of financial support if students pledge to teach in the state for three to four years.)\n\nMany feel the enrollment bump has also largely been because of a new approach the university is taking to reshaping the teacher workforce – an approach whose vision is a team of experts working to educate students rather than one teacher per classroom.\n\nIn that team, as the university envisions it, teachers who work with students specialize in different areas and approaches – for example, one may be a certified special educator while another specializes in mathematics – and meet regularly to plan lessons and discuss changes. Where that team lacks expertise, additional full-time, part-time or volunteer educators can step in to cover certain subjects. It’s a long way away from where the US is today, but industry leaders say it’s what education should look like.\n\n“You take a novice teacher and put (them) into the classroom,” Gangone said. “How do you expect that individual, brand new out of a program, to be able to teach students who come from all different socioeconomic backgrounds, all different kinds of language backgrounds, all different kinds of family structures and today, with even more mental health issues as a result of the pandemic?”\n\nNew Mexico Public Education Secretary Kurt Steinhaus announced an initiative in January to shore up public school substitute teaching on a voluntary basis with National Guard troops and state bureaucrats in Santa Fe. Morgan Lee/AP\n\n“We can’t keep putting people in that situation,” Carole Basile, dean of Arizona State’s teacher college, said. “They’re going to leave.” New approaches to education programs can help draw more educators in, retain them, but also facilitate progress for instructional staff already in the workforce, Basile said.\n\nTo combat a dangerous teacher and substitute shortage, some states recently opted for solutions like reducing requirements needed to lead a classroom, which industry leaders say is a band-aid solution and not a long-term answer to recruit qualified people to schools.\n\nThe problem, education leaders say, is not that a lack of people who could become teachers, but rather not enough people choosing it as a profession.\n\nKey in recruiting and retaining more people will be legislative support, many said.

Hospitalizations hit 15,840 on Friday and are climbing, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nWilla Fuller, executive director of the Orlando-based Florida Nurses Association, said the pandemic has exacerbated the ongoing nursing shortage. But now more hospital nurses may be nearing wits' end and quit because of the delta variant.\n\n“They get all the praise about being brave health care heroes, but they are not bulletproof,” Fuller said. “Now that this (delta variant) has hit, they are already fatigued. So now you are looking at people fatigued on top of fatigue.”\n\nFlorida still climbing:Think Florida's latest COVID surge has been bad? This UF model says it hasn't peaked yet\n\nBoosters:Do I need a COVID vaccine booster shot for my Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccine?\n\nKids and shots:Some parents are slipping young kids in for the COVID-19 vaccine, but doctors discourage the move as 'risky'\n\nHospitals don’t really want their communities to know how dire the situation is with their staffing needs, Fuller said.\n\n“They want people to feel safe,” she said. “Aside from painting a rosy picture, there is the liability issue to say if there is a staffing shortage.”\n\nDr. Sam Atallah, a colorectal surgeon in the Orlando area, said hospitals in his region can no longer handle patients with medical needs other than COVID-19. He declined to identify the hospitals.\n\n“This is the point of crisis we are at right now in the Orlando area,” he said. “Hospitals had to reallocate our nursing staff and other resources to accommodate the COVID patients.”\n\nHospitals nationwide and in Florida are contending with a workforce shortage that started well before the pandemic and accelerated in the last 18 months because of it, said Savannah Kelly, spokeswoman for the state hospital association.\n\n“As hospitals are experiencing increased hospitalizations due to the delta variant, staffing is an acute challenge,” she said in email.\n\nHospitals have turned to contract agencies to bring in traveling nurses, and in some cases larger systems can reassign staff on a temporary basis, Kelly said.\n\n“The (FHA) has been working with state officials to make it easier for out-of-state health professionals to enter the state to practice,” she said. “Out-of-state staff still need to apply for a Florida license in order to practice.”\n\nAtallah, the Orlando-area surgeon, isn’t confident that will be enough.\n\n“This has to be on the radar at the government level,” he said, but he declined to say if he thinks the state or federal government should step in to help.\n\nSetting up field hospitals requires resources and staffing that hospitals can’t spare, he said.\n\nAll of this comes as workforce stress is boosting burnout.\n\n“We cannot keep going at this full throttle much longer,” Atallah said.\n\nFlorida hospitals at 145% capacity\n\nHospitals are required because of COVID-19 to report staffing and capacity details to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on a daily basis.\n\nThe state hospital association uses the HHS data to release frequent updates that show how hospitals are functioning.\n\nIs it a cold, allergies or delta variant symptoms? How to know, and when to get tested for COVID\n\nFlorida COVID data:Gov. Ron DeSantis says state will look at releasing more county-level COVID-19 data\n\nFlorida hospitals on Tuesday were at running at 145% capacity compared to the previous COVID-19 peak on July 23, 2020.\n\nThe data shows 85% of beds were in use by all patients and 90% of intensive care unit beds were occupied, according to the state hospital association. Nearly 33% of all patients in hospitals have the virus.\n\nWhen the hospital association surveyed members about a critical shortfall of staff, defining what that means was left to each system, said Kelly, the spokeswoman.\n\n“A critical shortage would most likely be defined as a situation where supply of staff cannot meet up with increasing demand,” she said.\n\nHow hospitals are coping\n\nDozens of Florida hospitals have stopped elective surgeries to conserve beds and other resources that include personnel.\n\nHospitals are making those decisions on their own, in contrast with spring 2020 when Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered a stop to manage supply of personal protective equipment.\n\nOther ways of addressing staff shortages include paying top-dollar for traveling nurses through contract agencies, paying overtime to existing staff and reassigning nurses to keep patient care ratios in line with care models.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, hospitals worked together to share the supply of traveling nurses, but that may not be the case now, said Fuller of the nurses’ association.\n\n“Now a lot of our nurses are going to other states and nurses in other states are coming here,” Fuller said.\n\nFor nurses willing to take on stints as traveling nurses, pay boosts are far above their usual hospital salaries. Fuller has heard nurses say they have paid off their student loans that way.\n\nShe said one drawback of using traveling nurses is getting them up to speed.\n\n“Agency nurses are experienced, but it’s a new environment so you come in and re-orient,” she said. “It might slow down the care a little bit.”\n\nDr. David Lindner, medical director of the COVID-19 response team at the NCH Healthcare System in Collier County, disagrees.\n\nHospital staff is accustomed to working with traveling and seasonal nurses. He said NCH has a vigorous onboarding process.\n\n“Drop me or any ICU nurse into most any unit in the world — language issues aside — and we’d be fully functional in days,” he said in an email. “This is such a common occurrence that it is not unusual to have staff from elsewhere.”\n\nIn Southwest Florida, hiring and working more shifts\n\nThe publicly operated Lee Health, the largest system in Lee, and those in Collier, acknowledge their staffing hardships as COVID-19 cases keep climbing.\n\nLee Health, with 14,000 employees, has hired 160 bedside nurses in June and July but still has vacancies, especially for critical care nurses, spokesman Jonathon Little said.\n\nThe system has more than 1,400 job openings and is actively recruiting candidates to fill essential positions, ranging from medical assistants to surgical technicians and pharmacy staff.\n\n“With the current COVID-19 surge, we are experiencing a greater need for staff than we were a month ago and therefore are exploring all options to fill our needs,” Little said in an email.\n\n“We’ve implemented market-based pay increases for retention, incentive pay for picking up additional shifts and are employing more student nurses and (emergency medical technicians) for additional support,\" Little said. “We are also looking at resources across the health system to redeploy staff based on daily census, critical needs and patient care.”\n\nLee Health keeps breaking records:COVID-19 hospitalizations reach 480 at Lee Health hospitals, a new all-time high; NCH cases drop\n\nElective procedures:Lee Health cancels some elective procedures as COVID-19 continues to climb at Southwest Florida hospitals\n\nLee Health has asked employees who left bedside jobs for administrative roles to temporarily return to the bedside or help with vaccinations, testing or anywhere else their clinic background can help relieve some of the pressure, he said.\n\nThe patient-to-nurse ratio is one nurse to two patients and up to five patients. The ratio goal is the same for COVID-19 patients, Little said.\n\nAt the NCH system, staffing is tight and is a national issue, Lindner said.\n\n“This means staff are working more shifts and taking heavier loads,” he said. “Typically, this is the time of year when staffing is lowest, and those of us who call Southwest Florida home attempt to take some time off.”\n\nNCH follows national benchmarks for nurse-to-patient ratios, but that gets modified during surges, according to Ilia Echevarria, administrative director of the COVID-19 team. In critical care, the standard is one registered nurse to two patients or one patient, depending on the patient's need.\n\nIn the COVID-19 units, the ratio is one registered nurse for four patients, but it can be adjusted lower or higher depending on the acuity of the patient, Echevarria said.\n\nNCH has brought in traveling nurses — more are arriving next week — and the system has offered financial incentives to existing staff to help with the need, she said.\n\nLindner said he fears burnout among physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and support staff.\n\n“We are all emotionally tired, as well as becoming physically tired and at this time we are in a sprint (until) delta burns out,” he said. “Without vaccination, this variant will continue to kill and maim more young people.”\n\nAt Physicians Regional Healthcare System, also in Collier County, staffing is challenging as COVID-19 admissions keep increasing, spokeswoman Brittney Thoman said.\n\n“Our team has adapted regularly based on what we have learned during the pandemic and we are actively hiring for new nurses on our team and have invited many of our travel nurses back to help us during this surge,” she said in an email.\n\nShe declined to share details of the number of job openings or what the current ratio is between nurses and patients during the surge.\n\n“Our staff continues to rise to meet the community's needs and we are tremendously proud of them,” she said.\n\nAt Sarasota Memorial Health Care System, the staff are strained and the system is operating far beyond normal capacity, spokesman Kim Savage said. There are about 40 traveling nurses now helping and the system expects more of its seasonal nurses to return earlier than normal this year.\n\n\"The rate for agency nurses is rising exponentially and we can no longer count on them accepting our offers,\" she said in an email.\n\nAll nurses are providing patient care or directly supporting the nurses that do, and that includes managers and clinical educators, she said. The hospital has more than 100 clinical and non-clinical staff members who have volunteered to work extra shifts in an emergency labor pool to help bedside nurses, she said.\n\nOptimal nursing ratios is one nurse to two patients in critical care and higher in other units, but that's not always possible and other staff in the emergency labor pool are called upon.\n\n\"We are facing very serious staffing issues that can become critical very quickly if we continue to have daily surges of new COVID patients,\" Savage said. \"These continuing surges have taken a physical and emotional toll on our entire team. While we may feel disappointment that this fourth surge could have been avoided by vaccination, we are extremely proud of the care and compassion our team provides.\"\n\n1,000 job openings in one south Florida health system\n\nIn heavily populated South Florida, hospital systems may be facing the brunt of strained resources and staffing.\n\nJackson Health System in Miami with 13,5000 employees has close to 1,000 job openings that include slots for 200 nurses, according to Julie Staub, executive vice president and chief human resources officer.\n\n“Our greatest challenge is with continuing to increase our bed capacity and having staff to take care of the increasing need,” she said in an email. “For our current census, we are using agency nurses, incentivizing our own nurses to work additional shifts, increasing our per-diem staff and starting to redeploy nurses from our clinics and other areas. This is in addition to hiring 100-plus nurses per month.”\n\nThe ideal ratio is one critical care nurse for one to five patients depending on the severity of the patients, she said.\n\nJackson Health is trying to maintain the ratios in the COVID-19 units, but it has jumped to one nurse to six patients, she said.\n\nIn Palm Beach County, medical center officials say surging COVID-19 cases and a nursing shortage are creating a perfect storm that is threatening the ability of hospitals to care for patients.\n\n“The health system is at the breaking point here,” said one local hospital administrator, who asked that his name not be used because he isn’t authorized to speak for the hospital. “It's really significantly bad. It’s a crisis.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Lois Frankel said that hospital officials privately tell her they are worried. “They are afraid the healthcare system is going to be compromised,” she said. “The staffing shortages are getting bad.”\n\nDiverting ambulance crews in Brevard\n\nIn Brevard County, Parrish Medical Center in Titusville is using an emergency overflow tent and a secondary overflow ICU unit, plus it converted nearly 50 patient rooms to function as “negative pressure rooms” geared for COVID-19 patients.\n\nLast week, for a period of 10 hours, the hospital had to go on “full divert,” meaning that ambulance crews were directed to other hospitals rather than coming to their emergency room except in cardiac-related emergencies.\n\nNon-emergency surgeries continue to be postponed to allow staffing resources to be deployed to areas of greatest need. As of Wednesday, the hospital had 70 COVID-19 patients, including 11 in the ICU.\n\n“We agree with FHA, there is no set threshold but a critical shortage would be where availability of staff cannot meet the increasing demand and acuity of patients. By that definition and in the absence of measures taken to stem the COVID surge, critical shortages are inevitable,” Parrish Healthcare spokesperson Natalie Sellers said.\n\nAt Health First, which runs four hospitals in Brevard County, “we are implementing every solution available to support our associates and providers. Support efforts include flexible staffing, different levels of compensation incentives, enhanced recruitment efforts and even the use of available traveling nurses,” said Jessica Maynor, Health First System Director, Wellness and Workforce Optimization.\n\nShe said because they are part of a delivery network, they are able to redeploy resources from units where services are temporarily reduced. She noted that happens “in critical times of need — such as we are currently facing.”\n\nTeaching hospitals have options\n\nAt the University of Florida Shands in Gainesville, being a teaching hospital means having more resources to address staffing needs through residents and student nurses, Chief Executive Officer Edward Jimenez said.\n\nHe also oversees two central Florida hospitals in Leesburg and The Villages. The three locations have a combined workforce of 14,000.\n\nShands has different triggers it can use to control bed capacity and resources that range from canceling elective surgeries when use of an intensive care bed is anticipated to the highest trigger of not accepting transfers from within the state, he said. He did not share which trigger, if any, Shands has used during the current surge.\n\nBurnout among existing staff is already here, he said, coupled with a level of resentment that the delta surge was avoidable if the public had embraced vaccinations.\n\nThe statewide vaccination rate stands at 52%, while 63% of Floridians have at least one dose, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“I talk to doctors and nurses and they say, ‘I can’t believe we are back in this situation,'” he said.\n\nNo big hospital around the state was ever down to zero COVID-19 patients since the pandemic began last year.\n\n“Their world has been go, go, go,” he said. “I am both in awe of my staff and also heartened for them because they don’t get to turn it off.”\n\nJimenez doesn’t see how large hospitals can transfer nurses to sister hospitals to fill needs. Having someone drive two hours one way for a shift isn’t sustainable.\n\nPeople are quitting and giving four weeks’ notice, but there have been no cases where Shands employees have said they will not be back the next day.\n\nDr. Frederick Southwick, an infectious disease specialist at Shands, said in an email that burnout is moderately severe among the staff.\n\n“Everyone is becoming discouraged because as of now there is no light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.\n\nSouthwick is active with the state affiliate of the Committee to Protect Health Care that is outspoken against DeSantis for not taking action to reduce the spread of the delta variant by supporting mask wearing and vaccination.\n\n“Rather than focusing on prevention, the state is asking medical personnel to come to Florida to help,” he said. “I can’t tell you how frustrating this is to everyone working on the front lines. We saw this surge coming over a month ago with the arrival of the more contagious delta variant.”\n\n- Reporters Jane Musgrave and Rick Neale contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/10/04/oklahoma-covid-nursing-homes-limit-admissions-struggle-labor-shortages/5834998001/", "title": "Oklahoma nursing homes limiting admissions with workforce ...", "text": "Already dealing with workforce shortages and the brunt of a pandemic, nursing homes are now facing a grim choice: limit new admissions or shut down entirely.\n\nA new survey, conducted by the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living, found the workforce situation has worsened over the last three months for 86% of nursing homes and 77% of assisted living providers nationwide.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/healthcare/2021/11/04/covid-burnout-leads-thousands-columbus-health-care-workers-quit/8540738002/", "title": "COVID may be leaving thousands of Columbus health care jobs open", "text": "More than a half-million health care workers have left their jobs since the pandemic started nearly two years ago, raising concerns about danger and burnout and leaving thousands of positions open across Greater Columbus.\n\nSince February 2020, the number of health care workers decreased by around 524,000 across the United States, according to the most-recent jobs report released in early October from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFor a health system still in the throes of the deadliest pandemic in a century, that's a staggering hole to fill, said Jeff Klingler, president and chief executive officer of the Central Ohio Hospital Council.\n\nCOVID-19 and mortality:Ohio had more deaths than births in 2020, a grim first in state history amid COVID-19\n\n\"Our frontline workers are just mentally and physically exhausted. This latest spike due to the delta variant just exacerbated that exhaustion,\" Klingler said. \"When you're working with very, very sick patients at very high volumes, that does lead to stress, it does lead to burnout.\"\n\nThousands of jobs available at Greater Columbus health systems\n\nThe Dispatch surveyed job postings for the four major health systems in Columbus and found nearly 4,900 open positions as of Thursday for both clinical and nonclinical staff. OhioHealth had 2,313 open positions posted, Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center and primary care offices had around 1,091 jobs listed, Nationwide Children's Hospital had 925 and Mount Carmel had 562.\n\nIn general, finding workers as COVID-19 continues has proven difficult for many industries. And staffing has long been an issue in health care, but Klingler said the pandemic further exacerbated the problem.\n\nThough harder to quantify on the local level, nursing and long-term care facilities also suffered a big loss of employees since the pandemic began. Around 80%, or 419,200, of health care workers who left the field since February 2020 worked in long-term care facilities, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\"It's a really rough situation for nursing and long-term care facilities,\" said Pete Van Runkle, executive director of the Ohio Health Care Association. \"Long-term care has had it worse than anybody.\"\n\n'Another crisis coming'\n\nThe staffing shortage, fueled by burnout and risk, could be one of the long-term consequences of the pandemic.\n\nSince the virus was first discovered, health care workers have put themselves in harm's way to protect others. That, Klingler said, is likely a factor that may be pushing people away from or out of medicine.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 115,000 frontline workers have died of the virus worldwide. The losses were often needless and show that governments need to do a better job of taking care of health care workers, Annette Kennedy, president of the International Council of Nurses, said in an Oct. 21 World Health Organization briefing on COVID.\n\n\"The world was not prepared for the pandemic...\" Kennedy said. \"There is another crisis coming down the tracks and that is a shortage of health care workers.\"\n\nDr. Laurie Hommema is one of the medical professionals tasked with helping to take care of her colleagues at OhioHealth.\n\nCOVID-19 in Greater Columbus:Columbus ER wait times high as hospitals balance COVID patients with other health emergencies\n\nSpending each day caring for critically ill patients can take a toll on health care workers, Hommema said. COVID-19 patients have been known to require long stays in hospitals, and so when a nurse, doctor or respiratory therapist has a patient die, Hommema said it can serve as a very traumatic experience.\n\nIt's easy for health care workers to become \"robotic\" and unsatisfied with their jobs if they don't take time to \"pick apart their emotions\" when it comes to patients they've healed and lost, Hommema said. That's why, she said, it's important to make sure health care workers have a safe place at work to feel vulnerable and cope with the challenges of the pandemic.\n\nWhile each health system has its own internal support system and professionals who frontline workers can talk to if they need help, OhioHealth also encourages medical units to set aside time for \"reflection rounds.\" These rounds allow workers to share stories of their patients and talk to each other about how they're dealing with things, Hommema said.\n\nCOVID-19 in Greater Columbus: Find complete coverage at Dispatch.com/news/coronavirus\n\nStill, Hommema said the nearly two-year slog of COVID-19 has proven to be a difficult adversary for morale.\n\nWhen COVID-19 vaccines came out in December 2020 and eventually became more widely available in March 2021, there was a sense of hope among health care workers that that the worst of the pandemic was behind them. Then when the delta variant hit in July, that hope turned to \"sheer disappointment,\" Hommema said.\n\n\"People are very tired of the pandemic,\" Hommema said. \"I think what we're seeing now is there's a lot of fatigue, there's a lot of sadness and grief.\"\n\nMoney makes a difference\n\nFinancial incentives have long been used to retain and attract new employees to health care, and they continue to prove helpful in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nEach of the four area health systems offers bonus pay from time to time and for various reasons, spokespeople told The Dispatch.\n\nFor example, Wexner Medical Center offers a bonus of up to $3,000 for current employees who refer candidates who get hired, a spokeswoman said. Ohio State will also give $1,000 bonuses to around 15,000 eligible medical center workers in November.\n\nOhioHealth invested over $54 million in bonus payouts in fiscal year 2021, and $43 million so far in fiscal year 2022, spokesman Marcus Thorpe said. Nationwide Children's sometimes offers signing bonuses and retention bonuses, depending on labor market demands, a spokeswoman said.\n\nMount Carmel offers variations of incentive pay and sign-on bonuses. The health care provider is also experimenting with flexible work schedules to \"bring new talent to Mount Carmel and the field of healthcare,\" spokeswoman Samantha Irons said via email.\n\nIn northeast Ohio, the Cleveland Clinic has offered to pay some nurses a $400-per-day bonus for certain 12-hour shifts through Saturday. That means some nurses could end up getting paid $1,400 for a specific shift, Cleveland.com reported.\n\nVaccine mandates:Little pushback from Columbus hospital workers over COVID vaccine mandate\n\nWhile hospitals are able to offer incentive pay, it's more difficult for long-term care providers to do so, Van Runkle said. To do so, Van Runkle said long-term care facilities simply need more federal funding so the reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid meet the costs for care.\n\n\"You have to take a very holistic look at it and we're trying to see how we can really draw more people in,\" Van Runkle said. \"Probably the most significant thing from an overall perspective is that we really need the ability to pay higher wages and that unfortunately comes down to more government funding.\"\n\nDespite uncertainty and fears that staffing could become a long-term struggle in health care, there is some hope.\n\nIn April, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing announced that students enrolled in programs had increased during the pandemic. Around 251,145 students nationwide are studying in undergraduate programs, marking a 5.6% increase.\n\nIf there's a silver lining to the pandemic, it may be that the virus has brought more awareness to the medical field, Klingler said. Perhaps increased interest shows the most important and lasting incentive is that going into health care \"can still be a very rewarding career,\" he said.\n\nWhile it will take time for students to make their way into the medical workforce, Klingler said it's a start and a good sign.\n\n\"We're not going to flip a switch. It's going to take a while to train and educate a new generation,\" he said. \"But, if you want a job that's going to be there in the future, it's in health care... there's always going to be a need.\"\n\nmfilby@dispatch.com\n\n@MaxFilby", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/10/25/cigna-survey-vitality-mental-health/10546396002/", "title": "Cigna survey measures vitality's effect on mental, physical health", "text": "A first-of-its-kind survey measures a potential antidote to the pandemic malaise enveloping many Americans: Vitality.\n\nThe survey found 18% of U.S. adults had high vitality, meaning they were healthier, more likely to exercise and less likely to be obese.\n\nExperts believe it's important to track vitality's role as the nation emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCynthia Vitone volunteered at a theater near her hometown in Shelton, Connecticut. It was work that gave her purpose and social interaction – until the coronavirus shut down performances.\n\nEven though the pulse of daily life at work and home has returned to normal since the lockdowns of 2020, Vitone still feels a void and is scouting for other volunteer opportunities.\n\n“It made me feel great to be with people, meeting people and having fun,” Vitone said. \"I haven’t made myself find something else like that. Now I am thinking, why haven’t I done that?\"\n\nVitone’s self-assessment comes after she participated in a first-of-its-kind survey measuring a potential antidote to the pandemic malaise enveloping many Americans. New research from CIGNA and Morning Consult attempts to measure vitality and how it influences overall health and productivity.\n\nThe survey of more than 10,000 U.S. adults found 18% had high vitality. Those individuals were healthier, more likely to exercise, less likely to be obese and more likely to have a primary-care doctor.\n\nThe 15% of adults with low vitality had poorer diets, less sleep and more chronic medical conditions. They also are more likely to be socially isolated, obese, depressed or anxious.\n\nFeel the urge to 'quiet quit'?Time to check in with your mental health, experts say\n\nPsychologist Richard Ryan, who has studied vitality and human motivation and helped develop the survey, believes it's an important way to track vitality's role in the population as the nation emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. Communities and employers might learn how to help people thrive.\n\n\"You can have a big impact if you focus on this particular variable because it's so indicative of overall wellness,\" Ryan said. \"Then we can really identify routes to improve vitality.\"\n\nCIGNA, which has supported past research on the loneliness epidemic, has pledged to track vitality over the coming years through the Evernorth Vitality Index.\n\nCIGNA officials said vitality values, promotes and prioritizes good health while also treating sickness and disease. Helping people stay healthy can help employers and communities lower health spending but also guide people to healthier and more productive lives.\n\n“Harnessing the power of our individual vitality is critical to our collective future,\" said Cigna Chairman and CEO David Cordani. \"The past few years clearly illustrated that health is multi-dimensional and we need a more comprehensive measurement tool – one that can assess how we are showing up at work, at home and in our communities.\"\n\nSurgeon general targets workplace mental health\n\nThe survey comes as studies show the U.S. workforce is grappling with burnout, mental health and fatigue.\n\nU.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy in July issued an advisory on crisis levels of burnout among doctors, nurses, community and public health workers. He warned COVID-19's demands put health care workers and their families at risk of harm and pushed many \"past their breaking point.\"\n\nMental health challenges have extended beyond health care workers. Many Americans have struggled with work-life balance with some engaged in \"quiet quitting,\" or giving minimum effort on the job.\n\nLast week, Murthy unveiled a strategy for the broader workforce. His office cited research that revealed 76% of U.S. workers reported at least one symptom of a mental health condition and 84% blamed workplace conditions as contributing to at least one mental health challenge.\n\nMurthy unveiled a five-point plan to encourage companies to focus on their employees and establish workplaces as “engines for mental health and well-being.”\n\n“It will be worth it because the benefits will accrue for workers and organizations alike,” Murthy said.\n\nCIGNA's research, however, suggests that overall wellbeing extends beyond a person's employment. While people who earn more and have higher education levels are more likely to thrive, researchers also identified lower-wage earners with enviable marks on physical and mental health and strong social circles.\n\nLower income adults who achieve high vitality scores did better than their wealthier counterparts on measures of choice and freedom, prioritized health and had stronger social ties. They are also less likely to say their personal life suffers because of work, the survey said.\n\nDr. David Brailer, CIGNA's chief health officer, said the such results give reason for optimism about how social ties influence a person's outlook.\n\n\"What you hear today is there's a lot of churn, people are very distressed about the situation with their jobs,\" Brailer said. \"There's something else going on because people are feeling great about themselves. So much of this is how you feel connected to your social sphere.\"\n\n'More loneliness, less social relations'\n\nThe survey found wide variation among generations. Gen Z adults aged 18 to 24 had lower rates of chronic medical conditions and were less obese than older adults.\n\nBut the survey found about 1 in 4 Gen Z adults had low vitality with respondents revealing a lack of confidence in managing their health. About 32% of Gen Z adults had been diagnosed or got treatment for clinical depression or anxiety compared to 21% of the overall population.\n\nWant to improve your mental health? Helping others can be a good way to help yourself.\n\nRyan said young adults have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and other social shifts.\n\n\"I can see that reflected in a lack of confidence they have toward the future and managing conditions,\" Ryan said. \"I think that really has taken a toll on them. I see more loneliness, less social relations in a period of time where that's really what you want to be doing in life.\"\n\nAlthough seniors tend to have more chronic medical conditions, the survey found adults 65 and older reported the highest overall vitality. These older adults might have less stress about their finances compared to working-age adults. They also have access to Medicare, the government health insurance program for those 65 and older, allowing them to see a doctor to manage chronic medical conditions.\n\nMen had higher vitality scores than women as young adults and in middle age.

The technology raises legal and privacy issues because the U.S. Supreme Court has said officers generally cannot use high-tech sensors to tell them about the inside of a person's house without first obtaining a search warrant.\n\nThe radars work like finely tuned motion detectors, using radio waves to zero in on movements as slight as human breathing from a distance of more than 50 feet. They can detect whether anyone is inside of a house, where they are and whether they are moving.\n\nCurrent and former federal officials say the information is critical for keeping officers safe if they need to storm buildings or rescue hostages. But privacy advocates and judges have nonetheless expressed concern about the circumstances in which law enforcement agencies may be using the radars — and the fact that they have so far done so without public scrutiny.\n\n\"The idea that the government can send signals through the wall of your house to figure out what's inside is problematic,\" said Christopher Soghoian, the American Civil Liberties Union's principal technologist. \"Technologies that allow the police to look inside of a home are among the intrusive tools that police have.\"\n\nAgents' use of the radars was largely unknown until December, when a federal appeals court in Denver said officers had used one before they entered a house to arrest a man wanted for violating his parole. The judges expressed alarm that agents had used the new technology without a search warrant, warning that \"the government's warrantless use of such a powerful tool to search inside homes poses grave Fourth Amendment questions.\"\n\nBy then, however, the technology was hardly new. Federal contract records show the Marshals Service began buying the radars in 2012, and has so far spent at least $180,000 on them.\n\nJustice Department spokesman Patrick Rodenbush said officials are reviewing the court's decision. He said the Marshals Service \"routinely pursues and arrests violent offenders based on pre-established probable cause in arrest warrants\" for serious crimes.\n\nThe device the Marshals Service and others are using, known as the Range-R, looks like a sophisticated stud-finder. Its display shows whether it has detected movement on the other side of a wall and, if so, how far away it is — but it does not show a picture of what's happening inside. The Range-R's maker, L-3 Communications, estimates it has sold about 200 devices to 50 law enforcement agencies at a cost of about $6,000 each.\n\nOther radar devices have far more advanced capabilities, including three-dimensional displays of where people are located inside a building, according to marketing materials from their manufacturers. One is capable of being mounted on a drone. And the Justice Department has funded research to develop systems that can map the interiors of buildings and locate the people within them.\n\nThe radars were first designed for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. They represent the latest example of battlefield technology finding its way home to civilian policing and bringing complex legal questions with it.\n\nThose concerns are especially thorny when it comes to technology that lets the police determine what's happening inside someone's home. The Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that the Constitution generally bars police from scanning the outside of a house with a thermal camera unless they have a warrant, and specifically noted that the rule would apply to radar-based systems that were then being developed.\n\nIn 2013, the court limited police's ability to have a drug dog sniff the outside of homes. The core of the Fourth Amendment, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, is \"the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.\"\n\nStill, the radars appear to have drawn little scrutiny from state or federal courts. The federal appeals court's decision published last month was apparently the first by an appellate court to reference the technology or its implications.\n\nThat case began when a fugitive-hunting task force headed by the U.S. Marshals Service tracked a man named Steven Denson, wanted for violating his parole, to a house in Wichita. Before they forced the door open, Deputy U.S. Marshal Josh Moff testified, he used a Range-R to detect that someone was inside.\n\nMoff's report made no mention of the radar; it said only that officers \"developed reasonable suspicion that Denson was in the residence.\"\n\nAgents arrested Denson for the parole violation and charged him with illegally possessing two firearms they found inside. The agents had a warrant for Denson's arrest but did not have a search warrant. Denson's lawyer sought to have the guns charge thrown out, in part because the search began with the warrantless use of the radar device.\n\nThree judges on the federal 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the search, and Denson's conviction, on other grounds. Still, the judges wrote, they had \"little doubt that the radar device deployed here will soon generate many questions for this court.\"\n\nBut privacy advocates said they see more immediate questions, including how judges could be surprised by technology that has been in agents' hands for at least two years. \"The problem isn't that the police have this. The issue isn't the technology; the issue is always about how you use it and what the safeguards are,\" said Hanni Fakhoury, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nThe Marshals Service has faced criticism for concealing other surveillance tools. Last year, the ACLU obtained an e-mail from a Sarasota, Fla., police sergeant asking officers from another department not to reveal that they had received information from a cellphone-monitoring tool known as a stingray. \"In the past, and at the request of the U.S. Marshals, the investigative means utilized to locate the suspect have not been revealed,\" he wrote, suggesting that officers instead say they had received help from \"a confidential source.\"\n\nWilliam Sorukas, a former supervisor of the Marshals Service's domestic investigations arm, said deputies are not instructed to conceal the agency's high-tech tools, but they also know not to advertise them. \"If you disclose a technology or a method or a source, you're telling the bad guys along with everyone else,\" he said.\n\nFollow investigative reporter Brad Heath on Twitter at @bradheath", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/us/st-louis-school-shooting/index.html", "title": "St. Louis school shooting: Gunman who killed 61-year-old woman ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA teen and an adult were killed in a shooting at Central Visual and Performing Arts High School in St. Louis on Monday morning, police Commissioner Michael Sack said.\n\nOfficers arrived at the school four minutes after the first 911 call and it took them eight minutes to find the gunman. After a two-minute gun battle, the suspect was reported down, Sack told reporters at a news conference.\n\nAuthorities did not immediately identify the victims, but Sack said a 61-year-old woman was pronounced dead at a hospital and a 16-year-old girl was killed at the scene.\n\nThe commissioner identified the gunman as Orlando Harris, a 19-year-old who graduated from the school last year. He died at a hospital, Sack said.\n\nAuthorities are working to “try and come up with what might have led him to this. There’s suspicion, there may be some mental illness that he was experiencing. We are working on developing that information right now,” Sack said.\n\nThe shooter had no prior criminal history.\n\nSeven other teenagers were hurt and went to the hospital, Sack said. Some had gunshot or graze wounds and some had abrasions. One had a fractured ankle. They are all in stable conditions, the commissioner said.\n\nThe commissioner said the gunman had a long gun and around a dozen 30-round ammunition magazines with him.\n\nSack would not say how the gunman entered the school but said the school doors were locked, which delayed the suspect and bought responding officers time.\n\n“The security staff did an outstanding job identifying the suspect’s efforts to enter and immediately notified other staff and ensured that we were contacted,” Sack said.\n\nThere were security guards at the school at the time of the shooting, according to St. Louis Public Schools Communications Director George Sells.\n\n“We had the seven personnel working in the building who did a wonderful job getting the alarm sounded quickly. So that response, that fast response, could happen both from the police and also from our response teams who were among the first on the scene as well. So that was just more well-done work by a lot of people.”\n\nThe St. Louis Police Metropolitan Police Department reported the active shooter on Twitter, and about 45 minutes later, tweeted, “At this time, the scene is secure and there is no active threat.”\n\nThe school district is devastated after Monday’s shooting, it said in a statement. CVPA and two neighboring schools were evacuated to a reunification location, St. Louis Public Schools said.\n\nTeacher: Multiple bursts of gunfire\n\nSpeaking on the phone, math teacher David Williams said the gunshots erupted shortly after 9 a.m. local time (10 a.m. ET) and everyone went into “drill mode,” turning off lights, locking doors and huddling in corners so they couldn’t be seen.\n\nThere was a bang on the door, and it shook, he said. “Someone was trying to open the door,” Williams said.\n\nSirens emerged in the distance, and then Williams heard three shots, he said. Someone with an adult voice could be heard screaming, “You are all going to f**king die,” he recalled.\n\nShortly thereafter, a bullet came through one of the windows in his classroom, Williams said.\n\nThe gunshots picked up pace, he said.\n\nAbout then, officers from tactical teams arrived – a huge group of them, well organized – and there was another round of gunshots before Williams heard a woman announcing herself as police, he said.\n\nWilliams and the students ran to an emergency exit, he said, adding the ordeal lasted about 40 minutes.\n\nPolice engaged the shooter on the third floor, where Williams’ classroom is located, Sack said.\n\nSt. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly M. Gardner said many people reacted as trained to help save others from being hurt.\n\n“The situation is still developing and we will know more in the coming days, but one thing that is clear is that lockdown procedures – which St. Louis Public School’s administrators, teachers and students at Central Visual and Performing Arts High School and first responders followed as this attack unfolded – were essential in preventing further violence,” Gardner said.\n\nFBI, ATF assisting\n\nThe roughly 400-student high school is a magnet school about 6 miles southwest of downtown.\n\nStudents were being evacuated from campus “to safe and secure sites,” the district said. People are being asked to avoid the area, and parents have been informed they can pick up their children at Gateway Stem High School, about a mile and a half north of CVPA.\n\nWord of the shooting comes on the same day Michigan teen Ethan Crumbley pleaded guilty to murder charges in a Michigan school shooting last year that left four people dead and seven injured. On November 1, Nikolas Cruz will be sentenced for the February 2018 shooting at Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people died.\n\nAs the investigation into the St,. Louis shooting was unfolding, a Michigan prosecutor addressed the nation’s gun violence in the wake of Crumbley’s guilty plea.\n\n“It’s not just about sharing with other departments. Gun violence is preventable. That’s what I’ve learned, and the fact that there is another school shooting does not surprise me – which is horrific,” Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said. “It is preventable, and we should never, ever allow that to be something we just should have to live with.”\n\nDuring a news conference at the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre demanded Congress take action and pass an assault weapons ban.\n\n“Our hearts go out to everyone impacted by today’s senseless violence, particularly those injured and killed, their families as well as the first respondents,” she said. “We need additional action to stop the scourge of gun violence.\n\n“Every day that the Senate fails to send an assault weapons ban to the President’s desk, or waits to take another – other common-sense actions is a day too late for our families and communities impacted by gun violence.”\n\nThe FBI’s St. Louis field office is assisting local law enforcement in its response to the shooting, spokesperson Rebecca Wu said.

More than 138 million Americans use the video-sharing app owned by a company called ByteDance.\n\nFCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said ByteDance must comply with Chinese government laws. FBI Director Chris Wray said TikTok could be used for \"influence operations\" and that user data is in the hands of the Chinese government.\n\nThat's not just conjecture. Late last year, TikTok was forced to admit that it used this same data to spy on individual Americans, including journalists. Without question, TikTok is a Trojan Horse.\n\nAt least 27 states and the federal government have banned the use of the app on government devices. My advice: If you or someone in your family insists on using TikTok, install it on a separate device, like an old smartphone. Don’t connect that device to your home network. Use a cellular connection to get online.\n\nSeveral states have also banned a few other Chinese-owned apps and platforms.

You may consider it a smartphone manufacturer, but the company also designs and sells telecommunications equipment.\n\nThe FCC banned sales and imports of Huawei devices in November, citing national security concerns.\n\nXiaomi, OnePlus, and Oppo have faced similar accusations.

Though you can still buy their drones here in America, the U.S. has blocked DJI, prohibiting military use and investments.\n\nIn October, the drone maker made the Department of Defense's list of \"Chinese military companies\" operating in the U.S. DJI denies being a military company.

The computer giant was founded in Beijing, and Forbes reports around 900 U.S. municipalities and states use Lenovo products. Think of the staggering amount of information those systems must contain.\n\nThe military isn't taking chances. In 2008, Marines stationed in Iraq stopped using Lenovo tech after discovering data was being transmitted back to China.

Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. After initially agreeing to buy the company in April, Musk spent months attempting to get out of the deal, first citing concerns about the number of bots on the platform and later allegations raised by a company whistleblower.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, “the bird is freed.”\n\nBy completing the deal, Musk and Twitter have avoided a trial that was originally set to take place earlier this month. But Musk’s takeover, and the immediate firings of some of its top executives, now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it.\n\nIn addition to Agrawal, Musk on Thursday fired CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to the two sources. Musk also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, according to a source.\n\nLeft to right, clockwise: Twitter former executives Vijaya Gadde, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Sean Edgett. Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/11/30/your-guide-milwaukees-police-chief-candidates-and-issues/6405023002/", "title": "Your guide to Milwaukee's police chief candidates and the issues", "text": "One week after deadlocking on who Milwaukee’s next police chief should be, the six-member Fire and Police Commission will have another go at breaking its tie between two candidates on Thursday.\n\nLast week, commissioners were split 3-3 between Maj.

He said his department would utilize data to identify troubled areas throughout the city. Officers would receive additional training in de-escalation techniques and implicit bias.\n\nIn addition to holding various town hall events and consulting with residents, Davis wants to increase public accessibility with officers. He said he believes in issuing smartphones to those on the force, so residents can reach neighborhood officers directly, and making community engagement part of performance evaluations. He has expressed interest in involving community members in police training and policy making. He has also said it’s important for police and residents to jointly identify issues in a community and agree on appropriate solutions.\n\nMahaley has emphasized that his officers would make frequent appearances at a range of public events to engage with residents, from sporting events to town hall gatherings and homeowner association meetings. He has committed to building relationships with the city’s business community and has also floated the idea of consulting with residents on how to handle specific major investigations, similar to a program in the FBI.\n\nGetting rid of systemic racism in policing\n\nCritics of the criminal justice system in the U.S. contend that racism is embedded in policing across the country, leading to discrimination against people of color.\n\nDavis said the process starts with improving the diversity of those hired by the department and educating officers about the history of Milwaukee and the disadvantages and victimization rates the community has experienced. He has referenced several programs in Portland that could be replicated in Milwaukee, such as pairing officers new to the city with a host family to “onboard” them into the community, and hosting young people of color to discuss their experiences with law enforcement.\n\nMahaley said he would make it easier for the public to file online complaints. He has said he would visit schools, houses of worship and other venues to gather feedback on issues in the department. “We’re getting into the community, discussing these types of issues, identifying problems and getting rid of them,\" he said. \"It’s not complicated.”\n\nAziz said he would root out systemic racism by involving his officers in the community, recruiting the right people and educating recruits on the history of Milwaukee and the experiences of people of color.\n\nDealing with budgets cuts and a shrinking sworn staff\n\nIn 2020, Milwaukee lost 60 sworn positions through attrition. In 2021, it will lose between 120 and 150, based on the budget advanced by Mayor Tom Barrett and approved by the Common Council.\n\nMahaley said he could connect Milwaukee with federal grant funding to hire additional officers. He said his biggest concern is response times rising in the face of cuts, and pledged to work hard to fight further reductions to sworn staff.\n\nAziz said it would be important to lean on partner organizations that could alleviate police responsibility in certain areas. He also said some functions could be performed by civilians to reduce costs. He also expressed interest in building a volunteer program and involving retired officers more.\n\nDavis floated the idea that filing police reports for minor incidents — such as petty theft — could be done over the phone or the internet so officers focus their time on more pressing matters. Data can be used to more efficiently deploy officers throughout the city and robust wellness programs are critical in retaining good employees, he said. He also spoke favorably for turning some sworn positions into civilian roles to save costs.\n\nTear gas and other less-lethal munitions\n\nIn many cities across the country this year, peaceful demonstrations against police brutality were accompanied with bouts of civil unrest. Police in Milwaukee, Dallas, Portland and elsewhere used tear gas and other less-lethal munitions, drawing criticism and condemnations from elected officials and members of the public.\n\nAziz declined to offer his thoughts on the Dallas Police Department’s controversial use of tear gas and other less-lethal munitions. This summer, a federal judge temporarily forbade the department from using such weapons. He said such equipment is important to protect the public in the event of civil unrest, but said police need to effectively communicate when they are necessary and when their use is imminent.\n\nDavis has said Portland police did make mistakes at times this summer, when his department’s use of tear gas and other less-lethal munitions drew a temporary ban from a federal judge. He stressed that police tried numerous times to back off from demonstrations to avoid escalating tensions, but criminal activity by smaller groups would repeatedly necessitate police intervention. He has said that law enforcement needs to improve dealing with criminal activity within an otherwise peaceful crowd of protesters “without using indiscriminate tactics.”\n\nMahaley said tear gas and other less-lethal munitions are important tools for law enforcement to bring order to a chaotic situation. But to avoid their use, he said, law enforcement must educate the public on what circumstances necessitate it. He declined to offer an evaluation of the Milwaukee Police Department’s use of less-lethal munitions on crowds this summer. “It’s unfair for me to do that,” he said. \"I wasn't a part of that.\"\n\nSupporting the hypothetical creation of an unarmed response unit for non-emergencies at the expense of the police department\n\nWhen people call for \"defunding the police,\" they are often referring to creating new systems for unarmed individuals, such as social workers or mental health professionals, to respond to certain incidents and non-emergencies.\n\nDavis called such an idea “an emerging best practice” in the public safety profession. The city of Portland already has a similar unit called Portland Street Response, which Davis called “really effective” and is modeled after a similar program in nearby Eugene. “As long as we’re thoughtful about it, I would be completely supportive of something like that,” he said.\n\nMahaley also said he would be “very interested” in pursuing such an idea. He is particularly interested in retired officers filling those roles because of their previous experience working in the field. “I am interested in doing anything that’s going to make us efficient, make us a better department,” he said.\n\nAziz hesitated to lend his support to such an idea, but said if it would allow officers to concentrate on more urgent matters, he would generally be supportive. He did, however contend that the public wants more police officers and that their “para-military” structure is more conducive to serving the public. “We do things really well,” he said.\n\nDemilitarization and de-escalation\n\nCalls for \"defunding the police\" are often accompanied by demands for police to reject the use of military-style equipment, such as armored vehicles, and to emphasize alternatives to using force of any kind.\n\nAll three candidates were in relative agreement on this issue, saying it is important to teach officers de-escalation methods in order to avoid the use of force. When it came to demilitarizing police, each candidate said equipment such as armored vehicles has a place in law enforcement. They each said those vehicles are crucial in protecting officers and the public in chaotic situations.\n\nAnd although each candidate said the use of tear gas and other less-lethal munitions require a high standard for their use, they each said such weapons remain essential in chaotic situations in order to avoid more lethal uses of force.\n\nHomicides and violent crime in Milwaukee\n\nIn November, Milwaukee surpassed its 1991 record of 165 homicides in one calendar year, following a national trend of a rise in violent crime. Nonfatal shootings are also on the rise.\n\nMahaley called the violence in Milwaukee a “tremendous problem” that would require help from many other stakeholders. He said he would engage social workers and professionals in domestic violence prevention to do a “threat analysis,” and build a strategy from there. He also said his department would continue engaging religious leadership and youth on the issue. “At the end of the day, it’s the community working together.”\n\nAziz also characterized the surge in violent crime as an issue that would require help from other entities. This year, Milwaukee has seen an increase in domestic and intimate partner violence, a problem that he said is difficult for police to control because it happens “behind closed doors.” He called on state lawmakers to pass more stringent gun law regulations.\n\nDavis, who said Portland is experiencing a similar rise in violence, said there is a “significant investigative piece” to the solution. He described a successful program in Portland, similar to one in Milwaukee, where officers collect shell casings from every shots-fired call in the city to piece together evidence on repeat offenders. He said domestic and intimate partner violence fall more in the realm of a public health issue and said education and outreach in that regard is essential.\n\nReckless driving in Milwaukee\n\nOver the last decade, Milwaukee has seen a rise in reckless driving and fatal crashes.\n\nAziz said educating the public on the dangers of driving recklessly would be important in turning things around. He said he would consider adding resources to the department’s traffic division and pushing for stiffer penalties for offenders.\n\nDavis said he would try educating the public, along with taking a closer look at adjusting street engineering to make roads safer and discourage reckless driving. He spoke in favor of using automatic photo technology to increase enforcement, as long as it wasn’t misused as a revenue generator. He also said police could offer offenders a chance to take a driver safety class in order to avoid paying fines or help reinstate an invalid license.\n\nMahaley said he would focus on educating the public about the magnitude of the issue and would consider new technology and grant funding that could help. He also said he wants to find a way to hold responsible the car owners that lend their vehicles to people who drive recklessly. “If the owner knows they are on the hook, they will be more careful about who drives (the car).”\n\nCompliance with the ACLU settlement\n\nThe city of Milwaukee reached a $3.4 million settlement with the ACLU of Wisconsin over stop-and-frisk practices that disproportionately affected Black and Latino people compared to white people. The settlement came with a consent decree requiring Milwaukee police to reform the practice.\n\nDavis said Milwaukee police have taken steps in the right direction in terms of compliance efforts, but said the department is still struggling in some regards. He said the latest compliance assessment stated a need for one leader in city government to organize the effort. “I am not going to try to pass the buck” on that, he said.\n\nMahaley affirmed that officers need to understand they need to document the probable cause or reasonable suspicion for stopping and frisking someone. “It’s important that sergeants and lieutenants are enforcing this,” he said. “I recognize that there are a lot of things that has to be addressed and it is a heavy limit to a certain extent, but that’s no excuse. We have to get it done.”\n\nAziz pointed out the main idea of the ACLU settlement is to end the disproportionate rates in which nonwhites are being stopped and frisked without any documented justification for doing so. He said the department needs to institute additional training on constitutional rights and implicit bias in order to achieve this.\n\nWorking with youth\n\nHow police interact with youth, especially those who are disadvantaged, is of particular interest to some groups who want to avoid having them enter the criminal justice system at a young age.\n\nMahaley has said that forming partnerships with non-governmental agencies and the business community to refer youth for work or mentorship opportunities will be crucial to keep youth in Milwaukee on the right path. He has also expressed interest in creating a police-sponsored sports league.\n\nAziz, who helped create a police-sponsored athletics league in Dallas, has repeatedly expressed interest in doing the same in Milwaukee, along with a “junior cadet program,” as vehicles for mentorship. He has pledged to work with schools and non-governmental organizations to avoid sending kids through the criminal justice system.\n\nDavis describes himself as a “strong proponent” of holding youth accountable through alternatives to the criminal justice system. He said Portland officers are encouraged to handle troubled youth not with arrests but referrals. He said implicit bias curricula are important in order to avoid victimizing young people of color.\n\nWar on drugs\n\nThe \"war on drugs\" campaign has been criticized in the U.S. for mass incarceration that has disproportionately affected people of color.\n\nAziz said the war on drugs needs to be reshaped to help people caught in cycles of addiction. He’s said that the family he grew up in, and his extended family, were “rife” with addiction issues and that more than one sibling has passed through the criminal justice system only to receive little, if any, rehabilitation. He called addiction a “public health issue” and said police need to help bolster diversion and re-entry programs.\n\nDavis has said flatly that the war on drugs needs to end because of the “tremendous collateral damage” that the ensuing mass incarceration has inflicted on communities. He said it’s more important to care for those with addiction issues from a public health perspective, but said there is still a place for law enforcement when it comes to those distributing drugs.\n\nMahaley focused his comments on removing drugs from communities, saying law enforcement needs to hold accountable those who are profiting off the illicit trade. He has also voiced support for re-entry programs for sellers.\n\nRecruiting, retention and training\n\nFueled by the Black Lives Matter movement, many people are eager to see police departments recruit a more diverse workforce, retain good officers in the face of budget cuts and reform training protocols to treat people equitably.\n\nDavis said officer recruiting efforts should be tailored in a way that will appeal to people who already have a “guardian” mindset, rather than a “warrior” mentality. He said retaining good employees requires a comprehensive wellness program. While overseeing training in Portland, Davis said he added three new disciplines focusing on ethics, wellness and leadership development, and also beefed up the de-escalation and communications curriculum. He said allowing community involvement in training in Portland has been “hugely impactful.”\n\nMahaley said he is eager to institute a culture of police holding each other accountable, which would begin at the training academy. He has repeatedly stated a “tremendous” emphasis on recruiting and the need to do so out of schools. He has expressed interest in joining a federal pilot program that would make available recruits who have already completed advanced training and testing.\n\nAziz has set his sights on recruiting directly from Milwaukee neighborhoods, schools and other public events. He said training in Milwaukee needs to be more rigorous and emphasize de-escalation techniques, procedural justice and implicit bias in order to build up a “guardian” mindset.\n\nContact Elliot Hughes at elliot.hughes@jrn.com or 414-704-8958.

Richard Bratz, spokesman for the state police. It \"cannot obtain any Internet-based data.\"\n\nThe News Journal reported Sunday that the state police own Stingray technology. Through Freedom of Information Act requests, it was learned that $949,704 has been paid to Melbourne, Florida-based Harris Corp. for hardware and training for cell-site simulators.\n\nPrivacy groups raise concern over cellphone surveillance\n\nPolice secretly track cellphones to solve routine crimes\n\nThe boxy devices, which can be put into a briefcase and carried in a police vehicle, can covertly scoop up cellphone information within a few miles, including phone data from people who aren’t the target of an investigation.\n\nThe technology, originally developed to hunt down terrorists, works by tricking mobile phones to connect to it rather than the nearest tower – without the knowledge of users. Stingrays allow police to comb through the collected data to extract a phone’s location, as well as eavesdrop on text messages, call histories and other transmitted material.\n\nHow officers in Delaware use the technology was unclear before the story, as the agency declined to share details. Cell-site simulators have an extra layer of mystery as the state police signed an agreement with the FBI promising it would disclose virtually no information about the machines, and are directed to dismiss criminal cases if details about the tools are threatened to be released.\n\nThe head of the Delaware State Police, Col. Nathaniel McQueen Jr., would not talk about how the technology is used ahead of the Sunday story. He also could not be reached Thursday.\n\nBut Thursday, Bratz said in a statement that police cannot obtain “emails, instant messages, social media or obtain any personal subscriber information, cellular telephone numbers, billing information, or any other form of personal information.”\n\nBystanders' data gathered in the searches are not kept by the agency, Bratz said.\n\nIn September, the FBI said its agents must stop using the technology to view emails, texts, contact lists and images and must obtain warrants before switching on the devices.\n\nOn Tuesday, USA Today reported that the U.S. Marshals Service used the devices to track 6,000 phones over an undisclosed amount of time.\n\nThe News Journal sent state police a Freedom of Information Act request for warrants from adjudicated cases for Stingray use but were notified that no records existed.\n\nOn Thursday, Bratz said the state police have “always sought legal authority from the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, signed by a Superior Court Judge before the cell site simulator can be operated by an investigator of the Delaware State Police.”\n\nLinda Carmichael, chief staff attorney at the Delaware Superior Court, did not respond to a Feb. 17 request from The News Journal inquiring whether Superior Court judges have signed warrants, or court orders, allowing police officers to use the technology.\n\nDelaware police can covertly collect cellphone data\n\nThomas Neuberger, a Wilmington attorney and civil libertarian, said police should “redact and make available” all Stingray-related warrants.\n\n“We got an important public debate going,” he said. “Let’s disclose the documents and resolve the debate.”\n\nNeuberger said the disclosure should also include documents that outline police departments' standard operating procedures that govern their use of the devices.\n\n“The public would be assured if [those] procedures were made known,” he said. “The FBI’s is known to the whole world.”\n\nBratz said law enforcement agencies need to balance the desire the public might have for information with the risk that operational details could allow suspects to “avoid detection.”\n\nThe police disclosed the information Thursday, Bratz said, to clear up misconceptions about how the devices are used. He did not elaborate about what the misconceptions were.\n\nThe Delaware State Police is one of at least 60 law enforcement agencies nationwide equipped with Stingray, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been studying the proliferation of the technology.\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

That hack would also avoid tripping the self-erase program built into the iPhone, the security hurdle that's at the crux of the U.S. government's legal fight with Apple.\n\nJudge grants Justice delay in Apple hearing\n\nThe Justice Department isn't saying which \"outside party\" is helping it hack into the phone. If the method works, the agency won't need Apple's aid unlocking the phone, the department said in a filing late Monday when it asked for a surprise postponement of Tuesday's scheduled hearing in the Apple dispute.\n\nThat was quite an about-face from the FBI's previous stance, which held there was no way to get into the phone without Apple's assistance in overcoming the passcode locking feature. Apple has resisted, saying the approach would make all its customers' data more vulnerable.\n\nA second government official, who also was not authorized to speak publicly, said the undisclosed party had been in contact with the FBI over a period of days before authorities felt confident enough to seek a postponement of Tuesday’s hearing.\n\nA third law enforcement official said investigators have been able to bypass the security function on sample phones, providing some measure of confidence. They should have an update to the court by April 5 on their progress, Justice lawyers said Monday.\n\nVarious methods possible\n\nSecurity researchers for the last month have publicly discussed ways a phone can be hacked without having Apple redesign the operating system. These physical hacks were all expensive, time consuming, and posed the risk that the data could be destroyed. But firms like Canadian patent analysis firm Chipworks regularly applies some of them, such as a method that reverse-engineers computer chips in search of patent infringements.\n\n3 other hacks FBI could use on killer's iPhone besides an Apple key\n\nGillmor's approach involves making a digital copy of the phone’s chips and then creating a purely digital version of them. The FBI could then try to crack the passcode nine times, delete that digital version, make a new one and keep going until one of them worked. That would, in theory, allow the FBI to get around the passcode feature on later model iPhones that locks out a user after 10 wrong attempts to enter a passcode.\n\n“It’s hard for me to imagine the FBI, with the budget it has, the skills and competencies that it has, that nobody came up with the thing I proposed,” Gillmor told USA TODAY.\n\nThe FBI has the technical experts and necessary hardware in place to do the hack in no more than two days. Even if they had to start with nothing and hire and buy equipment, it wouldn’t take more than $50,000 and a month to unlock the phone, Gillmor said.\n\n“It was never going to be nearly as fast as the method the FBI wanted to try but it’s essentially a way of fooling the thing into letting you make multiple attempts,\" said Hall of the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\nApple had said it would take a team of six to 10 engineers working two to four weeks to create the software to bypass the passcode that the FBI had demanded.\n\nApple, U.S. joust over question: Can you have too much encryption?\n\nApple attorneys told reporters they didn't know who was assisting government investigators or what the new method may involve.\n\nThe idea that someone came to the FBI with a possible work-around isn’t surprising, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security in Indianapolis.\n\nSecurity experts have been crawling through the iPhone's operating system code and analyzing it for years. “This case might have upped the ante to security researchers to dive in a little deeper and really be heads down and working on an option,” he said.\n\nLogically, there are several possibilities, some more likely than others, he said. Like Hall, he thinks creating a virtual machine is the most viable of the proposals he’s heard.\n\nIt’s also possible that someone who’s reverse-engineered Apple’s chip patent diagrams came forward with a method of extracting the co-mingled private encryption key on the phone without damaging it.\n\n“That would be the most spectacular,” he said.\n\nFollow technology reporter @eweise.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/19/apple-iphone-san-bernardino-google-facebook-twitter-microsoft-yahoo-tech-industry-support/80618148/", "title": "Tech industry slowly rallies behind Apple in iPhone fight", "text": "Jessica Guynn\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — The U.S. technology industry is lining up behind Apple over its refusal to help the FBI break into the iPhone used by one of the terrorists in December's San Bernardino massacre — albeit cautiously.\n\nJan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research, says statements of public support from major tech companies have been guarded and \"somewhat lukewarm\" with Google and Facebook voicing public support for Apple more forcefully and swiftly than Microsoft, Yahoo and Twitter.\n\nSome may be trying to avoid scrutiny, fearing the same recriminations and loss of trust that followed Edward Snowden's 2013 revelations that major tech and telecom companies had secretly given the U.S. government vast amounts of consumer data, said longtime Silicon Valley futurist Paul Saffo.\n\n\"What took them so long? The longer they waited, the less credit they get. The smart thing was to say not just 'yeah, we support them' but 'hell yeah, we support them,\" Saffo said.\n\nThe U.S. government went back to court Friday in an attempt to force Apple to comply with a court order directing the company to assist the FBI in unlocking the iPhone used by one of the assailants in the December mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people.\n\nA federal judge ordered Apple this week to bypass security functions on the iPhone, igniting a public fight between the Obama administration and Apple, with the world's most valuable company declaring it would not comply with the order to hack into the phone.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google, was the first head of a major tech company to side with Apple, saying in a series of tweets on Wednesday that \"forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users’ privacy\" and would set a \"troubling precedent.\"\n\nEdward Snowden, Sundar Pichai back Apple in fight over iPhone\n\nFacebook followed with more forceful language on Thursday, warning of a \"chilling precedent\" and pledging to \"fight aggressively\" against government efforts to \"weaken the security\" of consumer tech products.\n\nCEO Jack Dorsey tweeted Twitter's support, later on Thursday: \"We stand with @tim_cook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership)!\"\n\nFacebook, Twitter side with Apple in iPhone fight\n\nMicrosoft and Yahoo initially referred reporters to written statements from industry trade groups.\n\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer Brad Smith tweeted a link to a trade group statement, saying \"essential to have broad public discussion on these important issues.\" Late Thursday Smith tweeted the link again and made a stronger statement: \"In a world where we need to keep both the public safe and privacy rights secure, backdoors take us backwards.\"\n\nYahoo backs Apple in fight over iPhone\n\nYahoo's chief information security officer Bob Lord on Friday said on Twitter: \"Ordering a company to hack one targeted system is clearly the first step to ordering them to backdoor them all. #slipperySlope#usersfirst.\" Yahoo spokeswoman Suzanne Philion confirmed the tweet reflected the official position of the Internet giant. Yahoo had previously referred reporters to statements from industry groups.\n\nStill, if the courts say Apple has to comply, there’s really nothing other tech companies can do to help, said analyst Dawson. \"As far as I know, the other big tech companies have always complied in the past with similar court orders, as has Apple, and I suspect they’ll continue to do so in future,\" Dawson said. \"So even if they respect Apple’s stance here, it’s hard for them to back it to the hilt.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY senior technology writer Jessica Guynn@jguynn", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/politics/white-house-period-tracker-apps/index.html", "title": "White House says Americans should be 'really careful' about using ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe White House is warning individuals to be “really careful” when using phone apps that track users’ menstrual cycles over fears that the data could be used against them if they seek abortions following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\n“I wouldn’t say we’re directing people (to stop using the apps), but I think people should be really careful about that,” Jen Klein, co-chair and executive director of the White House Gender Policy Council, told reporters on Friday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden touched on the issue earlier Friday while signing an executive order aimed at abortion protections, asking the chair of the Federal Trade Commission to consider taking steps to protect consumer privacy when seeking information about reproductive health care services. Klein added that the Department of Health and Human Services has publicized instructions on how to delete apps from their phones.\n\nConcerns about state data collection from period apps has increased in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last month, which eliminated the federal constitutional right to an abortion. Abortion advocates have warned the White House that women who reside in states that criminalize abortion could face prosecution when seeking one and data from those apps could be used as evidence against them.\n\nIn Congress, three House lawmakers launched an investigation this week into the collection and sale of personal health data related to abortion by data brokers and period-tracking apps. And a group of senators introduced a bill last month that would ban data brokers from selling health and location data.\n\nIn the private sector, however, many tech companies have thus far declined to say how they plan to respond to such requests from law enforcement. And online privacy experts have identified data brokers – which collect consumer data from various online sources and license it to third parties, typically advertisers – as a particularly vulnerable area because law enforcement could potentially purchase user data rather than having to issue a formal legal request.\n\nIn response to the potential privacy issues, Flo, the leading menstrual cycle tracking app with 240 million users, announced an “anonymous mode” option last week.\n\nThe feature allows users enter data into the app without adding their name, email or technical identifier. If the company, which is based in London, receives an official request to identify a user by name or email, it will be unable to connect that information with their health data, Flo said.\n\nAnd Clue, based in Berlin and serving 12 million users globally according to its site, claims its European location makes it a more secure home for data.\n\nBut some privacy experts are skeptical about how much a feature like Flo’s anonymous mode can separate the user from their personal health data.\n\nApple has told CNN it takes numerous steps to protect health data on its devices and in the cloud, including by encrypting health information in iCloud when a user enables two-factor authentication.\n\nAnd Google last week said it will soon automatically delete location history records that show whether a person has visited an abortion clinic or fertility center. In a blog post, Google said the move is intended to help users protect their privacy when they visit locations that could shed light on their personal medical situation or health care decisions.\n\nBut tech companies have also broadly said they would comply with government data requests so long as they are consistent with existing laws. The rollback of federal abortion protections, combined with the passage of new legislation in numerous states restricting abortion, could make it difficult for platforms to fight certain data demands related to abortion investigations.", "authors": ["Jasmine Wright Maegan Vazquez", "Jasmine Wright", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}]}

The company hasn't responded to media requests for information since Musk took over.\n\nAt Twitter's San Francisco headquarters and other offices, contract workers wore green badges while full-time workers wore blue badges. Contractors did a number of jobs to help keep Twitter running, including engineering and marketing, Roberts said.

Elon Musk is making automakers uncomfortable on Twitter\n\nCutting them will have a \"tangible impact on the experience of the platform,\" she said.\n\nMusk promised to loosen speech restrictions when he took over Twitter. But in the early days after Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in late October and dismissed its board of directors and top executives, the billionaire Tesla CEO sought to assure civil rights groups and advertisers that the platform could continue tamping down hate posts.\n\nThat message was reiterated by Twitter's then-head of content moderation, Yoel Roth, who tweeted that the Nov. 4 layoffs affected only \"15% of our Trust & Safety organization (as opposed to approximately 50% cuts company-wide), with our front-line moderation staff experiencing the least impact.\"\n\nRoth has since resigned from the company, joining an exodus of high-level leaders who were tasked with privacy protection, cybersecurity and complying with regulations.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/27/tech/elon-musk-one-month-twitter/index.html", "title": "A look back at Elon Musk's chaotic first month at Twitter | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSunday officially marks one month since the world’s richest man took the helm at Twitter.\n\nIn that time, Elon Musk initiated mass layoffs and gave remaining staffers a cryptic ultimatum, reinstated the accounts of controversial figures including former President Donald Trump, and launched – then punted – a plan to charge for Twitter’s iconic blue checkmarks.\n\nAfter spending months embroiled in an unsuccessful legal battle to get out of his initial proposal to buy Twitter, Musk made his first splashy entrance into the company’s offices on Oct. 26, carrying a sink. (In a video of the incident shared on Twitter, he wrote: “Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!)\n\nSince then, the billionaire has seemingly left no stone unturned during his whirlwind first month as “Chief Twit.” Here is a look at the range of ways Musk (who is still, simultaneously, CEO of his other companies Tesla and SpaceX) has already left his mark on one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nMusk clears out C-suite, then cuts approximately half of Twitter’s staff\n\nAlmost immediately after Musk completed his drama-plagued $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, he fired former CEO Parag Agrawal and other executives. He then made himself the CEO and sole director of the platform, per a securities filing.\n\nThe dramatic leadership shakeup, however, was only the first taste of the major staffing overhaul to come. Musk began wide-ranging layoffs across the company, reducing its overall headcount by roughly 50% in the span of a couple of days.\n\nOn the eve of Nov. 3 and into Nov. 4, numerous now-former Twitter employees began posting on the platform that they had been locked out of their company email accounts as the job cuts began to play out in a very dramatic, public manner.\n\nThe layoffs impacted departments including ethical AI, marketing and communication, search, public policy, and more. As the workers said goodbye to their colleagues online (many sharing blue hearts and salute emojis to signal they had lost their jobs at Twitter), Musk remained largely silent, at least on the job cuts.\n\nIn another dramatic move by the new boss, Musk publicly fired a software engineer who had survived the initial round of cuts, but who then questioned Musk on Twitter.\n\nMusk gives ultimatum to remaining employees: Do ‘extremely hardcore’ work or leave\n\nIn a late-night internal email after the mass staff cuts, Musk asked Twitter’s remaining employees to commit to “extremely hardcore” work or else leave the company with severance pay.\n\n“Going forward, to build a breakthrough Twitter 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be extremely hardcore,” Musk wrote in the memo sent out on Nov. 16. “This will mean working long hours at high intensity. Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade.”\n\nIn the memo, Musk goes on to outline how Twitter will be “much more engineering-driven” and then gives staff an ultimatum. “If you are sure that you want to be part of the new Twitter, please click yes on the link below,” directing staff to what appears to be an online form.\n\nMusk said any employee who has not done so by 5 p.m. ET on the following day, Thursday, would receive three months severance.\n\nAdvertisers flee, and Musk decries ‘massive drop in revenue’\n\nIn the shadow of the mass exodus of workers, a departure of advertisers was also brewing.\n\nSince Musk’s takeover, a handful of brands – ranging from General Mills to the North Face to the Volkswagen Group – confirmed a pause in advertising on the social network as civil society organizations raised new concern over the direction of the company under Musk.\n\nApproximately a week after he took over the company, Musk said that it had seen a “massive drop in revenue.”\n\n“Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists,” he said in a tweet on Nov. 4. “Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.”\n\nAn ongoing saga over blue check marks kicks off\n\nAnother aspect of Twitter that Musk quickly upended is one of the platform’s most familiar features for its users: the verified blue check marks that had long been used to confirm the authenticity of government officials, journalists, and other public figures.\n\n“Twitter’s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullsh*t,” Musk tweeted on Nov. 1. “Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.”\n\nSure enough, on Nov. 5, Twitter launched an updated version of its iOS app that allowed users to pay a monthly subscription fee to receive a blue check mark on their profiles. The update, as outlined on Apple’s App Store at the time, stated that users would now have to pay $7.99 per month for the company’s Twitter Blue subscription to receive a check mark on the platform, “just like the celebrities, companies, and politicians you already follow.”\n\nWithin days of the rollout of the subscription service, Twitter was inundated with a wave of celebrity and corporate impersonators who quickly gamed the new system to pose as brands and prominent figures.\n\nChaos ensued. In one viral example, a fake account, which featured a newly purchased blue check mark, purporting to be pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly tweeted that a critical diabetes drug would now be free.\n\nIn the wake of the mayhem, Musk ultimately announced that it would delay the rollout of the subscription service until the end of the month.\n\n“Punting relaunch of Blue Verified to November 29th to make sure that it is rock solid,” Musk tweeted on Nov. 15.\n\nOn Nov. 24 Musk gave a slightly different target date for the relaunch, Dec. 2, and offered more details about the future service, including a range of check mark colors to denote the type of verified account.\n\nTwitter restores some previously banned accounts, including Donald Trump’s\n\nOn Nov. 19, Musk restored the Twitter account of former President Donald Trump, nearly two years after it had been permanently banned following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe move came shortly after Twitter restored the accounts of several other controversial, previously banned or suspended users, including conservative Canadian podcaster Jordan Peterson, right-leaning satire website Babylon Bee, comedian Kathy Griffin and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nAhead of restoring Trump’s Twitter account, Musk posted a poll asking the platform’s users if Trump should be reinstated – where a slim majority (51.8%) voted in favor of it.\n\n“The people have spoken. Trump will be reinstated,” Musk tweeted. “Vox Populi, Vox Dei.” (Latin for “the voice of the people is the voice of God.”).\n\nTrump has previously said he would remain on his own platform, Truth Social, instead of rejoining Twitter, and has yet to tweet since his account came back online.\n\nBut a change in his approach could hold major political implications as Trump has said he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\nMusk goes onto to grant ‘amnesty’ to most previously banned accounts\n\nAfter conducting yet another Twitter poll, Musk said on Nov. 24 that he will begin restoring most previously banned accounts on Twitter starting next week. This would mark his most far-reaching move yet to undo the social media platform’s policy of permanently suspending users who repeatedly violated its rules.\n\nThe Thanksgiving Day announcement came after most respondents voted in favor of his poll over whether to offer “general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam.”\n\nOnce again, Musk tweeted that “the people have spoken.”\n\nHis recent decisions to reinstate previously banned accounts, based on the results of his polls on the platform, is notably at odds with how Musk previously said he would handle such choices.\n\nJust a day after his takeover of Twitter, Musk said that the social media company “will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.”\n\n“No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes,” Musk added\n\nIt is not immediately clear if that council was ever created, convened, or involved in the decision-making behind bringing back Trump and formerly banned accounts.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/tech/elon-musk-email-ultimatum-twitter/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk gives ultimatum to Twitter employees: Do 'extremely ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTwitter’s new owner Elon Musk has given employees until Thursday evening to commit to “extremely hardcore” work or else leave the company, according to a copy of a late-night internal email sent by the billionaire and obtained by CNN.\n\n“Going forward, to build a breakthrough Twitter 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be extremely hardcore,” Musk wrote in the memo. “This will mean working long hours at high intensity.

The Washington Post was first to report the memo.\n\nThe email, with the subject line “A fork in the road,” comes as Musk has publicly and privately clashed with Twitter employees over his approach to running the company. It also comes after Musk pushed out Twitter’s top execs, eliminated the board of directors and laid off roughly half the staff, including crucial roles in curation, wellness, public policy and other teams.\n\nDuring testimony in a Delaware trial over his Tesla pay package on Wednesday, Musk said that he expects the “fundamental organizational restructuring” at Twitter to be finished by the end of this week. He added that while he has spent the “lion’s share” of his time at Twitter rather than his other companies in the past few weeks, he doesn’t expect that to be the case forever.\n\n“I expect to reduce my time at Twitter, and find somebody else to run Twitter, over time,” Musk said.\n\nIn the meantime, Musk has laid out ambitious goals for how he plans to change the platform and is pushing his staff to achieve them as he attempts to quickly bolster the company’s bottom line. Musk has also reportedly made confusing asks of employees, such as requesting that they print out dozens of pages of code they’d recently written and then reversing course and telling them to shred it.\n\nAt least one Twitter employee also tweeted about sleeping on the floor at the office. Musk himself has previously said he’s worked as much as 120 hours a week at times and has slept on the floor at a Tesla factory.\n\nInside Twitter, Musk has faced pushback and concerns from employees. In one instance, employees earlier this month presented to Musk and his team a document detailing concerns about his then-proposed plan to launch a system where users could pay to receive a verification checkmark. Musk launched the system without implementing many of the suggested safeguards, and some of the employees’ fears were quickly realized. Twitter paused the rollout of the system just two days after it was launched, and said Tuesday he plans to restart it later this month.\n\n“Whatever decision you make,” Musk said in the memo, “thank you for your efforts to make Twitter successful.”", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/tech/elon-musk-twitter-changes/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk now owns Twitter. Here's what he could change | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAfter spending months attempting to get out of his deal to buy Twitter, Elon Musk officially owns the hugely influential platform. Now the question is: What will he actually do with it?\n\nMusk’s takeover — which was finalized Thursday night, a source familiar with the matter told CNN — not only has the potential to create upheaval for Twitter (TWTR) employees but also for the hundreds of millions of people around the world who use the platform daily. It could also impact the upcoming US midterm elections, if Musk makes good on his promise to restore the accounts of users who were previously banned from the platform, most notably former US President Donald Trump, and limit the company’s content restrictions.\n\nIn the first weeks after agreeing to buy the company in April, and before his initial move to bail on the deal, Musk repeatedly stressed that his goal was to bolster “free speech” on the platform and work to “unlock” Twitter’s “extraordinary potential.” The Tesla CEO suggested he would rethink Twitter’s approach to content moderation and permanent bans, with potential impacts on civil discourse and the political landscape. He also talked about his desire to rid the platform of bots, even as he later made the number of bots central to his argument to abandon the deal.\n\nDuring Tesla (TSLA)’s earnings call last week, Musk acknowledged that although finalizing the $44 billion deal meant “overpaying” for the social media firm, “the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value.” He added that he believes Twitter has “languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential.”\n\nMusk’s plans for boosting Twitter’s value could involve cutting down its workforce, something he’s hinted at before. Previous reporting suggested that he’d planned to cut 75% of staff, although he is said to have told Twitter staff this week that’s not the case. Either way, anxieties are running high. Musk immediately fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde.\n\nIn private and public statements over the past six months, Musk has tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting this week that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nThere have been more far-fetched suggestions, too. In one text exchange with his brother Kimbal Musk, revealed last week in court documents, the two appeared to discuss the possibility of asking users to pay for each tweet they post with small amounts of the cryptocurrency DogeCoin.\n\nNow that Musk has completed the deal, some of those theoretical changes could soon become reality. Here’s what users should know:\n\nA big shift for content moderation\n\nFor years under former CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey, Twitter emphasized its work to bolster “healthy conversations.” The company banned many accounts promoting abuse and spam, added labels for false or misleading information, and banned the misgendering of transgender people.\n\nUnder Musk’s ownership, Twitter could unwind steps taken to make the platform more palatable for its most vulnerable users, typically women, members of the LGBTQ community and people of color, according to safety experts.\n\nMusk has said Twitter, under his leadership, would have more lenient content moderation policies. “If in doubt, let the speech exist,” Musk said in one on-stage interview in April. “If it’s a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist. But obviously in the case where there’s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet.”\n\nMusk on Thursday sought to reassure advertisers that he doesn’t plan to turn the platform into a “free-for-all hellscape” despite his promises to reduce content moderation. The remarks follow questions about whether advertisers might leave the platform for fear of their paid posts ending up alongside potentially objectionable content.\n\n“In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences,” he said in an open letter posted to Twitter. Allowing all legal speech may not be so straight forward — content rules vary across the world and, in Europe, the new Digital Services Act imposes high moderation standards.\n\nMusk has also said he wants to make Twitter’s algorithm open source and make it more transparent to users when, for example, a tweet has been emphasized or demoted in their feed. (Leaders at Twitter have previously expressed support for moving in that direction, and the company often makes clear when it is demoting certain tweets or types of content.)\n\nUnbanning Trump and other accounts\n\nBut the most striking early change could come from who is and is not allowed on a Musk-owned Twitter.\n\nMusk has said he thinks Twitter should be more “reluctant to delete things” and “very cautious with permanent bans.” That could mean a long list of controversial far right figures and conspiracy theorists, among others, soon find their way back on the platform.\n\nMusk, for his part, has focused on bringing back one of Twitter’s most prominent former users: Trump.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake,” Musk said in May. “I would reverse the perma-ban. … But my opinion, and Jack Dorsey, I want to be clear, shares this opinion, is that we should not have perma-bans.”\n\nDorsey tweeted following Musk’s May remarks that he does “agree” there shouldn’t be permanent bans on Twitter users. “There are exceptions … but generally permanent bans are a failure of ours and don’t work,” he said.\n\nTrump has said he does not want to rejoin Twitter and will instead remain on his own social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nBut if Trump were to accept a Musk offer to return to Twitter, it could restore a significant following he hasn’t had since being banned from the platform in January 2021, just as the 2024 US Presidential race ramps up. On Truth Social, Trump has only 4 million followers; on Twitter, he reached an audience of more than 88 million followers.\n\nAn owner with an erratic and controversial history on the platform\n\nAnother notable change is simply who may be making these sensitive decisions.\n\nMusk has a mixed reputation in the tech industry. He is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious and successful innovators and entrepreneurs of this era. But he has also courted controversy, often from his own Twitter profile, where he has more than 100 million followers.\n\nOver the years, Musk has used Twitter to make misleading claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, to make a baseless accusation that a man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand was a sexual predator, to mock people who display their gender pronouns on the platform, and to make countless jokes involving the numbers 420 and 69. He has also tweeted a (since deleted) photo comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler and has compared the now-ousted Agrawal to Joseph Stalin.\n\nMusk also previously sought to remove a Twitter account dedicated to tracking the movements of his private jet by offering to pay off the college freshman running the account (the account owner declined).\n\nThe same day he sent his letter to Twitter attempting to revive the deal, Musk was widely panned for comments he made on the platform about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He suggested making Crimea, a region Russia invaded and annexed from Ukraine in 2014, “formally part of Russia.” Most followers responded “no” to his poll and Ukraine’s Ambassador to Germany Andrij Melnyk replied in a tweet: “F— off is my very diplomatic reply to you.” In a followup tweet, an apparently frustrated Musk seemed to blame the results of his poll on a “bot attack.”\n\nUntil now, Twitter has, at least to some extent, been accountable for its policy decisions to advertisers, shareholders and its board.

They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.”\n\nThe remarks come as brands, including General Mills and the Volkswagen Group, pause advertising on the social network and as civil society organizations called on Twitter’s advertisers to halt all spending globally, citing uncertainty about the direction of the company under Musk.\n\n“We have paused advertising on Twitter,” Kelsey Roemhildt, a spokesperson for General Mills, told CNN in a statement, making it the first company that doesn’t compete with Musk’s Tesla to confirm such a move. “As always, we will continue to monitor this new direction and evaluate our marketing spend,” the spokesperson said.\n\nIn a separate statement, Volkswagen Group, which owns Audi, Porsche and Bentley, confirmed it had recommended its brands “pause their paid activities on the platform until further notice.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which was first to report the moves, also said Pfizer and Mondalez are pausing ads on Twitter. The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe companies join General Motors, which had previously said it would pause paying for advertising on Twitter while it evaluates the platform’s “new direction.” Toyota, another Tesla competitor, previously told CNN that it is “in discussions with key stakeholders and monitoring the situation” on Twitter.\n\nOn Friday, organizations including the Anti-Defamation League, Free Press and GLAAD, upped their pressure campaign for more brands to rethink advertising on Twitter. The groups pointed to Friday’s mass layoffs of Twitter staff as a key factor in their thinking, citing fears that Musk’s cuts will make Twitter’s election integrity policies effectively unenforceable, even if they technically remain active.\n\nAfter months of uncertainty about Musk’s pending acquisition, advertisers are now confronting questions around how Musk will change the platform, which is already an also-ran in the digital ad space despite its outsized political influence. Musk, known as both an innovative entrepreneur and an erratic figure, has promised to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies and undo permanent bans of controversial figures, including former President Donald Trump.\n\nThat creates a challenge for brands, which are sensitive to the types of content their ads run against, an issue made more complicated by social media. Most marketers bristle at the thought of having their ads run alongside toxic content such as hate speech, pornography or misinformation.\n\nAd buying giant Interpublic Group, which works with consumer brands such as Unilever and Coca Cola, earlier this week also recommended its clients pause advertising on the platform.\n\nMusk has said he’s not a fan of advertising and is currently working to boost Twitter’s subscription revenue to boost its bottom line and be less dependent on ad sales, which account for 90% of Twitter’s overall revenue. But this shift won’t happen overnight, if it happens at all. Musk said he plans to launch an $8 per month subscription plan that will provide users with a verification mark, as well as several other perks, but the plans has faced sharp backlash.\n\nIn the meantime, Musk is working to stave off a possible advertiser exodus. Musk’s team spent Monday “meeting with the marketing and advertising community” in New York, according to Jason Calacanis, a member of Musk’s inner circle.\n\nMusk also met earlier this week with a group of leaders of civil society organizations, including the ADL, Free Press and the NAACP, to address concerns about a rise in hate on the platform. Representatives who attended the meeting told CNN they were encouraged by Musk’s willingness to talk and his initial commitments not to change the company’s content policies ahead of the midterms, but called on him to take further steps to protect the platform.\n\nSince meeting with Musk, representatives of some of the same organizations said, Twitter’s new owner has demonstrated “erratic” behavior that has “betrayed” the commitments he made privately to the groups.\n\nShortly before news broke last week that his $44 billion Twitter acquisition was completed, Musk wrote an open letter attempting to reassure advertisers that he does not want the social network to become a “free-for-all hellscape.”\n\n“Fundamentally, Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise,” he wrote. “Let us build something extraordinary together.”\n\n– CNN’s Brian Fung, Peter Valdes-Dapena and Jon Passantino contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Catherine Thorbecke", "Clare Duffy", "Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/11/14/elon-musk-too-much-work-twitter-takeover/10695792002/", "title": "Elon Musk says he has 'too much work' following Twitter takeover", "text": "Adam Schreck\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNUSA DUA, Indonesia — It’s not easy being Elon Musk.\n\nThat was the message the new Twitter owner and billionaire head of Tesla and SpaceX had for younger people who might seek to emulate his entrepreneurial success.\n\n“Be careful what you wish for,” Musk told a business forum in Bali on Monday when asked what an up-and-coming “Elon Musk of the East” should focus on.\n\n“I’m not sure how many people would actually like to be me.

On Thursday afternoon, Twitter staffers began posting the salute emoji, which has become a signal that someone is exiting the company. One Twitter employee said in a tweet that deciding to join the company was “one of the easiest decisions ever made. Deciding to leave today was 100% the opposite.”\n\nMeanwhile, an internal Slack channel at the company was filled with employees posting the salute emoji after the 5pm ET deadline, indicating they had chosen not to sign Musk’s pledge and depart the company, employees told CNN.\n\nTwitter’s remaining workforce had until 5 p.m. ET on Thursday to decide whether they wanted to be a part of the culture Musk wants to implement at the social media company, or else effectively resign, according to an email he sent to staff Wednesday.\n\nA former Twitter executive who recently exited the company described Thursday’s employee exits as a “mass exodus.”\n\nOn Thursday evening following the exits, employees remaining at the company received an email alerting them that the company’s offices will be temporarily closed and badge access will be restricted through Monday, according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN from a current Twitter employee. Musk’s team similarly shuttered offices during the mass layoffs earlier this month out of a concern for safety and an apparent fear that exiting employees could attempt to sabotage the company on their way out.\n\nTwo Twitter employees told CNN ahead of the deadline on Thursday that they planned to reject the ultimatum, citing a toxic work environment they say the billionaire has introduced. Another Twitter employee told CNN Wednesday they were still weighing the decision, saying the email from Musk “felt like a punch in the gut because no matter how you felt about wanting to stay or wanting to go, you were forced to make a decision and feel like you’re up against the time clock to make the best decision for you and your family.”\n\nThe employee added: “Those decisions are more than just 24 hours.”\n\nMusk told employees on Wednesday that his goal is to build “Twitter 2.0” and that employees who choose to stay will be required to commit to working “long hours at high intensity” and presumably agreeing to Musk’s demand for Twitter employees, who have been largely working remotely, to return to in-office work. As of midday Thursday, employees still did not have clarity on which remote-work exceptions would be granted if they decide to stay, one employee said.\n\nLater on Thursday, amid an apparent scramble by management to avoid losing too many workers to the ultimatum, Musk sent an email to staff attempting to clarify his position on remote work, according to text of the email obtained by CNN from a Twitter employee who asked not to be identified.\n\n“Regarding remote work, all that is required for approval is that your manager takes responsibility for ensuring that you are making an excellent contribution,” Musk said in the email, adding that workers would be expected to attend in-person meetings no less than once a month.\n\nTwenty minutes later, Musk sent a follow up email saying: “At risk of stating the obvious, any manager who falsely claims that someone reporting to them is doing excellent work or that a given role is essential, whether remote or not, will be exited from the company.”\n\nThe decision to issue an ultimatum came after Musk earlier this month fired half of Twitter’s staff, reducing its workforce to around 3,700 employees, and also reportedly cut many of Twitter’s contract workers. He also pushed out its top leadership and dissolved the board of directors. Musk also recently fired some employees for criticizing him in tweets or on internal Slack channels.\n\n“I don’t want to stick around to build a product that’s being poisoned from the inside and out,” said one of the employees who plans to reject the ultimatum, but requested anonymity to avoid putting the severance at risk. “Everyone has a price to a certain degree and this severance gives me some comfort into looking for a better environment in the time frame despite the economy.”\n\nThat employee said management now appears to have grown concerned about the number of people planning to depart and are “scrambling” to convince talent to stay. Twitter, which has reportedly eliminated most of its public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother Twitter employee, who asked not to be quoted, shared similar concerns and said they planned to also exit the company.\n\nA recently laid off employee who remains in touch with former coworkers told CNN that everyone they had spoken to plans to reject Musk’s ultimatum and exit the company. “People can’t overlook the public mockery and firing of other employees,” the former employee told CNN. “In the same vein, they can’t overlook or feel comfortable working for someone who has handled the last few weeks in the way Elon has.”\n\n“People don’t want to sacrifice their mental health and family lives to make the richest man in the world richer,” the former employee added.\n\nBut the decision may not be so easy for others. The ultimatum comes during a difficult period for the tech industry, following mass layoffs and hiring freeze announcements at many major firms including Meta, Amazon, Lyft and others. Employees working in the United States from other countries could also risk losing their work visas if they leave the company.\n\nA fourth employee told CNN Thursday they plan to stay at the company “because change is rarely influenced from the outside.”\n\nThe shakeup likely to come as a result of the ultimatum will be the last element of the “fundamental organizational restructuring” following Musk’s takeover, he told a Delaware court Wednesday during a trial over his Tesla pay package.\n\nMusk said in the Wednesday email that the “new Twitter” will be “much more engineering-driven,” leaving some non-engineering workers questioning whether their jobs could be at risk even if they opt to stay.\n\n“There’s no assurance in this, you’re just like, ‘I might be able to advocate for myself, I might not,’” the employee who expressed uncertainty about the decision said. “What’s behind this door? You don’t know. The only door you know that’s certain is the exit door.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Oliver Darcy", "Clare Duffy", "Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/tech/elon-musk-twitter-advertisers/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk tells advertisers he doesn't want Twitter to become 'free ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk attempted to reassure Twitter’s advertisers about the future of the platform in an open letter Thursday, a day before his $44 billion takeover of the company is expected to be completed.\n\nIn a letter posted to Twitter (TWTR), Musk said he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences,” despite his stated promise to rethink on its content moderation policies and bolster “free speech.”\n\nMusk has said he plans to cut back on content restrictions and that he would reverse the permanent bans of accounts previously removed from the platform for repeatedly violating its rules, including former President Donald Trump. Those plans had raised questions about the potential impact on Twitter’s core ad sales business, as advertisers might flinch at having their paid posts appear alongside more controversial content.\n\nMusk’s letter appears aimed at quelling those fears, which could impact the company’s core business. Twitter generated $4.5 billion in advertising revenue in 2021, nearly 89% of its total sales.\n\n“In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences,” he said in the Thursday post. “Fundamentally, Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise … Let us build something extraordinary together.”\n\nMusk has previously said he would seek to allow all legal speech on Twitter. Content rules vary across the world. In Europe, the new Digital Services Act imposes high moderation standards. Musk in May said he is “exactly aligned” with the new law.\n\nThe letter is the latest indication that the billionaire Tesla CEO is nearing completion of the Twitter acquisition after months of trying to get out of the deal. On Wednesday, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters and spoke with employees, reportedly telling them he does not in fact plan to cut 75% of Twitter’s staff, despite prior reports.\n\nTwitter’s Chief Customer Officer Sarah Personette responded to Musk’s Thursday tweet saying that she had a “great discussion” with Musk on Wednesday. “Our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remained unchanged,” Personette said. “Looking forward to the future!”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Thursday reported that one ad buying agency had already received requests from about a dozen clients to pause their advertisements on Twitter if Musk restores Trump’s account, and other were considering doing the same.\n\nMusk also reiterated in the letter a lofty earlier statement he had made that the Twitter acquisition is not meant to be a money-making venture for him.\n\n“The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence,” Musk said.\n\nMusk has previously suggested that he wants to increase Twitter’s subscription revenue to rely less on ads.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/tech/meta-facebook-layoffs/index.html", "title": "Meta to lay off 11,000 employees, as Zuckerberg says he is ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nFacebook parent company Meta on Wednesday said it is laying off 11,000 employees, marking the most significant job cuts in the tech giant’s history.\n\nThe job cuts come as Meta confronts a range of challenges to its core business and makes an uncertain and costly bet on pivoting to the metaverse. It also comes amid a spate of layoffs at other tech firms in recent months as the high-flying sector reacts to high inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a looming recession.\n\n“Today I’m sharing some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in Meta’s history,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post to employees. “I’ve decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go.”\n\nThe job cuts will impact many corners of the company, but Meta’s recruiting team will be hit particularly hard as “we’re planning to hire fewer people next year,” Zuckerberg said in the post. He added that a hiring freeze would be extended until the first quarter, with few exceptions.\n\nIn September, Meta had a headcount of more than 87,000, per a September SEC filing.\n\nMeta’s core ad sales business has been hit by privacy changes implemented by Apple, advertisers tightening budgets and heightened competition from newer rivals like TikTok. Meanwhile, Meta has been spending billions to build a future version of the internet, dubbed the metaverse, that likely remains years away from widespread acceptance.\n\nLast month, the company posted its second quarterly revenue decline and said that its profit was cut in half from the prior year. Once valued at more than $1 trillion last year, Meta’s market value has since plunged to around $250 billion.\n\n“I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here,” Zuckerberg wrote in his post Wednesday. “I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted.”\n\nShares of Meta rose 5% in trading Wednesday following the announcement.\n\nMeta is not alone in feeling the pain of a market downturn. The tech sector has been facing a dizzying reality check as inflation, rising interest rates and more macroeconomic headwinds have led to a stunning shift in spending for an industry that only grew more dominant as consumers shifted more of their lives online during the pandemic.\n\n“At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth,” Zuckerberg wrote Wednesday. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.”\n\n“I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that,” he added.\n\nMeta’s headcount in September was nearly twice the 48,268 staffers it had at the start of the pandemic in March of 2020.\n\nA handful of tech companies have announced hiring freezes or job cuts in recent months, often after having seen rapid growth during the pandemic. Last week, rideshare company Lyft said it was axing 13% of employees, and payment-processing firm Stripe said it was cutting 14% of its staff. The same day, e-commerce giant Amazon said it was implementing a pause on corporate hiring.\n\nAlso last week, Facebook-rival Twitter announced mass layoffs impacting roles across the company as its new owner, Elon Musk, took the helm.\n\nIn addition to the layoffs, Zuckerberg said the company expects to “roll out more cost-cutting changes” in the coming months. Meta, which like other tech giants is known for its vast, perk-filled offices, is rethinking its real estate needs, he said, and “transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office.”\n\n“Overall,” he said, “this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate.”", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/economy/elon-musk-tesla-job-cuts/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk pulls back on job cuts plans for Tesla | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTesla may not be cutting staff after all.\n\nThat’s according to a tweet from its ever-mercurial CEO Elon Musk — an apparent contradiction to two emails he sent staff last week about planned job cuts and a hiring freeze, which pushed Tesla shares lower.\n\nLast Thursday, according to a Reuters report, Elon Musk sent an email to staff saying the company would freeze hiring as part of a move to cut staff by 10% — explaining that he has a “super bad feeling” about the economy.\n\nHe sent a follow-up email, according to Musk-centered site Tesmanian, elaborating that the company would increase hourly headcount but reduce “salaried headcount by 10%, as we have become overstaffed in many areas,” adding that :this does not apply to anyone actually building cars, battery packs or installing solar.”\n\nThen, on Saturday, Musk tweeted that the company’s “total headcount will increase, but salaried should be fairly flat.” Yet hours later, Musk said on Twitter that the Tesmanian story was “accurate.”\n\nIt’s not clear whether Musk equates a 10% salaried headcount cut with “fairly flat”: As has long been the case at Tesla, it did not respond to a request for formal comment on the reported emails.\n\nReuters’ report about the email last week sent Tesla (TSLA) shares down 9% on Friday, but on Monday, they were up 2.8% in early trading on Musk’s sort-of walk-back. Another factor affecting the stock: Musk also threatened Monday to walk away from his proposed purchase of Twitter (TWTR). Tesla (TSLA) shares have been hurt by Musk’s interest in Twitter (TWTR) as some investors have worried it would distract him from running the electric automaker, or force him to sell more Tesla (TSLA) shares to raise cash.\n\n‘It clearly backfired’\n\nThe initial job cuts email was a “mini-disaster” for Tesla shares, said Dan Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. “Any hint of economic softness from an influential person like Musk will be heard around the world,” he said.\n\nLikely among Musk’s chief concerns is the Covid lockdowns in China, which have resulted in a temporary shutdown of Tesla’s Shanghai plant and a sharp fall in industrywide auto sales in the world’s largest car market.\n\nDespite those challenges, however, Tesla is still enjoying more demand for its cars than it can supply, Ives said.\n\n“Last week’s email set off nervousness with investors around demand for no reason and put pressure on the stock,” he said. “You can see why Musk is not waking up a good mood before he sent that email. That said, he probably he should have had coffee before he sent it. It clearly backfired.”\n\nTesla had about 100,000 employees at the end of 2021, according to company filings. There are about 5,000 job openings at Tesla listed on LinkedIn, and the company is in the process of ramping up production at two recently opened factories outside of Berlin and Austin.\n\nIn addition to the emails about staffing levels, Musk sent an email to salaried staff last week saying Tesla office workers must work in the office at least 40 hours a week — and if they don’t, the company will consider them as having resigned.\n\nSurveys show that a majority of workers would like the option of working remotely rather coming into the office. The scramble to fill jobs has many companies offering workers greater flexibility to work from home, though Musk clearly is not one of the leaders doing so. Despite signs of a weakening economy, the labor market is still very tight, with employers posting two job openings for every unemployed person looking for work.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}]}

It’s all part of the ever-evolving story of Augusta National, a timeless piece of land where tradition and beauty obscure the reality of its desire to remain on the sport’s cutting edge.\n\nBut ultimately, there is a simple reason this is the biggest event in golf. Year after year, decade after decade, Augusta National has a knack for identifying the best player in the world.\n\nAnd right now, there’s no doubt who holds that title.\n\nIn a sport as unpredictable as golf, where the history books are filled with one-off major winners while great players struggle to put all the pieces together when it matters most, Jon Rahm came to Augusta and did exactly what he’s been doing for several months.\n\nRarely has there been a more fitting Masters champion.\n\nOn the course where Jack Nicklaus made his legend, Tiger Woods asserted his otherworldly dominance and pretty much all the generational players have managed to win, Rahm and Augusta National added to the story this week.\n\nWhether rain or shine or wind, Augusta proved to be a worthy, relevant test for the best players in the world. And the greatest of them at the moment more than stood up to the challenge.\n\nAt 28 years old and now with a second major title on his résumé, the Spaniard didn’t just win the tournament — he absolutely crushed the field in a way that felt much more magnificent than his four-stroke margin of victory.\n\nHere’s how dominant it was: Rahm put himself in a hole at the very beginning Thursday when he four-putted No. 1 for double-bogey. He was on the more difficult side of the draw, playing in the afternoon Friday when the weather started to deteriorate. And on the weekend, Rahm blew past Brooks Koepka without even reaching his highest gear.\n\n“If there’s anything better than accomplishing something like this, it's making history,” said Rahm when informed he was the first European player to win a Masters and U.S. Open. “It’s hard to explain. Out of all the accomplishments and many great players who came before me, it’s a humbling feeling. It’s a pretty good duo of majors.”\n\nCHRISTINE BRENNAN:Thank you, Jon Rahm, for keeping the green jacket away from a LIV golfer\n\nBut that’s who Rahm is and has been: A player without a weakness, a game that translates on every type of course.\n\nThe Masters was Rahm’s 11th PGA Tour win in the span of 6 1/2 years, with eight more in Europe. He has played 26 majors and in 10 of them, recorded a top-10 finish. In 2023, he has played in nine tournaments and won four.\n\nAnd in some ways, it feels like just the beginning.\n\nHas a shot at Grand Slam\n\n“It was obvious to me at a very young age that he was one of the best players in the world even while he was in college,” said Phil Mickelson, whose brother Tim coached Rahm at Arizona State. “To see him on this stage is not surprising for anybody. It’s hard not to pull for Jon, too. He's such a good guy. He has such a great heart and treats people so well. I think the world of him as a person. And as a player, that's obvious, how good he is.”\n\nGolf, of course, is a delicate game with small margins. Plenty of players have won a lot in a short period of time and then struggled to maintain it. Their body breaks down, their motivation wanes, their focus goes toward other pursuits. We’ll see what Rahm’s next decade looks like. In this sport, there are no guarantees.\n\nBut Rahm, more than anyone else in golf right now, seems built to last.\n\nSure, he has gone through rough patches like everyone else on tour. It doesn’t always click. The foundation of Rahm’s game is so strong and solid, though, that he legitimately has a chance to win the Grand Slam this year if he’s playing well.\n\nIs it likely to happen? Of course not.\n\nBut when you’re one of the best drivers of the golf ball, one of the most accurate iron players and in the top echelon of chippers and putters — all qualities supported by the PGA Tour’s strokes-gained data — you have a chance to win every time you play.\n\nThere are only a few players whose fortunes don't rise and fall with hot-putting weeks or whether a particular tournament setup favors their style of game. Rahm is a man for all courses, and in this Masters, all seasons.\n\nSure, there are years where the weather is perfect, the wind isn’t a factor and Augusta National is vulnerable to a beatdown from the best players in the world. But again and again, this place proves its relevance. Last year, it was Scottie Scheffler winning three times and becoming No. 1 in the world rankings before carrying that peak to his first major title.\n\nAnd now we have Rahm doing exactly what his start to the 2023 season suggested he would do.\n\n“It’s super awesome to see,” Koepka said on CBS after finishing his final round. “He's been playing really well for a while now, and to get a green jacket is pretty special.”\n\nThe only remarkable part of it was the lack of drama on Sunday.\n\nChasing history, legacy\n\nThere wasn’t one shot, one moment, one sequence where Rahm turned a two-shot deficit starting the final round into a four-shot win. He just played the most solid golf on a day where the conditions — cold in the morning as players finished their rain-delayed third round, followed by a breezy afternoon — made it difficult to post a low number.\n\nThat Rahm’s final-round 69 proved to be the sixth-lowest score of the day showed just how much teeth Augusta National has when the weather isn't perfect. You could argue Rahm wasn’t even playing that well for the first six holes, but that's all it took for him to grab the lead because he scrambled for pars and made fewer mistakes than Koepka.\n\nFrom there, it was simply about holding on and avoiding trouble through holes 10, 11 and 12, which Rahm did successfully. And when he cleared the water with his second shot on No. 13, setting up a standard birdie from just off the green, he had a three-shot lead with nobody else making a move in front of him.\n\nThe tournament was essentially over right then.\n\n“Luckily the people who shot good rounds today were a little too far out,” he said. “I’ve always been confident when I’m close of the lead. I have full faith. And maybe because it was so difficult out there, I was so focused on what I had to do.”\n\nRahm is a terrific and popular Masters champion. Even on a day where he was paired with Koepka, an American, the Spaniard garnered the bulk of the crowd support because golf fans know how much he appreciates the tradition of the game and what these big titles mean. He even mentioned in his Butler Cabin interview how special it was that he won on what would have been the 66th birthday of the late Seve Ballesteros.\n\nAnd yes, Rahm’s decision to stick with the PGA Tour and be one of its biggest defenders in the feud with LIV Golf last year matters, too.\n\n“Yeah, money is great … but would my lifestyle change if I got $400 million? No, it wouldn’t change one bit,” he said last year.\n\nThat’s a man chasing history and a legacy. That’s someone whose name belongs on the list of Masters champions. And that’s a player who Augusta National, as it often does, identified as the best golfer on the planet.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/masters/2023/04/08/masters-saturday-rounds-leaderboard-live-updates-weather/11625055002/", "title": "Masters suspends play Saturday; Tiger Woods in last place", "text": "Play was suspended at The Masters in the third round Saturday after golfers endured rain for nearly an hour.

After two rounds, the 23-year-old sat in third place at 8-under, only four strokes behind leader Brooks Koepka.\n\nBennett is within striking distance of becoming the first-ever amateur to win the Masters, but he got off to a rough start on the third round on Saturday. He hit a bogey on No. 1 and No. 2 to bring him to 6-under for the tournament. Maybe it’s the inclement weather? Maybe it’s nerves? But Bennett rebounded on No. 3 with a par.\n\nHe’s slipped to fourth place and is tied with American Phil Mickelson and Norwegian Viktor Hovland. Koepka sits atop the leaderboard at 13-under for the tournament.\n\nScottie Scheffler is seeking to defend his Masters title. On Saturday, the American star rebounded from a shaky Friday performance that left him with a score of +3. He started the third round Saturday at tee No. 10 and was able to bring his score to -1.\n\nThe 2023 Masters Tournament has been a mixed bag for members of LIV Golf competing against the PGA Tour stars they abandoned for the Saudi-backed league.\n\nFor Brooks Koepka, things couldn't be going better.

This is his 23rd straight time making the cut at the Masters.\n\nThe five-time Masters champion will continue play Saturday afternoon in the third round at 1:06 p.m. ET from tee No. 10. He will play in the last wave of the day with Thomas Pieters and Sungjae Im.\n\nTiger Woods makes cut as second round wraps up\n\nTiger Woods' streak of 23 straight made cuts at the Masters came to fruition after the five-time champion finished the first 36 holes at 3-over-par. The consecutive cuts ties the record shared by Gary Player and Fred Couples.\n\nWoods began the day with a chance to play the weekend and was comfortably above the cut line when he made a birdie on the Par 5 No. 15. But he bogeyed the last two holes and had to wait for the cut line to move as Justin Thomas finished with two straight bogeys to secure Woods' spot.\n\nBrooks Koepka (12-under) goes into Saturday's action on top of the leaderboard after Friday's action was suspended due to inclement weather. He holds a two-shot lead over Jon Rahm. Amateur Sam Bennett is alone in third at 8-under, followed by Collin Morikawa and Viktor Hovland at 6-under.\n\nTiger Woods finishes second round at 3-over, outside projected cut line\n\nWoods' approach on No. 17 was an adventure as his tee shot went wide right on the par-4 440-yard hole, but battled back to get within six feet of a par, and he missed it, going back to 2-over.\n\nOn 18, another par-4, Woods hit the ball left of the fairway and was left with a 50 foot for par.\n\nWoods finishes his second round at 1-over with two birdies and three bogeys and will likely need players above him to falter to get a new projected cut line so he can play through the weekend.\n\nOn the updated leaderboard, Jon Rahm is still two shots from the lead after bogeying 16. Brooks Koepka remains the 36-hole leader at 12-under.\n\nTiger Woods makes second birdie of round, Jon Rahm inches closer to lead\n\nWoods had a chance to make up some ground on the 550-yard Par 5 15th hole, and hit the fairway on his first shot, leaving him 277 yards from the hole. He made a 27-foot put for birdie to give him some breathing room and gave the crowd a nice fist pump. On 16, one of the five holes that has played over par through two rounds, Tiger made a seven-foot putt for par and sits at +1.\n\nRahm, who finished Friday three shots off the lead, got off to a good start, making birdie on the Par 3 No. 12, and making pars on No. 13 and 14.\n\nTiger Woods resumes second round, pars first two holes to remain at 2-over\n\nWoods got through 12 holes during Friday's round and started early on Saturday trying to stay above the cut line. On the par-5 No. 13, Woods got in good position with a chance for a birdie from 15 yards out, but settled for par and remains at 2-over. On 14, he made a four-yard put to save for another par.\n\n63-year-old Fred Couples could make history\n\nIt appears that Fred Couples will be playing the rest of the weekend at the Masters.\n\nThe 1992 champion finished his second round with a bogey, leaving him at 1-over for the championship and inside the projected cut line. That would make the 63-year-old Couples the oldest player to make the cut at Augusta National, beating the mark that Bernhard Langer set during the 2020 tournament by about 3 ½ months.\n\nIt also would be the 31st career cut for Couples, trailing only Jack Nicklaus’ record of 37.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nPlay has resumed at Masters\n\nSome of the golfers who have yet to complete their second round have hit the course at the Masters on Saturday after play was suspended on Friday due to inclement weather. Tee times have not been posted for the third round.\n\nAnother LIV golfer withdraws\n\nA second golfer who plays on the LIV tour has withdrawn from the Masters. Louis Oosthuizen, who has one PGA Tour win, the 2010 British Open, won't finish the weekend due to injury.\n\nThe South African completed 17 holes of his second round and finished at 7-over, mostly likely missing the cut anyway. Kevin Na, a fellow LIV golfer, withdrew after nine holes on Thursday.\n\nSix other LIV golfers, including four who haven't completed their second round, are in danger of missing the cut, based on the projected cut line of 2-over.\n\nAugusta National takes big risk after trees crash down at Masters\n\nAugusta National Golf Club and the Masters got very lucky Friday afternoon when the three trees that crashed to the ground near the 17th hole missed dozens of fans gathered nearby.\n\nYet no more than 90 minutes after the incident, the Masters announced that ticket gates for spectators would open as scheduled Saturday morning at 7 a.m. In other words, fans will be back on the grounds in droves and it will be business as usual at the first men’s major golf tournament of the year.\n\nClearly, the leaders of Augusta National are gambling that in the midst of severe weather that is expected to continue throughout Friday evening, including heavy rain and high winds, all their other trees — thousands of them — are safe and stable and nothing like this will happen again.\n\n— Christine Brennan\n\nHow to watch the Masters on Saturday\n\nESPN is set to air the restarted second round action beginning at 8 a.m. ET. CBS will have live coverage of the Masters from 3 p.m.-7 p.m. ET.\n\nThe resumption of the second round and the third round can be live streamed at CBSSports.com, ESPN+, Paramount+, Masters Live and the CBS Sports app.\n\nWhat time does the Masters resume on Saturday?\n\nThe second round is scheduled to resume at 8 a.m. ET Saturday morning, with the third round to follow — though more rain and storms are in the forecast for the entirety of the day.\n\nKoepka is back in championship form at the Masters\n\nBrooks Koepka is back. But given which side of the professional golf schism he landed on, you better catch him while you can.\n\nEven if Koepka wins this Masters for his fifth major championship — and it’s looking pretty good with a three-shot lead in the clubhouse when officials suspended the round due to inclement weather — the next time you’ll see him (or won't see him, more likely) will be later this month in Adelaide, Australia, or the following week in Singapore. Back to the easy, breezy LIV Golf anti-grind that is so obviously beneath his talent and incapable of satisfying his hunger to be remembered as one of the greats of all time.\n\nIt would be a welcome development if golf has entered a second era where Koepka feels like a threat every time he tees it up at a big event. He’s that electric of a player and competitor. But in golf’s current fractured state, he only gets four chances a year to beat the players he most wants to beat.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nWhat other LIV Golf players are projected to make the cut?\n\nWith the cut line currently standing at 2-over par, 10 members of the LIV Golf Series would make the cut as things stand entering Saturday.\n\nKoepka, of course, is a shoo-in, and Phil Mickelson and Joaquin Niemann are in excellent shape after finishing their second rounds at 4-under. Patrick Reed also sat at 4-under with four holes remaining in his second round, while Cameron Smith was 2-under through eight holes.\n\nDustin Johnson and Harold Varner III both finished their second rounds at 1-under, Abraham Ancer is 1-under with six holes remaining, Mito Pereira was Even following the second round and Talor Gooch was 1-over with just the 18th hole to play.\n\nWhat is the Masters cut rule?\n\nThe Masters will pare down the field after the conclusion of the second round, with the low 50 players and ties qualifying for the final 36 holes.\n\nJack Nicklaus holds the record for most Masters cuts made with 37, followed by Fred Couples and Gary Player who each made the cut 30 times.\n\n— Fletcher Page, Augusta Chronicle\n\nMcIlroy crashes out at Masters, misses cut\n\nNo exit at the 2023 Masters is more surprising than that of Rory McIlroy.\n\nAs he heads home to Florida, McIlroy, who needs only a Masters win to complete the career grand slam, will be burning with fury — though not at others — after carding a 5-over through two rounds and missing the cut. He sets a high standard for himself and at Augusta National, he fell woefully short.\n\nThe world No. 2 has missed only two cuts since the 2022 Masters. One came at the FedEx St. Jude Championship in August, and he went on to win the PGA Tour’s $18 million playoff prize two weeks later. The other was last month at the Players Championship, which he followed with a strong third-place showing at the WGC-Match Play. He won’t yet care what will follow this Masters disappointment.\n\n— Eamon Lynch", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2023/05/22/brooks-koepka-captures-pga-championship-exorcising-demons/70242570007/", "title": "How Brooks Koepka overcame injuries, thoughts of retirement to ...", "text": "There have been long and hard moments over the past couple years when Brooks Koepka wondered whether he would ever get to experience the incredible week he just had on his way to winning the 2023 PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club.\n\nEver since he won his last major championship at the 2019 PGA, there had been nothing but grimness for the 33-year-old from West Palm Beach, Florida, and no, banking a reported $100 million to defect from the PGA Tour to LIV Golf, and even winning two events on that controversial circuit, did not quell his concerns about where his golf career was headed.\n\nHe endured a torn patella tendon in August 2019, a hip injury in 2020, and a terribly serious knee injury that included a broken knee cap in March 2021 which, at the time, had him thinking he would never again return to the form he needed over these four days to slay the treacherous beast called the East Course.\n\nNow, those doubts are a thing of the past. Koepka is back, and while it’s a shame we won’t get to see him play on the PGA Tour, there are always the majors, and that’s when he’s usually at his best anyway.\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up to get the latest news and features sent to your inbox\n\nLive Leaderboard: PGA Championship Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\n\"Yeah, this one is definitely special,\" Koepka said after he raised the weighty Wanamaker Trophy above his head as a massive, sun-baked, golf-worshiping gallery roared its approval late Sunday afternoon. \"I think this one is probably the most meaningful of them all with everything that’s gone on, all the crazy stuff over the last few years.\"\n\nHe opened the tournament with a ho-hum 72, then got hot in the middle with back-to-back 4-under-par 66s which put him into the third-round lead, one shot ahead of Viktor Hovland.\n\nAnd then, like the Koepka of old, he was a killer on the final day. He shot an excitingly volatile 67 that included seven birdies and four bogeys which made for an absolutely thrilling final round of action.\n\nWell, at least through 15 holes. With the tournament heading for what could have been a truly spectacular finish, we were robbed of that thanks to what happened to poor Hovland on the 16th hole. Trailing Koepka by just one stroke, he drove into the bunker on the right, then plugged his second shot into the grass face and ultimately settled for a sickening double bogey that gave Koepka an insurmountable four-stroke lead, essentially securing his victory.\n\n\"Just didn’t get out of the bunker,\" said a deeply disappointed Hovland, who finished in a second-place tie with world No. 2 player, Scottie Scheffler. \"Plugged in the lip and tried to get a drop and made a double bogey.\"\n\nIt was an appallingly terrible break, and what made it so incredible is that it mirrored exactly what happened to Corey Conners on Saturday. And when I say exactly, I mean exactly. Same spot in the bunker, same club trying to get out, same spot where the ball embedded, same double-bogey 6.\n\nThere will be 400 major championships played in the next 100 years, and we may never see a situation like that in terms of how uncannily similar the nightmare played out for both Hovland and Conners.\n\n\"I couldn’t see what was going on, but I had a pretty good idea,\" said Koepka, who sure didn’t seem too sympathetic about it. \"It was buried under the lip, which was unfortunate. Took a couple minutes to figure out the drop and just figure out what was going on.\"\n\nPerhaps it wouldn’t have mattered if Hovland had just parred the hole, but who knows how the final two holes would have played out if Koepka had only a two-stroke lead instead of a four-stroke cushion?\n\nAlas, we’ll never know. But we do know is this. A fully healthy and focused Koepka makes him a threat to win any major championship he plays in. He flashed all of the talent and determination that had led to his previous four major championship victories in the span of 22 months from 2017-19 and his being the No. 1-ranked player in the official world golf ranking for 44 weeks.\n\n\"Brooks is a great player, and now he has five majors,\" Hovland said. \"I mean, that’s a hell of a record right there. It’s not easy going toe-to-toe with a guy like that. He is not going to give you anything, and I didn’t really feel like I gave him anything either until 16.\"\n\nEven as recently as the Masters, Koepka was wondering where his game was headed. He blew a four-shot lead late in the third round and then shot 75 on Sunday at Augusta which allowed Jon Rahm to win. Koepka said he learned a big lesson that day about mental preparation and attitude, and he said he applied those lessons this week.\n\n\"I don’t think I win today if that didn’t happen, right?\" said Koepka, who became the first LIV player to win a major. \"Definitely take it and keep using it going forward for each event, each major, any time I’m in contention, but I’m not going to share. I can’t give away all the secrets.\"\n\nCan’t blame him for that.\n\nBut he was willing to share how difficult it was to overcome his health issues and to get back to the top of the mountain.\n\n\"It’s tough, it’s very hard to explain,\" he said. \"You can’t fathom how difficult it is just to get going. I mean, it was a lot worse than I let on to you guys, let on to everybody. Maybe only five, six people really know the extent of it, and it was hard. Cold weather, it was achy. The swelling didn’t go down until maybe a couple months ago.\n\n\"A couple years ago, I was just lost. Didn't know where my golf swing was; didn't know physically if I was capable of getting back to where I was. I don't know if I considered retiring, but I knew … if I couldn't play the way I wanted to play, then I was definitely going to give it up. I mean, the thought definitely kind of crossed my mind.\"\n\nSuffice to say, those thoughts are gone.\n\nODDS BOOST:Add +1000 on golfer of your choice to win any tournament\n\nSal Maiorana can be reached at maiorana@gannett.com.

Last year's winner Scottie Scheffler and three-time champ Phil Mickelson are also among the stars in the field, which includes both PGA Tour and LIV golfers.\n\nFollow along for the latest action, leaderboard updates, highlights and more.\n\nLive Leaderboard: PGA Championship Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nTEE TIMES: Pairings for Thursday's first round\n\nHow did Tiger Woods do today at the Masters?\n\nPlaying in his first competitive round since mid-February, Tiger Woods posted an uneven first round at Augusta National. Through his first seven holes, Woods recorded four pars and three bogeys, before he recorded his first birdie at No. 8.\n\nWoods had played well off the tee with his drives mostly finding the fairways. His approach irons and putter was where he was let down, often leaving himself longer putts; he averaged 1.78 putts per hole in the first round.\n\nOn the back nine, Woods bogeyed No. 11, before posting three consecutive pars. He then came on late, notching back-to-back birdies on Nos. 15 and 16. He bogeyed the final hole of the round to finish 2-over par (74). That has him — as of 4 p.m. ET — tied for 54th and hovering around the cut line, which will see the top 50 players (including ties) after the second round moving on.\n\nNotable Round 2 tee times\n\nTiger Woods will return to Augusta National for Round 2 at 12:54 p.m. ET. He'll be featured in Group 27 with co-leader Viktor Hovland, who shot 7-under (65).\n\nCo-leader Jon Rahm will tee off shortly after in Group 29 at 1:18 p.m. ET, while fellow co-leader Brooks Koepka will get started earlier in the day at 8:18 a.m. ET in Group 5.\n\nA full list of Round 2 tee times here.\n\nMASTERS:Tee times, TV, streaming info for Friday's second round at Augusta National\n\nJordan Spieth wraps up Round 1 with clutch putt to save par\n\nSpieth preserved his 3-under (69) with a clutch putt on No. 18. He finished his first round with a par putt after finding the fairway bunker on his first stroke. That’s good enough for 14th place, where he’s tied with three other golfers. It could’ve been worse after he shot a double bogey on hole No. 13. He also had 2 bogeys and seven birdies on the day.\n\nScottie Scheffler tied for sixth after one round; rookie Sam Bennett hangs with him\n\nDefending champion Scottie Scheffler got off to a good start on No. 18, hitting a 295-drive up the middle of the fairway. But a missed putt squandered a birdie. He finished No. 18 with a par, ending the first round 4-under (68). He’s one of seven players tied for sixth place.\n\nAmerican amateur Sam Bennett, who was in the same feature group as Scheffler, matched the defending champion at 4-under (68) and is also tied for sixth place. Not bad for the 23-year-old's first-ever Masters appearance.\n\nJordan Spieth and Tony Finau miss eagles on No. 15\n\nJordan Spieth and Tony Finau had a chance to make up some ground on No. 15, but they both missed an eagle opportunity by the slimmest of margins. Finau's putt came up just short and Spieth veered slightly to the right. They both finished with a birdie.\n\nFinau had a similar hiccup on No. 16. He putted for birdie, but the ball rolled right over the hole. He finished at par, keeping him at 3-under par.\n\nJason Day seals clean round with key par putt on 18; Scottie Scheffler hanging around\n\nJason Day, over his last three rounds at the Masters, had shot a combined 15-over par. Thursday, in his first round at the 87th Masters, Day played bogey-free golf and notched five birdies to finish the day 5-under (67). He's one of two players tied for fourth.\n\nMeanwhile, defending champion Scottie Scheffler hasn't had the most efficient round, needing to scramble at times to save par. Scheffler, however, is staying well within striking distance, currently at 4-under par (and tied for sixth) after birdies on Nos. 13 and 15.\n\nScheffler's tee shot on the gettable par-3 16th, though, fell long of the pin and left him some considerable work for another birdie.\n\nJordan Spieth, unraveling, finds the water ... twice in Amen Corner\n\nJordan Spieth, who raced out to a score of 4-under par through 10 holes, has started to unravel a bit on Amen Corner. Spieth bogeyed No. 11, which was actually a favorable outcome because he found the water and scrambled to keep the damage minimal.\n\nBut on No. 13, on his approach shot from the pine straw, Spieth chose an aggressive play and tried to make the green. His shot didn't get enough loft and bounced short of the green, eventually finding the creek. He had to work to set up a shorter bogey putt, which he misread, forcing a tap-in for double-bogey.\n\nAfter dropping three strokes in as many holes, Spieth now sits at 1-under par, in a tie for 27th.\n\nLIV Golf's Koepka takes co-lead spot with birdie on 18\n\nJoining a pair of European players in Viktor Hovland and John Rahm atop the leaderboard, Brooks Koepka concluded his first round in a co-lead with them at 7-under par (65). Koepka, one of the star acquisitions of the LIV Golf tour, shot up the leaderboard with birdies on three of his final four holes (Nos. 15, 16 and 18).\n\nThey find themselves two strokes up on the next closest players.\n\nKoepka is one of 18 players — including six past Masters champions — from the LIV tour who accepted invitations to play this week at Augusta National. Koepka is seeking his first green jacket. A victory by a LIV Golf player would certainly present an interesting, if awkward, moment for Augusta National and the PGA Tour, which are named in an antitrust lawsuit LIV filed in August 2022.\n\nRory gets back to even par; Koepka representing LIV Golf well\n\nWorld Golf No. 2 player Rory McIlroy's first round at the Masters has been all over the place. He birdied No. 2, bogeyed No. 3, got a double bogey on No. 7 and then birdied two of his latest three holes — Nos 8 and 10 — to climb back to even-par.\n\nAs far as the LIV Golf players in the field, Brooks Koepka has been far and away the top player. He is just one stroke off the lead as he starts the final hole of his first round. Koepka actually had a makeable birdie putt at No. 16 that just missed the pin.\n\nJordan Spieth rebounds from bogey on No. 5\n\n2015 Masters champion Jordan Spieth had a solid front-9 and is currently sitting at 4-under par through 10 holes. Spieth had dropped a stroke at No. 5 but has otherwise played cleanly, converting five birdies, on Nos. 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8.\n\nDrizzle starts to fall; Scheffler finishes front-9\n\nThe first round has seen warm and humid — though mostly dry — conditions at Augusta National. Coupled with rain earlier in the week, the greens have been amenable to low scoring, but after 4 p.m. ET hit, a slight drizzle started to fall. As of yet, it hasn't appeared to affect conditions, but as the forecast the rest of the weekend is projected rain, it will continue to bear watching.\n\nDefending champion Scottie Scheffler posted a clean and efficient, bogey-free front nine. An eagle at No. 2 and a birdie at No. 9 has him sitting at 3-under par at the turn.\n\nAlso making the turn is one of Scheffler's playing partners Thursday, amateur Sam Bennett, who has excelled in his Masters debut, and is actually outpacing Scheffler, currently at 4-under. That score ties him for the lowest-ever front nine score for an amateur at the Masters.\n\nViktor Hovland on his shirt\n\nCurrently tied atop the leaderboard, Viktor Hovland caught some attention for something else on Thursday, his colorful shirt that featured an oversized bright pink flower.\n\n\"I had nothing to do with it,\" Hovland said after his first round. \"I just wear what they tell me to wear. It’s definitely a little bit out there, but I’d rather take these than the pink pants I had last year.\"\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nA couple of low scores atop the leaderboard\n\nA pair of players, Viktor Hovland of Norway and John Rahm of Spain, have opened up a two-stroke lead on the rest of the field. Both Hovland and Rahm are tied atop the leaderboard at 7-under par (65).\n\nHovland blistered out of the gate, picking up an eagle on No. 2 and then birdies on Nos. 6, 8, 9, 11 and 13. His pace slowed, however, as he had to scramble for five consecutive pars to close his round.\n\nRahm was the opposite story; he double-bogeyed No. 1 and then slowly chipped away, going bogey-free the rest of the way. Rahm birdied four of his last six holes to climb into a tie with Hovlan\n\nWoods gains a stroke with bogey at 18, ends round at 2-over par\n\nTiger Woods had to manage a difficult second shot at No. 18, shooting out of an uneasy stance in which his left foot was on the first cut and his right foot was in a bunker. That shot eventually found a green-side bunker, from which he also had to navigate a tough stance. He set himself up with a challenging, but doable par putt that he pushed just left with too much pace.\n\nThat means Woods will have some work to do Friday, as he finishes his first round at 2-over-par (74). That left him hanging around the cut line, which will see the top 50 players, including ties, after the second round advance.\n\nAs warm and humid conditions have remained at Augusta National, scoring chances are available. John Rahm, the third-ranked player in the World Golf Rankings, made consecutive birdies at No. 15 and 16 to move up the board. A lenghty birdie putt at 17 left him with a tap-in par.\n\nRahm is currently second overall at 6-under par, one stroke behind leader Viktor Hovland, who finished his round at 7-under.\n\nTiger makes it two in a row\n\nAfter muddling through the middle of the back-9, Tiger Woods bridied his second-consecutive hole at the par-3 No. 16. His tee shot left him a manageable putt just left of the hole.\n\nWoods also converted par on the 17th hole, keeping him 1-over on the day.\n\nTiger gets second birdie of the day at No. 15\n\nThough Tiger Woods's approach iron again, following the trend of his opening round, left him a difficult birdie opportunity at No. 15, he recorded his second birdie of his Masters with a challenging but confidently-taken putt. The putt broke from left to right, but Woods read it perfectly and now sits at 2-over par, with three holes left to play. He had previously recorded his first birdie at No. 8.\n\nViktor Hovland remains the overall leader at 7-under par after notching birdie-par-par at Nos. 13, 14 and\n\nOf the LIV Golf players, Brooks Koepka is the one who has performed best thus far, recording consecutive birdies at Nos. 7 and 8. Koepka finished the front-nine bogey-free and is 4-under par.\n\nElsewhere, amateur Sam Bennett of Texas A&M has showed he's ready for the big stage. At No. 1, Bennett drained a putt of about 15 feet and then chipped in at No. 2 to start with a birdie-eagle. He parred at No. 3 and is at 3-under.\n\nDefending champ Scottie Scheffler races off to hot start; Tiger stays unsteady\n\nAfter kicking off his Masters title defense at No. 1 with a steady par, Scottie Scheffler's approach shot on the par-5 second hole, from about 245 yards, landed softly on the green within five feet. It set up a tap-in eagle meaning that — already — Scheffler has done something he didn't do last year when he won the green jacket: record an eagle.\n\nAt No. 14, Tiger Woods continued his uneven play, landing his tee shot in the rough. Though he eventually saved par — after his approach shot hit the branch of a pine and kicked out just in front of the green — Woods remains at 3-over par and needs to shave some strokes off his score if he is to make a move in the first round.\n\nScottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy start first round; Woods still at 3-over\n\nThe star power continues to make their way to the first tee, as defending champion Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy start their first rounds.\n\nTiger Woods' last three holes on No. 10, 11 and 12 were par-bogey-par.\n\nWill Zalatoris withdraws from Masters\n\nWill Zalatoris became the second golfer to withdraw from the tournament on Thursday after leaving the course minutes before his tee time. This time, it is due to a back injury.\n\nHe also withdrew from the WGC-Dell Match Play with a stomach bug and said he felt great heading into the Masters, even though he lost seven pounds due to the illness.\n\nTiger bogeys 11, now at 3-over\n\nTiger Woods missed a birdie opportunity from 17 feet on the 10th, as the shot just missed and he also got off to a good start on 11 with the driver but missed the green, hit a bunker, and had to settle for bogey. Woods is now 3-over through 11 holes.\n\nViktor Hovland still maintains the lead at 6-under. Cameron Young and Jon Rahm are at 3-under. Eight others, including four-time major champion Brooks Koepka and Fred Couples, the 1992 winner, are four shots off the lead.\n\nWoods finishes front nine at 2-over, Hovland increases lead\n\nTiger Woods finished his first nine holes with a 38, good for a score of 2-over with a birdie-par finish.\n\nPhil Mickelson went par on his first hole, but Viktor Hovland made two straight birdies at No. 8 and 9 and now is at 5-under for the tournament, good for a two-shot lead. Scott Stallings has completed his round and is at 2-under after a birdie on No. 18.\n\nTiger hits first birdie, Phil Mickelson tees off, Hovland takes lead\n\nOne of the early storylines of the tournament is how well the golfers on the LIV tour will do in the tour's first major. One golfer, Kevin Na, has already withdrawn from the Masters after only finishing nine holes. Phil Mickelson, one of the most popular players on the LIV Tour, has teed off for his first round.\n\nWoods finally got on the right side of a hole and birdied the par 5 No. 8 and now is at 2-over.\n\nOn the leaderboard, Viktor Hovland has a one-shot lead at 4-under over Shane Lowry.\n\nTiger Woods 3-over through 7 holes\n\nWoods had a chance to get his first birdie but instead two-putted the par-3 sixth. On the seventh, he was 20 feet from a birdie shot but again ended the hole with a bogey. He is struggling and now sits at 3-over-par.\n\nViktor Hovland has joined Cameron Young at the top of the leaderboard at 3-under after he birdied the par-3 sixth hole. Canada's Mike Weir was the first golfer to finish his round as his playing partner Kevin Na withdrew earlier in the tournament. Weir finished his round with a 72, good for even par.\n\nTiger Woods struggling, Cameron Young surges to lead\n\nCameron Young, who is making his second Masters appearance, birdied his first three holes and is leading the way early.\n\nThe scores are slowly falling as now there are seven golfers within striking range at 2-under, including 2013 Masters champion Adam Scott, and Sergio Garcia, the 2017 champion.\n\nWoods continues to chug along and after bogeying the 5th hole, now sits at 2-over.\n\nSurprising leaders at the top, Tiger 1-over through three holes\n\nAdrian Meronk from Poland has two bogeys and two birdies and is currently 2-under.

Koepka managed one birdie and five pars during the miserable cold and rain over his first six holes of the third round to reach 13-under-par for the tournament, four better than Rahm, who had a birdie, two bogeys and three pars.\n\nLive Leaderboard: PGA Championship Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nRahm, 28, had the misfortunate of bearing the brunt of the bad weather both Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, while Koepka luckily finished his second round before the weather turned ugly Friday and didn’t have to return to the course until the third round began.\n\nNow they both face a very long, intense journey Sunday.\n\n“I'm not too concerned about playing 29 holes or however many holes we've got left,” said Koepka, who won four majors from 2017-19 but has dealt with a series of injuries to his right knee the past few years. “It’s part of the deal. I'm pretty sure I'll be up for it considering it is the Masters. So I don't think anybody should have a problem with that.”\n\nThen again, 29 or 30 holes of golf in one day is a lot for a man who now enjoys the no-cut, exhibition-style, 54-hole lifestyle of the Saudi-backed LIV circuit — albeit a man who is believed to not be the happiest golfer in the LIV stable.\n\nMASTERS ROUNDUP:Play suspended due to weather; Tiger Woods sits in last place\n\nIf he had been as healthy last year when he left for the far-less-competitive LIV life as he is right now, he was asked, would his decision to bolt from the PGA Tour been more challenging?\n\n“Honestly, yeah, probably, if I'm being completely honest,” Koepka said. “I think it would have been. But I'm happy with the decision I made.”\n\nKoepka and 17 other golfers who arrived at this week’s Masters left their regular tour jobs to go into the “sportswashing” business with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, the mastermind of the killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, as well as his golf-bro buddies in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the nation responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States and abysmal human rights violations against women and the LGBTQ community.\n\nOne golfer who was adamant that he would never leave the PGA Tour for LIV’s ridiculously fat paychecks is Rahm.\n\n“Shotgun (start), three days to me is not a golf tournament. No cut. It's that simple,\" Rahm said. \"I want to play against the best in the world in a format that's been going on for hundreds of years.\n\n\"I've never really played the game of golf for monetary reasons. I play for the love of the game, and I want to play against the best in the world. I've always been interested in history and legacy, and right now, the PGA Tour has that.”\n\nRahm, ranked No. 3 in the world, has one major title, the 2021 U.S. Open. Koepka, ranked 118th in the world, has won two U.S. Opens and two PGA Championships.\n\nThere’s still a long way to go, but it’s likely one of those two will be donning a green jacket Sunday evening. Augusta National officials could have banned all the LIV golfers from competing here, but refused to do so.

Woods has made 22 consecutive cuts at the Masters, the longest active streak and second-longest in history.\n\nPlay was been briefly delayed with severe weather in the area, but the action resumed about a half hour after the horns blew at Augusta National.\n\nTemperatures were expected to drop in the late afternoon and early evening hours with winds having shifted and now coming out of the northeast.\n\nPlay suspended as Rory McIlroy finishes +5, likely to miss cut\n\nPlay was suspended during the second round of the Masters shortly after 3 p.m. ET due to a weather warning. Raindrops had been falling and ominous clouds and more severe weather was in the area.\n\nIt was not immediately known when or if play would resume Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, world No. 2 Rory McIlroy shot a 5-over 77 and is likely to miss the cut sitting at 5-over for the tournament. The cut is expected to be around +1 or +2. McIlroy is still seeking his first Masters win, which would make him just the fifth golfer all-time to complete a career grand slam.\n\nTiger Woods was on the fringe at 3-over for the tournament and was playing the ninth hole when play was suspended.\n\nScheffler shoots worst round of Masters career; amateur making it look easy\n\nDefending Masters champion Scottie Scheffler shot a 3-over 75 in a disappointing second round for the World No. 1.

The five-time winner was tied for 54th at 2-over entering the day and likely has some work to do in order to be safe from the weekend cut.\n\nMeanwhile, defending champion Scottie Scheffler saw his frustrating Friday continue by posting a double-bogey on No. 9. He was 2-under through 11 holes.\n\nAmateur Sam Bennett birdied No. 9 to move to 6-under for the tournament, just six strokes off leader Brooks Koepka, who shot a 5-under 67 Friday.

The 26-year-old missed multiple mid-range birdie putts along the way and now sits at 4-under for the tournament and even for the day.\n\nBrooks Koepka continued his second-round charge and leads the Masters at 12-under through 15 holes. Jason Day was making a charge Friday and sits second at 8-under through 10.\n\nMcIlroy struggling early; Spieth, Morikawa moving up leaderboard\n\nWhile Brooks Koepka maintains a four-shot lead after a birdie on No. 13, others are trying to make a push to join him at the top.\n\nCollin Morikawa and Jordan Spieth are each two-under for the day, for a score of 5-under while Rory McIlroy is two-over after back-to-back bogeys and is 12 back of the leader. Jason Day completed his front nine and is four off the pace at 7-under.\n\nThe projected cut line is at 2-over.\n\nJason Day making a charge, Brooks Koepka now at 10-under\n\nAfter making par on the first hole, Day has surged into a tie for second with two straight birdies on No. 2 and 3. Viktor Hovland and Jon Rahm are also at 7-under but will take the course Friday afternoon when it is expected that the weather will start to take a turn for the worst. Justin Rose and Zach Johnson are among 12 players that have played under par in the early portion of the second round.\n\nKoepka has had his way with Par 5's in the second round, making an eagle on the Par 5 No. 10 and now is three shots clear of the second-place place golfers.\n\nKoepka increases lead\n\nBrooks Koepka is trying to make sure he is among the leaders before the expected weather hits, which is sure to make things difficult for players who are teeing off later. Koepka saved par on three of the first four holes and took advantage of the par-5 second hole by making birdie to take the outright lead.\n\nOthers who have teed off in the second round include Phil Mickelson, Gary Woodland and Jason Day.\n\nWhat time does Tiger Woods tee off today?\n\nTiger Woods tees off his second round at 12:54 p.m. ET alongside two players at the top of the leaderboard after Thursday's first round.\n\nCo-leader Viktor Hovland was tied with Jon Rahm and Brooks Koepka at 7-under par to start the day.

He had eight birdies, nine par, and one bogey during his first round. He started his second round with one of the earlier tee times and settled for par on the first hole to remain at 7-under.\n\nThe weather is not expected to be pleasant Friday afternoon, so officials have bumped tee times up 30 minutes. Jose María Olazabal and Cameron Champ will get the second round started at 7:30 a.m. ET.\n\nHere's the complete list of tee times for Friday's second round.\n\nThere were 18 LIV golfers in the 2023 Masters field, six of whom have previously won a Green Jacket.\n\nHere are those golfers and how they fared during the first round:\n\nPhil Mickelson (2004, 2006, 2010 Masters champion) — 1 under, tied for 26th\n\nBubba Watson (2012, 2014 champ) — 5 over, tied for 78th\n\nDustin Johnson (2020 champ) — 1 under, tied for 26th\n\nPatrick Reed (2018 champ) — 1 under, tied for 26th\n\nSergio Garcia (2017 champ) — 2 over, tied for 54th\n\nCharl Schwartzel (2011 champ) — 2 over, tied for 54th\n\nBrooks Koepka — 7 under, tied for lead\n\nBryson DeChambeau — 2 over, tied for 54th\n\nCameron Smith — 2 under, tied for 17th\n\nLouis Oosthuizen — 4 over, tied for 73rd\n\nMito Pereira — 2 over, tied for 54th\n\nJoaquin Niemann — 1 under, tied for 26th\n\nKevin Na — withdrew after nine holes due to illness\n\nAbraham Ancer — even par, tied for 37th\n\nThomas Pieters — 2 over, tied for 54th\n\nHarold Varner III — even par, tied for 37th\n\nJason Kokrak — 1 over, tied for 45th\n\nTalor Gooch — even par, tied for 37th\n\nWhile the PGA Tour considers the Masters an official event, the field is determined by the Augusta National Golf Club and is by invitation only. That means LIV golfers can compete in the tournament.\n\nThe Masters will pare down the field after Friday's second round, with the low 50 players and ties qualifying for the final 36 holes.\n\nJack Nicklaus holds the record for most Masters cuts made with 37, followed by Fred Couples and Gary Player who each made the cut 30 times.\n\n— Fletcher Page, Augusta Chronicle", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columns/gene-frenette/2022/04/11/masters-champ-scottie-scheffler-next-rising-golf-star-trying-stay-top/9536283002/", "title": "Masters champ Scottie Scheffler next rising golf star trying to stay on ...", "text": "The golf world is rightfully showering praise on Scottie Scheffler, who got a firm grip on The Masters lead before the halfway point of the tournament and never let it go.\n\nHe deserves to bask in the glow of being the sixth player in golf history to win any major while being ranked No. 1 in the world, joining the exclusive company of Tiger Woods, who did it 11 times, Dustin Johnson (2020 Masters), Rory McIlroy (2014 PGA), Fred Couples (1992 Masters) and Ian Woosnam (1991 Masters).\n\nThe question moving forward for the 25-year-old Scheffler, the seventh 20-something to ascend to No. 1 in the last 11 years, is whether golf’s latest shooting star — four wins in his last six events — can keep this phenomenal run going.\n\nPlenty of young guns have risen to the top in the fourth quarter of the Tiger era. The challenge is staying there. With the exception of Rory McIlroy, who rose up to shoot a Masters career-best 64 Sunday to finish second, every one of them have found it difficult to sustain elite performances on a major stage.\n\nMcIlroy didn’t fade away after first ascending to No. 1 in the world at age 22 a decade ago. After winning the 2014 PGA Championship, he stayed No. 1 for another full calendar year, but hadn’t been in legitimate back-nine Sunday contention at a major since the 2018 Open championship.\n\nLive Leaderboard: PGA Championship Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nGene's previous three columns\n\nWho will they take?:What Trent Baalke does with Cam Robinson could impact Jaguars' No. 1 pick, GM's future\n\nStill on the prowl:Tiger will eventually be reserving closet space for a sixth Masters green jacket\n\nTough to replace:FSU play-by-play voice Gene Deckerhoff will be tough act to follow\n\nNot that McIlroy, who holed out from the bunker on the 18th hole to get within three shots of Scheffler, was much of a threat to earn that elusive green jacket. This was his seventh top-10 finish in his last nine Masters appearances, but he never got close enough near the end to put pressure on the leader.\n\nFrankly, McIlroy has only shown brief glimpses of the form that carried him to wins at The Players Championship and Tour Championship in 2019.\n\n“It was just nice to feel that buzz in a major championship again,” said McIlroy. “It’s been a while since I felt that, and I think the last time was trying to make the cut at an Open Championship, was the last time I felt a buzz like that in a major. So this was certainly better than that.”\n\nStill, nobody envisioned after McIlroy won the 2014 PGA at age 25 that, almost eight years later, he would continue to be stuck on four majors.\n\nScheffler shows almost as much promise at the same age that McIlroy did then. Just remember, stardom is rarely as fickle or fleeting in any sport as it is in golf.\n\nNo Tiger 2.0 coming\n\nOne by one, 20-somethings like Scheffler who soared to the top and were earmarked for all-time greatness tend to take a step back, making all of us realize why there’ll never be another Tiger.\n\nYou know the names — Jordan Spieth, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas, Jason Day, Martin Kaymer and Jon Rahm, who just lost the No. 1 ranking to Scheffler two weeks ago. All of them had those moments on a major stage and made you think their magic at such a young age would carry them to sustained success. Not that they can't get there again.\n\nRahm undoubtedly has the game to go on a tear like Scheffler is on now. Nobody would be surprised to see Thomas or Koepka regain their best form, but nobody is going to be Tiger 2.0. It’s just too taxing to stay king of the hill for as long as he did.\n\nSpieth certainly had a special run in 2015, winning five tournaments, including a Masters and U.S. Open among them. Then he captured the ‘17 Open and with three major trophies on his mantle at age 23, there was talk of him being the next Woods.\n\nWell, Spieth has won all of one tournament since then, fell to nearly 100 in the world rankings (he's currently No. 20) and shockingly just missed his first Masters cut. Kaymer won the Players and U.S. Open a month apart in 2015. He’s won nothing since then and his world ranking is down to No. 170.\n\nKoepka had the look of a sure thing when he captured four majors in an eight-major stretch in 2018 and ‘19, pulling off the rare feat of winning back-to-back U.S. Opens and PGA Championships. By no means has he drifted into oblivion, but Koepka has dropped to No. 16 in the world and just missed his second consecutive Masters cut.\n\nLike Scheffler, another player that got to No. 1 at age 25 is Thomas, who has been a top-10 fixture since winning the 2018 PGA. He finished a respectable tie for eighth at the Masters, and validated his status as a great player by winning last year’s Players.\n\nIt’s just that Thomas, like so many of his accomplished young peers, has discovered the daunting challenge of living up to the Tiger standard. Yes, he won with amazing regularity, but Woods also had such a relentless competitive drive, he never seemed to grow weary of the pressure to stay on top.\n\nTiger’s appetite for winning never diminished through multiple back surgeries or calamities in his personal life. He just refused to fade away, winning the 2019 Masters for his 15th major.\n\nDespite Woods’ unprecedented 78-78 weekend finish that left him in a tie for 47th at this year’s Masters, it was no embarrassment. Considering this was his first full tournament a year after a car accident left doctors questioning if he’d walk again, just grinding for 72 holes on the hilly Augusta National layout was a positive first step toward maybe one more stupendous final act.\n\nAll the roars this time for Tiger at Augusta National were out of appreciation for his gutsy effort. It also served as a reminder to Scheffler and every player who ever occupied that No. 1 spot of something else: the weight of carrying that burden.\n\nScheffler’s turn under the gun\n\nThe meteoric rise of Scheffler, who was ranked 61st in the world as recently as June, 2020, has been rather breathtaking. He's now more than two full points ahead of Collin Morikawa in the latest OWGR.\n\nUntil he won the Phoenix Open in February, he was 0-for-69 in professional starts. Sandwiched around a tie for 55th at the Players, Scheffler won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play and now a green jacket.\n\nScheffler gave the world a potential sneak preview of his potential when he dominated Rahm at the Ryder Cup, winning 4-and-3 in Sunday singles and also won his only other match in 4-ball.\n\nBut who besides Tiger, and also Day in 2015, wins four times in six starts? That’s a pretty insane stretch of golf, especially when two of the wins come at a WGC match-play event and The Masters.\n\nScheffler has been so good for going on two years that, since the 2020 PGA Championship, his 36-under-par score over the last seven majors is better than the next-best player by seven shots.\n\nThat still didn’t keep him from questioning on Sunday morning whether his game, dominant as it has been lately and remained throughout Masters week, was good enough to hold up.\n\n“I cried like a baby this morning, I was so stressed out,” Scheffler said. “I didn’t know what to do. I was sitting there telling [wife] Meredith, ‘I don’t think I’m ready for this, I’m not ready, I don’t feel like I’m ready for this kind of stuff,’ and I just felt overwhelmed.”\n\nBeing on the verge of winning a first Masters or a major of any kind can do that. Scheffler better get used to the spotlight being on him. He kind of slid under the radar at Augusta National as a world No. 1 because of all the Tiger attention, but what anonymity he had is gone now.\n\nThe pressure will turn up significantly at next month’s PGA Championship, then the U.S. Open and Open Championship. A bunch of former No. 1s, as well as two-time major champion and third-ranked Collin Morikawa (fifth at Masters), plus Scheffler’s biggest Masters challenger in Ponte Vedra Beach resident Cameron Smith (No. 5) from Australia, will be aiming to take him down a peg.\n\nScottie Scheffler is about to learn how difficult staying on top of the golf world can really be.\n\nGfrenette@jacksonville.com: (904) 359-4540\n\nGene Frenette Sports columnist at Florida Times-Union, follow him on Twitter @genefrenette", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/brennan/2023/04/09/jon-rahm-masters-win-augusta-no-liv-koepka-mickelson/11633234002/", "title": "Jon Rahm's Masters win saves Augusta from embarrassment of LIV ...", "text": "AUGUSTA, Ga. — Here’s a message from the leaders of men’s golf, especially Augusta National Golf Club, for Spain’s Jon Rahm:\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you for winning the Masters so LIV Golf didn’t.\n\nThank you, they all must be saying, for saving us from ourselves.\n\nRahm rescued Augusta National from the ignominy of having to put a green jacket on LIV Golf escapee Brooks Koepka, currently suspended by the PGA Tour, who led by four strokes when the day began and ended up losing by four, a massive eight-shot swing in Rahm’s favor.\n\nLive Leaderboard: PGA Championship Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nWith his spectacularly steady victorious play over a marathon 30 holes Sunday, Rahm also saved Augusta National from the utter embarrassment of having to place another green jacket on the shoulders of the late-surging Phil Mickelson, in many ways the epitome of the greedy, preposterous world of LIV Golf, the Saudi-backed league that is using men like Koepka and Mickelson to help “sportswash” a laundry list of the kingdom’s atrocities.\n\nWait, what? Phil? Him?\n\nYes, Mickelson, the 52-year-old, three-time Masters champion, became the oldest player in history to finish in the top five at a Masters with a surprising seven-under-par 65 in the final round. He was birdieing 18 when Rahm and Koepka were walking down the 10th fairway, posting an eye-popping, red 8-under near the very top of the leaderboard when Rahm at the time was just two better at 10-under. What an interesting development that was.\n\nWith Koepka trading shots with Rahm on that back nine for more than two hours, and with Mickelson’s name just hanging out there, as noticeable as a neon sign, and with another LIV man, Patrick Reed, also in the hunt, LIV Golf CEO Greg Norman had to be absolutely giddy watching from afar.\n\n(We can only surmise what Norman was doing, and where he was doing it. He was not invited to attend the Masters because of concerns that he would be an unwanted distraction. Ya think?)\n\nBut LIV’s presence at the top of the leaderboard meant that basically every third shot being shown in the late afternoon and early evening Sunday on CBS was hit by a LIV golfer. How about that? CBS ended up giving the no-cut, exhibition-style, silly golf tour more publicity than it will ever get itself with its underwhelming TV deal on the CW Network.\n\nWhen the Masters was over, there were three LIV golfers among the top six finishers. This is the significant issue facing the four men’s majors, each of which has failed to ban LIV golfers from their events, meaning they will end up rolling the dice on the legitimacy of their championships just as the Masters did Sunday.\n\nLet us make no mistake what Koepka, Mickelson, Reed and the other 15 LIV golfers who arrived here have done. They left their regular tour jobs to go into the “sportswashing” business with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, the mastermind of the killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, as well as his golf-bro buddies in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the nation responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States and abysmal human rights violations against women and the LGBTQ community.\n\nOne golfer who was adamant that he would never leave the PGA Tour for LIV’s fat paychecks is Rahm, the man who held off the LIV charge Sunday.\n\n“Shotgun (start), three days to me is not a golf tournament. No cut. It's that simple,\" Rahm said. \"I want to play against the best in the world in a format that's been going on for hundreds of years.\n\n\"I've never really played the game of golf for monetary reasons,” he added. \"I play for the love of the game, and I want to play against the best in the world. I've always been interested in history and legacy, and right now, the PGA Tour has that.”\n\nThat man won the Masters Sunday. And because he won, LIV lost. That’s the story. That’s the headline. At the end of the day, that’s really all that matters.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2023/04/09/jon-rahm-rallies-to-win-the-masters-as-spanish-stars-align/70096869007/", "title": "Jon Rahm rallies to win the Masters as Spanish stars align", "text": "DOUG FERGUSON\n\nAP\n\nAUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Jon Rahm kept hearing how he was destined to win because so many Spanish stars were aligned in his favor.\n\nSunday was the birthdate of Seve Ballesteros, his idol and inspiration for playing. This year was the 40-year anniversary of the second Masters title Ballesteros won. If that wasn't enough, caddie Adam Hayes was assigned white coveralls with No. 49 — April 9.\n\n“I was told a lot of things about why this could be the year,” Rahm said, looking smart as ever in his new green jacket. “And I just didn't want to buy into it too much.”\n\nHis golf was far more valuable than any historical coincidence.\n\nRahm turned the longest day into his sweetest victory Sunday. The 30-hole marathon finish started with him trailing by four and ended with a walk up to the 18th green that nearly reduced him to tears, and gave him another major that affirmed him as No. 1 in the world.\n\nLive Leaderboard: PGA Championship Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nHe closed with a 3-under 69 to pull away from . He won by four shots over Koepka and 52-year-old Phil Mickelson, who matched the low score of the tournament with a 65 and became the oldest runner-up in Masters history.\n\n“We all dream of things like this as players, and you try to visualize what it’s going to be like and what it’s going to feel like,” Rahm said. \"Never thought I was going to cry by winning a golf tournament, but I got very close on that 18th hole.\n\n“And a lot of it because of what it means to me, and to Spanish golf,” he said. “It’s Spain’s 10th major, fourth player to win the Masters. It's pretty incredible.”\n\nIt was Mickelson who declared Rahm would be among golf's biggest stars even before the Spaniard turned pro in 2016. Rahm now has a green jacket to go along with his at Torrey Pines.\n\n“It was obvious to me at a very young age that he was one of the best players in the world even while he was in college,” said Mickelson, whose younger brother was Rahm's college coach at Arizona State. “To see him on this stage is not surprising for anybody.”\n\nRahm made up two shots on Koepka over the final 12 holes of the rain-delayed third round and started the final round two shots behind. He seized on Koepka's collapse and then surged so far ahead that Mickelson's amazing closing round — it matched the three-time Masters champion's best final round ever at Augusta National — was never going to be enough.\n\nThe finish was vintage Rahm. He pulled his drive into the pine trees and it ricocheted out, short of where the fairway starts. No problem. He hit 4-iron toward the green and lofted a pitch to 3 feet to end his round with only one bogey.\n\n“An unusual par, very much a Seve par, a testament to him, and I know he was pulling for me today,” said Rahm, who finished at 12-under 276. “And it was a great Sunday.”\n\nRahm embraced his wife and two children, and as he walked toward the scoring room, there was two-time Masters champion José María Olazábal in his green jacket for the strongest hug of all and a few words that included Ballesteros.\n\n“He said he hopes it’s the first of many more,” Rahm said in Butler Cabin. “We both mentioned something about Seve, and if he had given us 10 more seconds, I think we would have both ended up crying.”\n\nSergio Garcia was the low amateur in 1999 when Olazábal won his second green jacket, and then Garcia won in 2017, the year Rahm made his Masters debut.\n\nStars aligned, and Rahm played some world-class golf. And to think he began the tournament with a four-putt double bogey on the opening hole.\n\nRahm won for the fourth time this year — just as — and reclaimed the No. 1 world ranking from Scheffler.\n\nThis Masters had a little bit of everything — hot and humid at the start, a cold front with wind that toppled three trees on Friday, putting surfaces saturated from rain on Saturday and a marathon finish Sunday as Rahm and Koepka went 30 holes.\n\nKoepka had one miscue after another, losing the lead for the first time since Thursday afternoon when he chipped 20 feet past the hole from behind the par-3 sixth and made his second bogey. More would follow.\n\n“Just some days you have it, some days you don’t, and today wasn’t one of those,” Koepka said. “But I feel good, and I expect to be there the other three (majors).”\n\nKoepka went 22 consecutive holes Sunday without a birdie — from the par-5 eighth hole in the morning of the third round until the par-5 13th in final round. By then, he was three shots behind and Rahm all but sealed it with his next shot.\n\nHe hit a low cut with an 8-iron from 141 yards around a tree from right of the 14th fairway, and it caught a slope on the green at just the right spot to feed down to 3 feet for birdie. When Koepka three-putted for bogey, it was a matter of finishing.\n\nThe leaderboard was littered with major champions and a tinge of Saudi-funded LIV Golf. Mickelson and Koepka both are part of the rival circuit. Former Masters champion Patrick Reed, another player who defected to LIV, closed with a 68 and tied for fourth with Jordan Spieth (66) and Russell Henley.\n\nfor the finish. He withdrew Sunday morning before the third round resumed, saying plantar fasciitis in his foot was aggravating him. Woods also withdrew after three rounds of the PGA Championship last year in similarly cold, windy conditions at Southern Hills in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nMickelson barely contends over 54 holes in the 48-man LIV Golf league. And then he played like the six-time major champion who two years ago became the oldest major champion at age 50 when he won the PGA Championship.\n\nHe stuffed his tee shot on the par-3 sixth, birdied the seventh and then finished in style. His approach to the 17th came within inches of going in for an eagle, and he pumped his fist when his 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th dropped for a 65.\n\nIt matched his lowest score ever at Augusta National — he shot 65 in the opening round in the 1996 Masters and was at his Sunday best.\n\n“Unfortunately it wasn’t enough, but it was really a lot of fun for me to play at this level again, and it’s encouraging for me going forward the rest of the year,” Mickelson said.\n\nRahm called it an incredible day, especially with his father coming over from Spain. He concluded his remarks at the trophy presentation on the 18th green by saying, “Happy Easter. And rest in peace, Seve.”\n\nHe then made the sign of the cross, kissed his finger and pointed to the sky, the clearest it had been all week.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: and", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/masters/2023/04/02/masters-2023-storylines-liv-golf-players-augusta-hole-13/11590878002/", "title": "Welcome back? As Masters Tournament returns, reaction to LIV ...", "text": "David Westin\n\nSpecial to the Augusta Chronicle\n\nIf the playing of the 87th Masters Tournament is half as interesting as all the lead-in conjecture this week, it will be one that will be remembered for years to come.\n\nAs official practice rounds begin Monday morning, storylines are coming from all directions, starting with what could be a contentious Champions Dinner on Tuesday night as six former champions are now part of the controversial LIV Golf tour and expected to be in attendance.\n\nAs for the course itself, for the second year in a row, one of the second nine par 5s has been lengthened. This time, it’s the iconic 13th. It’s a move that has been talked about since Augusta National Golf Club bought land from neighboring Augusta County Club in 2017. This year, it’s a reality.\n\nOn the course, it’s one of those years that the top players in the world are peaking at just the right time for the Masters. They are the new Big Three; Defending champion Scott Scheffler, Jon Rahm and Rory McIlroy. This is McIlroy’s ninth try to complete the career Grand Slam. He’s coming off his best finish here, a solo second last year thanks to a final-round 64.\n\nLIV's First Big Moment at Masters? The Champions Dinner\n\nSome former champions, such as Fred Couples, have expressed their displeasure with the breakaway LIV Golf tour. Since last year’s Champions Dinner, six former champions have joined the league and are expected to be in attendance Tuesday night.\n\nLive Leaderboard: PGA Championship Tournament Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nThat includes three-time champion Phil Mickelson, who skipped the dinner and the tournament last year in the wake of comments critical of the PGA Tour and his support of LIV. He joined LIV in June, and was followed by former Masters champions Bubba Watson, Dustin Johnson, Sergio Garcia, Patrick Reed and Charl Schwartzel.\n\nScheffler, who will host the dinner as the defending champ, joked with Watson that maybe there should be a separate table for the LIV golfers. Nick Faldo, a three-time champ, joked that perhaps it might be wise to use “plastic knives and forks.”\n\nIn all, there are 18 LIV golfers in the Masters field, including four-time major champion Brooks Koepka. All of them have been sensitive to criticism that, because they are banned by the PGA Tour and have only played three events this season (including one in Orlando that ended Sunday), they might have lost their edge. They also play 54 holes tournaments, not the normal 72.\n\nThe PGA Tour has banned LIV members from playing its events. But the four majors, including the Masters, are allowing those who qualified to play.\n\nLIV GOLF:What Cameron Smith, others have said about 2023 Masters\n\nGOLFWEEK: All the latest news from the Masters and around the links\n\n“Most of us will get four cracks at it this year (in the major championships), and hopefully we get maybe a win out of it,” said Cameron Smith, the current British Open champ and LIV’s highest player in the world rankings. “Maybe we just show a really hearty effort. I think for us, internally, there’s a lot of chatter going around about, 'These guys don’t play real golf anymore.' And I think it’s (crap) to be honest. And we just want to show people that.\"\n\n\"I think there is a big rivalry right now between the Tour and LIV,\" said Joaquin Niemann, another LIV member. \"I think there is a lot of players that – I don't know if they don't like us or they don't like the decisions that we take – but it's going to be fun.\"\n\n\"I think it's going to be more fun knowing that they hate us,\" Niemann said. \"Then go to the majors and beat them.\"\n\nWill Augusta National pair them all together? It’s doubtful. The former champions are normally paired with amateurs. Will the fan reaction be muted?\n\nAnd what if a LIV golfer wins? That could very well happen, especially since Smith is unquestionably one of the game’s top players. He’s shown he can win here, with top-10 finishes in each of the past three years. He tied for second in 2020, becoming the first golfer in tournament history to break 70 in all four rounds, tied for 10th in 2021 and tied for third last year.\n\nLucky, or Unlucky, New 13th Hole at Augusta National?\n\nBack to the lengthening of the 13th hole. The tee was moved straight back and up the hill 35yards, making it play at 545 yards. It will be more difficult for players to draw their ball around the dogleg right corner on the par-5. That means fewer player will go for the water-guarded green in two shots, and eagles will be rarer. But there were only three there last year.\n\nLast year, when the other second-nine par-5, the 15th, was lengthened by 20 yards to 550 yards, there was zero eagles recorded.\n\nThe change on No. 13 puzzles two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson.\n\n\"It will change the hole,” Watson said. “It's now driver (off the tee) and maybe a long iron into the green. Will they take out trees on the bend? That'll determine how much harder it is when it comes to going for it in two. There's probably going to be a lot more lay-ups. A few years ago, they wanted the roars back on Sunday. Now you're taking away the roars? That's kind of weird.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/02"}]}

The 6-foot-5 Boston was a three-time Associated Press All-American and also the Player of the Year as a junior.\n\n“It’s really special, I’m thankful to God for putting me in this position,” said the 21-year-old Boston, from the U.S. Virgin Islands. “Everyone in Indiana, they saw something in me, I’m ready to get there and get to work.”\n\nThe Fever had the worst record in the league last season, going 5-31.\n\n“Aliyah Boston will have an immediate impact on our franchise on and off the court,\" Fever GM Lin Dunn said. 'We are excited to pair her with Kelsey (Mitchell) and NaLyssa (Smith) as we reload the Indiana Fever. We are very impressed with Aliyah’s post skills as well as her natural leadership skills. This a a great day for our franchise!”\n\nBoston, like many other players, have had to choose whether to return to college for a fifth season because of the extra year granted for the COVID-19 virus or turn pro. She decided to enter the WNBA draft, joining 111 other players to declare.\n\n“Everyone that has a COVID year has a tough choice,” Boston said. “You could be somewhere you know the system. ... It took a lot of thought.”\n\nShe was one of three South Carolina players taken in the first round. Laeticia Amihere went eighth to Atlanta and Zia Cooke 10th to Los Angeles. It’s the 10th time that three players from the same team were drafted in the opening round, and the first since Oregon had three in 2020.\n\nThe Gamecocks also had two other players drafted, with Brea Beal going 24th to Minnesota and Victaria Saxton picked next by Indiana.\n\n“It’s amazing experience really, because this group of girls have been through life together,” Amihere said. “These four years haven’t been only about basketball. Being able to be with them on one of our biggest nights is an amazing experience.\"\n\nMinnesota took Diamond Miller of Maryland with the No. 2 pick, and Dallas drafted Maddy Siegrist of Villanova with the third pick. Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman, who was the WNBA's first president, sat with Siegrist.\n\nThe Wings also drafted UConn guard Lou Lopez Senechal two picks later. She had transferred to UConn after a stellar career at Fairfield.\n\n“It feels surreal, really didn’t think I’d be here,” Senechal said. “I've come a long way, gone through a lot of challenges.”\n\nStephanie Soares of Iowa State went fourth to Washington. The Mystics quickly traded her to Dallas soon after selecting the 6-foot-7 center. Washington got back a first round pick in 2025 and second-round pick in 2024.\n\n“It was a very interesting feeling,” Soares said. “Pure excitement going to Washington, but now getting to go to Dallas. It's going to be a great next step to the journey.”\n\nSoares tore her ACL in January and will miss the upcoming WNBA season.\n\nStanford guard Haley Jones went sixth to Atlanta. Indiana's Grace Berger was drafted seventh by the Fever. She was the first Hoosiers player selected in the first round in school history.\n\nSeattle took Tennessee's Jordan Horston ninth. Dallas chose Maryland's Abby Meyers with the 11th pick. Meyers started her career at Princeton before finishing with the Terrapins.\n\nMinnesota closed out the first round taking French center Maïa Hirsch.\n\nTIP-INS:\n\nLSU guard Alexis Morris, who helped the Tigers win a national championship eight days ago, was taken 22nd by the Connecticut Sun. Her LSU teammate LaDazhia Williams was drafted six picks earlier by Indiana. ... USC grad students Kadi Sissoko and Okako Adika were taken 29th and 30th by Phoenix and New York, respectively. It's the first time since 2012 the school had two players chosen in the draft. ...

Dunn pulled out a worn-down rabbit's foot and other relics that went back two decades when she coached and managed the Seattle Storm, when the team had the No. 1 picks in 2000 and 2001, when they got Sue Bird and Lauren Jackson.\n\nDunn wanted desperately to be in that position again. With the No. 1 pick, with the chance of landing a franchise-changing player. And this time, she wanted it for the Indiana Fever.\n\n\"I pulled out all my lucky charms,\" Dunn, the Fever's general manager, told IndyStar last week. \"And I did a little hooby, dooby, dooby.

Could the Fever get Aliyah Boston?\n\nWNBA DRAFT:Time, TV, streaming, first-round order and key players to watch\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up to get the latest news and features sent to your inbox\n\nWomen's basketball pundits were dubbing Boston the No. 1 pick in the 2023 draft. But Boston still had another year of college eligibility, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After losing in the Final Four to Iowa's Caitlin Clark on March 31, Boston had a choice.\n\nShe could return for a fifth season or declare for the WNBA draft. Dunn and the world of women's basketball waited.\n\n“She's ready to make the next step to the league,\" South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said after the team's Final Four loss.\n\nHours after Staley said those words, Dunn was reading through social media posts and saw the tweet — Boston's tweet.\n\n\"In this moment, I am truly breathless as I make the next best decision of my life,\" Boston tweeted April 1. \"I have decided to pursue my dream by declaring for the 2023 WNBA Draft.\"\n\nFor Dunn, that tweet was wonderful and kind of ironic, coming on a day for fooling. This was no joke for Dunn. This was serious and potentially franchise changing for the Fever.\n\n\"We're looking to get better,\" Dunn told IndyStar, not revealing whether Boston would be the team's No. 1 pick. \"We’re looking to get better today, tomorrow and in the future.\"\n\nIf anyone can do that for the Fever, there is no doubt in Sherry Levin's mind, it is Boston.\n\nA high school phenom: 'She is never content with the right now'\n\nI think I can make Aliyah the best player in women's basketball.\n\nThose words came out of Levin's mouth before she ever stepped on a court to coach Boston. But Levin never regretted those words she spoke to Boston's mother after her freshman season of high school at Worcester Academy in Massachusetts. She had watched the tapes of Boston on the court.\n\nLevin was doing her homework as she began her second stint as girls basketball coach at Worcester, inheriting a team she knew nothing about. But when Levin got the roster of returning players, Worcester's athletic director Ed Reilly pointed to one name and said, \"This is a mom you probably want to connect with.\"\n\nCleone Boston wasn't too happy with the way her daughter's freshman basketball season had played out. She was considering moving Boston to another school.\n\nAs Levin watched game tapes from the previous season, she understood Cleone's frustrations and reached out. The two talked for 90 minutes.\n\n\"I watched every single game,\" Levin told Cleone before Boston's sophomore season at Worcester. \"Aliyah was not used the way she should have been.\" She had been used to pass the ball to seniors to shoot 3-pointers.\n\nBoston had so much more potential, unimaginable potential, and so Levin said those words to Cleone: \"I think I can make Aliyah the best player in women's basketball.\"\n\n\"Thank God they said, 'We're staying,'\" Levin told IndyStar. \"They said, 'We're going to leave her in your hands.'\"\n\nLevin began a journey she calls a \"beautiful story\" and her \"claim to fame,\" getting to coach Boston for three years in high school, giving her a foundation.\n\n\"I can tell you she is never content with the right now, so I didn't coach her that way,\" Levin said. Boston would score 22 points and get 10 rebounds in a game, but Levin knew Boston didn't want to hear \"great job Aliyah.\" She wanted to hear, \"you had three blocks with the wrong hand.\"\n\nBoston ate up everything Levin told her.\n\n\"She was one of the most coachable in terms of her work ethic,\" Levin said. \"Always ready and wanting to learn more, to get better.\"\n\nIt was a work ethic Boston learned as a young girl growing up more than 1,700 miles from Worcester Academy in the U.S. Virgin Islands, playing basketball every chance she got, honing her game — and dreaming of one day playing in the WNBA.\n\n'She's a double, double machine'\n\nBoston grew up in St. Thomas on an island 40 miles east of Puerto Rico. She fell in love with basketball after watching her older sister, Alexis, play. But there weren't many basketball leagues for girls in St. Thomas so Boston played with the boys and she dominated.\n\nBy middle school, Boston was hooked on the game, she says in an ESPN video of her basketball journey. Boston declined an interview with IndyStar for this story as she prepared for her final weeks of college and Monday night's draft.\n\nIn the ESPN video, Boston went back to the outdoor basketball court where she spent endless hours in St. Thomas. “After school, my mom would bring us out here. 'Let’s shoot,'\" Boston said. \"It was brutal.\" The hot sun pounding down relentlessly, but Boston kept playing anyway.\n\n“I saw some signs in her in seventh grade,“ Russell Brewley, who was Boston's basketball coach in middle school, told ESPN. \"She was honestly better than all the girls.\" And plenty of the boys.\n\nAs Boston's high school basketball career loomed, her mom Cleone said her daughter \"needed an opportunity to see who she could become.\"\n\nAfter playing basketball in summer camps in the United States, Boston and Alexis moved in 2014 to Massachusetts to live with their aunt. It was the best move the family ever made.\n\nAs a high school player at Worcester, Boston dominated, becoming a three-time Gatorade Player of the Year and rising to the No. 3 recruit in the country.\n\nBoston could finish a shot on the left and on the right. She was strong and big. She was a quiet, dominating force on the court who led her team to a 24-1 record and a second straight New England Prep School Athletic Council Class A championship her senior season in 2019. That year, she was also a consensus All-American, averaging 17.3 points, 10.6 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game.\n\n\"She's, as we like to say in the business, a double-double machine,\" said Reilly, Worcester's athletic director. \"The biggest mistake I ever made was not appointing myself to be Aliyah Boston's coach.\"\n\nReilly remembers the day Boston walked onto the Worcester campus and her beautiful smile. She had an endearing way about her, kind and humble, but she also had incredible leadership skills, he said.\n\n\"You hear this often echoed, I think it rings true, particularly with Aliyah,\" Reilly said. \"She is a better person than she is a basketball player and she is an off-the-chart player who has gotten national and international attention.\"\n\n'The Fever will never regret taking Aliyah Boston'\n\nThe college coaches came calling for Boston at Worcester, one after another after another. Major college programs wanted this towering player who could handle the ball like a point guard. Boston was recruited by UConn, Ohio State, Notre Dame and countless other schools. She chose South Carolina.\n\nStaley, who declined an interview with IndyStar, got an immediate taste of this phenom she had recruited.\n\nIn Boston's first game at South Carolina in November 2019, she posted the first triple-double by a freshman in program history and the first by any NCAA Division I player in her career debut. She also tied the school record with 10 blocks.\n\nBoston went on to become South Carolina's superstar, winning just about every school, league and college women's basketball accolade there was to win. She also led her team to its second NCAA title in 2022.\n\nAs Boston's senior season played out, Dunn said she was careful not to distract her. But last week, as Dunn had Zoom interviews with top prospects in the WNBA draft, she talked to Boston.\n\nEven before that call, Dunn said she already felt like she knew Boston from talking to her agent and college coaches and following her on social media.\n\n\"I read her posts. I feel like I learn a lot about how she says things, things she values, her closeness to her family,\" Dunn said. \"That's been really helpful. It gives me a little bit of insight to the type of person she is. And she is a very good person.\"\n\nBut, of course, Dunn is in the business of basketball and Boston's on-court presence and skills are phenomenal.\n\n\"She’s an exceptional player,\" Dunn said. \"She is special.\"\n\nThe likes of a player like Boston don't come along often in women's basketball, Levin said. \"Aliyah is an example of God-given talents and gifts. Not everybody is 6-5, not everybody can run and jump the way she can. She uses her brain and her heart.\"\n\nAnd Levin will never forget the dream Boston had in her heart as she rose to greatness at Worcester Academy.\n\n\"To play in the WNBA, that was her dream then,\" Levin said. \"I literally would say, 'You are going to be in the WNBA. You are the going to be the best player in the WNBA.\"\n\nAnd if the Fever make what Levin believes is the only pick the team could possibly make, Boston will electrify the franchise.\n\n\"Whatever is not working for the Fever, Aliyah will figure that out,\" Levin said. \"I can tell you the Fever will never regret taking Aliyah Boston.\"\n\nFollow IndyStar sports reporter Dana Benbow on Twitter: @DanaBenbow.

So much so that its players have been featured on the runways of New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe 2023 WNBA draft is an opportunity for the newest stars to show that not only will they bring excellence on the court, they will show out off of it too.\n\nThe league, true to its branding, had the draft prospects walk the orange carpet as they prepared to hear their names called to the professional ranks.\n\nThe players impressed with a wide range of well-tailored suits and stunning gowns.\n\nHere is the WNBA draft drip check:\n\n7. Alexis Morris — Louisiana State\n\nAfter winning the national championship, Alexis Morris channeled Aaliyah, the late queen of cool, for the WNBA draft. The LSU star wore an expertly tailored black suit. Fierce black sunglasses and a simple diamond necklace completed the effortless look.\n\n6. Aliyah Boston — South Carolina\n\nNo. 1 overall pick Aliyah Boston showed up ready to take the stage. She wore a silky white high-waisted jumper with drapery that was fit for an empress. Her flowing purple hair added to the effect of royalty. And, she got her braces off!\n\n5. Dorka Juhász — Connecticut\n\nDorka Juhász wowed in a classic LBD. The three-quarter sleeves and high neck is simple and modest upon first look. But the dress features a built-in corset that takes the outfit to the next level. The Connecticut Husky-turned-Minnesota Lynx forward kept her hair slicked back behind her ears for her the sparkle of her jewelry to gently shine.\n\n4. Brea Beal — South Carolina\n\nThe pop of pink from South Carolina star Brea Beal is straight off of a limited edition collectible Barbie doll. Not only does the suit show that she is here for business, but the bejeweled bralette underneath screams superstar.\n\n3. Haley Jones — Stanford\n\nOne of the special parts of draft day is that the players get to celebrate with their family. Stanford's Haley Jones looked dashing in this green getup from Sergio Hudson, which featured a bralette and skirt with a structured blazer. The special touch to her outfit was a ring from her late great-grandmother.\n\n2. Jordan Horston — Tennessee\n\nTennessee's Jordan Horston knew she was crossing the finish line of her college career and donned a Louis Vuitton checkerboard jacket with smart black trousers. She accessorized the look with a matching belt, black Louis Vuitton loafers and plenty of bling. Her checkerboard nails showed she was fully committed to the look.\n\n1. Zia Cooke — South Carolina\n\nZia Cooke took the orange carpet straight to Hollywood with this stunning look. The South Carolina Gamecocks-turned-Los Angeles Sparks guard wore a black evening gown with flowing sleeves and a bedazzled design around a peek-a-boo accent.

Minnesota Lynx (from Las Vegas Aces)\n\nWho are some key players to watch in the WNBA draft?\n\nThe only sure thing about the 2023 WNBA draft is that South Carolina forward-center Aliyah Boston, the consensus national player of the year last season, will be taken with the No. 1 overall pick. The only other near certainty is that plenty of Boston's teammates will also be selected Monday night.\n\nFour other Gamecocks, who along with Boston won the 2022 national championship and helped South Carolina reach its third consecutive Final Four this month, have declared for the draft — F Laeticia Amihere, G Brea Beal, G Zia Cooke and F Victaria Saxton — and one or more could join Boston as first-round selections. Add in G Kierra Fletcher, who played for South Carolina in the 2022-23 season as a graduate student after four years at Georgia Tech, and the 2023 draft could be a monumental one for the Gamecocks.\n\nBut there will be plenty of other great athletes for the 12 teams to choose from. Among the other players to watch:\n\n► G Diamond Miller: One of the most pro-ready players, she led Maryland to the Elite Eight after averaging 19.7 and 6.4 rebounds in her senior season.\n\n► F Madison Siegrist: The nation's leading scorer with 29.2 points per game led Villanova to the Sweet 16 for the first time in 20 years.\n\n► G Haley Jones: The versatile guard is an excellent passer and rebounder and won a national championship with Stanford in 2021.\n\n► G Jordan Horston: One of only two Tennessee players all time to finish with at least 1,000 points, 700 rebounds and 400 assists for the Lady Vols.\n\n► C Stephanie Soares: Tore her ACL just 13 games into Iowa State's 2022-23 season — her only one with the Cyclones after four years in the NAIA — but is a monster in the paint.\n\n► F/G Ashley Joens: A three-time Cheryl Miller Award winner as the nation's best small forward, the Big 12 Player of the Year finished as Iowa State all-time leading scorer.\n\n► G/F Lou Lopez Sénéchal: UConn's second-leading scorer and best three-point shooter this season became a primetime player on a team decimated by injuries.\n\n► G Alexis Morris: The fifth-year senior, who averaged 15.4 points in 2022-23 and 24 ppg in the Final Four, led LSU to its first national championship.\n\n► G Taylor Mikesell: A deadly three-point shooter, Ohio State's leading scorer in 2022-23 led the Buckeyes to their first Elite Eight in 30 years.\n\nWho won't be in the WNBA draft?\n\nIf you are looking for some of the stars that made a big splash in the NCAA Tournament — like Iowa's Caitlin Clark or LSU's Angel Reese — you'll have to wait at least one more year, if not two.\n\nClark, Reese, Virginia Tech's Georgia Amoore, Louisville's Hailey Van Lith, Stanford's Cameron Brink and Connecticut's Paige Bueckers were all juniors academically and have at least one more year of eligibility — if not two, if they decide to take advantage of the extra year the NCAA granted in 2021 because of COVID. Bueckers, technically, could have as much as three years of eligibility remaining since she missed her entire junior season after tearing the ACL in her left knee.\n\nThree seniors who saw their stock rise in the NCAA Tournament did opt to take advantage of the extra COVID year and return to college for a fifth year. Virginia Tech center Elizabeth Kitley, a second-team AP All-American and the ACC Player of the Year, led the Hokies to their first ever Final Four and hopes to duplicate that feat; Ohio State guard Jacy Sheldon will be back in Columbus next year after leading the Buckeyes to the Elite Eight; and guard Charisma Osborne returns to UCLA after leading the Bruins in scoring and rebounding in 2022-23 and a berth in the Sweet 16.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/basketball/wnba/fever/2023/04/06/wnba-draft-what-indiana-fever-fans-should-know-about-aliyah-boston-south-carolina-q-a-beat-writer/70073420007/", "title": "WNBA draft: What Indiana Fever fans should know about Aliyah ...", "text": "The Indiana Fever are expected to select South Carolina forward Aliyah Boston with the No. 1 pick in the 2023 WNBA draft on Monday.\n\nThe 6-5 Boston is universally considered a once-in-a-lifetime franchise player, who could immediately elevate the Fever. Indiana has not reached the playoffs since 2016 and is on its fifth coach since 2019.\n\nA three-time first-team All-American, two-time Naismith defensive player of the year honoree and 2022 national player of the year, Boston averaged 14.1 points and 10.8 rebounds over her four seasons, guiding South Carolina to a 129-9 record that included three consecutive Final Four appearances and a national championship in 2022. She fueled the team's run to a 36-1 finish this past season, with the lone loss coming to Iowa in the national semifinals. Boston holds a number of school records, and announced her decision to enter the draft and forgo her extra year of eligibility (COVID) shortly after the Final Four.\n\nWNBA draft:With No. 1 pick (Aliyah Boston?), Fever in position to jumpstart vital rebuild\n\nAliyah Boston is likely top pick:Here are 5 things you should know.\n\nWNBA Draft:Aliyah Boston is likely No. 1 pick, but who should Indiana Fever take at 7?\n\nBoston's resume speaks for itself, but to learn more about the phenom, we spoke with Gamecocks beat writer Emily Adams of The Greenville News.\n\nDawn Staley said Boston should enter the WNBA draft. Do you agree with her assessment? And why is Boston ready to take that next step in her career?\n\nAdams: I do, and I think Staley hit the nail on the head: Boston hit her ceiling in college basketball because of the way opposing teams were choosing to play her. The reason she often played few minutes this season, even in close games, was because she drew double, triple and even quadruple teams at the post. There’s a shot from the Georgia game where she literally had every player on the court defending her.\n\nIn the WNBA, the defensive 3-second rule prevents that kind of junk defense and will give her the opportunity to play true 1-v-1 basketball. She finished 0.2 rebounds shy of averaging a double-double even up against the defenses she faced this year, so I think she’s ready for that challenge of taking on higher-skill defenders in a more technical format.\n\nWhat has impressed you most when watching Boston play?\n\nAdams: I’ve never seen a college player with basketball IQ like Boston. In 37 games, she almost never made a bad decision or a true mistake, even on plays that resulted in turnovers or missed shots. For a post player to foul out one time — in overtime — and to average less than two turnovers per game is pretty remarkable, and it’s a testament to how smart she is.\n\nShe will always pass up a good shot if a teammate has a better one. She sees lanes and weak spots in defenses that are so difficult to process in real time. I think it’s a trait that will take some time to adjust at the WNBA level with certain rule differences and such, but it’s so unique and impactful once she gets to that comfort level.\n\nHer size aside, what distinguishes Boston defensively?\n\nAdams: Her footwork and athleticism. It’s so rare to see players of Boston’s size have the kind of agility and ability to 1-v-1 defend even out toward the perimeter. Her body position and technique are almost always perfect, and the fact that she’s 6-foot-5 makes it that much more impressive. She also has some speed she can turn on when she needs to, especially when she’s chasing down a block.\n\nHow did Boston adjust to the way teams defended her in the paint and the different ways they tried to take away components of her game?\n\nAdams: The biggest thing is that she became a much stronger passer, which was a big goal that Staley had for her coming into this season. If teams were going to pack the paint on her, her ability to find an assist or just get the ball out of a trap developed a lot. She also worked a lot on her jump shot and started hitting mid-ranges with more consistency. That kept her outside the messes that opponents tried to create in the paint, and it’s why the rebounding numbers suffered a bit while her field goal percentage went up compared to last year.\n\nMore:Fever remove interim tag from general manager Lin Dunn\n\nIs there a moment that comes to mind that captures what Boston brings in terms of leadership?\n\nAdams: What’s cool about Boston is she’s very aware of what the team needs from a basketball perspective, but she’s also attuned to individuals and what kind of encouragement each teammate responds to.\n\nThe moment that stands out to me was in the first round game of the tournament against Norfolk State, which wasn’t really a big or close game. One of the freshman post players, Ashlyn Watkins, checked in pretty early in the game and missed two free throws and her first two field goal attempts right away. Boston came back in off the bench right after Watkins missed the second jumper, went straight to her and just kind of took her aside and talked to her for a second. Literally the next play, Watkins got an offensive rebound, missed the shot, made a steal and then got her first points on the fast break.\n\nThat’s a long story just to say Boston is one who elevates the players around her, and she’s also perfectly capable of taking over and dominating on her own. It’s a special combination that takes a particular personality to pull off.\n\nBrea Beal is projected by ESPN as a potential Fever draft pick at No. 7. What distinguishes her game and how does it translate to the professional level?\n\nAdams: I could talk about this all day, because I’m so glad Beal is finally getting recognition as a high-level WNBA prospect. Beal is the most skilled 1-v-1 defender I’ve ever watched, and I don’t think any player besides Caitlin Clark was able to beat her on the dribble this season. She’s super technical in her positioning and footwork, and what makes her unique for a guard is her size. She’s 6-foot-1 and has a super broad, physical build, which helps her hang even with players that have height on her.\n\nDefensive excellence is maybe the best skill you can have coming into the W, but Beal also grew a ton this year as an offensive threat. Her field goal percentage went from 38% in 2021-22 to 42% this season and from 24% on 3-pointers to 38%. Developing that outside shot is something teams love to see at the next level, and she’s someone who will stretch the floor on both ends.\n\nFollow Brian Haenchen on Twitter at @Brian_Haenchen.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaw/2023/04/01/aliyah-boston-declares-2023-wnba-draft-south-carolina-gamecocks/11585401002/", "title": "Aliyah Boston, South Carolina star, declares for 2023 WNBA draft", "text": "South Carolina Gamecocks star Aliyah Boston is declaring for the WNBA draft.

The high mark was 28 of the 36 draftees in 2019. The low was only 20 the year before.\n\nEven if a player does get into the league, it's a battle for playing time.\n\nOnly 60% of players drafted got on the court to play minutes their first year since 2017 according to the basketball website ’Her Hoop Stats.\" It's part of the reason why five of the first-round picks in 2021 are no longer in the league.\n\nThere has been talk of WNBA expansion, but nothing has come to fruition yet. Players often turn to playing professionally overseas, working on their games and looking for another shot to play at home.\n\nNow those jobs are also at a premium.\n\nBrittney Griner's nine-month incarceration in Moscow along with the war with Ukraine has led to the elimination of dozens of potential jobs in Russia.\n\n, during which she was detained when customs officials said they found vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage, then later arrested before being released in a high-level prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Russia.\n\nThe lost jobs in Russia has a trickle down on openings in other countries as top players who once played there are looking elsewhere for work.\n\nLongtime agent Brian Dyke said that there a fewer countries now that he can send players to. Besides Russia, China and Korea stopped signing foreign players few years ago because of the coronavirus. Neither has started again. That's roughly another three dozen jobs gone.\n\n“In Korea, everyone used to get $25,000 a month,” Dyke said. “It's a huge loss not having those jobs as those are two of the biggest markets.”\n\nDyke also said he wouldn't send some of his clients to play in other countries because of the political climate.\n\nWhile the overseas job market is shrinking, there are start-up leagues looking to fil the void.\n\nAthletes Unlimited just completed its second season. Over a dozen WNBA players competed last month in it. The four-team competition in Dallas is an opportunity for players to stay in the U.S. during the offseason and make up to $50,000 during the five-week season.\n\nStaying in the U.S. is becoming more important with the WNBA now requiring players to be present at the start of training camp. The requirement can impact playing opportunities outside of the league for WNBA players. Their overseas contract have to include provisions that allow players to return to the U.S. in the middle of a postseason run overseas.\n\nIt all makes the path to a professional basketball career for women harder than ever.\n\nPlayers had to declare by March 26 if they planned to enter the WNBA draft unless they were still playing in the NCAA Tournament. Those players had 48 hours after their last game to declare. South Carolina's Zia Cooke and Dorka Juhasz from UConn are among players headed to the draft.\n\nOthers like 6-foot-6 Elizabeth Kitley from Virginia Tech are staying in college, where they enjoy various amenities due to Title IX, including taking . Kitley, a senior, despite being a possible first-round pick is one of many college players who have an extra year of eligibility because of COVID.\n\nThe new name, image and likeness (NIL) opportunities women basketball players also have is playing into their decisions on turning pro.\n\n“NIL definitely plays a major role,” said South Carolina star Aliyah Boston, who decided to forgo her COVID year and enter the WNBA draft as the likely No. 1 overall pick. “NIL is something that's a blessing. It gives you a head start on life before you need to get there.”\n\nMaking a WNBA roster isn't something that Boston is going to have to worry about.\n\nTennessee forward Tamari Key isn't rushing to find out if she would.\n\n“Everyone says college is the best years of your life… why pass up… especially when you have enjoyed your time at the school,” the 6-6 Key wrote on social media.\n\nKey, who will return for a fifth-year after missing most of her senior season with blood clot issues, added:\n\n“Why go to the league right away when there are potentially not enough spots?”\n\n___\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/03"}]}

Trump called Bragg, the first Black man to become Manhattan DA, a “racist” for prosecuting him in a post on Truth Social on March 20 and an \"animal\" who is \"doing the work of Anarchists and the Devil\" in two posts March 23. Trump posted a picture on Truth Social that he later removed showing himself holding a baseball bat next to Bragg.\n\nBragg's office has said he is following the law to uncover the truth. As publicity about the case has grown, he has received death threats and a threatening letter with an unknown substance.\n\n“We will not be intimidated by attempts to undermine the justice process, nor will we let baseless accusations deter us from fairly applying the law,” said Danielle Filson, a Bragg spokesperson.\n\nHere is what we know about the investigation:\n\nBragg a longtime prosecutor, Harvard educated\n\nBefore winning election to district attorney, Bragg served in the state Attorney General's Office and as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York.\n\nAs chief deputy attorney general, he oversaw 1,500 people and a $225 million budget. Bragg was the first chief of a special unit investigating deaths caused by police conduct. And he directly oversaw the Trump Foundation litigation.\n\nBefore Bragg became DA, Trump pardoned Bannon for federal charges related to the not-for-profit We Build The Wall Inc., which was charged with alleged money laundering and conspiracy in a scheme that raised millions of dollars. But Bragg and Attorney General Letitia James announced a six-count indictment in September against Bannon and the group.\n\nBragg's office won convictions against two parts of the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer. Allen Weisselberg was sentenced to five months in prison after pleading guilty to 15 charges in a scheme to avoid taxes. Two Trump corporations were fined $1.6 million for convictions of 17 felonies.\n\nBetween government jobs, Bragg represented the mother and sister of Eric Garner in seeking information about his death during an arrest by city police in 2014. A city grand jury decided not to indict the Officer Daniel Pantaleo and federal prosecutors declined to prosecute him.\n\nBragg earned his undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard University.\n\nRepublicans criticize Trump inquiry as 'tenuous and untested'\n\nTrump isn’t alone among Republicans calling the investigation political.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said March 20 “if you have a prosecutor who is ignoring crimes happening every single day in his jurisdiction and he chooses to go back many, many years ago to try to use something about porn star hush money payments, that’s an example of pursuing a political agenda.”\n\nThree House committee chairmen called for Bragg to testify about his inquiry, which they called \"politically motivated\" and “tenuous and untested.” When Bragg rebuffed their questions into a pending criminal investigation, the chairmen said they were considering legislation to prevent a local prosecutor from charging a president of another party.\n\nLeslie Dubeck, Bragg's general counsel, wrote in reply to the House chairmen that accusations of political motivations were \"unfounded.\"\n\nBragg pursued Trump after others declined\n\nBragg’s critics complain he pressed charges for events known for years and that other prosecutors decided not to pursue:\n\nBragg critics focus on crime, while he says homidices, shootings down\n\nNew York’s crime rate figures prominently in criticism of Bragg from Trump and other Republicans.\n\nTrump accused Bragg in a Truth Social post on March 20 of letting \"murderers, rapists, and drug dealers walk free\" and presiding over the \"biggest violent crime wave\" in New York City history.\n\nBut Bragg’s office said homicides and shootings in Manhattan are down since he took office more than a year ago.\n\nBragg’s office said during the first year of his administration, homicides were down 16% and shootings were down 11%.

The resignations followed weeks of internal debate and discussion over the strength of the evidence against Trump and whether it could pass the hurdle of proving a crime.\n\nProsecutors have been investigating Trump and the Trump Organization and whether they misled lenders, insurers, and others by providing them false or misleading financial statements about the value of properties.\n\nThe abrupt resignations last month of the top prosecutors has cast the future of the investigation into doubt as a special grand jury convened last year is set to expire at the end of April.\n\nBragg’s office has reiterated that the investigation, which was started by Bragg’s predecessor, Cy Vance Jr., is ongoing. Susan Hoffinger, an experienced attorney, has been appointed to lead the investigative team.\n\nThe New York Times first reported that the resignations followed a decision by Bragg to stop presenting evidence to the grand jury.\n\nThe strength of the evidence against Trump has been debated by attorneys in the office for months, CNN has reported. Some prosecutors, including Dunne and Pomerantz, believed there was sufficient evidence to charge, while others, including some career prosecutors, were skeptical that they could win a conviction at trial, in part because of the difficulty in proving criminal intent, people familiar with the matter said. On the one hand, some prosecutors believed Trump spoke with a lot of hyperbole, but it wasn’t clear whether they could show he acted with intent to defraud.\n\nProsecutors also didn’t have a victim who lost money from Trump’s misstatements, people familiar said, a matter that might give a jury pause. Still some attorneys believed strongly that Trump should be held accountable and that the case was worth bringing even if they might lose, the people said.\n\nMultiple factors were at play, including the lack of a key Trump Organization insider cooperating with the investigation who, at trial, could walk the jury through the evidence, these people said. The possible value of using Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney who in testimony before Congress alleged Trump inflated and devalued the worth of assets for his advantage, was also discussed with Bragg’s team, the people said. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine criminal charges, including lying to Congress. While he was once close to Trump, his conviction and public statements critical of Trump would give the defense ammunition to aim to discredit him. The Times first reported that Cohen’s potential role as a witness factored into Bragg’s decision.\n\nIn recent weeks, Bragg was advised that the attorneys on the investigative team believed they gathered enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump committed crimes, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nBut by February 22, Bragg informed the prosecution team that he was not prepared to authorize charges against the former President, the person said.

The company is not at risk of being dismantled because there is no mechanism under New York law that would dissolve the company. However, a felony conviction could impact its ability to do business or obtain loans or contracts.\n\nThe guilty verdict comes as Trump is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors for his handling of classified documents, the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, and the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s business records and financial statements. He is also facing a $250 million civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general alleging he and his adult children were involved in a decade-long fraud. The attorney general is seeking to permanently bar them from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York state, among other penalties.\n\nTrump Org. attorneys said they plan to appeal.\n\n“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “The Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes. Today’s verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.”\n\nWhen asked on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday why charges weren’t brought against the former president, Bragg said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“This was a chapter in it. A case against the corporations,” Bragg said.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said Bragg’s approach has been vindicated.\n\n“Obviously, this is a setback for the Trump Org. – a major setback for the Trump Org. They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nHear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less. It’s a win-win – unless you’re the tax authorities.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Lauren Del Valle", "Kara Scannell", "Lauren Del Valle"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/donald-trump-investigations-lawsuits/index.html", "title": "The notable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAll eyes are on former President Donald Trump, whose third White House bid has already become mired in controversy.\n\nProsecutors, investigators and lawmakers in Washington, DC, New York, Georgia, Florida and across the United States are among those interested in what Trump has to say about the myriad legal issues facing the former president, his business and his allies.\n\nMultiple federal and state investigations are ongoing regarding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, his handling of sensitive government documents and his family business.\n\nTrump and his company deny any wrongdoing or criminality in all matters, state and federal, and has aggressively maintained his innocence.\n\nHere’s an updated list of notable investigations, lawsuits and controversies:\n\nTax returns: House Democrats win court battle to view documents\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee finally got access to the former president’s tax returns after the Supreme Court dealt a massive defeat to Trump, paving the way for the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the documents to the Democratic-led House.\n\nA federal appeals court sided with a House Ways and Means Committee request – originally made in 2019 – to obtain the returns, upholding a ruling from a Trump-nominated district court judge.\n\nTrump appealed to the Supreme Court, which rejected his appeal with no noted dissents.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sought the tax returns from the IRS in 2019, and the agency, under the Trump administration, initially resisted turning them over. The case moved slowly until 2021, when, under the Biden administration, the Justice Department changed its legal posture and concluded the IRS was obligated to comply with the committee’s request.\n\nMar-a-Lago documents: Did Trump mishandle classified material?\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has appointed special counsel Jack Smith to oversee the Justice Department criminal investigations into the retention of national defense information at Trump’s resort and parts of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nThe Justice Department investigation continues into whether documents from the Trump White House were illegally mishandled when they were brought to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after he left office. A federal grand jury in Washington has been empaneled and has interviewed potential witnesses to how Trump handled the documents.\n\nRELATED: The big numbers from the Mar-a-Lago search\n\nThe National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago – including some classified records.\n\nAny unauthorized retention or destruction of White House documents could violate a criminal law that prohibits the removal or destruction of official government records, legal experts told CNN.\n\n2020 election and January 6: House select committee\n\nThe House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack has uncovered dramatic evidence of Trump’s actions before and on January 6, especially efforts to use the levers of government to overturn the election.\n\nThe committee is expected to issue a report and to vote on whether to make criminal referrals to the Justice Department later this month, marking the end of its investigation.\n\nDuring the panel’s hearings this summer, fingers were pointed at GOP lawmakers and Trump allies who tried to help overturn the election and Trump White House officials who failed to stop the former president’s actions.\n\nThe House panel and Trump are also enmeshed in a legal fight over whether the former president must comply with a subpoena for documents and his testimony.\n\n2020 election and January 6: US Justice Department\n\nThe Justice Department has an investigation of its own into the post-2020 election period.\n\nWhile DOJ has not acted publicly during the so-called quiet period leading up to the midterms, a grand jury in Washington has been hearing from witnesses.\n\nRecently, DOJ moved to compel additional testimony from former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin.\n\nTrump has been fighting to keep former advisers from testifying about certain conversations, citing executive and attorney-client privileges to keep information confidential or slow down criminal investigators.\n\n2020 Election: Efforts to overturn Georgia results\n\nFulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis is overseeing a special grand jury investigating what Trump or his allies may have done in their efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia.\n\nThe probe was launched last year following Trump’s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he pushed the Republican to “find” votes to overturn the election results.\n\nWillis, a Democrat, has also informed all 16 of the individuals who signed an “unofficial electoral certificate,” which was ultimately sent to the National Archives in late 2020, that they may be indicted in the probe.\n\nThe investigation may be drawing closer to Trump as well. Former New York City Mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani has appeared before the grand jury, as has Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham lost a court bid to avoid testifying.\n\nWillis had pledged to wait until after the midterms to make announcements about possible charges.\n\n2020 Election: Fake GOP electors\n\nThe Justice Department, meanwhile, is looking at an aspect of a plot to put forward fake GOP electors from seven states.\n\nFake certificates were created by Trump allies in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Mexico, who sought to replace valid presidential electors from their states with a pro-Trump slate.\n\nTrump Organization convicted of criminal tax fraud\n\nTrump’s namesake business, the Trump Organization, was convicted this week by a New York jury of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors allege was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees.\n\nManhattan prosecutors told a jury the case is about “greed and cheating,” laying out an alleged 15-year scheme within the Trump Organization to pay high-level executives in perks like luxury cars and apartments without paying taxes on them.\n\nFormer Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded guilty to his role in the tax scheme this summer. He testified in the trial but did not cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nTrump Organization: NY attorney general investigation\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, after a lengthy investigation, sued Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization in September, alleging they were involved in an expansive fraud lasting over a decade that the former president used to enrich himself.\n\nJames alleged the fraud touched all aspects of the Trump business, including its properties and golf courses. According to the lawsuit, the Trump Organization deceived lenders, insurers and tax authorities by inflating the value of his properties using misleading appraisals.\n\nJames is seeking $250 million in allegedly ill-gotten funds.\n\nRetired Judge Barbara Jones has been named to serve as a monitor over the company. James said one is needed to prevent the real estate company from continuing what the state has alleged is a decade-long fraud.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has called the investigation politically motivated based on James’ electoral ambitions.\n\nA trial is set for October 2023.\n\nTrump Organization: NY DA criminal investigation\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg inherited that office’s probe into Trump’s businesses, but it has slowed significantly.\n\nProsecutors were focusing on the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s financial statements when seeking financing, people familiar with the matter have told CNN.\n\nEarlier this year, Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz, two senior prosecutors on the team, resigned after Bragg informed them that he wasn’t prepared to move forward with criminal charges, CNN’s Kara Scannell has reported.\n\nA special grand jury hearing evidence in the case expired in April, but a new one could be seated in the future.\n\nBragg has maintained the investigation is ongoing and prosecutors are reviewing new evidence. He said he will issue a public statement or an indictment when it’s completed.\n\nJanuary 6: Lawsuits by police officers\n\nSeveral members of the US Capitol Police and Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police are suing Trump, saying his words and actions incited the riot.\n\nThe various cases accuse Trump of directing assault and battery; aiding and abetting assault and battery; and violating local Washington, DC, laws that prohibit incitement of riots and disorderly conduct.\n\nA federal judge in February said Trump’s statements to his supporters before the riot are “the essence of civil conspiracy,” and lawsuits by the police officers have been allowed to proceed.\n\nTrump and his top advisers have not been charged with any crimes. Trump and others who are sued have argued they are not responsible for the actions of the people who stormed the Capitol.\n\nA federal appeals court this week heard Trump’s attempt to throw out the cases.\n\nE. Jean Carroll: Defamation suit over Trump’s denial of rape claims\n\nMagazine writer E. Jean Carroll alleged Trump raped her in a New York department store dressing room in the mid 1990s and defamed her when he denied the rape, said she was not his “type” and alleged she made the claim to boost sales of her book.\n\nTrump and the Justice Department said Trump was a federal employee and his statements denying Carroll’s allegations were made in response to reporters’ questions while he was at the White House. They argue the Justice Department should be substituted as the defendant, which, because the government cannot be sued for defamation, would end the lawsuit.\n\nIn September, a federal appeals court in New York ruled that Trump was a federal employee when he denied Carroll’s claim of rape and sexual assault.\n\nEarly next year, the Washington, DC, appeals court will determine if Trump was acting within the scope of his employment when he made the allegedly defamatory statements. Meanwhile, the judge overseeing the lawsuit has set a trial for early February.\n\nCarroll has also sued Trump for battery and defamation.\n\nMichael Cohen: Claims of retaliation against Trump and Barr – Trump victory\n\nTrump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, sued Trump, former Attorney General William Barr and others, alleging they put him back in jail to prevent him from promoting his upcoming book while under home confinement.\n\nCohen was serving the remainder of his sentence for lying to Congress and campaign violations at home, due to Covid-19 concerns, when he started an anti-Trump social media campaign in summer 2020. In retaliation, Cohen said he was sent back to prison and spent 16 days in solitary.\n\nA federal judge on November 14 threw out the lawsuit. District Judge Lewis Liman said he was empathetic to Cohen’s position but said Supreme Court precedent bars him from allowing the case to move forward.\n\nMary Trump: Accusations of deception regarding inheritance – Trump victory\n\nIn 2020, Mary Trump sued her uncle Donald Trump, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired judge, and the executor of her late uncle Robert Trump’s estate, alleging “they designed and carried out a complex scheme to siphon funds away from her interests, conceal their grift, and deceive her about the true value of what she had inherited.”\n\nOn November 14, a New York state judge threw out the lawsuit, saying that Mary Trump’s claims are barred by an earlier settlement she reached over 20 years ago.\n\nMary Trump has appealed the ruling.\n\nPersonal retaliation: Peter Strzok lawsuit\n\nFormer top FBI counter-intelligence official Peter Strzok, who was terminated by the FBI in 2018 after the revelation of anti-Trump texts Strzok exchanged with a top lawyer at the bureau, Lisa Page, has sued DOJ alleging he was improperly terminated. Strzok is now seeking to depose Trump for the case, though the judge has not said yet how she’ll rule on a DOJ request to block the deposition.\n\nStrzok and Page were constant targets of verbal attacks by Trump and his allies as part of the larger ire Trump expressed toward the FBI during the Trump-Russia investigation. Trump repeatedly and publicly called for Strzok’s ouster until Strzok was fired in August 2018.\n\nPersonal retaliation: Alexander Vindman – Trump allies victory\n\nA federal judge recently dismissed a lawsuit from star Trump impeachment witness Alexander Vindman, who had accused Donald Trump Jr., Rudy Giuliani and former Trump White House staffers of smearing him so that he lost his federal job. Former President Trump was not named in the suit.\n\nVindman alleged the defendants conspired against him to cause him harm after Trump’s first impeachment proceeding.\n\nJudge James Boasberg of the DC District Court wrote that Vindman wasn’t able to show the group worked together with the “specific goal of intimidating Vindman from testifying or performing his job” or injure him by taking unlawful action.\n\nTrump-filed lawsuits: Hillary Clinton, Democrats, ex-FBI officials and more\n\nA federal judge in September dismissed Trump’s lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, several ex-FBI officials and more than two dozen other people and entities that he claims conspired to undermine his 2016 campaign by trying to vilify him with fabricated information tying him to Russia.\n\n“What (Trump’s lawsuit) lacks in substance and legal support it seeks to substitute with length, hyperbole, and the settling of scores and grievances,” US District Judge Donald Middlebrooks wrote.\n\nTrump is appealing the decision, but Middlebrooks this month also ordered Trump lawyers Alina Habba, Michael Madaio, Peter Ticktin, Jamie Alan Sasson and their law firms to pay $50,000 in penalties to the court and $16,274.23 in legal fees to Charles Dolan, one of more than two dozen people or entities named as defendants in the lawsuit.\n\nTrump-filed lawsuits: The New York Times, Mary Trump and CNN\n\nThe former president is suing his niece and The New York Times in New York state court over the disclosure of his tax information.\n\nDonald Trump’s lawsuit – which is seeking “damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but believed to be no less than One Hundred Million Dollars” – alleges that Mary Trump’s disclosure of the tax information to the Times amounted to an illegal breach of contract, among other claims, because the disclosure allegedly violated the 2001 settlement agreement among the Trump family.\n\nThe Times has planned to fight the lawsuit.\n\n“The Times’s coverage of Donald Trump’s taxes helped inform the public through meticulous reporting on a subject of overriding public interest,” the Times said in a statement. “This lawsuit is an attempt to silence independent news organizations and we plan to vigorously defend against it.”\n\nDonald Trump also sued CNN last month in a southern Florida court, accusing the network of a “campaign of dissuasion in the form of libel and slander” that “escalated in recent months.”\n\nA CNN spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Dan Berman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/17/house-gop-hearing-new-york-crime-or-trump/11682503002/", "title": "OnPolitics: House Judiciary hearing and crime, Bragg and Trump", "text": "Hi there OnPolitics readers.

What you need to know about the arraignment and charges\n\nTrump lashes out at Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg\n\nTrump attacked Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg during his remarks to supporters at Mar-A-Lago on Tuesday evening. At one point, Trump called Bragg a \"local failed district attorney.\"\n\n\"I never thought anything like this could happen in America,\" Trump said. Trump also attacked Bragg's family.\n\nTrump isn't the only one on the attack.

Meet the attorneys representing Trump.\n\n— Sarah Elbeshbishi, Sudiksha Kochi and Ken Tran\n\nFormer tabloid publisher David Pecker, a likely co-star witness to Michael Cohen\n\nFormer Trump attorney Michael Cohen remains a central figure in the criminal case outlined Tuesday against the former president.\n\nBut court documents unsealed by Manhattan prosecutors also suggest that former tabloid publisher David Pecker is likely to co-star at any future trial.\n\nPecker, the former chairman of American Media Inc., was not only a central player in the alleged hush money scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels, but the company also is intertwined with similar payments to silence former Playboy model Karen McDougal about a long-running affair and a former Trump Tower doorman, who claimed knowledge of a child Trump allegedly fathered out of wedlock.\n\nUntil Tuesday, the case against Trump was largely believed to be centered on the $130,000 payment to Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\n\nBut Bragg said Tuesday that the case against Trump is “not just one $130,000 wire payment.”\n\nThe broader case likely elevates Pecker’s role in it and helps explain Pecker’s second appearance before a Manhattan grand jury last week before prosecutors had disclosed the panel had returned a sealed indictment against the former president.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nWhat are Trump's 34 charges?:He's accused of falsifying business records in hush-money payments\n\nArraignment finally forced Trump to \"keep his mouth shut,\" former Watergate lawyer and witness says\n\nJohn Dean, lawyer and former White House counsel for President Richard Nixon during Watergate, said he has never seen Trump so humbled and cowed by an attempt to hold him accountable.\n\nWatching Trump enter the courthouse and be arraigned, Dean said, “This is the first time I've seen him ever acknowledge accountability, where he had to keep his mouth shut and it was somebody else's proceeding.”\n\n“I've never seen him with less bravado and more passive,” Dean said. “It was really quite remarkable.

Todd Blanche, one of the lawyers, said the indictment doesn’t allege what statements were false.\n\n“It’s really disappointing. It’s sad,” Blanche said. “We’re going to fight it and we’re going to fight it hard.”\n\nBlanche described Trump as upset the district attorney brought a case that wasn’t justified.\n\nThe lawyers said Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan admonished everyone in the case, including witnesses, to consider their public comments.\n\n“He did not admonish the president,” lawyer Joe Tacopina said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump pleads not guilty in historic first case of criminal charges against a former president, reports say\n\nDonald Trump pleaded not guilty Tuesday in New York to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the unprecedented case of the first criminal charges against a former U.S. president in history.\n\nHis plea came in response to a Manhattan grand jury’s indictment of Trump on Thursday.

MAGA!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump tweets about 'surreal' feeling of facing imminent arrest\n\nFormer President Donald Trump issued a short message on his TruthSocial social media platform just before surrendering to authorities at the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office on Tuesday, saying his imminent arrest felt “surreal.”\n\n“Heading to Lower Manhattan, the Courthouse,” Trump posted minutes before arriving at the Hogan Building at approximately 1:23 p.m. “Seems so SURREAL — WOW, they are going to ARREST ME. Can’t believe this is happening in America. MAGA!”\n\nTrump then left his black limousine, surrounded by his Secret Service protective detail and what looked like a few lawyers and aides ,entered the building and surrendered and was placed under arrest.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nTrump gives a wave before surrender\n\nDonald Trump arrived at the Manhattan courthouse Tuesday after a brief motorcade from his Trump Tower residence.\n\nWearing a serious expression, he exited an armored vehicle, gave a wave and turned with his Secret Service detail who escorted the former president to the custody of New York authorities.\n\nIt was less than dramatic, except for the television helicopters.\n\nAs the TV cameras whirred from above, Trump simply entered the district attorney's office – the Hogan building – surrounded by Secret Serve and what looked like a few lawyers and aides.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene in NY:As Marjorie Taylor Greene leads protest against Trump indictment, NYC mayor has a message for her\n\nWho is Stormy Daniels?\n\nStormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress central to the Manhattan hush money investigation, alleged that former President Donald Trump had consensual sex with her in 2006 – months after Melanie Trump gave birth.\n\nTrump’s then-attorney and personal fixer, Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 to Daniels just before the 2016 election to silence claims that she had an affair with Trump after she was willing to go public about the scandal.\n\nDaniels’ longtime lawyer Clark Brewster told USA TODAY she was surprised when she heard the news about Trump's indictment, even though a few weeks ago, she said she would “dance down the street” if Trump was indicted.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhite House draws distinction between Trump case and Jan. 6\n\nPresident Joe Biden is staying silent on former President Donald Trump’s arraignment despite having had plenty to say about the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol because the incidents are very different, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday.\n\nThe insurrection at the Capitol, she said, was an attack on democracy.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is being arraigned as part of an ongoing criminal investigation, Jean-Pierre added.\n\n“And so, it was a different moment and a different time,” she said when pressed on why Biden is using the fact that Trump’s case is continuing as a reason not to comment when he talked about Jan. 6 while criminal cases were being made against accused insurrectionists.\n\n“We’re not going to politically interfere from here,” Jean-Pierre emphasized about the Manhattan District Attorney’s case against Trump.\n\n--Maureen Groppe\n\nWhy was Trump indicted?\n\nAfter a years-long investigation, Trump was indicted by a grand jury last Thursday in connection with hush-money payments intended to silence two women who claimed to have had sex with the former president. Trump directed Michael Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, to make the payments to silence Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in the days before the 2016 election.\n\nWhile the payments were not necessarily illegal, the charges, soon to be unveiled Tuesday, are expected to allege that Trump falsified business records related to the hush-money payments.\n\nTrump and his legal team have denied wrongdoing and plan to fight the charges.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhite House: Biden not focusing on Trump’s arrest\n\nPresident Joe Biden, like the rest of the nation, may not be able to avoid seeing footage of his predecessor being arraigned in New York Tuesday.\n\nBut that doesn't mean he's paying attention, his spokeswoman said.\n\n“Of course, this is playing out on many of the networks here on a daily basis for hours and hours. So obviously he will catch part of the news when he has a moment to catch up on the news of the day,” Jean-Pierre said at her daily briefing. “But this is not his focus for today.”\n\nShe repeated past comments that the White House will not comment “on any ongoing case.”\n\n“Our focus right now is on the American people,” she said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nChuck Schumer: Trump will get fair trial; protests must be peaceful\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Trump would get a fair trial that follows the facts and law. But Schumer, who fled the mob that ransacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, also insisted any protests against the charges must remain peaceful.\n\n“There’s no place in our justice system for any outside influence or intimidation in the legal process,” Schumer said in a statement. “AS the trial proceeds, protest is an American right but all protests must be peaceful.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump, Secret Service departed Trump Tower before short drive to court\n\nDonald Trump left his namesake Manhattan residence Tuesday afternoon on his way to surrender to New York authorities as the first former president to face criminal prosecution.\n\nAccompanied by his Secret Service detail, the former president’s motorcade is expected to travel the estimated four miles to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office where he will be processed and later arraigned.\n\nTrump’s surrender has been transformed into a public spectacle, as cameras have tracked his movements since leaving his Florida estate Monday.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nTrump mug shot not expected, lawyer says\n\nDonald Trump is not expected to be subjected to a mug shot following his surrender to New York authorities, the former president's attorney Joe Tacopina said Tuesday.\n\nThe attorney did not elaborate on the reason, but a person familiar with the matter said the decision was ultimately made by the district attorney's office.\n\nBecause Trump is the first former president in history to face criminal charges, there was much anticipation that such a photograph would go viral or that Trump could use it as a fundraising tool in his bid to reclaim the White House.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nWhat will happen after Trump is arraigned?\n\nThe arraignment marks the start of criminal proceedings. Bragg announced the indictment Thursday and is expected to unveil the detailed charges Tuesday.\n\nTrump is expected to have his mug shot and fingerprints taken, have the formal charges read and then plead not guilty “loudly and proudly,” his lawyer Joe Tacopina told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. But the details haven’t been nailed down because the Secret Service will accompany Trump, Tacopina said.\n\nTrump's New York arraignment comes as he's under investigation elsewhere\n\nHowever the New York case is resolved, Trump faces other investigations in Georgia over alleged election fraud and from the Justice Department over whether he incited the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack and the discovery of hundreds of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nTrump has boasted about overcoming previous investigations including special counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election and two House impeachments that resulted in Senate acquittals over his dealings with Ukraine and his role in the Capitol attack.\n\nTrump to go on legal assault, experts say:Donald Trump expected to unleash wave of legal challenges after Tuesday arraignment in New York\n\nTrump's arraignment spectacle:Donald Trump plans to turn his arraignment into a political spectacle. Here's how.\n\nTrump allies including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene rally near courthouse\n\nCheers, boos and whistles drowned out Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., as she spoke briefly outside the Manhattan Criminal Court building before Donald Trump’s arraignment on criminal charges.\n\nOne attendee, Christina Lo, 61, a Manhattan retiree who supports Trump, called his indictment political persecution by Democrats.\n\n\"They had to wait until he declared his presidential run,\" she said.\n\nDion Cini, 54, of Brooklyn, carried a large “Trump or death” flag to show his support for the former president.\n\n“It’s a tragedy what’s happening in New York City today,” Cini said, adding the case could help the candidate running for the White House in 2024. “I think Donald Trump is going to get 20 points in the polls.”\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas and Zach Wichter\n\nNYC mayor's message to Greene:As Marjorie Taylor Greene leads protest against Trump indictment, NYC mayor has a message for her\n\nTrump could seek delays in criminal case: legal experts\n\nAfter New York charges against him are unsealed, Donald Trump could pursue a number of legal challenges that could delay any eventual trial, according to legal experts.\n\nTrump could try to dismiss the case, change the venue where it is heard and perhaps seek to have a new judge preside. If the charges are falsifying business records as expected, Sarah Krissoff, a former federal prosecutor, said Trump lawyers could claim the alleged violations are too old or exceed the statute of limitations of two to five years.\n\nTrump has said in a social media post Thursday that Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Mercan hates him, after presiding over a criminal case against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer.\n\n\"It is an understatement to say that he (Trump) has a litigious style,\" said Joshua Ritter, a former Los Angeles County prosecutor. \"You're going to see challenges to everything, every step of the way.\"\n\n– Kevin Johnson and David Jackson\n\nTrump expected to go on legal assault:Donald Trump expected to unleash wave of legal challenges after Tuesday arraignment in New York\n\nDonald Trump blaming George Soros while fundraising off indictment\n\nFormer President Donald Trump continues to seek political donations after his indictment, using anti-Semitic tropes that blame Democratic philanthropist George Soros in addition to longstanding themes he’s used like attacking investigations of him as witch hunts.\n\nSoros is a frequent target of antisemitic attacks on the far-right even in his home country of Hungary. As recently as Sunday, according to an archive at politicalemails.org, a campaign email referred to Alvin Bragg, the prosecutor whose office brought the case to the New York grand jury, as “George Soros’ hand-picked and funded Manhattan DA.”\n\nMoney raised by these emails will be split between Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and a fund called Save America that has spent millions since the 2020 election paying lawyers who have worked for Trump, including on the case that prompted the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nHouse GOP chairmen oppose gag order on Trump as ‘unconstitutional’\n\nTwo House Republican chairmen opposed an anticipated gag order on Donald Trump pending his New York trial.\n\nReps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, head of the Judiciary Committee, and James Comer, head of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, called any potential order from Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan against Trump speaking about the charges unconstitutional.\n\n“We are deeply concerned by reports the New York District Attorney may seek an unconstitutional gag order,” the chairmen said in a joint statement. “To put any restrictions on the ability of President Trump to discuss his mistreatment at the hands of this politically motivated prosecutor would only further demonstrate the weaponization of the New York justice system.”\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump protests\n\nSteel barriers lined streets near the courthouse, roads were closed, and traffic was diverted across a swath of Manhattan on Tuesday in preparation for the arraignment of Trump.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams on Monday urged potential protesters to follow police instructions and threatened anyone who becomes violent with arrest. Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said the department has been preparing for the arraignment for weeks.\n\n\"I will remind everyone that violence and destruction are not part of legitimate lawful expression,\" he said at a briefing Monday. \"It will never be tolerated in our city.\"\n\nTrump called on his supporters to take to the streets of New York City and protest his arrest.\n\n-- John Bacon and Zach Wichter\n\nWhat time is Trump's arraignment? Trump's plans from NY to Florida\n\nAs it stands now, Trump is scheduled to leave his self-named tower around 1 p.m. for the trip to the district attorney's office and courthouse that should take about a half-an-hour, according to his schedule.\n\nAfter a formal surrender and processing, Trump is scheduled for arraignment at 2:15 p.m.\n\nThe schedule anticipates a 3 p.m. departure from the courthouse to the airport for the trip to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump is scheduled to arrive back at his Palm Beach home in time for an 8:15 p.m. speech to supporters.\n\nAll of this is subject to change depending on events.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat are the charges facing Trump?\n\nWitnesses before the Manhattan grand jury have described hush-money payments Trump directed former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen to make to silence two women who claimed to have had sex with Trump before the 2016 election.\n\nLegal experts expect a combination of misdemeanor charges alleging falsification of business records about the payments, combined with a felony such as a campaign finance violation.\n\nBut Trump has denied wrongdoing and Tacopina said there is no documentation of false business records.\n\n“All of the Tuesday stuff is very much up in the air except that we will very loudly and proudly say not guilty,” Tacopina said. “We’re not doing anything at the arraignment because that would be showmanship and nothing more because we haven’t even seen the indictment.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Trump indicted: How did Michael Cohen arrange hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal?\n\nTrump judge expected to be same as for Trump Organization case\n\nThe New York judge tentatively assigned to preside at Donald Trump’s arraignment is familiar with players in the former president’s orbit.\n\nActing Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan oversaw the fraud trial of Trump's namesake real estate company and the related Trump Payroll Corporation, which ended in December with a conviction and $1.6 million in fines.\n\nMerchan also oversaw the sentencing of former Trump financial chief Allen Weisselberg, whose testimony in the fraud case helped secure the convictions.\n\nTrump has harshly criticized Merchan in posts on his social media company, Truth Social.\n\n\"The Judge 'assigned' to my Witch Hunt Case, a 'Case' that has NEVER BEEN CHARGED BEFORE, HATES ME,\" Trump wrote in one post.\n\n– Kevin Johnson, Josh Meyer, David Jackson\n\nWhat is an arraignment?:What the legal proceeding means ahead of Trump's appearance Tuesday.\n\nWho is judge in Trump arraignment?:Juan Merchan, judge in Trump Organization trial, expected to preside at Trump arraignment\n\nLawyers for Trump, Cohen argue against each other’s credibility\n\nTacopina and Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, foreshadowed the fight over credibility in any eventual trial.\n\nTacopina called Cohen a convicted liar who \"is constitutionally incapable of telling the same story the same way twice.\" Tacopina said there is no documentation of Trump falsifying business records.\n\n“I know there is no such evidence,” Tacopina said. “Michael Cohen is a pathological, convicted liar.”\n\nDavis said Cohen and other witnesses have provided testimony and documentation. Cohen has already been imprisoned in part because he arranged for $280,000 in hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.\n\n“Michael Cohen submitted a lot of documentation,” Davis said. “There are other documents from other people and other testimony from other people.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nNew York mayor warns Trump protesters to ‘control yourselves’\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams on Monday urged potential protesters for Donald Trump’s arraignment – he singled out Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. – to be on their best behavior and threatened anyone who becomes violent with arrest.\n\n“While there may be some rabble-rousers thinking about coming to our city tomorrow, our message is clear and simple: control yourselves,” Adams said.\n\nHe said there were no specific threats. But he said people like Greene, “who is known to spread misinformation and hate speech,” are expected to visit the city. New York Young Republicans announced she would attend a 10:30 a.m. rally Tuesday at Collect Pond Park.\n\n“While you are in town, be on your best behavior,” Adams said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhat is a grand jury?:Here's what to know about the jury that voted to indict Trump.\n\nStormy Daniels says she's received death threats since Trump indictment\n\nStormy Daniels says she is “kind of numb” now that the hush-money investigation stemming from her alleged affair with Donald Trump in 2006 has led to his criminal indictment – and that it has prompted death threats against her.\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, told the Times UK that the charges by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office amount to a vindication of her efforts to hold the former president accountable. But in her first interview since Trump’s indictment last Thursday, she said the as-yet-unspecific charges have put her in more personal danger than ever before.\n\n“The first time it was like gold digger, slut, whore. You know, liar, whatever and this time it's like, ‘I'm gonna murder you,’ “ she said of the threatening messages she has been getting.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nStormy Daniels faces threats:Stormy Daniels' accusations against Trump prompt post-indictment death threats, she says", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/04"}]}

Hugo Burnand/Royal Household 2023/AP In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next\n\nThe moment Elizabeth II died, her eldest child, Charles, automatically became monarch. As sovereign, he has chosen to take the name King Charles III.\n\nAll rights and responsibilities of the Crown now rest with King Charles III.\n\nHe becomes head of state not just in the UK but in 14 other Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada. He will become head of the 56-member Commonwealth, although that is not a hereditary position, after his succession to the role was agreed by Commonwealth leaders at a meeting in London in 2018.\n\nHe has become head of the British Armed Forces, the judiciary and the civil service, and he is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He is the Fount of Honour, which means all honors, such as knighthoods, will now be given in his name.\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution, so the role of monarchy is defined by convention rather than law. He has a duty to remain politically impartial, which means he will come under greater scrutiny if he continues to express the views he is known for.\n\nHe has championed alternative medicines and organic farming techniques. In 1984, he hit out at the “glass stumps and concrete towers” of modern architecture. He has spent decades warning of the dangers of climate change. In the so-called “black spider” memos, he raised the issues he was concerned about directly with ministers.\n\nIn a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Charles acknowledged having ruffled feathers with his past interventions. But he promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once sovereign, saying he would operate within “the constitutional parameters.”\n\nElizabeth stayed “above politics” and never expressed herself in any way on any issue and as a result she rarely divided opinion. She managed to retain popular support and cross-party support in parliament, which was the one body with the power to dethrone her.\n\nWe will never know what she discussed in her regular audiences with her prime ministers, beginning with Churchill, but Charles is a more outspoken character. Will he go quiet on policy matters in public but continue to lobby in private? Will the prime minister act on it?\n\nThe prime ministerial audiences are one of several constitutional duties to which King Charles III will be expected to step up and they will bring him in regular contact with policymakers. He appoints the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, approves legislation and official appointments, receives the credentials of foreign ambassadors and hosts world leaders on state visits.\n\nCharles has also adopted the symbolic position as Head of Nation, meaning he becomes the symbol of national identity, unity, and pride. He represents continuity and celebrates excellence on behalf of the country. That’s why we see the monarch opening national events and leading commemorations.\n\nPeople would look to Elizabeth in times of crisis, but will they rally around King Charles III in the same way? He is more divisive not just because of his honest views but also because of the bad taste still left from his acrimonious divorce from his immensely popular first wife, Diana.\n\nAll the official royal residences including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will now be under his control. There are also other residences such as Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk which the Queen owned privately – and the nation will have to see to whom she leaves them in her will.\n\nEither way, Charles’ wealth has ballooned. By far the biggest slice of the family’s fortune, the £16.5 billion ($19 billion) Crown Estate, now belongs to him as reigning monarch. But under an arrangement dating back to 1760, the monarch hands over all profits from the estate to the government in return for a slice, called the Sovereign Grant.\n\nThe estate includes vast swathes of central London property and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It has the status of a corporation and is managed by a chief executive and commissioners — or non-executive directors — appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\nThe grant, which covers the cost of his official duties and amounted to £86.3 million ($99.2 million) for the 2021/2022 financial year. He will take charge of the Royal Collection, which includes one of the most valuable art collections in the world. He also picks up the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate dating back to 1265, which was valued at about £653 million ($764 million) according to its most recent accounts. Income from its investments cover official costs not met by the Sovereign Grant, and helps support other Royal family members.\n\nKing Charles III has become one of the richest men in England overnight.\n\nCamilla\n\nCharles and Camilla attend the Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel on June 13, 2022 in Windsor, England. Toby Melville/Getty Images\n\nFor years, the big question around Charles’ wife surrounded her title. At the time their wedding was announced in February 2005, the official statement said: “It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH The Princess Consort when The Prince of Wales accedes to The Throne.” That was a very clear signal that Camilla would not use the title of Queen. Her office at Clarence House distanced itself from that statement in the intervening years, however, saying it was a matter for the reigning monarch.\n\nThen, in February 2022, the Queen expressed her desire for her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort when Charles became King in a message marking the start of her platinum jubilee year – a statement that appeared to resolve the issue for good.\n\nThe Queen’s wishes were welcomed by the couple themselves. That same weekend, a statement released by a spokesperson said they had been “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”\n\nWhere will the couple live? Well, traditionally the new monarch would move into Buckingham Palace but in 2011, the BBC reported that Charles was considering moving his entire court to Windsor and turning Buckingham Palace into an events center. That would be a dramatic and controversial shift but might also assert King Charles III as the new boss.\n\nWilliam and Catherine\n\nWilliam and Catherine are pictured with their children, George, Charlotte and Louis, and the Queen, Charles and Camilla at Buckingham Palace during platinum jubilee celebrations on June 5, 2022. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nUp until now, Charles has been responsible for covering the costs of his heir, Prince William.\n\nWilliam has now inherited his father’s titles of The Duke of Cornwall, which comes with an estate which last year delivered an income of £23 million ($26 million). That money now goes straight to William and he becomes independently wealthy.\n\nHis new title is HRH The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge and tradition dictates that, as first in line to the throne, he also becomes Prince of Wales. And Catherine becomes Her Royal Highness, The Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nWilliam and Catherine will be able to solidify their own independent court, which is currently based at Kensington Palace in west London, in an apartment that was refurbished shortly after their marriage. It seems unlikely that William would want to move, so the King’s former residences, including Clarence House and Birkhall in the Scottish Highlands, will likely remain vacant until Charles offers them to other members of the family, or finds an alternative use. The family resides at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor during school term time.\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will follow their parents’ titling. They are now Their Royal Highnesses Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cornwall and Cambridge. Colloquially they are likely to be known as George, Charlotte and Louis Wales.\n\nHarry and Meghan\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry react as they attend the annual One Young World Summit in Manchester, north-west England on September 5, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt’s unlikely that Charles’ second son, Harry, will be offered a royal office unless he and wife Meghan return to their royal duties, and the King would also need to confirm that they can continue to use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, which is part of the royal estate. They currently live with son Archie and daughter Lilibet in California but were allowed to continue using Frogmore as their official residence during the Queen’s reign.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced in early 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties, they said they would “work to become financially independent.” The terms of the split stipulated that while the pair would always remain part of the family, they would no longer use their HRH titles.\n\nAs grandchildren of the monarch, Archie now automatically becomes Prince Archie of Sussex while Lilibet will be Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Whether they use those titles will only become known the first time their parents refer to them publicly.\n\nPrince Andrew and other family members\n\nKing Charles III also becomes responsible for distributing roles, responsibilities and resources to other members of the royal family.\n\nCharles has never been close to his brother Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties over his links to the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022 he was stripped of his HRH title, as well as others associated with the military and charity roles. That raises the question of whether the new King continues to allow Andrew to use his Buckingham Palace apartment and offers financial support.\n\nThen there are his other siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and more distant relatives such as the Gloucesters and Kents who retain royal residences at Kensington.\n\nPrincess Anne attends a service at St Giles' Cathedral on June 30, 2022 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nCharles will need to decide how much family support he needs to carry out his duties and who he wants to offer it. Then he can reveal what support he offers in return. Many of these decisions would already have been taken and the first telling signs of where his loyalties lie will be seen in who gets to keep which residences and especially who gets an upgrade.\n\nAnne and Edward, and his wife Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, are expected to continue with their public duties following decades of dedicated service but the new King needs to balance that against pressure for a slimmed down monarchy in austere times.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/05/05/king-charles-iii-grandchildren-are-young-royals-attending-coronation/70173395007/", "title": "King Charles III grandchildren: Did young royals attend coronation?", "text": "King Charles III may be the star of his coronation, but we can’t forget about the royal kids.\n\nThe king, who has five grandchildren between sons Prince William and Prince Harry, shared the spotlight with the young royals when they joined as many as 2,800 guests for his coronation on May 6 at Westminster Abbey.\n\nWhether it’s Prince George's comical excitement during the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, Princess Charlotte's solemn grace at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II or Prince Louis' colorful facial expression at the Trooping the Colour parade, these monarchs-in-waiting know how to mark an occasion.\n\nHere’s everything to know about Charles' grandchildren's participation in their grandpa's big day.\n\nMore:Everything that happened at King Charles III's coronation\n\nDid King Charles' grandchildren attend the coronation?\n\nKing Charles' grandchildren Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, children of Prince William and Princess Kate, all attended the coronation alongside their parents.

The last coronation took place for the late Queen Elizabeth II on June 2, 1953.\n\nOn April 9, Buckingham Palace announced the official plan for Charles' coronation service including his procession route from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey to the coronation procession after being crowned.\n\nHere's everything we know about Charles' big day.\n\nMore:Everything that happened at King Charles III's coronation\n\nWhen is King Charles' coronation?\n\nCharles' coronation will take place on May 6. The official service will begin at Westminster Abbey at 6 a.m. EST (11 a.m. British Standard Time).\n\nPrior to the coronation service, Charles and Camilla will be traveling from Buckingham Palace in the Diamond Jubilee state coach.\n\nWho is attending?\n\nMuch of the royal family will be there, including Prince Harry, who will attend while his wife, Duchess Meghan, will stay in California with their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. Archie's birthday falls on the same day as the coronation.\n\nPrince William, who is first in line to the throne, and his wife Princess Kate will likely play a major role in the coronation.\n\nWilliam and Kate's 9-year-old son Prince George, who is second in line to the throne, is one of the eight selected \"Pages of Honour\" selected to tend Charles and Camilla on coronation day.\n\nIt's unclear what role, if any, the Prince and Princess of Wales' daughter Princess Charlotte, 7, and youngest son Prince Louis, 5, will have at the coronation.\n\nWhat is the king's procession route?\n\nCharles and Camilla will depart Buckingham Palace, proceed down The Mall, pass through the Admiralty Arch leading to Trafalgar Square, continue past Whitehall, and travel along Parliament Street to Broad Sanctuary before finally reaching the Sanctuary building of Westminster Abbey, where the coronation service will begin.\n\nThe couple will be traveling in the Diamond Jubilee state coach, which was created to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Elizabeth II's reign in 2012.\n\nThe coach's interior includes samples of wood, metals and other materials from Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace, Windsor Castle, St Paul’s Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, the historic Mary Rose ship and other notable landmarks in British history.\n\nWhat happens at King Charles' coronation?\n\nThe coronation will be a solemn religious ceremony, known as Operation Golden Orb, presided over by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at Westminster Abbey.\n\nCharles will arrive in the King's Robe of State, a crimson velvet robe worn by his grandfather King George VI at his coronation in 1937.\n\nIn the most sacred part of the service, the Archbishop of Canterbury will anoint the king with oil, consecrating him and setting him apart from his subjects. A screen will cover Charles at this moment, and the anointing won’t be visible on television or to most people in the abbey, except for a few senior members of the clergy.\n\nThis will be followed by the presentation of the coronation regalia, sacred objects like the orb and scepter that symbolize the monarch’s power and responsibilities.\n\nIn another innovation that reflects the changed religious landscape in Britain, members of the House of Lords from the Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh traditions will present the king with objects with no explicit Christian symbolism.\n\nFollowing tradition, Charles will be crowned with St. Edward's crown. The crown was made for King Charles II in 1661 as a replacement for a medieval crown that melted down in 1649.\n\nCharles' mother, Queen Elizabeth, wore the same crown at her 1953 coronation.\n\nWill Camilla be crowned?\n\nPer tradition, Camilla will be coronated alongside Charles in a \"similar but simpler ceremony,\" according to Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe queen consort will arrive in a crimson velvet Robe of State like Charles. Camilla's was originally made for Elizabeth II in 1953.\n\nCamilla will be crowned with Queen Mary's crown, marking the first time an existing crown was used for the queen consort's coronation.\n\nWhat will King Charles, Camilla do after the coronation?\n\nAfter being crowned, Charles and Camilla will participate in the coronation procession, taking the same route from Westminster Abbey back to Buckingham Palace.Charles will change into the Robe of Estate, a purple silk velvet robe with gold embroidery that was originally worn by King George VI. Camilla will also change into a Robe of Estate, but her is being made from scratch.\n\nThe couple will travel in the Gold State coach, which has been used at every coronation since 1831. The coach was last used for Elizabeth II during her Platinum Jubilee pageant in June.\n\nTheir Majesties procession to Buckingham Palace will be a bigger event including armed forces from across the British Commonwealth and overseas territories. Upon return, the couple will receive a Royal Salute and three cheers from the military service personnel.\n\nCharles and Camilla will be joined by other members of the royal family and an appearance on the palace balcony once the procession concludes.\n\nWho is performing at the coronation concert?\n\nOn May 7, there will be a special coronation concert at Windsor Castle open to a ticketed audience. The concert will be broadcast in the U.K. on BBC.\n\nBBC announced the long-awaited list of performers on April 14, which includes \"American Idol\" judges Lionel Richie and Katy Perry as well as local British stars Take That, Andrea Bocelli, Sir Bryn Terfel, Freya Ridings and Alexis Ffrench.\n\nA choir drawn from amateur troupes across the U.K., including refugee choirs, National Health Service choirs, LGBTQ singing groups and deaf signing choirs are also expected to perform. The \"Coronation Choir'' will perform alongside another one made up of singers from across the Commonwealth who will appear virtually during the televised concert.\n\nWhat else is happening around the U.K. for the coronation?\n\nThe palace is asking neighborhoods around the nation to take part in the \"Coronation Big Lunch'' on May 7 – the latest incarnation of the block parties that have become a staple of big royal celebrations.\n\nOn May 8, the palace is inviting people around the country to take part in ''The Big Help Out,'' encouraging them to volunteer in their own communities.\n\n\"The Big Help Out will encourage people to try volunteering for themselves and join the work being undertaken to support their local areas,'' the palace said in a statement. \"The aim of The Big Help Out is to use volunteering to bring communities together and create a lasting volunteering legacy from the coronation weekend.''\n\nA full list of local coronation activities is located here.\n\nContributing: Danica Kirka, The Associated Press\n\nRead all our King Charles III coronation coverage:\n\nBiggest moments: Charles and Camilla crowned, royal family appears on balcony\n\nThe balcony:See who greeted the crowd with Charles and Camilla (not Harry)\n\nKing Charles III formally crowned: A recap of the monarch's coronation day\n\nQueen Camilla looks regal: She is also crowned at King Charles III coronation\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis: See the royal grandchildren on coronation day\n\nPrince Harry and Prince William: Look back their complicated relationship\n\nCoronation photos: See all the best photos from the ceremony and procession\n\nContributing: Danica Kirka, The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/03/05/will-prince-harry-duchess-meghan-attend-king-charles-coronation/11410185002/", "title": "Will Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan attend King Charles III's ...", "text": "Staff and wire reports\n\nLONDON — King Charles III's office has been in touch with Prince Harry about the new monarch's coronation, raising the possibility the prince will attend the historic ceremony despite tensions within the royal family.\n\nIf Harry and his wife, Meghan, were to attend the May 6 coronation at Westminster Abbey in London, it would be the first meeting between Charles and his younger son since Harry deepened the rift within the House of Windsor by revealing family secrets in his bestselling book, \"Spare.''\n\nA spokesperson for Harry and Meghan, also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, confirmed Sunday that Harry had received \"email correspondence'' from the king's office about the coronation.

But the date for the formal coronation ceremony for the new king has not yet been announced.\n\nShortly after the queen was laid to rest, the royal family's official Twitter account shared a new photo of Queen Elizabeth II climbing a hill with a walking stick in one hand and a coat draped over the other.

But there hasn't been a coronation since June 1953 when Elizabeth was crowned, following the death of her father King George VI. Queen Elizabeth II was 25 when she took the throne.\n\nMost people in the U.K. have never lived through such a momentous event.

The funeral and events surrounding it were designed to help unite the royal family and divided subjects while helping ensure the monarchy survives another century.\n\nLondon’s mayor’s office said up to two million people were expected to line the streets as members of the royal family and hundreds of foreign dignitaries and heads of state descended on Westminster Abbey.

But it was the moments out of the public eye that I will most fondly remember her for.\"\n\nWhat is the committal service at Windsor Castle?\n\nThe queen headed to her final resting place in Windsor Castle where a committal service took place before she was lowered into the Royal Vault.\n\nThe committal service was conducted by the dean of Windsor, David Connor. Events include prayer and a choir performance at St George's chapel. Nearly 800 people were expected to attend, including royal family members, and the hymn, \"All My Hope on God is Founded,\" was performed.\n\nWhile the procession took place, the Imperial State Crown sat atop the queen’s coffin along with her scepter and orb.\n\nDuring the committal service, the crown, scepter and orb were removed from the top of the coffin. The items were placed on an altar at St. George’s Chapel, and marked the final separation of the late queen from her crown.\n\nThe “Wand of Office” was broken by the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Andrew Parker. The breaking of the wand is a tradition in a sovereign’s funeral, according to The Independent, and hasn’t been seen since King George VI died in 1952.\n\nThe new king stood by quietly during the moments of farewell and appeared somber and a bit teary-eyed before his mother’s coffin was lowered into the vault.\n\nPast tears:Did Queen Elizabeth cry at Prince Philip's funeral?

The queen often attended races and was also a successful owner and breeder.\n\nPrincess Kate, the wife of Prince William, wore two pieces of jewelry that once belonged to her grandmother-in-law.

She will be laid to rest with her late husband, Prince Philip, at a private family service.\n\nWhat is the hearse the queen is in?\n\nThe queen’s coffin was moved from the gun carriage to the royal hearse at Wellington Arch as it was taken to Windsor. The hearse drove 25 miles west of London to Windsor Castle and St George's Chapel, a mini-cathedral that seats 800 and is often used for royal weddings. It's where Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan were married in 2018.\n\nAt Windsor, the state hearse traveled in procession to St George’s Chapel via the Long Walk. Once inside, a committal service began at 4 p.m. local time, 11 a.m. EDT.\n\nThe glass-walled hearse allows the queen’s coffin to be viewed – and it is lit up when it is dark out.\n\nFuneral program: What happened at queen's funeral\n\nThe funeral concluded just after noon, local time. The pall bearers escorted the queen's coffin onto the gun carriage.\n\nThe queen will be buried in a special chapel beneath the floor of St George's with her parents, sister Princess Margaret, and husband, Philip.\n\nThe program also included:\n\nPatricia Scotland Commonwealth Secretary-General read a lesson from Corinthians 15 as a tribute to the queen’s life of dedication to service and the nation.\n\nA sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nChoirs sang the Anthem, taken from \"Songs of Farewell\" by Hubert Parry, a favorite of King Charles'.\n\nA short anthem, composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams for the queen’s coronation in 1953, presenting a reflective moment in the service.\n\nThe third hymn, \"Love Divine, All Loves Excelling\" is a Welsh tune, and was sung at the wedding of The Prince and Princess of Wales at Westminster Abbey in 2011. The arrangement is by James O’Donnell, a former organist at the Abbey.\n\nThe Archbishop gave the commendation over the queen’s coffin. The commendation will include the familiar line, \"Go Forth, O Christian Soul, From This World,\" which is often heard during funerals.\n\nThe choirs sang a new anthem, composed for the service by Sir James McMillan. The words are taken from Romans 8, which leads with the hopeful, confident line, \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\"\n\nThe dean pronounced the blessing from the altar, and the congregation will remain standing for the last post, which will be sounded by the state trumpeters of the household cavalry.\n\nThis was followed by two minutes’ silence, to be observed across the United Kingdom.\n\nThe trumpeters then sounded the reveille, before the national anthem was sung.\n\nThe sovereign’s piper played the traditional lament, ‘Sleep, dearie, sleep.’\n\nAt the conclusion of the lament, at noon local time (7 a.m. ET), the pall bearers entered and moved the queen’s coffin to the state gun carriage.\n\nCharles writes note to the queen tucked in funeral wreath atop coffin\n\nThe funeral wreath on the queen's coffin was anything but funereal – it was a massive assembling of color and symbolism topped with a note from Charles. \"In loving and devoted memory. Charles R,\" it read.\n\n\"Charles R\" is the monarch’s official signature, with R being Latin for \"Rex\" or king. (Elizabeth’s signature was Elizabeth R for \"Regina,\" Latin for queen.)\n\nThe sight of that note immediately evoked memories of the note that sat on Princess Diana’s coffin during her funeral procession to Westminster Abbey in 1997. It was from her sons and signed \"Mummy.\"\n\nAccording to Buckingham Palace’s notes on the funeral, the queen’s wreath included, at the king’s request, flowers and foliage cut from the gardens of Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and the king’s private home Highgrove House.\n\nThe foliage was chosen for its symbolism: Rosemary for remembrance. Myrtle for the ancient symbol of a happy marriage, and cut from a plant grown from a sprig of myrtle in the queen’s 1947 wedding bouquet. English oak symbolizes the strength of love.\n\nAlso included are scented pelargoniums, garden roses, autumnal hydrangea, sedum, dahlias, and scabious, in shades of gold, pink and deep burgundy, with touches of white to reflect the Royal Standard on which it sits.\n\nAnd at the request of the king, a longtime environmentalist, the wreath is made in a sustainable way, formed in a nest of English moss and oak branches and without the use of floral foam.\n\nWho attended the queen’s funeral?\n\nThe guest list for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II amounted to hundreds of people, a mix of members of the British royal family, foreign royals (many of them relatives of the queen), domestic and foreign government leaders, including President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, British religious and military leaders, members of the royal households, and scores of ordinary people, from the National Health Service, for instance, who were invited to mark their service to the nation.\n\nThe top British royals:\n\nKing Charles III\n\nCamilla, Queen Consort\n\nPrincess Anne Princess Royal, Vice Adm. Sir Tim Laurence\n\nPrince Andrew Duke of York\n\nPrince Edward Earl of Wessex, Sophie Countess of Wessex\n\nPrince William, Prince of Wales, Catherine, Princess of Wales\n\nPrince George of Wales\n\nPrince Charlotte of Wales\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\n\nEarl of Snowdon\n\nPeter Phillips\n\nAlso there are some two dozen other members of the queen’s family, including descendants of her mother’s Scottish family. All eight of her grandchildren are there and some of the older 12 great-grandchildren, including the new second and third in line in the succession, Prince George of Wales, 9, and Princess Charlotte of Wales, 7.\n\nMany of the foreign royals who attended also are related to the British royal family through descent from Queen Victoria, sometimes known as the \"grandmother\" of Europe in the 19th century. The monarchs of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain are there. Also, Japan’s Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, making their first overseas trip since assuming the throne of Japan in 2019.\n\nThe Bidens top the foreign leaders list, which also includes France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Ireland’s President Michael Higgins. Also there: Ursula von der Leyen, representing the European Union that Britain quit amid many recriminations in 2016. Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also are there, representing three of the major Commonwealth nations over which the queen also reigned.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral:See King Charles III, Prince Harry, all royals who attended\n\nIs Prince Harry at the funeral? Harry wore military medals, but not his uniform\n\nPrince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, were visiting the U.K. from their home in California to promote several causes they are involved with when the queen died.\n\nAt Monday's funeral, Harry wore his military medals but not his uniform. He wore the uniform during a vigil on Saturday with Queen Elizabeth's grandchildren.\n\nRoyal experts have explained that only working members of the royal family will wear the military uniform for the five events during the late monarch's period of mourning and state funeral.\n\nHarry walked in to Westminster Abbey alongside his brother, Prince William. But during the service, Harry and Meghan sat in the second row behind his father, while William, Princess Kate and their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte sat across the aisle in the first row.\n\nIs Sarah 'Fergie' Ferguson at the funeral?\n\nSarah Ferguson, affectionately known as Fergie, attended the state funeral for the queen Monday. The Duchess of York, 62, has remained close with the royals despite her divorce from Prince Andrew in 1996. The former pair share daughters Princess Beatrice, 34, and Princess Eugenie, 32, who were also in attendance.\n\nFollowing the queen's death, Ferguson wrote in a tribute on Twitter that \"she was was the most incredible mother-in-law and friend.\"\n\n\"I will always be grateful to her for the generosity she showed me in remaining close to me even after my divorce,\" the Duchess of York added. \"I will miss her more than words can express.\"\n\nState funeral at Westminster Abbey\n\nThe queen's casket entered Westminster Abbey around 11 a.m. local time Monday. The choir of St. George's Chapel sang The Sentences as the queen's coffin procession, including King Charles, Prince William, Princess Kate, Prince Harry, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince George, Prince Charlotte, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, followed the coffin into the abbey.\n\nDavid Hoyle, Dean of Westminster, opened the service before attendees joined together to sing The Hymn, \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\n\nDuring the funeral, speakers included Most Rev. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury; Rev. Mark Birch, Minor Canon and Precentor; Patricia Scotland, Commonwealth secretary-general; Shermara Fletcher, principal officer for Pentecostal and Charismatic Relations, Churches Together in England; and Rt. Rev. Dame Sarah Mullally. As the funeral concluded, the choir sang \"God Save the King.\"\n\nFuneral music: Hymns sung at queen's funeral\n\nThe music during the funeral will be sung by the choir of the Westminster Abbey and included The Sentences, written by William Croft, whose Sentences have been used since the mid 1500s, and at every State Funeral since the early 18th century.\n\nThe choir of St George's Chapel sang The Sentences during the procession as the casket entered. The choir of Westminster Abbey began the funeral service in song, later joining with the choir of the Chapel Royal for a rendition of \"Like as the Heart.\" The funeral's attendees sang \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\n\nThe choir also sang \"The Lord’s My Shepherd,\" which also was heard at the Wedding of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh in 1947. The choir sang \"God Save the King,\" featuring different lyrics from what many have known for decades as \"God Save the Queen,\" as the funeral concluded.\n\nDetails about Queen Elizabeth's coffin\n\nThe oak coffin was made more than 30 years ago, funeral directors previously confirmed to USA TODAY. Leverton & Sons, which has served as funeral directors to the royal household said it inherited the coffin made for the queen by another firm, Kenyons.\n\nAndrew Leverton, a funeral director at Leverton & Sons, previously told British outlet the Times \"It is made from English oak, which is very difficult to get hold of.\n\n“Oak coffins are now made from American oak. I don’t think we could use English oak for a coffin now. It would be too expensive,” he told the outlet.\n\nThe coffin is also lined with lead, Leverton & Sons said. The lead lining makes the coffin so heavy that eight military bearers carried it Monday.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's casket:Queen to be buried in decades-old coffin lined with lead that takes 8 people to carry\n\nImperial State Crown: Details about crown atop casket\n\nThe majestic Imperial State Crown sits atop the queen’s flag-draped coffin as the queen was moved to Westminster Abbey, along with her scepter and orb.\n\nThe crown, the same one the young Queen Elizabeth II wore for her coronation in 1953, is adorned with stones including the 317-carat Cullinan II diamond, one of several stones cut from the more than 3,000-carat Cullinan Diamond, mined in South Africa in 1905, when the nation was a British colony. The main stone – the 530.2-carat Cullinan I diamond, also called the Star of Africa – rests at the top of the monarch’s scepter.\n\nAs the royal jewels are in the news, so are repeated calls to return the diamonds to their country of origin. The queen's death at 96 on Sept. 8 has also renewed the conversation of the royal family's ties to colonialism and the queen's lack of apology or atonement.\n\nCalls for reparation from former colonial powers are not new, but they have resurged in recent years. Barbados in November 2021 removed the queen as its head of state, becoming the region’s newest republic. Six other Caribbean countries have signaled their intent to follow suit.\n\nThe monarchy:Imperial State Crown and royal scepter glimmer, but some say on back of colonialism\n\nWhat is the gun carriage used to carry the queen?\n\nWhen the coffin emerged from Westminster Hall, the pallbearers placed it on the green gun carriage that was used for the funerals of the queen’s father, grandfather and great-grandfather, all kings.\n\nKing Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward flanked the procession, followed by several other members of the royal family including Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nKing Charles, more royals arrive at funeral\n\nKing Charles was met with applause by crowds as his motorcade arrived at Westminster Hall for the queen's coffin procession to Westminster Abbey. Prince William and Prince Harry joined him.\n\nOne car contained Queen Consort Camilla and Catherine, Princess of Wales, with her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Another featured Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex.\n\nMore members of the royal family, including Prince William, Catherine, Princess of Wales, Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrived shortly after.\n\nThe funeral’s order of service showed that George and Charlotte will walk together behind their parents. They will be followed by Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and other royal family members.\n\nThe royal children’s 4-year-old brother, Prince Louis, is not expected to be present at the funeral, which will be attended by some 2,000 people.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Prime Minister Liz Truss, more world leaders arrive\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, accompanied by first lady Jill Biden, is among the top world leaders who arrived at Westminster Abbey ahead of the funeral.\n\nBiden arrived at Westminster Abbey for the queen’s funeral in his armored limousine, The Beast. He was among the few international diplomats who, for security reasons, did not ride on a fleet of chartered luxury buses provided for other world leaders. Biden stepped out of the The Beast a few minutes after 10 a.m. local time. He did not say anything or address the press.\n\nMany other leaders arrived Monday morning via bus; the Bidens arrived separately. British Prime Minister Liz Truss and husband Hugh O'Leary, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and wife Sophie Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and wife Brigitte Macron, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and wife Michelle Bolsonaro and Israeli President Isaac Herzog and wife Michal Herzog were also spotted arriving.\n\nThe president signed the official condolence book and attended a reception Sunday at Buckingham Palace hosted by King Charles III.\n\nBiden is among many world leaders who traveled to the United Kingdom to honor Queen Elizabeth’s long reign. During his visit, Biden told media the queen \"was the same in person as her image: decent, honorable and all about service.\"\n\n\"Our hearts go out to the royal family, King Charles and all of the family. It’s a loss that leaves a giant hole and sometimes you think you’ll never overcome it,\" the president said, adding that he told Charles the queen will be with him \"every step of the way, every moment.\"\n\nThe day before the funeral:Biden arrives in London for funeral; Queen's grandchildren stand vigil by coffin\n\nTom Parker Bowles, more royals' family members arrive\n\nLess than an hour and a half before the funeral is set to begin, notable arrivals connected to the royal family began to trickle in. Queen Consort Camilla's family was also photographed arriving at Westminster Abbey, including Laura Lopes, Camilla's 44-year-old daughter, and Tom Parker Bowles, her 47-year-old son. Princess Kate's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, were also photographed upon arrival.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nWhere will Queen Elizabeth II be buried?\n\nThe queen will be buried at St George Chapel at Windsor Castle, where many of her ancestors are buried, including her parents, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother.\n\nFollowing the funeral at Westminster Abbey, the coffin procession will begin, joined by King Charles, other members of the royal family, past and present members of the queen's household, governors general and prime ministers of the realms.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral details:When is it? Will it be on TV? Your questions, answered\n\nKing Charles thanks the public for 'messages of condolence' ahead of queen's funeral\n\nAhead of Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, King Charles III issued a statement Sunday evening thanking people in Britain and across the world for \"the many messages of condolence.\"\n\n\"Over the last ten days, my wife and I have been so deeply touched,\" the king said. \"In London, Edinburgh, Hillsborough and Cardiff we were moved beyond measure by everyone who took the trouble to come and pay their respects to the lifelong service of my dear mother.\"\n\n\"As we all prepare to say our last farewell, I wanted simply to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those countless people who have been such a support and comfort to my family and myself in this time of grief,\" Charles concluded his statement.\n\nAhead of the queen's funeral Monday, a new photograph was released Sunday.\n\nAccording to the royal family on Facebook, the photo was taken to mark the queen's Platinum Jubilee earlier this year. She was the first British monarch to reach this milestone.\n\n\"Tomorrow, millions will come together to commemorate her remarkable life,\" the post read.\n\nPrince Charles is now King Charles III. Here's what to know about UK's new monarch.\n\nHow old is Westminster Abbey, site of Queen Elizabeth funeral?\n\nWestminster Abbey, where Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral will be held Monday, has a centuries-long association with the royal family, hosting generations of coronations, royal weddings and funerals.\n\nThe church, which was consecrated in 1065 and “has been the setting for every coronation since 1066” and 16 royal weddings, a statement on the abbey’s website says.\n\n“Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's connection with Westminster Abbey ran like a thread through her early life and her long reign,” the site says. “As an 11-year-old girl, she watched as her father was crowned here. As a young adult, she married here and was crowned here.”\n\nFourteen English monarchs were buried there between 1066 and 1760, including Queen Elizabeth I, the daughter of King Henry VIII, who was interred in the abbey in 1603. The Unknown Warrior, whose body was brought from France in 1920, is buried in the abbey’s nave. Author Charles Dickens is among those buried in Poets' Corner of the abbey.\n\nThe funeral of Princess Diana was held at the abbey in 1997 and the Queen Mother’s funeral took place there in 2002. More recently, Prince William and Duchess Kate, now the Prince and Princess of Wales, were married there in 2011.\n\nVisual guide to the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey\n\nQueen's funeral more than ceremony, designed to show monarchy's stability\n\nThe queen, who died Sept. 8 in Scotland at age 96 after 70 years on the throne, was widely considered the glue holding the U.K. together. She was also the most canny of her Windsor ancestors about using ceremony and splendor to bond the monarchy and the people who pay for it.\n\nNot since 1965, for former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, has Britain mounted a state funeral, which is usually reserved for monarchs, with exceptions for distinguished figures such as Churchill, the queen's first prime minister of her reign.\n\nRoyal funerals are planned decades in advance by governments and the crown, and the plans are updated regularly. The monarch plays a crucial role in deciding details. The choice of flowers in the wreath on her coffin, the music and prayer selections, even the bespoke design of the Royal Hearse (lots of glass and inside light so the casket can be seen even at night), were all decisions made by the queen.\n\nSurvival of the monarchy:Why Queen Elizabeth II's funeral is more than just ceremony\n\nMourners line the streets during queen's funeral\n\nAt 6 a.m. local time, snipers were on rooftops, sniffer dogs were on the streets, drains were being searched and surveillance drones have been banned from all of central London. Around 20 miles of barriers have been erected to control crowds as the queen’s coffin travels the short distance from Westminster Hall, where it is lying-in-state, to Westminster Abbey, and then onward to Windsor Castle after the funeral for burial.\n\nA full five hours before the funeral gets underway, London’s transportation network was already busy on a public holiday, with the subway system seeing members of the public rushing to secure viewing spots in and around Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster. Many carried small fold-up chairs, and Londoners almost entirely wore black in the quiet of the city. Volunteers in purple vests every few yards provided help with directions and other needs.\n\nHyde Park, one of London's central parks, is a designated screening spot for Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral on Monday. The 11 a.m.-ceremony will be broadcast live on large screens for attendees to see for free at the park, and the Hyde Park site will show the procession through London following the funeral, the procession through Windsor and the Committal Service at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nSigns and staff are present across the city to direct people to either the park or other \"viewing areas\" where they may catch a real glimpse of the state funeral route. The park and viewing areas include dedicated spots for anyone who has an accessibility need, including British Sign Language interpreters and a dedicated location for wheelchair users.\n\nPeople watched the funeral and procession from almost everywhere – lining the streets 10-deep to sitting on blankets in parks.\n\nLucy Hartnell, 26, from Hertfordshire, organized a picnic at Hyde Park of what she and friends assumed were “queen favorites” including strawberries, cucumber finger sandwiches, Prosecco, cupcakes and chips. They took the tube into London and were \"shocked\" how easy it was for them to get to Hyde Park to view the funeral.\n\nThey said they attended to not miss a big event and aren’t really pro-royal or anti-royal, which has been a large debate among young people.\n\n\"We’re not super against the royals or for them, we just wanted to be part of them moment,\" Hartnell said.\n\nThey said the transition to a king likely won’t affect them, but they said the area where they grew up is very pro-monarchy. \"Our grandparents care a lot. We don’t care that much either way. People our age are like 'we should get rid of the monarchy.' But no one cares enough to actually do anything about it … we just like having them,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Nicole Fallert, Kim Hjelmgaard, Jane Onyanga-Omara, Maria Puente, Laura Trujillo, Amy Haneline and Morgan Hines, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/uk/queen-health-supervision-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II dies at 96 | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning British monarch whose rule spanned seven decades, died on Thursday at the age of 96, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nThe Queen’s oldest son Charles has now become King Charles III.\n\n“The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow,” the royal family said in a statement posted on its official Twitter account, referring to Charles as the new King for the first time.\n\nThe King said in a statement that the Queen’s death was “a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family.”\n\n“We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world,” he said in the statement.\n\nCrowds of mourners gathered outside Balmoral Castle and other royal residences, despite heavy downpours in parts of the UK on Thursday evening. Many brought flowers and lit candles, some looking visibly shaken by the news.\n\nIn keeping with the royal tradition, a written statement announcing the Queen’s death was displayed on the gates of Buckingham Palace. In a striking moment just after the official announcement was made, the heavy rain battering London stopped and a large double rainbow appeared over the palace.\n\nFollow live updates here.\n\nElizabeth ascended to the throne in 1952, on the death of her father, King George VI. She oversaw the last throes of the British empire, weathered global upheaval and domestic scandal, and dramatically modernized the monarchy.\n\nShe lost Prince Philip, her husband of 73 years and the longest-serving consort in British history, in April last year.\n\nElizabeth ruled over the United Kingdom and 14 other Commonwealth realms, and became one of the most recognizable women ever to have lived.\n\nRoyal family rushed to the Queen’s side\n\nThe Queen’s four children were at Balmoral Castle when the announcement was made.\n\nCharles rushed to the Scottish castle earlier on Thursday together with his wife, Camilla. The Queen’s daughter, Princess Anne, known as the Princess Royal, was already there.\n\nPrince William, who is now the heir apparent to the throne, arrived at Balmoral Thursday afternoon together with the Queen’s other two sons, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, as well as Edward’s wife Sophie, the Countess of Wessex.\n\nPrince William and his wife Catherine have taken on the title of Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, according to their official Twitter account. Charles and Camilla were previously known by that title. The couple are now known as the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nCatherine remained at Windsor, where their three children attended their first day at a new school.\n\nPrince Harry arrived to Balmoral after the announcement was made. His wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex was not traveling with him.\n\nLast public appearance\n\nThe Queen was last seen in public on Tuesday when she formally appointed Liz Truss as the UK’s new prime minister. A photograph from the audience showed the monarch smiling, standing in the drawing room in Balmoral, carrying a walking stick. Truss is the 15th – and the last – British Prime Minister to be appointed by Elizabeth.\n\nThere have been concerns over the Queen’s health ever since a brief hospital stay last October. She has experienced episodic mobility issues, which have at times caused her to withdraw from official engagements.\n\nBut those concerns grew deeper on Wednesday when Buckingham Palace announced the Queen had postponed a virtual meeting of her Privy Council after being advised by doctors to rest.\n\nOn Thursday, the palace announced that the Queen was under medical supervision, but said she was “comfortable” at Balmoral. As her children rushed to her side during the day, it became clear the situation was serious.\n\nHer death comes seven months after the Queen marked the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne. The UK officially celebrated the platinum jubilee in June with days of pomp and pageantry and she made several public appearances in London.\n\nGlobal tributes\n\nMessages of condolences started pouring in from around the world immediately after the announcement was made, underscoring the global impact the Queen had made during her 70-year reign.\n\nSpeaking outside Downing Street on Thursday, Truss said the Queen’s death was “a huge shock to the nation and to the world.”\n\n“Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built,” the new prime minister said. “Our country has grown and flourished under her reign.”\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth II, saying she was “loved and admired” by the people of Scotland.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General António Guterres described the Queen as a “good friend” of the UN, adding: “She was a reassuring presence throughout decades of sweeping change, including the decolonization of Africa and Asia and the evolution of the Commonwealth.”\n\nPope Francis also mourned the Queen’s death, praising her “steadfast witness of faith in Jesus Christ” in an open letter to King Charles III.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was “with the heaviest of hearts” that Canada learned of the monarch’s passing, while Australia’s PM Anthony Albanese praised the Queen’s devotion to “duty, family, faith and service.”\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a national address that the Queen had come to define “notions of service, charity, and consistency.”\n\nThe Queen was the head of state in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden called the Queen a “steadying presence.”\n\n“Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was more than a monarch. She defined an era,” they said in a statement.\n\nPresident of Ireland Michael D. Higgins said the country had lost “a remarkable friend.”\n\n“Her Majesty served the British people with exceptional dignity. Her personal commitment to her role and extraordinary sense of duty were the hallmarks of her period as Queen, which will hold a unique place in British history,” Higgins said. In a hugely symbolic moment in 2011, the Queen became the first British monarch to make a state visit to the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNumerous kings, queens and royal families of other countries have also sent messages of sympathy. King Felipe VI of Spain, King Abdullah II of Jordan, Norway’s King Harald and King Willem-Alexander, Queen Máxima and Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands all sent condolences.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Max Foster Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Ivana Kottasová", "Max Foster", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/world/royal-family-line-of-succession/index.html", "title": "The British royal family line of succession explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nCharles has become Britain’s new King following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at the age of 96.\n\nThe Queen became the sixth female to ascend to the British throne in February 1952, after the death of her father, King George VI.

The 21-month-old was baptized on Friday by the Archbishop of Los Angeles, the Rev. John Taylor, Harry and Meghan said in a statement.\n\nThe christening announcement marked the first time Prince Harry and Meghan publicly called their daughter a princess, revealing for the first time that they will use royal titles for their children.\n\nTitles are conferred in line with a decree issued by King George V in 1917 that limits the titles of prince and princess to the male-line grandchildren of the sovereign.\n\nThat's prince and princess to you:Harry and Meghan's kids get new titles, palace website says\n\nAs long as the late Queen Elizabeth II was alive, Harry and his older brother, Prince William, were the sovereign’s grandchildren. Harry and William’s children, as great grandchildren, didn’t receive the titles automatically.\n\nBut Elizabeth had the power to amend the rules, and in 2012 she decreed that the children of Prince William and his wife, Princess Kate, would be princes and princesses. This decree didn’t apply to Harry and Meghan.\n\nHowever, the situation changed when King Charles III ascended to the throne after Queen Elizabeth II's death in September. William and Harry are the king’s sons, meaning their offspring are now royal grandchildren and so entitled to be known as prince and princess.\n\nOn Wednesday, the children were still listed on the palace's official website as Master Archie Mountbatten-Windsor and Miss Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor. By Thursday morning, the site was updated to Prince Archie of Sussex and Princess Lilibet of Sussex.\n\nKing Charles III's coronation:Prince Harry, Duchess Meghan contacted about attending\n\nArchie and Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor:Could Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's children gain royal titles now?\n\nPrince Harry's older brother, Prince William, and Duchess Kate's children have always been listed on the site under their titles Prince George of Wales, Princess Charlotte of Wales and Prince Louis of Wales.\n\nThe question of the children’s titles took center stage two years ago during Harry and Meghan’s television interview with Oprah Winfrey. Meghan, who is biracial, said that when she was pregnant with Archie \"they\" — presumably the palace — \"were saying they didn’t want him to be a prince … which would be different from protocol.\"\n\nMeghan suggested that this was because Archie was the royal family’s \"first member of color\" and would have marked the first time a royal grandchild wasn’t given the same title as the other grandchildren.\n\nAt the time, royal experts said Meghan’s comments appeared to be based on a misunderstanding of the way royal titles are conferred.\n\nThe christening announcement marked the first time that the children’s titles had been used in public.\n\nLilibet's christening was unusual, according to rules established by the Church of England. The Church only permits christening outside of a parish church in \"very exceptional circumstances\" and they typically take place during \"the Sunday service of a church, so that the whole congregation can offer a warm welcome to you and your family.\"\n\nTaylor Swift's 'Anti-Hero,' Prince Harry's 'Spare' and the art of celebrity authenticity\n\nStephen Colbert 'Late Show' Q&A:Prince Harry says 'freedom' describes his future\n\nTraditionally, godparents are also invited to christenings.\n\nTyler Perry is Lilibet's godfather, he revealed in their Netflix docuseries \"Harry & Meghan.\" It's unclear who her godmother is.

Harry and Meghan confirmed moments later that they will attend the festivities, giving the Queen a first chance to meet her granddaughter Lilibet.\n\n“Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are excited and honoured to attend The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this June with their children,” a spokesperson for the couple told CNN.\n\nHours earlier, CNN attended a media briefing at the palace on Friday to hear all the details for the jubilee. The celebrations have been eagerly awaited by royal fans worldwide, but we haven’t had a full picture of how they’ll unfold until now.\n\nHere’s everything we found out about the big day(s).\n\nHarry, Meghan and Prince Andrew won’t be on the balcony.\n\nSeveral members of the royal family will make an appearance on the famous Buckingham Palace balcony during the Trooping the Colour parade, which kicks off the celebration on the morning of Thursday, June 2.\n\nBut only royals carrying out official duties will be included, a royal spokesperson told CNN.\n\nThat means Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex won’t be present. The couple split from the royal family in 2020 and no longer take part in royal duties.\n\nIt also rules out Prince Andrew, who was stripped of royal duties and his HRH title in the wake of his civil sexual assault lawsuit. Andrew settled that suit out of court earlier this year, but his lengthy association with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein has tarnished his reputation and his involvement in the weekend posed awkward questions for organizers.\n\nPrince Andrew attended a memorial service for Prince Philip in March.

Not getting a glimpse of the monarch may disappoint some of the fans in attendance, but it’s become a reality that the nonagenarian Queen has slimmed down her schedule.\n\nA party at the palace.\n\nWe already knew that a concert was planned for outside Buckingham Palace, following the jubilee tradition of hosting some big music stars on an impressive stage near the building.\n\nBut now we know what that stage will look like – and it’ll be quite something.\n\nImages of the stage outside Buckingham Palace were released on Friday. BBC Studio Events\n\nThe BBC has released an impression of the staging and it’s also been announced that 22,000 people will be able to attend. That includes 5,000 tickets reserved for key workers.\n\nTen years ago, the Queen watched from a royal box and made an appearance on stage as stars like Paul McCartney, Elton John and Stevie Wonder sang for the monarch.\n\nWe don’t yet know who will be performing this time around, but we’ll keep you updated as we hear.\n\nA flypast, a golden coach ride and a day at the races.\n\nA whole lot more is planned for the four-day weekend. It’s been confirmed that a Royal Air Force flypast will take place while the royals are waving to supporters on the Buckingham Palace balcony, a fitting climax to the Trooping the Colour ceremony.\n\nThen, on Saturday, the racecourse at Epsom will stage the 243rd edition of its famous horse race, the Derby. The Queen, a keen horse breeder herself, has been a regular spectator at the event and has presented the famous trophy in the past.\n\nOn Sunday, streets across the UK will stage their own jubilee lunches. The palace said 60,000 people have registered so far.\n\nAnd back in London, the weekend will be capped with the Platinum Jubilee Pageant on Sunday. It will feature a reappearance of the Gold State Coach, which has been used at major royal events since it was built in 1762.\n\nThe Queen rode in the coach during her jubilees in 1977 and 2002, but this time she won’t be inside – instead, film footage of the monarch during her coronation in 1952 will be played in the windows.\n\nAnd there are more announcements to come between now and June 2. Keep your eyes on Royal News for all the details in the coming weeks.\n\nIN THE ROYAL DIARY\n\nThe Queen won’t attend her traditional summer garden parties at Buckingham Palace this year, another series of events the monarch is skipping as she suffers mobility problems.\n\nThree events will take place in the grounds of the palace on May 11, 18 and 25, with a fourth in late June at Holyroodhouse in Scotland, it was announced on Thursday. Because of the pandemic, this will be the first time the parties have been held since 2019.\n\nThe 96-year-old Queen will be represented at the parties by other members of the family, though the palace hasn’t yet confirmed which royals will attend.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II at a garden party in 2018 Yui Mok/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nElizabeth has been forced to miss a number of events this year, including an Easter service last month.\n\nThe garden parties are a big part of the royal calendar, giving the monarch and her family the chance to meet with thousands of community leaders and celebrate their work.\n\nBut they do require long periods of standing and walking, and these are the kind of events that the Queen has had to skip in the past few months. She also hinted that she was left “exhausted” by Covid after catching the virus in February.\n\nThe Queen could still make it to next week’s state opening of Parliament, a ceremonial event in which the monarch unveils the government’s legislative agenda.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nNetflix drops Meghan’s animated series.\n\nNetflix has dropped Meghan, Duchess of Sussex’s planned animated series “Pearl,” PA Media reported. The show was set to be produced in collaboration with Meghan and Prince Harry’s studio, Archewell Productions, but the streaming giant is understood to have dropped it as it cuts costs. According to a press release last year, “Pearl” was set to focus on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl, who is “inspired by a variety of influential women from history.” Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter of this year and lost $50 billion in share value last month after those figures were announced. It has other projects from Harry and Meghan still in the pipeline, including a “Heart of Invictus” documentary that tracks participants in the sporting tournament Harry founded.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge took the picture of the birthday girl.

The shot, which shows a smiling Charlotte relaxing in a field of bluebells, was taken by her mother in Norfolk, eastern England last weekend, according to the family. Charlotte is William and Kate’s second child, and fourth in line to the throne – just after her older brother, George, who turns 9 in July.\n\nWilliam urges action on male suicide.\n\nPrince William said society is “not really tackling the problem” of male suicide “as fast as we need to,” PA Media reported. During a visit to London mental health charity James’ Place, William asked workers how they get the message across to men that “some support is necessary.” The prince has long been an advocate for mental health causes. In a 2019 BBC documentary, he said he felt “pain like no other” after his mother, Princess Diana, died. “Particularly in Britain … we are nervous about our emotions. We’re a bit embarrassed at times,” he added.\n\nHow to get help: In the US, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

Rob Munday\n\nThe Queen is one of the most photographed women in history. But rarely in formal photo shoots do we see her smiling, natural and unposed.\n\nWhen Buckingham Palace commissioned holographer Rob Munday to create the first official holographic portrait of Elizabeth in 2004, he snapped more than 8,000 pictures. That sitting produced a famous picture of the Queen, used on banknotes, postage stamps, and on the front cover of Time Magazine.\n\nBut it also included a more spontaneous shot, which sat unnoticed in his personal archives for almost 19 years.\n\nThe image shows a wry smile on the Queen’s face as she reacts to an amusing comment made by her friend and dresser, Angela Kelly, who was rearranging her clothing prior to the shoot.\n\nMunday rediscovered it while under lockdown in France and is now displaying it to the public for the first time.\n\n“I’ve completely forgotten about it. It’s lying on the hard drive for nearly 19 years.” Munday told CNN’s Robert Iddiols at the unveiling on London’s Park Lane. “But as I was thumbing through, right in the middle, there was just this one frame.”\n\nThe image was a happy accident, the result of test shots taken before the real thing.\n\n“My first thought was that it would make a beautiful image to commemorate the Platinum Jubilee,” Munday said.\n\n“I just loved it so much because it’s just a really, really natural portrait. I mean, a lot of people have told me that they’ve never seen a portrait quite like this of the Queen.”\n\nPHOTO OF THE WEEK\n\nAaron Chown/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nGo long!

Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor died Thursday at Balmoral Castle, her estate in Scotland. She was 96.\n\nThe palace issued a black-bordered statement about 6.30 p.m. local time: \"The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and The Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow.\"\n\nHer eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, 73, immediately became King Charles III upon her death. His wife became Queen Consort Camilla.\n\nBuckingham Palace issued another black-bordered statement from \"His Majesty the King,\" shortly after her death.\n\n\"The death of my beloved Mother, Her Majesty The Queen, is a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family,\" the statement said. \"We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished Sovereign and a much-loved Mother. I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.\n\n\"During this period of mourning and change, my family and I will be comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which The Queen was so widely held.\"\n\nAs the 41st monarch since William the Conqueror in 1066, Elizabeth was the symbol of stability as Britain and its 1,000-year-old monarchy sailed through roiling storms of the modern age, including a deadly pandemic.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II died 'peacefully' under medical supervision:William, Harry traveled to be by her side\n\nElizabeth enjoyed robust health most of her life, but lingering “mobility issues” affected her in recent months. She increasingly handed over duties to Charles, from the recreational to the constitutional. Last week, she couldn't attend the annual Highland Games, the Braemar Gathering, which she never missed throughout her reign.\n\nOn Tuesday she presided over the transition of one prime minister to a new one, a constitutional duty as head of state which took place at Balmoral for the first time in her reign.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the palace announced she would not be able to attend via Zoom the meeting of the Privy Council, the standing committee of senior governmental advisers, after doctors' orders to rest.\n\nShe also missed significant appearances in June during the four days of celebration of her Platinum Jubilee of 70 years on the throne.\n\nThe world reacts:King Charles III expresses 'greatest sadness' over mother Queen Elizabeth II's death\n\nIn February, two weeks after marking the 70 anniversary of her ascension to the throne in 1952, the palace announced she had tested positive for COVID-19. During an audience in mid-February, the queen mentioned to her visitors that she had difficulty \"moving,\" leading to \"ongoing mobility\" issues, as Buckingham Palace put it, that prevented some appearances, including the State Opening of Parliament on May 10.\n\nShe had missed this important head-of-state role only twice before during her reign, both for pregnancies, but for the first time she officially delegated Charles to stand in for her, accompanied by his elder son, Prince William.\n\nShe was preceded in death by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, her husband of 73 years, who died April 9, 2021, at Windsor Castle at age 99, just short of his 100th birthday. He was Britain's oldest and longest-serving royal spouse in 10 centuries.\n\nHis funeral yielded poignant pictures of the queen, alone and masked, in St. George's Chapel at Windsor for a sublime service attended by only 30 members of his family amid COVID-19 restrictions. At the end of March, she appeared in public for her first major in-person gathering since her COVID-19 diagnosis, leading her family, dozens of foreign royals and hundreds of Britain's great and good in a service of thanksgiving for the life of her late husband at Westminster Abbey.\n\n► Stay up to date with the latest on King Charles III and the royal succession with our newsletter Keep Calm and Carry On. Sign up here.\n\nThe death of a monarch is followed by a flurry of rituals, including an address to the nation by the new king and by the prime minister, followed by long-established funeral plans carried out with military precision.\n\nFor now, however, Britain prepared to mourn.\n\nThe plans include a funeral worthy of the devout and dutiful woman who pledged herself at age 21 in service to her nation and never wavered as the living symbol of the British people.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's historic reign\n\nShe reigned, never ruled, as Britain's head of state and constitutional figurehead for decades. She acceded to the throne on Feb. 6, 1952, when her father, King George VI, died at age 56. She was just 25.\n\nHaving celebrated her Diamond Jubilee of 60 years on the throne in 2012, she was the U.K.'s oldest monarch ever, and the longest-serving, surpassing her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria, who reigned 63 years and died in 1901.\n\nMore than half the people alive in Britain today have known no other monarch on their throne, their coins, their bank notes and their stamps. A modest, even shy girl, she became the most famous woman in the world, the most photographed and depicted human being in history, who met and shook hands with an estimated 4 million people or more during her reign.\n\nShe inherited a sun-never-sets empire just starting to disintegrate, then presided over its final collapse into a Commonwealth of nations that looked to her as its leader, and to which she was deeply committed to the end. She was Britain's stiff upper lip during the 20th-century post-World War II recovery, the last gasps of the empire, the Cold War and the war on terrorism.\n\nIn her colorful hats and her sturdy sensible shoes, her ever-present handbag on her arm, she was a constant through kaleidoscope changes as the 20th century roared into the 21st: the growth of television, Beatlemania, Britain's demographic transformation to a multi-ethnic society, and the rise of a celebrity culture that ensnared nearly every member of her family.\n\nShe adapted to changing times by changing – and yet not changing on the important things, such as maintaining a dignified silence – while embracing the internet age with a palace website, Facebook and Twitter accounts, and even a royal channel on YouTube.\n\nShe was stoic and carried on through the antics and scandals of members of her family. Most recently, she had to weather the public downfall of her son Prince Andrew for his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which later led in an embarrassing civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse. And her grandson Prince Harry's decision to move to America with his wife, Meghan, and leave royal life behind resulted in months of recriminations further inflamed by accusations of racism (hotly denied) in the royal family.\n\nWhen it was necessary, she shed her usual reserve. She presided over the heart-rending 1997 funeral of her former daughter-in-law, Princess Diana, the \"people's princess.\" She did it – despite her desire to protect Charles and Diana's two sons – to save the standing of the monarchy from a grief-maddened populace enraged by what seemed to be royal coldness and detachment in the wake of Diana's death in a car crash in Paris.\n\nIf the queen seemed occasionally out of step with the accelerating changes, she redeemed herself and the monarchy by adjusting, and she gained new popularity and admiration in her later years. Always deeply respected, she was beloved by the time she reached 80, helped partly by the release of the film \"The Queen.\" Dame Helen Mirren's transcendent performance as Her Majesty won her the Academy Award for best actress in 2007, and her tribute in her acceptance speech is as apt a eulogy as any.\n\n\"For 50 years and more, Elizabeth Windsor has maintained her dignity, her sense of duty – and her hairstyle,\" Mirren said in her acceptance speech. \"She has had her feet planted firmly on the ground, her hat on her head and her handbag on her arm. She has weathered many, many storms. And I salute her courage and her consistency.\"\n\nWhat happens to the monarchy after Queen Elizabeth's death?\n\nBiographers point to the queen's devotion to duty as her most important personal and professional characteristic, raising questions about whether the monarchy can survive long without her. Even foes of the monarchy, known as republicans in Britain, acknowledged they admired her. They see the monarchy as a hereditary institution wrapped in wealth and privilege that has no place in a modern democratic society; they credit her with not only saving it but making it more popular than ever.\n\nKing Charles III takes over:What happens to the other royals under new slimmed-down monarchy?\n\n\"She will be remembered for keeping the British monarchy going through the 20th and into the 21st century – and for leaving it in better shape,\" says Robert Lacey, the British historian and biographer who has written four books on the queen. \"She was imbued with a great sense of duty and responsibility. In the long run, that would be a strength and her charm.\"\n\nElizabeth's sense of duty was established early in her life during the monarchy's worst modern crisis: the abdication of the throne by her uncle, King Edward VIII, in 1936. The abdication shocked Britain, especially after the government and palace had kept the crisis out of the headlines until almost the day it happened. From the perspective of commoners and dukes alike, the former king was seen as shirking his duty and turning his back on his country.\n\nThe profound effect on 10-year-old Elizabeth, Lacey says, is that from then on duty was her watchword. Unlike Edward, the queen swore to never abandon the role she was thrust into by chance of birth and thus throw the monarchy and nation into crisis.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's early life\n\nShe was unlikely to be queen when born the first child of Prince Albert (Bertie) and the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the Duke and Duchess of York, on April 21, 1926, at her parents' townhouse in London. Her father's eldest brother, known in the family as David, was the Prince of Wales and heir to the throne after his father, and her grandfather, George V. Although single when he became Edward VIII in January 1936, he was still young enough to marry and have children.\n\nElizabeth spent her early years in quiet family life, largely at family estates in the country, where she developed a lifelong affinity for horses and dogs, especially Welsh corgis. That bucolic life was shattered after Edward quit the throne in December 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nThe abdication thrust Elizabeth's father to the throne as George VI (he took the name to honor his father), which made Elizabeth heiress presumptive and the likely next monarch. So she became a queen in training under the tutelage of her father and her austere paternal grandmother, Queen Mary.\n\nShe made her first public speech at age 14 in 1940 on BBC Radio, speaking to children, like her, who were being evacuated to safety from the London Blitz in World War II. Two years later, she got her first military appointment, colonel-in-chief of the Grenadier Guards.\n\n'I remain committed to serving you':Queen Elizabeth II's most memorable, poignant quotes\n\nOver the years, her official duties increased, giving her a taste of what was expected of her in charitable work and as figurehead of the British government and military. She became head of children's hospitals. She toured Scotland with her parents. She even became a licensed military driver in 1945 toward the end of the war.\n\nAlthough she and her younger sister, Princess Margaret Rose, spent much of the war years in the safety of Windsor Castle, they and their parents helped rally the British in the brutal effort to win the war against the Nazis. When Britain succeeded, the country was nearly bankrupt but also deeply bonded to the royal family for their roles.\n\nOn her 21st birthday, during a visit to South Africa, then still part of the empire, Princess Elizabeth addressed the British people by radio, vowing that her life, \"whether it be long or short,\" would be dedicated to serving the nation and the imperial family, now known as the Commonwealth. In 1977, celebrating her Silver Jubilee of 25 years on the throne, she told the nation that though her vow was made \"in my salad days, when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it.\"\n\nFamily life was at times tumultuous\n\nIn 1947, Elizabeth married her distant cousin, Philip (she was the first British monarch to celebrate a diamond wedding anniversary), the exiled Greek prince raised mostly in Britain who was an officer in the Royal Navy and with whom she had been in love since she was 13 and he was 18.\n\nIn contrast to the 1981 fairy-tale extravaganza wedding of Charles to the former Lady Diana Spencer, Elizabeth's wedding was simple. With the country still recovering from the war, she collected ration coupons for her dress like other young brides of the time, which further endeared her to the public.\n\nThe wedding in Westminster Abbey helped lift some of the gloom that fell over London after the war, and soon there were two children to celebrate: Charles, the heir, and Princess Anne, now the Princess Royal. Her early years as a wife and mother were her happiest; then her father died in his sleep while she was on holiday in Kenya. She flew home a queen, somber but composed.\n\nShe was crowned a year later, on June 2, 1953, by this time royally trained for her job, ready for the responsibilities, accepting of the fact that her life and her family's life would never be the same again.\n\nAs a queen, Elizabeth has been an unqualified success. As a mother, not always. She suffered grief and ridicule as head of a modern, often dysfunctional royal family trapped in public expectations of Victorian-era values.\n\nCharles was born in 1948, followed by Anne in 1950. Andrew and Edward came much later, in 1960 and 1964.\n\nThe queen always wanted a large family but put it off because duty came first, biographer Lacey says. Hers was never a warm and fuzzy persona, he says, and her cool aloofness may have carried over into family life.\n\nCharles told his biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, in 1994 that the queen was an absentee mother. She was off being queen and he was left with nannies, he said. Andrew and Edward, however, insisted they weren't starved for motherly attention. \"They made it clear they thought their mother had been absolutely marvelous,\" Lacey says.\n\nStill, her children were the chief source of distress in the most painful year of her life, 1992, what she called her \"annus horribilis,\" when the marriages of three of her children collapsed, accompanied by reams of scandalous tabloid headlines.\n\nThen, on Nov. 20, 1992, the queen's beloved Windsor Castle burned for 15 hours; 100 rooms were damaged or destroyed. \"It was symbolic of what was happening to the house of Windsor,\" Lacey says.\n\nTaxes paid to restore the castle because it was state property but Elizabeth opened parts of Buckingham Palace to the public the following year, and tourist receipts helped offset the costs.\n\nThen, things got worse. The death of the then-divorced Diana in a car crash in Paris on Aug. 31, 1997, threatened the queen's standing and that of the monarchy more than any time of her reign.\n\nWhile the queen's weeping subjects piled flowers waist-high outside Buckingham Palace and Diana's home at Kensington Palace in London, the royal family kept their grief under wraps as they holed up on their annual summer holiday at Balmoral, their estate in Scotland.\n\nThe queen's instinctive need to grieve privately was seen as out of sentimental step with a nation that wanted an unprecedented public display of sorrow and respect. At that moment, the queen's renowned sense of public sentiment eluded her. Her stiff upper lip, and the monarchy, seemed frozen in a distant time.\n\nOn the advice of then-new but savvy Prime Minister Tony Blair and others, the queen was persuaded to return to London to speak to the nation in a rare televised address. At the funeral the next day, when Diana's casket passed her standing outside the palace, she bowed her head.\n\nWith that simple gesture, the queen began turning public opinion.\n\nEsteem for the queen grew as years passed and a lifetime of official engagements stacked one on top of another. By the time of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012, according to Buckingham Palace, she had conferred more than 404,500 awards and honors; hosted 1.5 million people at garden parties and another 50,000 people a year at banquets, lunches, dinners and receptions; met 11 U.S. presidents (13 as of 2021); hosted 102 state visits in London; traveled on 325 overseas visits, including 96 state visits, to 150 countries; sent more than 540,000 telegrams to couples in the U.K. and Commonwealth celebrating a diamond wedding anniversary; served as patron to more than 620 charities or organizations; sat for 129 official portraits; and launched 23 ships. She also owned 30 corgis since 1944, and her horses won nearly every major race in Britain.\n\nDespite her calculated royal distance from the public – she never gave an interview, and people who met her were encouraged not to divulge what she said, which was usually innocuous anyway – the queen had become a familiar mother figure to her family of subjects.\n\n\"I think it's because we are comfortable with her,\" says Ingrid Seward, a veteran royals observer, biographer and editor of Majesty magazine, as the queen's popularity soared in her later years. \"We can sympathize with all that she has gone through. We know that the queen is always looking out for us. We really respect her.\"\n\nDuring her later years, foes of the monarchy acknowledged they would never be able to abolish the throne as long as the queen was alive. Public admiration for her was just too great, conceded Graham Smith of Republic, Britain's loudest advocacy group for scrapping the monarchy.\n\nThat's because the queen went about her job and avoided controversy, Smith says. Although every prime minister starting with Winston Churchill briefed her nearly every Tuesday during her reign, Elizabeth stayed above politics, never giving a hint of her political leanings or signaling publicly which prime minister she liked best.\n\nSerious debate about getting rid of the royals will come only under a monarch less astute, less admired and more gaffe-prone than Elizabeth on the throne, Smith says. \"Her most enduring quality was her ability to hold onto power.\"\n\nLacey considers that a fitting tribute to a woman who devoted her life to performing a role she didn't choose.\n\n\"In the end,\" Lacey says, \"she triumphed.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}]}

There were no other human casualties.\n\nSpecial report:'We don’t seem to learn': The West, Texas, fertilizer plant explosion, 10 years later\n\n\"It's mind-boggling,\" Dimmitt Mayor Roger Malone said. \"I don’t think it's ever happened before around here. It's a real tragedy.\"\n\nIt was the biggest single-incident death of cattle in the country since the Animal Welfare Institute, a Washington-based animal advocacy group, began tracking barn and farm fires in 2013.\n\nGraphics: How many cows died in dairy fire? 18,000, enough for 26 football fields\n\nThat easily surpassed the previous high: a 2020 fire at an upstate New York dairy farm that consumed about 400 cows, said Allie Granger, a policy associate at the institute.\n\nThe Texas fire \"is the deadliest fire involving cattle we know of,\" she said. \"In the past, we have seen fires involving several hundred cows at a time, but nothing anything near this level of mortality.\"\n\nWhere was the Texas cattle fire?\n\nCastro County, site of the fire, is open prairie land dotted with dairy farms and cattle ranches about 70 miles southwest of Amarillo.\n\nPictures posted on social media by bystanders showed the large plume of black smoke lifting from the farm fire, as well as charred cows that were saved from the structure.\n\nWhat caused the dairy farm explosion?\n\nA malfunction in a piece of farm equipment may have caused an explosion that led to the fire, said County Judge Mandy Gfeller, the county's top executive. Texas fire officials are still investigating the cause, she said.\n\nMalone, the mayor, said he wasn't aware of any other fires reported at the facility. He said the dairy had opened in the area just over three years ago and employed 50 to 60 people.\n\nThe owners of South Fork Dairy couldn't be reached for comment.\n\nHow many cows were killed in the dairy fire?\n\nMost of the perished animals – a mix of Holstein and Jersey cows – were in a large holding pen before being milked, she said. The 18,000 cows represented about 90% of the farm's total herd.\n\nWith each cow valued roughly at about $2,000, the company's losses in livestock could stretch into the tens of millions of dollars, Gfeller said. That doesn't include equipment and structure loss.\n\n\"You're looking at a devastating loss,\" she said. \"My heart goes out to each person involved in that operation.\"\n\nHow did the Texas dairy compare with the rest of the country?\n\nTexas ranks fourth nationally in milk production, home to 319 Grade A dairies with an estimated 625,000 cows producing almost 16.5 billion pounds of milk a year, according to the Texas Association of Dairymen, a trade group.\n\nAnd Castro County is the second-highest-producing county in Texas, with 15 dairies yielding 148 million pounds of milk a month, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nEven by Texas standards, South Fork Dairy was a behemoth. Its 18,000 cattle made it nearly 10 times larger than the average dairy herd in Texas.\n\nIt's not the first time large numbers of Texas cattle have died, but rarely do so many perish from a single fire. A blizzard in December 2015 killed off about 20,000 cattle across the Texas Panhandle, according to the Texas Association of Dairymen.\n\nAnd Hurricane Harvey in 2017 drowned thousands more in Southeast Texas, which led to $93 million in livestock losses across the state, according to Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nState and dairy officials are turning to the massive, messy task of cleaning up 18,000 charred carcasses.

She was in critical condition as of Tuesday.\n\nSpecial report:10 years after tragic Texas chemical explosion, risk remains high\n\nDealing with cattle deaths in Texas\n\nWhile state fire investigators look into the cause of the blaze, officials with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service have descended onto the scene to advise and monitor the disposal of the animals.\n\nIn a statement, TCEQ said its Amarillo office \"is providing assistance to South Fork Dairy to ensure that dead livestock and any other debris is disposed of in accordance with TCEQ rules and regulations,\" including ensuring the animals are buried at least 50 feet from the nearest public water well and outside the 100-year floodplain.\n\nOn its website, TCEQ lists more than 13 rules surrounding the disposal of livestock carcasses, including making sure they're buried in at least three feet of soil, and covered as soon as possible, \"ideally the same day.\"\n\nThe incident could also draw agents from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, as well as scientists with the Environmental Protection Agency – all monitoring how the dead animals may contaminate soil, air or aquifers, said Andy Vestal, a retired professor and extension specialist at Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service who has assisted in large-scale cattle disposal. The efforts are aimed at protecting both humans and livestock, he said.\n\n\"You have an element of human public health and livestock sustainability to deal with,\" Vestal said.\n\nGraphics:18,000 cows – enough to cover 26 football fields\n\nHow many cattle were killed in the fire?\n\nThe fire was the deadliest involving cattle recorded by the Animal Welfare Institute since it began tracking barn and animal pen fires in 2013.\n\nOverall, the group has tracked 6.5 million animals killed in fires in that span, with chickens making up more than 90% of the fatalities. This week, the number of cattle herd killed by fires jumped from 7,385 to 25,385, after the institute added the South Fork incident.\n\nWho owned the Texas dairy company?\n\nState records show the South Fork Dairy farm was owned by the Brand family. Frank Brand did not return several requests for comment. A neighbor told the industry publication Dairy Herd that the Brand family was \"a great family and customer, and said the community supported them.\n\nDimmitt Mayor Roger Malone told USA TODAY the dairy had opened in the area just over three years ago and employed 50 to 60 people.\n\nRules about cattle, farm animals\n\nThe incident has drawn the ire from animal activists, who have lobbied for more fire regulations at large-scale farms such as the South Fork Dairy.\n\nFarmers and cattle raisers are not required to abide by the same fire codes or animal welfare rules as zoos and aquariums, creating disparities in treatment, said Allie Granger, a policy associate with the Animal Welfare Institute.\n\n\"There's a huge gap in protection when it comes to animals used for agriculture,\" she said.\n\nThough there are rules for disposing carcasses, having such a large number makes the job formidable, said Mukhtar, who co-wrote a widely-used handbook on cattle disposal.\n\nThe preferred method is often taking them to a landfill that accepts animal carcasses, which are often engineered to protect the environment from the waste. But hauling so many dead cows to landfalls would be time-consuming, costly and unrealistic, he said.\n\nBurning the carcasses would take too long since you could only burn three or four cows at a time using mobile incinerators, Mukhtar said. And composting would require an unfathomable amount of organic material – such as hay mixed with manure -- to cover all 18,000 animals.\n\nBurying them on site, though the least-recommended option because of the risks of pollutants seeping into the soil and aquifer, is the most likely outcome in the South Fork farm case, he said. The main risk with this method is what's known as \"leachate,\" or liquids that eventually seep out of the carcasses and into the surrounding soil.\n\nWhatever method is chosen, owners and regulators will need to act fast: As they decompose, cow carcasses release gasses, such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, that – if leaked in large enough quantities – could pose air pollution risks, Mukhtar said.\n\nBut nothing about disposing of 18,000 carcasses promises to be fast.\n\n\"It’s a major, complex conundrum that they're in,\" he said.\n\nFollow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/960454/about-18000-cows-killed-in-texas-dairy-farm-explosion", "title": "18,000 cows killed in Texas dairy farm explosion | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

What makes them valuable?\n\nCatalytic converters filter harmful pollutants from a car's exhaust system. They contain valuable metals that make them targets for theft. They are regularly targeted car parts, sometimes stolen right out of driveways.\n\nLocated between the engine and the muffler, they contain high-value precious metals. The value of these metals per ounce has skyrocketed. Here are the values of each material, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau:\n\nRhodium: $10,700\n\nPalladium: $1,568\n\nPlatinum: $1,010\n\nCatalytic converters can be removed with a battery-operated saw in minutes. They are then sold for a few hundred dollars to scrap recyclers.\n\nFor ripped-off car owners, the pain has just begun. Replacing the catalytic converter can cost $1,500 to $5,000, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. And insurance may not cover it.\n\nWhat is a catalytic converter?

The alleged conspiracy involved stolen trucks they would use to rip ATMs from the ground and gain access to the vault.\n\nThat trio is also accused of burglaries of two New Hampshire jewelry stores on Jan. 12. Prosecutors said the combined value of stolen jewelry was found to be more than $137,000, and each store sustained about $10,000 in damage.\n\n18,000 cows killed in explosion:Fire at Texas dairy farm may be largest cattle killing ever\n\nContributing: Jessica Guynn, USA TODAY\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

It was the third time since Tecpile's marriage to Veronica Montalvo that he left his country to work on a Wisconsin dairy farm.\n\nThe trip, more than 2,000 miles, is not uncommon among the families in and around Astacinga. The area has almost 7,000 people. Unemployment is in the double digits and virtually everyone – 96% – lives below the poverty level. Money sent from those working in the USA is one of the only ways to build solid new homes made of concrete.\n\nTecpile left five years ago and remains in Wisconsin. He works six days a week, about 10 hours a day at Rosenholm Dairy in Buffalo County. After work, he prepares dinner, takes a shower and, most evenings, calls home. Every two weeks, he heads to a grocery store in Arcadia and sends $300 to $500 to his family back in Mexico.\n\nTecpile and Montalvo want to finish a home they are building in Astacinga – get the bathroom and kitchen done, install a tile floor, paint the walls. They hope to start their own business someday.\n\nThat means for now, Megan will know her father only through the nightly calls and by browsing photos on her mother's cellphone.\n\n“There’s no other option,” Tecpile says.\n\nReliable numbers on immigrants working in the dairy industry are hard to come by. A national survey taken five years ago for the National Milk Producers Federation estimated the immigrant workforce at 51% of the total.\n\nWorkers in Wisconsin express little doubt immigrants account for a larger portion of the dairy industry workforce today. They don't work on just the biggest farms but also on operations that grew their herd beyond what a family can handle.\n\nWhile unemployment is low, many farmers fill openings by passing word to Mexican laborers on-site, then accept the new workers who show up without asking too many questions.\n\nSome farmers say they haven’t encountered a U.S.-born applicant in years.\n\nEntry-level jobs may pay $11 to $13 an hour and can include free – albeit modest – housing. The immigrants may have to work nights, milk hundreds of cows every shift, toil in the wind and snow. The job can be dangerous; not everyone makes it back to their family.\n\nImmigrants say the jobs are a ladder to a better life; farmers say the immigrants are the only means of affordable labor. So despite the rancor that surrounds national immigration policy, the workers keep coming and the farms keep hiring.\n\nIn dairy barns across Wisconsin, farmers and workers said there is a simple truth: Without the work of Latino immigrants – many, if not most, of them undocumented – the signature industry in America’s Dairyland would collapse.\n\nDairyland in Distress:Americans love soda, fancy water and fake milk. Can the dairy industry keep up?\n\nNew rivals:Wisconsin farmers helped hook world on dairy, but those customers are now competitors\n\nBeyond the USA:How Wisconsin trading partners Canada and Mexico survive\n\nFew Americans willing to do the work\n\nHiring immigrants caught on among Wisconsin dairy farms in the late 1990s and early 2000s, according to University of Wisconsin research.\n\nBeginning in 2004, the state increased its annual milk production every year, and beginning in 2009, it annually set records – streaks that continue to this day. In 2012, then-Gov. Scott Walker initiated an incentive program urging farmers to produce even more, in the belief that foreign markets could absorb the increase. This fall, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue essentially told family dairy farmers in Wisconsin: Get big or get out.\n\nAll of that increased production required new workers.\n\nJohn Rosenow says half of his Buffalo County farm’s 18 employees – including Tecpile – are from Mexico. He started hiring them in 1998 when he was having trouble finding local workers.\n\nHe recalls hiring a retired state trooper. Within days, the trooper walked up his driveway and said he was leaving because he couldn’t keep pace with the milking operation. The dairy farmer kept him on but moved him to a new job.\n\nRosenow made his first immigrant hire after seeing an ad from a Dallas recruiting company. It sent him a worker named Manuel, who knocked out 10 hours a day for 54 days straight. When Manuel left, Rosenow hired two more Mexican workers. Over time, other farmers asked him for help hiring immigrants.\n\nIn the past 10 to 15 years, he has probably had about 150 job candidates. Only two were American-born, and neither was willing to do what was necessary, he says. One didn’t want to work on Fridays or weekends.\n\nOmar Guerrero says his experiences are similar. During his time at Elkhart Lake’s Drake Dairy, the farm has received two job applications from American-born candidates. One lasted through an hour of training. The other didn’t really want the job; he just needed to claim he was searching for work to avoid losing food stamps.\n\nWhen Guerrero arrived in Wisconsin 22 years ago, he didn’t have any difficulties finding a dairy farm job. There were barely any Latinos then. Farmers would even pay bonuses – say, $500 – to workers who could recruit newcomers.\n\nGuerrero, now a citizen and settled with his family in the USA, started out as an undocumented immigrant, working as a milker, one of the toughest jobs on a dairy farm. At Drake Dairy, he learned more about the operation, took on new responsibilities and moved into management. Now he has a stake in the farm.\n\nHe is proud to have helped push the farm from 400 cows to 2,500. He says many of the workers are undocumented and only the ones who work outside with tractors are American-born. Across Wisconsin, he guesses, more than 90% of the immigrants in the dairy industry are undocumented.\n\nL.A. Auto Show:Land Rover Defender's return thrills off-road enthusiasts\n\nBlack Friday:How scammers use gift cards, hot toy deals to trick you\n\nPay an issue in attracting workers\n\nGuerrero says he does not have difficulty finding workers; he’s built up a network of connections.\n\nSome farms struggle to fill holes. They could compete for workers better if they raised wages, and some have gone to $14 and $15 an hour, Guerrero says. But for farms barely breaking even or losing money, increasing the payroll is prohibitive.\n\nHans Breitenmoser started to hire immigrant workers at his Merrill dairy farm 15 to 20 years ago. The farm had expanded beyond the point where his family could do the work by itself and the homegrown labor pool wasn’t there. The farm has 450 cows. Nine of the 12 hired workers are Latinos.\n\nBreitenmoser says most dairy farmers are used to the idea of workers not being born in the USA. His parents, after all, came from Switzerland.\n\nStarting pay on his farm is $12 and $13 an hour – a higher rate, he says, than what his farm really can afford. He acknowledges there's little vetting; hiring the first person through the door is better than being selective and ending up with no person at all.\n\n“I’ll hire them, and I’ll cross my fingers that they turn out to be a good employee,” he says.\n\nThe dairy farm that hired Blanca Hernández and her sister Guadalupe in 2006 had never hired anyone, much less Mexican workers. Hernández was told the owners didn’t trust foreigners, but they were unable to keep doing all the work by themselves. A nearby farmer vouched for immigrant workers. Hernández and her sister became the first employees.\n\nBy the time she took the job, Hernández had earned a law degree in Mexico and had worked once before in the USA. The law degree didn't lead to a job, and the work – low-wage jobs for a cleaning company, airplane parts factory and car wash in North Carolina – didn't allow her to save.\n\nShe left her hometown of Texhuacán and headed back across because her sister Guadalupe was going with her 4-year-old daughter. Crossing the border with a child is particularly dangerous; Hernández wanted to help. Once across, they made their way to Wisconsin, where Guadalupe's partner worked.\n\nHernández says the Durand farm owners who gave them jobs were surprised to see the sisters writing down the correct number of hours for their pay – at the time, $6.25 per hour.\n\nDuring their first days at the farm, the sisters cleaned the parlor in addition to milking 320 cows. The milk quality went up because the sisters were vigilant about cleanliness and sanitation.\n\n“If I’m going to be a street sweeper, I’m going to be a good street sweeper,\" Hernández says. \"If I’m going to be a teacher, I’m going to be a good teacher.”\n\nWhen the farm grew to 500 cows or more, Hernández said, she was working 14 hours a day with no days off.\n\nThe sisters told the farm owner they were returning to Texhuacán. By then, the owners had undergone a change of heart.\n\n“After four years, the boss wept,” Hernández says.\n\nImmigrants take on risky, difficult jobs\n\nDairy jobs are inherently risky.\n\nAt 6.1 injuries per 100 full-time employees in 2018, dairy workers at farms with more than 10 employees suffered higher odds of getting injured than workers in sawmills, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nationwide, that meant 6,500 injuries on those larger farms.\n\nFrom 2012 through 2017, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration increased inspections of dairy farms with more than 10 employees or a temporary labor camp. At least 51 Wisconsin dairy farms were found in violation of some safety regulations during this period, according to the OSHA data.\n\nMexican immigrants often work the most wearing jobs. A University of Wisconsin study in 2009 found that immigrants tended to be relegated to routine, lower-paid tasks such as milkers or pushers, who clean manure in the barns and bring the cows to the milking parlors. When the study was done, 62% of the immigrants in the dairy workforce held one of those two jobs; 16% of the American-born workers held them.\n\nDairy workers averaged 57 hours of work a week and fewer than five days off each month.\n\nIn New York state, according to a survey in 2014-15 of 88 immigrant dairy farmworkers – the majority working on farms with more than 500 cows – about half of the workers said they felt rushed on the job, and breaks could be as short as five minutes in a 12-hour workday.\n\nThe survey, conducted by the Workers’ Center of Central New York and the Worker Justice Center of New York, found that more than one-fourth of the workers had suffered wage theft and two-thirds had experienced one or more injuries on the job, most of those disclosing they suffered an injury so severe it required medical attention.\n\nJohn Peck, executive director of the Madison-based advocacy group Family Farm Defenders, says he would like Wisconsin to be a leader in socially responsible milk production, which would take into account paying workers better wages and paying farmers better prices, instead of measuring only the quality of the product.\n\n“Farmers are always struggling to find workers, especially if they are not paying people well,” he says. “But at the same time, there are farmers going bankrupt. So how can they afford to pay workers, if they are losing their farms?”\n\nPeck says consumers may fail to connect inexpensive milk at the store with inadequate pay for farmers, and with low-wage immigrant labor.\n\n“If you want a cheap food policy, that means that you’ll be exploiting workers,” he says. “And the workers that are going to be exploited are going to probably be undocumented immigrants.”\n\nLong, grueling hours\n\nSalvador Salas worked on several farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota. He has good memories of one owner who made breakfast for workers and a farm that offered $12 an hour and paid overtime, as required in Minnesota.\n\nThere also was a Wisconsin farm where he worked 11- and 12-hour split workdays without a single day off, even for Thanksgiving or Christmas, for four years. He says the farm owner rarely paid him for more than 10 hours a day, no matter how long he worked cleaning barns, herding cows, feeding calves, pushing feed, milking. He started at $7.25 an hour plus free housing. His wages topped out at $11 an hour.\n\n“When one needs to work, there’s no (such thing as) hard work,” says Salas, who was undocumented his entire time here.\n\nThe toughest times for Salas were the winters when it was freezing outside and he had to move tires off tarps covering mounds of feed.\n\n“That’s when it feels uglier,” he says. “When the wind is blowing and you are on top.”\n\nHe hurt his back working on the farm, he says, and told his boss about the accident – but never asked to see a doctor. He feared the farmer might think he was lying and wouldn't help him.\n\nSalas returned to Mexico early this year after more than six years on U.S. dairy farms. He was worn out and wanted to see his family.\n\nHe lives in Astacinga in a home he built by adding on to his father's home, using savings from the dairy work. A chiropractor helped alleviate his back pain.\n\nCouple's plans cut short\n\nAntonia Rodríguez worked in dairy longer than Salas. Her partner, Gerardo Nájera, says she used to take on 12-hour shifts before he was deported in 2012, and she had to cut back to care for their two U.S.-born children.\n\nHer sister, Consuelo, says she would tell Antonia that working at a dairy farm was too hard, a man’s job. But her sister had never been scared of work. At 53, undocumented and living with her two younger children in a trailer that needed repairs, Antonia kept working at Clarks Mills Dairy Farm in Reedsville.\n\n“As a mother, one has to work in whatever you can,” Consuelo says.\n\nThe last time the sisters talked on the phone, Antonia sounded weary. It was \"one of those times when one becomes sad – you miss your family, your parents, your siblings,” Consuelo says.\n\nNájera says the plan was for their younger kids to finish school in the USA and for Rodríguez to return one day to Ciudad Juárez. He was building their home, and she was sending money to finish it. She would tell him that she wanted to go back so they could be together.\n\nOne afternoon last March, the cows were not lined up properly at the milking parlor. Rodríguez walked up from the pit where workers attach milking machines to udders and onto a concrete pad where the cows lingered. She didn’t have a stick or any physical barrier between her and the cows.\n\nAs she tried to move them, a cow knocked her against a half wall. Other employees heard her scream, came to her aid and moved the animal away. Rodríguez was unconscious, and as the ambulance arrived at the hospital, her heart stopped and she died.\n\nThe autopsy found rib fractures and lacerations in her heart and left lung.\n\nOSHA fined the 800-cow farm, saying it didn’t ensure employees working with cows were protected from being struck and it didn't train workers to improve safety.\n\nFor that, and another unrelated violation, the farm was fined $15,155.\n\nRobert Goehring, co-owner of the farm, says Rodríguez had worked there since 2014, and he had personally trained her on how to move the animals. The OSHA representative said Goehring needed to train employees on animal behavior, which he says he hadn’t heard about.\n\nConsuelo Rodríguez is taking care of her sister's younger kids, 10 and 16, so they can finish high school in the USA. She set up a small altar at home for her sister, displaying her glasses, earrings and photos. She took it down because her nephew said it made him sad.\n\nThe children speak with their father regularly.\n\n“They say they are fine,” he says. “But one knows they aren’t.”\n\nLatino influence grows\n\nThe Rev. Matthew Sauer, pastor at the Manitowoc Cooperative Ministry, says that when he arrived in 2005, there were some Latino workers, but they weren’t very visible in the community. The Manitowoc School District had a 5% Hispanic enrollment.\n\nSauer noticed the immigrant population rising in 2010-11.\n\nIn the most recent school year, the school district had 14% Latino enrollment. In the city of Manitowoc, there are at least five Mexican restaurants, two with small attached grocery stores. In spring, a bull-riding rodeo attracted hundreds of Latinos, many of them from nearby dairy farms.\n\nManitowoc is among the 30 counties in the USA with the most dairy operations, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 2017 census.\n\nSauer says U.S.-born residents in the area have become more comfortable with the changing demographics. “Younger people are growing up with them, in their classes, which means that parents are meeting these cultures,” he says.\n\nThe story is similar in other rural Wisconsin communities. Though many Latino immigrants keep to themselves, their influence is unmistakable. Although many return to their hometowns, some settle in Wisconsin and start a family.\n\nIn Clark County, which ranks second in the USDA 2017 census, this month's historical society newsletter noted a recent quinceañera celebration. In Marathon County, which ranks fourth in the census, the Hispanic Soccer League, founded in 2002, changed its name to the Central Wisconsin Adult Soccer League to be more inclusive, and U.S.-born players have joined immigrants on the pitch.\n\nTrump election sparked worries\n\nWhen Donald Trump won the presidential election after campaigning to crack down on illegal immigration, many Wisconsin dairy workers were nervous. Some left their jobs; some left the state or the country. Most kept working, and the threats never materialized.\n\nApolonio Sánchez says he planned to leave for Canada if Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials started to launch raids close by. His boss on a 120-cow farm in the Alma area told him not to worry, that wouldn’t happen. He stayed.\n\nSánchez says there are still undocumented immigrants arriving to work on the farms. There have been ICE arrests, but nothing approaching a massive crackdown.\n\nPablo Cruz works on a farm with more than 1,500 cows in Kewaunee County. He says most of the workers are undocumented – not only from Mexico but more recently from Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nBreitenmoser, the farmer from Merrill, says the rhetoric against immigrants hasn’t been good for a dairy industry that relies on workers not born in the USA.\n\nIf all undocumented immigrants were to be deported, he says, “we would have dead cows piled up in our farms.”\n\nHe favors a process that would provide a path for undocumented immigrants to acquire legal status. “It’s disgusting that people are treating them like criminals for working their butts off,” he says.\n\nRosenow, the Buffalo County farmer, says everyone should understand the necessity of immigrants, but “I don’t see the solution happening very soon.”\n\nA push for path to residency\n\nThe American Dairy Coalition and the National Milk Producers Federation have pushed to get dairy farms access to foreign agricultural guest workers through a visa program that is limited to seasonal work, such as crop harvesting. Dairy farms can’t hire these guest workers for year-round work.\n\nThe American Dairy Coalition has supported replacing the guest worker program with one that would eliminate some worker protections, such as the requirement to pay a prevailing wage.\n\nWorkers advocate groups pushed for a path to permanent residency and citizenship, which the National Milk Producers Federation supported. The worker advocate groups resisted efforts to expand the guest worker program, saying it leaves workers in a position to be exploited. Under the program, if a worker doesn't do what an employer asks without complaint, the employer can fire the worker, which in general means the end of his or her visa.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Peck, with Family Farm Defenders, says undocumented immigrants are essential to the dairy economy and part of Wisconsin’s rural communities. “If they are so integral to our economy, why can’t they become citizens?” he asked.\n\nIn November, after months of negotiations that included agribusiness representatives and workers groups, 49 U.S. House members co-sponsored bipartisan legislation that would provide undocumented farmworkers and family members with a path to citizenship. It would allow dairy farms access to thousands of agricultural guest workers for year-round jobs and would dedicate an additional 40,000 green cards per year for agricultural workers.\n\nAgricultural employers could sponsor workers' getting green cards, and some seasonal guest workers could apply directly. The bill would create a pilot program with visas allowing workers to move freely among agricultural employers.\n\nThe bill would require agricultural employees to use the E-verify program to check whether immigrants are authorized to work. The bill has been referred to four House committees. If passed, it could face an uphill battle in the Senate.\n\nNo Wisconsin representative has co-sponsored the bill.\n\nBorder crossings more difficult\n\nTecpile says he would love to travel home, but there's no guarantee he could get back. Crossing the border on the way north is riskier and more expensive, he says. The smugglers, called coyotes, who guide and transport immigrants illegally ask for $8,000 or more.\n\nWhen Trump was elected, Tecpile says, he never thought of leaving. He knew American farmers need workers too much.\n\n“I didn’t pay attention,\" he says. \"I had to work.”\n\nIn Mexico, Montalvo, his wife, says it’s hard to be separated this long.\n\nMegan has never had a birthday party when she could hug her father. She wants him to take her to school. She wants him home.\n\n“Sometimes my daughter needs her dad, but he isn’t here,” Montalvo says. “She knows he is working.”\n\nTheir son Kevin, 16, says holidays and other special occasions are tough.\n\n“When all the family gathers, he isn’t here,” he says.\n\nMany of Kevin's friends, he says, also have parents working in the USA who stay away for five or six years at a time. He says he should go to Wisconsin, work on a dairy farm, be with his father and build \"a good future.\"\n\nHe isn’t afraid of trying to cross the border, an attempt that has left many migrants dead. His mother doesn’t want him to go yet. He is too young.\n\nMaybe, she says, he could try crossing after he turns 18.\n\nContributing: Andrew Mollica\n\nFor this story, reporter Maria Perez of the Journal Sentinel staff interviewed immigrants in Spanish, translated their words into English, then checked back with them to make sure the phrasing was correct.\n\nEmail her at maria.perez@jrn.com; follow her on Twitter: @mariajpsl.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/23/fallen-hero-honored-manatees-rescued-rabid-bats-campus-hungry-bears-hibernating-news-around-states/111365684/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The state’s preservation agency is investigating whether pottery shards, bone fragments and spearheads found near where a subdivision is being built might be evidence of an ancient settlement. Al.com reported that the Alabama Historical Commission is reviewing reports of nearby residents and an Army archaeologist who raised concerns about items found near a development called Flint Crossing, located in Huntsville near the Flint River. Jeff Benton Homes began building the subdivision last year, but nearby residents reported finding items that could be linked to a former Indian settlement in and around the site. They contacted Ben Hoksbergen, post archaeologist at the U.S. Army’s Redstone Arsenal, who said he informed the developer and the city about the finds in mid-2019. Jeff Benton, owner of Jeff Benton Homes, said in an email the company had no prior knowledge of “significant artifacts” or human burials on the site. But Hoksbergen said he found an assessment conducted by a private archaeological firm in 2010 that showed significant evidence of a Native American village at the site from roughly 500 to 900 AD. People who live near the site have sent him photos of what appeared to be bones, he said. Some bones found at the site were most likely those of deer, Hoksbergen said, but some appeared to be fragments of a human leg bone, skull and teeth. Hoksbergen said he informed the developer and the city the construction might violate laws protecting human burial or historic sites but construction continued. He also told the Alabama Historical Commission, which is conducting a review. The Alabama Historical Commission said it couldn’t comment on an active investigation, but law requires that construction stop if human remains are found at a site. Hoksbergen said an assessment of the site conducted a decade ago by Tennessee Valley Archaeological Research found a large number of artifacts.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Navy will collect public comment about its proposal for permits to again use the Gulf of Alaska for training exercises, a spokeswoman said. “Anytime the Navy wants to do any sort of action, they have to go through an Environmental Impact Statement,” said Julianne Stanford of Navy Region Northwest. Exercise Northern Edge is a major Army, Navy and Air Force exercise held every two years across Alaska, the Juneau Empire reported. The supercarrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and its escorts took part in exercises last year. The public has expressed concern about Navy sonar and explosive ordnance disturbing marine life. The environmental review, Stanford said, is about hearing concerns so that the Navy can avoid negatively affecting marine mammals such as humpback whales, gray whales and Steller sea lions. The Gulf of Alaska has been a training ground for more than three decades, Stanford said, and best practices have been put in place to minimize disruptions. The Navy and regulatory agencies have not noted changes in marine mammals numbers in training areas, she said. “The Navy has developed numerous mitigations that include navigating away from marine mammals, implementing exclusion zones to cease activities or power down and shut down equipment if marine mammals are in proximity to training,” Stanford said.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale:The school board ended its yearslong superintendent search Saturday, unanimously naming Scott Menzel its permanent leader. The decision came after 18 hours of deliberations that started Friday morning. Five groups composed of teachers, students, parents and residents, administrators and staff members in the Scottsdale Unified School District interviewed three finalists and provided feedback to the board. Menzel currently serves as superintendent of the Washtenaw Intermediate School District in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He was one of three finalists who had been narrowed from 29 applicants. The other finalists included Kimberly Guerin, the district’s assistant superintendent of educational services, and Shelley Redinger, superintendent of Spokane (Washington) Public Schools. Menzel has led Washtenaw for eight years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He earned doctorate degrees in philosophy and educational leadership from Eastern Michigan University. He was a finalist in Peoria Unified School District’s superintendent search, which concluded in December. The Scottsdale board deliberated all day Friday and for six hours Saturday about the decision, according to spokeswoman Amy Bolton. The board chose to meet Saturday to ensure continuity of discussions and to not prolong the decision, she said. Current Superintendent John Kriekard’s contract runs through June 30. District officials hope Menzel could begin on July 1. Kriekard came out of retirement to provide the district a steadying hand when Denise Birdwell resigned in April 2018 after more than a year of controversy.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The head of the state lottery said he opposes a measure a group is trying to get on the ballot that would allow thousands of coin-operated “amusement machines” across the state to raise money for the lottery program. Lottery Director Bishop Woosley announced his opposition with the leaders of a group formed to campaign against the constitutional amendment vying for a spot on Arkansas’ ballot. Supporters of the proposal have until July 3 to gather nearly 90,000 signatures from registered voters to qualify for the November election. The amendment would require the lottery to issue 50 licenses to own and lease the machines that would award noncash prizes such as lottery tickets or vouchers for merchandise valued at less than $5. Each licensee would be allowed to operate up to 300 machines. Twenty percent of net receipts from the machines would go toward the state’s lottery. But Woosley said the machines would ultimately result in a loss to the state, with the lottery facing additional costs for licensing and oversight. He also criticized the measure for prohibiting any local limits on the machines. Arcade Arkansas, the group behind the expanded gambling proposal, has raised more than $360,000 and spent nearly $359,000 on its campaign. A spokesman for the group said Woosley was entitled to his opinion but believed opponents were mischaracterizing the proposal, noting it wouldn’t allow cash prizes. The measure is vying for the ballot months after Arkansas implemented a voter-approved amendment legalizing casinos in four counties. Casinos have opened at a West Memphis dog track, a Hot Springs horse track and another location in Pine Bluff under the amendment. Protect Arkansas Communities, a group launched to oppose the proposed amendment, hasn’t received any money from the casinos but has reached out to them, campaign consultant Robert McLarty told reporters.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBrentwood: A bomb used to get rid of gophers might have started a brush fire in a Northern California suburb, authorities told the East Bay Times. The fire that started about 2:30 p.m. Friday burned seven acres in Brentwood in Contra Costa County, Firefighters put out the blaze two hours later, the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District said. If the fire is determined to have been started by a gopher bomb, it would be reminiscent of a scene in the 1980 movie “Caddyshack” in which a frustrated groundskeeper played by Bill Murray used dynamite in a futile effort to get rid of a burrowing rodent. No injuries were reported in connection with the fire. “We would like to take the opportunity to remind everyone to be mindful of their conditions and this early season fire should be a reminder of what can happen very quickly,” the East Contra Costa fire district wrote on Facebook, calling the blaze accidental.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Police are looking for a person who broke into a woman’s apartment and stole her underwear last week – and they are asking anyone with a similar situation to report it. The victim came home from work on Feb. 10 and reported someone had ransacked her apartment and stolen her underwear, according to a news release from police. Police have not identified any suspects. Because of the potential sexual motivation of the crime, police are asking anyone with information or other unreported incidents to come forward. “We know that people typically don’t call police if an item of clothing is missing,” Sgt. Heather Moore, who leads the Crimes Against Persons Unit, said in a video statement. “If you’ve had personal items disappear from your home and you suspect they may have been stolen, please contact police. In any situation that just feels off, trust your instincts and give us a call. Your tip may be our best lead.” Anyone with information is asked to contact officer RJ Tutle at 970-416-2825 or email tipsline@fcgov.com. People who wish to remain anonymous can contact Crime Stoppers of Larimer County at 970-221-6868 or www.stopcriminals.org.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Puerto Rico residents looking to relocate to Connecticut after recent natural disasters are getting financial assistance to help with housing. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday that $75,000 in state funding will be allocated to provide housing support for Puerto Rican residents coming to the state after recent earthquakes on the island territory. Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin told a news conference Friday that when news of natural disasters reaches the state, thousands of residents wonder if their family members are going to be all right. He added that many in Puerto Rico also look to Connecticut as a place of refuge and a possible new home. Connecticut already has a large population of Puerto Rican descent. The money will be used to make security deposits or help with paying rent and will be distributed to nonprofit organizations like Alpha Community Services in Bridgeport, Casa Otoñal in New Haven, and the San Juan Center in Hartford, among others. Housing Commissioner Seila Mosquera-Bruna noted in a release that over the last few years Puerto Rican families have suffered devastating natural disasters including the recent earthquakes. Hurricane Maria – a Category 5 hurricane – struck the island in 2017.\n\nDelaware\n\nMagnolia:A 9-year-old girl stricken with cancer appeared on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Feb. 20, according to the Love 4 Layla Facebook page dedicated to her cancer fight. A preview of the segment posted online showed Layla Mosley and several other children with cancer surprised by an appearance by rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs. Mosley, who is fighting an extremely rare form of bone cancer called Ewing’s Sarcoma, appeared on the program in coordination with Fighting All Monsters, a nonprofit group supporting children facing life-threatening illnesses. The group had been leading an online campaign for Combs to dance with their children. The children even made a dance video to Combs’ “Bad Boy for Life” to entice the entertainer to join them. In the “Ellen” preview clip, Combs surprised the children and Mosley told DeGeneres about how her trip to California had been. “So far it’s been great. I’m just so excited to be here to see you because I watch your show all the time. I love your ‘Game of Games’ show and I just love everything about you,” she tells a smiling DeGeneres, eliciting applause and “aws” from the audience. With eight children seated in front of her, DeGeneres responds with a deadpan joke: “Look, I hate to pick favorites, but she is mine.” When Combs appeared after faking out the audience with a taped video apologizing for not attending, Mosley leapt off the couch and was the first child to run across the stage and jump in his arms. Her segment was apparently filmed on Feb. 19 with Love 4 Layla posting, “She had the most incredible day!! Lots more pictures to come!! Layla is having the best time ever out in Hollywood!”\\ Mosley’s cancer fight isn’t her first. In 2016, she was first diagnosed with metastatic Ewing’s Sarcoma at the age of 5, which affects only about 200 children and young adults in the United States annually. She underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatments at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia for the Stage 4 cancer, completing a 16-month fight. But after two years, she relapsed in May and has been fighting ever since with help from her friends and family, who have set up a GoFundMe page and have held fundraisers and raffles for her.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The DC Board of Elections confirmed that some mailers went out with the wrong primary date, WUSA-TV reported. The correct primary date is June 2. The District actually has two elections coming up before the general election. The primary is first on June 2. A couple of weeks later, on June 16, DC is holding a special election for Jack Evans’ former position, the Ward 2 council seat. The Board of Elections said some people received voter registration cards with a different election date listed. Ladawnae White, a spokeswoman for the D.C. Board of Elections, said some of the cards listed the primary as the third Tuesday in June. White said the mix-up happened, because of an earlier template created before the primary date was changed to June 2. She said the template has been updated to reflect the June 2 date, and all future mailings will have the correct date printed. In a statement released on Twitter, the Board of Elections said in part, “We regret the error and will correct it in all future communications ... We have planned a number of future communications about important events in this election cycle, and voters will be well-informed about when and where to vote.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: A female manatee named Marlin and its calf were rescued after wildlife specialists found them injured in Florida waters. The South Florida Sun Sentinel reported the pair was being treated for wounds and infections at the Miami Seaquarium. The mother was found Saturday with boat strike wounds. The female calf has a wound on her underside. On Tuesday, rescuers initially spotted the mother swimming sideways, which indicates lung damage. On Wednesday, the manatees swam away and disappeared under a low bridge in Fort Lauderdale. After Saturday’s rescue by experts from SeaWorld in Orlando and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, both were started on antibiotics. Marlin will be scheduled for a procedure where veterinarians will drain liquid or air from its chest. The newspaper said boats and other watercraft were the biggest cause of manatee deaths statewide last year, causing at least 136 of the 606 animal deaths.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Health officials said students at Savannah State University have been warned after a rabid bat was found on campus. The Chatham County Health Department said the bat tested positive for rabies after it was taken to a veterinarian. It was found Feb. 18 on the rear porch of the school’s College of Business Administration building. The health department said in a news release it was interviewing students who had contact with the bat to determine whether they needed treatment. Rabies is a potentially fatal disease that can be spread from infected animals to humans through bites, scratches and other contact. Health department officials said people should be aware of the risk of possible rabies exposure before getting close to wild animals such as bats, foxes and raccoons.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Oahu experienced its hottest year on record in 2019, according to federal officials and municipal authorities. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the island reached its highest temperatures last year and the National Weather Service said 273 daily temperature records were tied or broken across the state,Hawaii Public Radio reported Thursday. A separate study by the City and County of Honolulu also found the state experienced its hottest recorded day last year. The city’s Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency performed the first Community Heat Assessment on Aug. 31. The study found the maximum heat index in several Oahu communities was more than 100 degrees, with Waimalu Plaza Shopping Center recording the highest temperature at 107.3. “By all indications, that’s the new normal,” said Josh Stanbro, Honolulu’s chief resilience officer. “So that’s why we have to take action immediately to try to reverse that trend. We have to completely slam on the brakes in terms of burning carbon fuels for our energy source.” Mayor Kirk Caldwell said Wednesday that increasing the city’s tree canopy is expected to help cool communities. City officials advised residents to protect themselves from high temperatures, especially children and the elderly. Honolulu Emergency Services Director Jim Howe urged residents to not leave children or pets in locked cars on hot days and advised surfers and stand-up paddleboarders to drink a liter of water before heading onto the water. “The time you need to be most prepared is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.,” Howe said. “Every one of our lifeguards here knows that when you’re out at the beach, the first place you go is you go for the shade. So you want to stay in the shade and you want to stay well-hydrated.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Companies that are responsible for checking the quality of Idaho’s road materials have altered the results of their asphalt tests thousands of times, government documents showed. Those changes might have allowed contractors that repair and build Idaho’s highway infrastructure to get bonus payments when they should have been penalized for substandard work – or even forced to tear up the asphalt and replace it. For decades, Idaho has paid private contractors to repair and build the state’s vast system of highways, roads and bridges, the Idaho Statesman reported. They are trusted to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars and to ensure the state’s infrastructure is built to last and is safe for drivers. Although roads are under construction, Idaho and other states require contractors to take samples of the asphalt they’re using and run it through a series of tests. Those tests determine whether the asphalt is high quality and the right kind of material for that road. Can it withstand the winter snow and ice in northern Idaho? Can it withstand all the drivers and truckers who travel Interstate 84 in southern Idaho? Front-line workers for several companies involved in road construction throughout Idaho were recorded in 2018 changing their test results before submitting the results to the state for payment, a Statesman analysis of government records found. A Statesman analysis of four highway projects completed in 2018 found that Idaho paid contractors about $8 million, including about $190,000 in bonuses, for asphalt whose test results were altered dozens or hundreds of times. Internal documents from the Idaho Transportation Department say such changes might have allowed construction companies to receive more money than the asphalt was worth. For Idaho taxpayers, that would mean more funds went to private contracting firms and less went to other projects to fix potholes, strengthen highways and improve the state’s crumbling transportation network.\n\nIllinois\n\nBelleville: Cancer-causing chemicals used over the years at Scott Air Force Base in southern Illinois might have leaked into local water supplies, according to a report from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. The state’s EPA said an expanded site inspection is set to begin this summer for signs of the class of substances known collectively as PFAS, which are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they take thousands of years to degrade, the Belleville News-Democrat reported. The newspaper obtained the agency’s report through requesting records under the Freedom of Information Act. U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin said the Air Force contacted his office this month with preliminary details on the contamination at the base and his office has reached out to local elected officials to determine next steps. In recent days, officials started contacting those potentially affected. There is no reason for concern if a person uses tap water from a municipal supply, according to Col. Joseph R. Meyer, vice commander of the 375th Air Mobility Wing at Scott AFB. However, people should worry if they live near the base and drink from a private well. The Air Force Civil Engineer Center is locating and contacting anyone who uses a well within one mile southeast of the base. The center’s officials have identified five people who do so. The Air Force will test well water for PFAS levels, Meyer said. The EPA considers levels below 70 parts per trillion, which equates to roughly a drop of water in an Olympic-sized swimming pool, to be safe for consumption. If tests of well water reveal PFAS levels above EPA standards, individuals who use those wells should immediately stop drinking the water. High levels can cause cancer and birth defects, among other health problems, the EPA said. The Air Force will provide free bottles of water as it develops a long-term solution, Meyer said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An Indiana woman who had given birth just a few days earlier said her instincts kicked in when she stopped along a highway to help save a driver who was on fire after his tanker truck loaded with jet fuel burst into flames. Holly McNally, 35, had just left a hospital’s neointensive care unit Thursday afternoon with her mother after they checked in on her son Connor, who was born Monday. They saw the overturned truck and flames along an Interstate 465 bridge that crosses over Interstate 70 on Indianapolis’ far east side. McNally said she slowed her car and was stunned to see the 59-year-old driver on fire after he managed to get out of the truck on his own. McNally, who has three other children, ages 8, 11 and 15, said that despite the risk to herself, she knew she had to help. Running toward the driver, McNally crossed paths with another man who was bringing a blanket to help extinguish the flames and cover the driver, whose clothes had burned off. As they began walking him away from the fire, an explosion rocked the overturned truck, which the driver told them was loaded with 4,000 gallons of jet fuel. A second explosion then caused the fire to spread and follow the three of them down the embankment. and the driver, who appeared to be in shock, began to slow down. Luckily, another man ran to the embankment and helped move the driver to safety. Another Indiana State Police trooper drove down the highway embankment to meet the three rescuers and the driver. He used clothing from his gym bag to cover the man until emergency medical technicians arrived, Indianapolis Fire Department Battalion Chief Rita Reith said. The driver remained hospitalized in critical condition Friday morning, Reith said. Trucking company Jet Star Inc. released a statement Friday, thanking those who helped save the driver, which it identified as Jeffrey “Duke” Denman.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Dozens of South Sudanese Iowans and allies gathered at the state Capitol on Saturday for a peaceful rally protesting recent violence that left more than 30 dead and 15 children abducted in Abyei, a long disputed region between Sudan and South Sudan. Both countries – that after years of civil war split into independent nations in 2011 – claim the Abyei region in east Africa for ethnic and economic reasons. As a result, clashes between South Sudan’s ethnic Dinkla villages, and Misseriya, a nomadic tribe from Sudan, occur regularly in the region. The United Nations has more than 5,300 peacekeepers – known as the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei – deployed in the region to ease tensions and protect civilians. But on Jan. 22, a suspected Misseriya attack on the Dinkla village of Kolom left at least 32 people dead, dozens wounded and 15 children abducted. Six children have since been recovered. Protesters at Saturday’s rally said children have been abducted and placed into slavery. South Sudan’s government claims the UN failed to protect Kolom and South Sudanese Iowans have expressed anger, as well. During the rally, Abyei community leaders educated attendees on the history of the conflict between Sudan and South Sudan and the status of Abyei. Protesters chanted “Justice, justice for Abyei! Justice, justice for Kolom! Shame, shame UNISFA! Abyei is bleeding and the world is watching!” Some held signs showing graphic images reportedly from the attack last month.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Lawmakers are considering blocking the sale of raw milk or requiring farmers to include warning labels on packaging after the state abandoned a law prohibiting farmers from advertising raw milk outside their farm. The state stopped enforcing the ban after Shepherd’s Gate Dairy operators Mark and Coraleen Bunner filed a lawsuit against the state in October, The Wichita Eagle reported. Attorney General Derek Schmidt and the state Department of Agriculture settled the lawsuit in November resulting in the end of the ban. Schmidt admitted the law was “plainly unconstitutional.” Pasteurized milk undergoes a heating process to kill pathogens. Raw milk that comes straight from a cow or goat is much more likely to carry salmonella, E. coli and other bacteria, according to the Food and Drug Administration. But those who drink and sell raw milk think of it as an all-natural product that brings people closer to the source of their food. The Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee endorsed a bill Thursday that would allow the on-farm sale of raw, unpasteurized milk, so long as each container sold labels it as such. It goes next to the Senate for debate, possibly next week. It remains unknown how the Legislature as a whole would vote. A bill to ban the sale of raw milk have also been proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:Gov. Andy Beshear signed legislation Friday to require that law enforcement officers carry weapons when assigned to provide security at schools. The measure won strong bipartisan support in the legislature. It’s a follow-up to last year’s sweeping school safety law stemming from a 2018 fatal school shooting in Kentucky. Beshear had until Friday to either sign the bill, veto it or let it become law without his signature. In announcing his decision, the governor repeated concerns that the bill’s supporters made for arming school officers – that other law officers couldn’t respond quickly enough to a school shooting. Beshear said he considers the presence of armed officers at schools as a potential deterrent. Republican Sen. Max Wise, the bill’s lead sponsor, said the governor’s action signing the measure into law will go down as an “incredibly important day” for the state. The measure is crucial to the state’s efforts to bolster school safety, Wise said. Last year’s school safety law did not specify whether school police officers – known as school resource officers – needed to carry a weapon. The issue of arming school-based officers has sparked intense debate in the state’s largest school district, which includes Louisville. Beshear said Friday he hopes concerns about arming school officers can be alleviated through the officers’ training.Executive Cabinet Secretary J. Michael Brown said Beshear’s administration welcomes suggestions from the bill’s critics on shaping curriculum and training for school officers. The school safety efforts are in response to the 2018 shooting at Marshall County High School in western Kentucky, where two 15-year-old students, Bailey Holt and Preston Cope, were killed and more than a dozen others were injured when another student opened fire.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state can soon start spending $1.2 billion in federal cash to fortify communities against future flood risks, after the governor’s office announced Friday that federal officials have approved the state’s plan for the funds. The dollars, overseen by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, will bolster an effort that Gov. John Bel Edwards has pushed since the 2016 floods to use regional approaches to flood mitigation and drainage improvements around Louisiana. “HUD’s approval of our plan confirms that Louisiana is headed in the right direction,” Edwards said in a statement. “We have taken proactive steps and served as a blueprint for other states preparing their own flood mitigation plans to use these federal funds in ways that prioritize data, science and regional collaboration to build resilience in the face of future flooding.” The federal aid will be spread across projects in 46 Louisiana parishes identified through the governor’s Louisiana Watershed Initiative as most flood-prone and impacted by water. Edwards’ office said the state expects the federal dollars to be available by the spring.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: Seasonal ferry service between Maine and Nova Scotia is scheduled to resume this summer. Bay Ferries, the Canadian ferry company, said service is expected to begin by June 26, the Bangor Daily News reported Friday. The Cat, a high-speed catamaran, will sail between Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, to Bar Harbor until Labor Day, said Bay Ferries CEO Mark MacDonald. Crossings will then run six days a week – every day but Wednesdays –until the season ends on Oct. 13. The ferry company has to finish its $6.5 million renovation of a Bar Harbor terminal before service can resume, MacDonald said. The company needs to finish installing U.S. Customs and Border inspection booths and renovating the interior of the building.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:Salisbury University said a suspect has been identified in the investigation into racist graffiti on campus, but that person’s identity has yet to be made public. The case is being referred to the Wicomico County state’s attorney’s office for prosecution, according to a Friday news release. The only identifying information about the suspect released so far is that the person is not believed to have an “immediate connection to the campus.” The release does not state if the person is a suspect in one or multiple incidents. The investigation began after the discovery in October and November of vandalism in Fulton Hall involving racist and sexually explicit language that escalated to a threat of violence. More racist graffiti was found on campus on Feb. 19, first in Henson Hall and then in Fulton Hall. That same day the university announced the FBI had been aiding campus police in the open investigations. Administrators canceled classes Thursday for a day of healing, during which various gatherings were scheduled to support students and faculty.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNorton: Authorities have identified a man killed in what authorities said appears to be an explosion caused by a meth lab in Massachusetts. The Bristol County District Attorney’s Office identified the man on Sunday as 38-year-old Edward Rooney. Authorities said Rooney died Saturday after an apparent meth lab explosion in his Norton apartment. Police said they were called to the apartment complex around 1 a.m. and found damage believed to have been caused by the explosion. Police said Rooney had fled the home before first responders arrived. A short time later, authorities were called to an Attleboro home to help a man who was experiencing a medical emergency, officials said. Authorities said residents of the home were awoken in the middle of the night by a man outside who was screaming for help. Officials said the residents let Rooney inside the home, where he collapsed. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.\n\nMichigan\n\nVanderbilt: The state’s 108,000-acre Pigeon River Country State Forest is getting a nearly 600-acre addition in a land deal valued at more than $2 million, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources. The property purchase, completed last month, added the Elk Forest at Black River, which is in Montmorency County, to the state’s public lands. The area is surrounded on three sides by existing state-managed land and includes public access to Walled Lake. The money came from the state’s Forest Legacy Program with matching funds from the agency’s Land Exchange Facilitation Fund and a $75,000 donation from the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, according to state officials. “This spectacular place adds a gem to the crown of Michigan’s public lands,” said Debbie Begalle, DNR forest resources division chief, in a statement. “The land will be open for hiking, hunting, fishing, elk viewing, skiing, snowshoeing, bird watching, mushroom hunting and berry picking, to name just a few activities.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis:The state on Friday shut down a metal recycling company where a fire burned for days and sent up plumes of smoke. The state cited “imminent and substantial danger” to the public, the Star Tribune reported. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued an administrative order prohibiting Northern Metal Recycling from accepting any scrap metal at its plant in Becker, the site of the fire. The order also prohibits the company from accepting scrap metal at its previous facility in north Minneapolis, where it still has many junked cars stored. On Friday, Gov. Tim Walz said he is considering placing a30-day hold on Northern Metal’s recycling permit. Speaking at a forum organized by the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs, Walz said he is looking at ways to hold Northern Metal responsible for pollution caused by last week’s fire. Walz told the audience that he does not trust Northern Metal “to do the right thing,” KMSP-TV reported. The Democratic governor said state regulators would make the decision on a 30-day hold. On Feb. 11, a week before the fire erupted, fire inspectors cited Northern Metal’s former facility in north Minneapolis for a variety of code violations related to its outdoor storage practices, the Star Tribune reported, citing inspection records. A state fire marshal investigator was at the scene Friday. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Police said Thursday that firefighters had the blaze under control, but the fire flared late Thursday, sending more smoke over Becker. Classes in Becker were canceled Thursday but resumed Friday. On Friday, police said firefighting efforts have been turned over to a private company hired by Northern Metal. The fire has been reduced to a few smoldering areas and could be extinguished by the end of the weekend, police said. Residents of the city of 4,500 people have not been asked to evacuate but should stay away from the immediate area of the fire, police said. Becker is about 50 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Northern Metal moved its shredding operation from Minneapolis to Becker last year after the Pollution Control Agency ordered it shut down because of high levels of air pollution and inaccurately recorded pollution.\n\nMississippi\n\nSatartia:Authorities said they’re testing the air quality after a pipe ruptured, prompting the evacuations of more than 300 residents and sending dozens of people to hospitals. The Mississippi Department of Emergency Management said 46 people were treated at area hospitals after the Saturday night rupture, but all of them had been released by late Sunday morning. Authorities said the 24-inch pressurized pipe ruptured in a heavily wooded area near Satartia, about 40 miles northwest of Jackson. They said the pipe contained carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide and that residents in the area complained of green gas and a noxious odor. Residents were expected to be able to return to their homes soon, emergency officials said in an update late Sunday morning. It appears the ground caved into a ravine, damaging the 24-inch pipe, the state agency said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Missouri might have shed its unwanted image as the meth lab capital of the U.S., but the dangerous and addictive drug remains a major problem, a top Drug Enforcement Administration official said Friday. The depth of the problem became clear Thursday when the DEA announced a methamphetamine crackdown called Operation Crystal Shield, which will focus on eight “transportation hubs” where high levels of Mexican meth are being seized. The St. Louis Division, which covers all of Missouri and Kansas as well as southern Illinois, is the northernmost of the eight targeted areas. The others are Atlanta, Dallas, El Paso, Texas, Houston, Los Angeles, New Orleans and Phoenix. The targeted DEA divisions accounted for more than 75% of all meth seizures last year. The St. Louis Division includes hundreds of miles of major roadways through the three states, including interstates 35, 70, 44 and 55, providing a pipeline not only to the central U.S. but the upper Midwest and the Northeast. William J. Callahan, special agent in charge of the St. Louis Division, said the targeted operation will allow better coordination of intelligence about trafficking routes, the types of vehicles being used, and other information. For many years, meth was a two-pronged problem: Much of it came from Mexico, but thousands of users across the U.S. made their own drug in home labs or by mixing the dangerous concoction in a 2-liter soda bottle. In 2004, more than 24,000 meth labs were seized across the U.S., including nearly 3,000 in Missouri, which for years was atop the list of states for lab seizures.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. Interior Department officials are seeking to bolster their case for easing restrictions on energy development, mining and grazing in Western states inhabited by a declining bird species. A federal judge in Idaho blocked Trump administration plans last year over concerns that they could harm greater sage grouse, a ground-dwelling bird. Assistant Interior Secretary Casey Hammond said a new set of environmental studies published Friday clarified the steps the government will take to conserve the bird’s habitat. The Interior Department opened a 45-day public comment period on the studies that cover millions of acres of public lands in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Oregon and California. Sage grouse have been in decline for decades because of habitat loss and other factors, and their numbers dropped sharply last year across much of their range. Sage grouse territory in Montana, Washington and the Dakotas was not impacted by the proposed changes. The legal dispute over the administration’s proposal is before Judge B. Lynn Winmill In Idaho. The case dates to 2016, when environmental groups sued the Obama administration over a previous set of rules that they described as insufficient to protect grouse from heading toward extinction.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The U.S. Department of Transportation said it’s awarding $10.7 million in airport safety and infrastructure grants to 18 airports in Nebraska. The grants include $750,000 to go to parking lot improvements and construction of an access road at Blair Municipal Airport. The department is sending Lincoln Airport $360,000 to buy snow removal equipment and $450,000 to update the airport master plan. Hartington Municipal Airport is getting $549,000 for runway rehabilitation, and Hebron Municipal Airport will receive $315,000 to fund the sealing of apron pavement surface and joints, plus the sealing of taxiway pavement.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Four Nevada firefighters recently returned from Australia, and three more will be deployed in the coming weeks to help with fire suppression efforts, according to the Bureau of Land Management. Firefighters Brian Holmes, Eric Tilden and Joe Miller returned to Nevada on Feb. 5. Another firefighter, Justin Cutler, also returned on Feb. 10, officials said in a news release. Holmes, who usually serves as an engine captain in the Southern Nevada District, worked as a task force leader and crew member in Australia. Tilden, a fire helicopter supervisor in the Elko District, also served as a task force leader and crew member. Miller, an air tank base manager at the Battle Mountain District, served also served as an air tanker base manager in Australia. He also provided other aviation assistance, officials said. Cutler, an assistant superintendent for the Silver State Hotshots based out of Carson City, served as an aerial tactical supervisor. The BLM also deployed two more firefighters to Australia, and three more will be sent in a few weeks. In total, 11 firefighters were deployed to assist in the fire suppression efforts. The two firefighters who were recently deployed and the three others expected to fly oversees are set to return in March. Since 2000, Australia has deployed fire management specialists six times to the United States. Meanwhile, the U.S. has sent firefighters and fire managers to help with the fire season in Australia four times since 2003. The two countries have exchanged techniques, policies, and information as far back as 1964.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: State wildlife officials warn that bears are more active this winter because of mild weather combined with limited snowfall. New Hampshire Fish and Game officers said bears are encouraged to remain active because of the amount of available food, WMUR-TV reported Friday. Bears typically hibernate from November to April, but in a mild winter, that period can be shortened to December or January until March. “Bears aren’t actually true hibernators,” said Daniel Bergeron, of New Hampshire Fish and Game. “So, they can wake and go back out and get food and go back in and den up for an extended period of time. So just because they’re up doesn’t mean they’re up for good.” Vermont wildlife officials voiced similar concerns about bear activity earlier this month. Wildlife officials in New Hampshire and Vermont have recommended moving any potential outdoor food sources to prevent attracting bears.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Wildlife authorities and utility officials have been taking aim at one of the leading killers of bald eagles in New Jersey – electrocution on power lines. There is growing concern about protecting the endangered birds from getting electrocuted by power lines when they nest in suburban and urban areas following a spike in the eagle population, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Between 2015 and 2019, electrocution was the top cause of death of raptors found injured or killed, according to data compiled in annual reports by the New Jersey Bald Eagle Project, a partnership overseen by the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife and Conserve Wildlife Foundation. In addition to the 34 eagle deaths, crashes into vehicles left 29 eagles dead and fights with other eagles killed 14. The cause of 29 other deaths remains unknown, and officials said some deaths are undocumented.Kathleen Clark, supervising zoologist for the state’s Division of Fish and Wildlife, said an electrocuted 4-year-old eagle was found on a recent Sunday near Pickle Factory Pond in Belleplain State Forest. Cristina Frank, a biologist and raptor specialist who manages avian protection for Atlantic City Electric, said utilities can’t realistically bury all distribution lines, so they install protective equipment or build-in protections on new lines. The measures can include cross-arms on existing lines to spread wires farther apart, insulated conductors, or covering energized or grounded equipment. Some utilities also install barriers to prevent birds from perching and mark lines with colored tape or reflectors to warn birds from flying into them.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The funeral service for Sgt. 1st. Class Antonio Rey Rodriguez of Las Cruces, who was killed in action on Feb. 8 while serving in Afghanistan, was held Friday afternoon at Cathedral of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. There wasn’t an empty seat in the church as hundreds of residents, military members and veterans joined Rodriguez’s family and close friends to honor the fallen hero. Students from Valley View Elementary, which is across the street from the church, also paid tribute to the soldier before and after the ceremony by waving American flags. During the service, Rodriguez was described by many as a hero, warrior, an inspiration and a child of God who gave the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and to save others. Rodriguez, 28, was born and raised in Las Cruces and was affectionately known as “Rod.” He graduated from Mayfield High School in 2009. According to the Department of Defense, a Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha from 7th Special Forces Group was ambushed in Afghanistan on Feb. 8 by a rogue Afghan policeman in the Sherzad district of Nangarhar Province, located in eastern Afghanistan. It resulted in the deaths of two American operators, including Rodriguez and Sgt. 1st Class Javier Jaguar Gutierrez of San Antonio. Six others were wounded. Rodriguez joined the Army in October 2009, according to a news release from U.S. Army Special Operations Command. After completing the Basic Airborne Course and the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program, he was assigned to the 3rd Ranger Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment. He deployed eight times with the 75th Ranger Regiment and twice with 3rd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) in support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, part of the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. During his military service, Rodriguez earned the Bronze Star Medal-2, Joint Service Commendation Medal-1, and Expert and Combat Infantryman Badge. Rodriguez posthumously earned the Purple Heart, Combat Action Badge, Bronze Star Medal (1 OLC) and Meritorious Service Medal.\n\nNew York\n\nWest Nyack: An Orthodox Jewish man credited as a hero for attacking a knife-wielding man who stabbed five people during a Hanukkah celebration north of New York City is refusing to take a $20,000 reward from established Jewish groups because he considers them Zionists, according to a rabbi who knows him. Officials with the Jewish Federation and the Anti-Defamation League told The Journal News that they were caught off guard by Josef Gluck’s decision to turn down the reward, the newspaper reported Friday. “The reward would have been for anybody who offered information that would lead to an arrest,” said Miriam Allenson, spokesperson for the Jewish Federation & Foundation of Rockland County. “That was what was on our minds.” Allenson said that there were no strings with the money and that the groups had “no idea” regarding Gluck’s decision to turn away the funds. The reward presentation event was scheduled for Feb. 6, but Gluck said he had a family emergency, Allenson said. Rabbi Dovid Feldman of Monsey said Gluck’s decision stems from the discomfort he and some other Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox Jews have with organizations like the Jewish Federation and Anti-Defamation League. Feldman said Gluck was preparing to notify the groups in writing to explain in more detail his reasons for declining the reward. Rabbi Feldman is a leader of Neturei Karta International. Its Orthodox Jewish members believe “the entire concept of a sovereign Jewish state is contrary to Jewish Law.” Gluck is credited with throwing his body in front of the machete-wielding man and using a wooden table to try and stop the Dec. 28 assault in Monsey, the newspaper reported. He then lured the attacker outside and documented the attacker’s license plate number and alerted police.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: The body of a 6-month-old boy who had been reported missing has been found in a North Carolina cemetery and his mother is under arrest, authorities said Saturday. Law enforcement officials said the body of Chi-Liam Cody Brown-Erickson was found about 4 a.m. Saturday at Sharon Memorial Park in Charlotte. The boy’s body was found about six hours after Tamara Jernel Brown, 30, was arrested by Charlotte police for common law robbery and two counts of assault on a government official. She reportedly refused to tell police where her son was. Brown and the boy had been reported missing Thursday night. Authorities had said before Brown’s arrest that she might be suffering from a mental health disability and was last seen walking in uptown Charlotte around noon Friday\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Bismarck Park Board has voted to keep the name of Custer Park, despite efforts to change it because of the eponym’s history with Native Americans. Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer fought against Native Americans on the Great Plains in the 1860s and 1870s. Two Bismarck women led the effort to change the name. Three Affiliated Tribes member M. Angel Moniz said that to some, Custer is a reminder of violence and genocide. The Bismarck Tribune said commissioners Thursday adopted a formal process to rename city parks and to install an educational marker at Custer Park. Under the new process, there can’t be another proposal to rename Custer Park for 15 years. In 1868, Custer launched an attack on Chief Black Kettle’s Southern Cheyenne Village near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma, in which Native American women were raped and killed in an assault known as the Washita Massacre. Custer spent several years stationed at Fort Abraham Lincoln in Mandan before his death..\n\nOhio\n\nMassillon: A family thinks an unmarked grave might hold the answer to the mystery of a relative’s disappearance 50 years ago. Russell Brunner was 31 when he disappeared from his home at the former Massillon State Hospital in 1970, where he had been committed as a teen because of a diagnosis of schizophrenia, his sister, Rita Tod, told The Repository. Although the hospital allegedly told his family that Brunner had been discharged, a body was found in 1972 in a barn on the grounds where Brunner worked, the paper said. Although the coroner at the time apparently suspected the body was Brunner’s, the coroner didn’t identify him as Brunner and the body was declared an “unknown male” before it was buried in the city cemetery in Massillon in northeastern Ohio, according to The Repository. Brunner was known to have worked in the same barn, the remains fit his description and state hospital-issued items were found on the body, the paper said. An investigation into existing records by The Repository along with its interviews with Brunner’s surviving siblings indicated the body is most likely Brunner and that he died by killing himself. The current county coroner agreed with the paper’s findings. Because there was no evidence of foul play, the family would need a court order to exhume the remains and would have to pay that cost and any testing, the coroner said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed one regent on Friday to the governing boards of each of the state’s top two public universities. Stitt named Anita Holloway of accounting firm Ernst & Young to the University of Oklahoma Board of Regents, which oversees OU, Cameron University in Lawton and Rogers State University in Claremore. He also named western Oklahoma rancher and banker Jimmy Harrel to the Oklahoma A&M Colleges Board of Regents, which oversees Oklahoma State University and four other regional universities. Both appointments will require Senate confirmation. Holloway replaces outgoing OU Regent Leslie Rainbolt-Forbes, whose term ends March 21. Harrel replaces Lou Watkins, whose term ends in April. Rainbolt-Forbes served as chair of the OU Board of Regents during an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against longtime OU President David Boren, who retired in 2018.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The main Oregon highway connecting Salem and Bend reopened Saturday after a tanker crash and gas spill forced a weeklong closure. The double tanker trunk spilled an estimated 7,800 gallons of petroleum products into the soil at the crash site east of Idanha, the Statesman Journal newspaper in Salem reported. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality said in a prepared statement that water quality tests done on the North Santiam River show the concentration of petroleum levels is below federal safe drinking water levels except for in the immediate vicinity of the crash. The agency said there is no impact to nearby cities’ drinking water, and workers will continue to test the water quality in the area periodically. Cleanup crews dug up and hauled away about 6,200 tons of contaminated soil. Workers also added a new guardrail near the site of the crash. The area has had two major tanker crashes and spills into the North Santiam River in the last three years.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nChambersburg:A military repair depot in central Pennsylvania has announced plans to lay off or reassign hundreds of contract employees because of an anticipated decrease in workload. Letterkenny Army Depot said the reduction will affect 323 contract personnel, nearly half of its contract positions. Up to 75 positions will be cut on or about March 10, and up to 248 additional workers will lose their jobs by September, although some workers could be reassigned. Officials said the reduction will affect about 15% of its total workforce of approximately 2,200 employees. Spokeswoman Lisa Baker said nearly one-third of all employees are contract personnel, while the others are federal employees. Letterkenny, which is north of Chambersburg, is one of Franklin County’s top employers, with workers repairing tactical missile systems, route clearance vehicles, electrical generators and other items. Letterkenny Munitions Center on the depot stores rockets and ammunition.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s motor vehicles division is temporarily opening its headquarters on some Saturdays so residents can upgrade their driver’s license to meet federal requirements that will affect air travel. The Cranston office will be open from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on select Saturdays of each month, as the October deadline for the federal REAL ID program approaches. Appointments must be made online first. Current Rhode Island licenses aren’t compliant with the federal program, which was enacted after the Sept. 11 attacks to strengthen rules for identification. The federal law requires state driver’s licenses and ID cards to have security enhancements and to be issued to people who can prove they are legally in the United States. Beginning in October, noncompliant IDs won’t be sufficient for boarding a plane or entering secure federal facilities or military bases. The weekend service is limited to REAL ID transactions for those obtaining or renewing passenger-vehicle driver licenses and state IDs. Appointments for commercial driver license services, including REAL ID, are available on weekdays.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The Coast Guard plans to consolidate its facilities across the South Carolina coast to an old naval shipyard near Charleston and plans to base national security vessels at the new site, Adm. Karl Schultz said. The moves are linked with dredging of Charleston Harbor, which when competed in 2021 will make it the deepest harbor on the East Coast. The Coast Guard is looking to add three national security cutters to the two already stationed in Charleston and also place a group of offshore patrol cutters that might soon be built, Shultz said. That could double the Coast Guard population in the area to about 2,000 people, Shultz said. “A community like Charleston understands just how important our defense contributions are to the nation. And for generations, the people of this great port city have also appreciated the importance of maritime commerce to our nation,” Shultz said. The Coast Guard has property in Charleston from the tip of the city’s peninsula through North Charleston. They will all be consolidated at the old Naval Shipyard in North Charleston on the Cooper River, Shultz said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:The city plans a makeover at its namesake park, and officials hope infusing some friendly competition between companies in the architecture and design world will lift the project to new heights. In the last two decades, the city has added dozens of acres to the boundaries of Falls Park through land acquisitions and parcel redevelopment. And it has become the destination for hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. That’s why officials with the Parks and Recreation Department said the walkways and layout of the pedestrian elements of the park campus are no longer adequate and need to be upgraded. With that in mind, City Hall last week announced it will use a design competition to gather ideas for expanding and improving the infrastructure at Falls Park in the coming years. A design competition is an alternative to a more typical process used by the city, where one architecture firm is hired to create a design before a construction company is hired. Instead, the city will put out a call for designs in hopes of spurring wide-ranging ideas for how to improve and enhance the park. Eventually, all ideas the city receives will be considered by a selection committee before the architects with the best four ideas will each be given a $10,000 stipend to continue working through their concepts and even incorporate other ideas the city in the first phase of the competition. The winning design elements could see implementation through construction as early as 2021.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:Federal authorities conducted searches Friday at the home and business addresses of Democratic state Sen. Katrina Robinson, the FBI said. FBI spokesman Joel Siskovic confirmed that agents executed search warrants at two locations in Memphis. They are listed as addresses for Robinson’s residence and her nursing school, Healthcare Institute Inc. The FBI declined to discuss any additional details of the searches and the U.S. attorney’s office in Memphis said it “will not comment on the nature or progress of any FBI activities before charges are publicly filed.” No one responded Friday to a knock on the door of the school, which sits in a strip mall in southeast Memphis. Robinson didn’t immediately return phone and email messages seeking comment. Her legislative office forwarded a request to a Senate Democratic Caucus spokesman. “We’ve been made aware of the investigation and have received no indication that it relates to the legislature or her legislative service,”said Brandon Puttbrese, spokesman for the Senate Democratic Caucus. “Because the investigation is ongoing, we will not be making additional statements and will defer any further questions to Sen. Robinson’s attorney.” Puttbrese also said the caucus’ thoughts are with Robinson and her family. Robinson was elected to the state Senate out of a Memphis district in 2018. Edward L. Stanton II of Butler Snow LLP emailed a statement saying only that he had been retained by Robinson “in connection with today’s events.” The school’s website said it received a $1.6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a certified nursing assistant program focused on geriatric populations and educational programs. The school was founded in January 2015. Its certified nursing assistant program was introduced that July. The school also includes phlebotomy and electrocardiographic technician instruction.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Saba: A man fatally stabbed three people, including a 13-year-old girl, Friday before leading officers on a car chase and eventually being arrested, police said. Sheriff’s deputies in San Saba, a community of about 3,000 people 100 miles northwest of Austin, received a call around 4:30 a.m. from an 18-year-old woman who said she was one of four people stabbed inside a home, said Sgt. Bryan Washko of the Texas Department of Public Safety. Officers arrived to find a 62-year-old man, a 44-year-old woman and the girl dead, Washko said. He could not provide the names of the victims or the 22-year-old suspect. He also said it’s unclear how they are connected and that no motive is known at this point. The Texas Rangers were investigating. The girl was a seventh-grade student at a local school, which was open and offering counseling, said San Saba Independent School District Superintendent Wayne Kelly. “It’s hit us pretty hard, “ Kelly said. ”When there are only 200 kids in the junior high they tend to know each other.” Kelly described the stabbings as a “domestic situation” but said he could not elaborate. He declined to name the student. Moments after the stabbings, Washko said, the suspect fled in a car belonging to one of the victims. Police gave chase and followed him for 20 miles into the city of Goldthwaite, where he crashed into the wall of a senior citizen center and was arrested, he said. No one, including the suspect, was injured in the crash. Anthony Wayne Pierce was being held Friday in the Mills County jail in connection to the stabbings, jail employee Disa Purcell said. She said the 22-year-old is charged with aggravated assault on a public servant and evading arrest, and that more charges could be filed. The woman who survived the stabbing was hospitalized in critical condition, Washko said.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: A proposed public park and nature reserve on the shores of Utah Lake would provide restoration habitat for ospreys, bald eagles and waterfowl, as well as walking trails, fishing spots and bird-watching towers. The 1,000-acre park would be nestled between Provo, Orem and Vineyard on land where Ute Chief Colorow Ignacio Ouray Walkara once brought his tribe to hunt and fish, the Daily Herald newspaper in Provo reported last week. A coalition of 25 government entities, civic groups and private landowners are working on a proposal they’re calling the Walkara Way Project. They plan to ask state lawmakers for $5.6 million for the project. The park has been discussed for a long time and would be a great place for families to enjoy nature, said Doug Robins, assistant director of the Provo Parks and Recreation Department. The plans call for 2.8 miles of trails, towers so people can watch bald eagles, and fishing areas and picnic areas. The trails would connect with other regional trail systems. The area where the park and preserve would be created is commonly known as the Powell Slough. Jake Holdaway, whose family has owned much of the land, said his family will get cattle grazing rights for perpetuity. He said that cows are the best way to keeping weeds from overgrowing. Taxpayer money is now used to mow the weeds or spray them with weed killer. Holdaway is planning on building an education center for children.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: Concerns from the Federal Aviation Administration that a five-story hotel planned for the Burlington International Airport could interfere with the airport’s radar system is forcing developers to relocate the proposed hotel. The FAA’s objection came as officials were preparing to begin construction of the hotel, planned for near the entrance to the South Burlington airport. Airport planners are now hoping to build the $14 million hotel just north of the airport’s parking garage on what is now a parking lot. MyNBC5.com reported the new site is larger, allowing for a slightly larger hotel with about 110 rooms, conference space and a limited service bar and restaurant. Airport officials said they hope for expedited approval from the FAA and local design review boards in order to begin construction this summer.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Dominion Energy said a reduction in fuel rates should save its Virginia customers an average of $6 a month later this year under a new proposal. The state’s largest electricity supplier announced Friday that a proposed fuel rate adjustment would result in roughly a 5% reduction in the average residential bill. Industrial customers would see an even greater rate drop of about 10% because the fuel rate makes up a bigger part of a typical industrial bill. The reduction would go into effect May 1 if approved by the State Corporation Commission. Dominion said that improved efficiency at its natural gas plants and increased solar generation are fueling the rate drop.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Spring chinook salmon could return on the Columbia River in the second-lowest numbers in 21 years, according to Washington state Department of Fish and Wildlife. This year’s forecasted return of 81,700 upriver spring chinook is up 12% from last year’s return of 73,100, which was the lowest since 1999, the News Tribune in Tacoma reported Sunday. The record low return was just 12,000 fish in 1995. The projected return this year is just 43% of the 10-year average for chinook returning to hatcheries and spawning areas upriver from the Bonneville Dam. Poor ocean conditions continue to play a significant role in lower projected returns, said Ryan Lothrop, Columbia River policy coordinator for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. New fishing regulations for the Columbia River – from about 6 miles below the The Dalles Dam upstream to the Oregon and Washington state line above McNary Dam – set the season at April 1 through May 5. Anglers can retain either two hatchery steelhead or a hatchery chinook and a hatchery steelhead per day. Hatchery fish have a clipped adipose fin, which is just above the tail fin. Barbless hooks will be required. The expected harvest is about 340 adult chinook above the Bonneville Dam and 2,500 below it. Fishing regulations have yet to be set for this year for spring chinook on the Snake River, but the catch is expected to be similarly constrained.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: President Donald Trump has increased the federal share of costs to help West Virginia recover from floods that ravaged the state in June 2016. Gov. Jim Justice’s office said Friday that Trump approved his request to increase the federal share from 75% to 90% for public assistance projects. A recent award of $131.7 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds to rebuild two Nicholas County schools helped the state meet the threshold for a cost-share increase, the governor’s office said. Covered costs include emergency expenses, debris removal and infrastructure repair. The increase falls under a major disaster declaration by former President Barack Obama in 2016 after the floods killed 23 people and damaged hundreds of buildings in the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOnalaska:Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, will stop in Wisconsin for a campaign event in March. The Pences will be in Onalaska, near La Crosse, at noon March 5 for a “Women for Trump” event at the Stoney Creek Hotel and Conference Center, 3060 S. Kinney Coulee Road. They will also appear later that day at an event in St. Paul, Minnesota. Mike Pence held a rally last month at the Wisconsin State Capitol to promote private voucher and charter schools.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: Yellowstone National Park plans to replace dozens of decades-old trailers used by park workers, part of an initiative to upgrade employee housing. About half of the Yellowstone’s 800 employees live in park housing, according to park spokeswoman Morgan Warthin. She described the quality of the accommodations as “fair to poor.” Over the next two years, park administrators plan to replace 64 trailers built between 1960 and 1983 with cabin-style modular houses. The number of new houses has not been determined. They would be placed in already-developed areas. The park also plans to add new housing, rehabilitate historic homes in Fort Yellowstone and other areas, and upgrade 150 nontrailer housing units, including with new flooring and better insulation and heating systems. Warthin told Montana Public Radio that there’s not enough housing, and the housing crunch hurts workforce recruitment as park visitation has jumped 45% since the year 2000. Costs for the work will run into the tens of millions of dollars, with funding coming from 2020 federal appropriations legislation, Yellowstone administrators said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/28/lebron-mural-vandalized-seaweed-eating-cows-flash-floods-news-around-states/117686040/", "title": "LeBron mural vandalized, seaweed-eating cows, flash floods: News ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: Charlotte Morris , the interim president of Tuskegee University, will assume the job on a permanent basis, the school said. Trustees of the historically Black school in east Alabama elected Morris to the position, which takes effect Sunday, officials said in a statement. Morris’ time as interim president began with the departure of Lily McNair, who began in 2018 and and left earlier this year. With more than 30 years at the school, Morris’ previous roles at Tuskegee included chief of staff and secretary to the board. Her inauguration as the school’s ninth president is planned for April to coincide with Founder’s Day. “She understands the needs of this university today – putting the students first – and is the right leader for tomorrow and beyond,” board chair Norma Clayton said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A small airplane reported overdue Monday was found crashed, with the two people on board dead, according to Alaska State Troopers. Austin McDaniel, a troopers spokesperson, said there were two adults on board. He said the plane left from Anchorage, but he did not have immediate details on the purpose of the flight or when it took off. He said by email that the wreckage was found in Chugach State Park. The troopers, in an online log, said authorities were notified about 8 p.m. Monday of an overdue aircraft that had taken off from an Anchorage airport. The statement said the aircraft was believed to have gone up the Knik River Valley toward Knik Glacier and Lake George before heading toward Chugach State Park. A good Samaritan found the wreckage about 10:45 p.m. Monday and was able to land nearby. Recovery efforts were expected to start Tuesday, the troopers’ statement said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A dust cloud that triggered a dust advisory in Maricopa, Casa Grande and Florence on Tuesday night moved north along Interstate 10 to hit the southern edge of Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix issued a dust advisory affecting parts of Maricopa County, including the Ahwatukee neighborhood of Phoenix, Chandler, Gilbert and Queen Creek until 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. Visibility was below 1 mile in some areas, including parts of I-10, Interstate 8, highway 347, and Highway 85 south of Gila Bend, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation. Just before 7:30 p.m., the weather service said the dust cloud was blowing into the Phoenix area and would cause visibility to drop to 1 to 3 miles, “enough to notice but not low enough to cause significant concerns.” At 7:45 p.m., the weather service said isolated storms across central Arizona would wind down in the next hour or two although dust clouds, heavy rain and gusty winds were possible.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The leader of the University of Arkansas system proposed keeping a statue of the late U.S. Sen. J. William Fulbright on its flagship campus but add “contextualization” about his legacy, despite calls to remove the monument because of Fulbright’s support of segregation. System President Donald Bobbitt cited a new state law preventing the removal of historical monuments without state approval in his proposal, which was scheduled to go before the university’s board of trustees on Wednesday. Bobbitt’s proposal also called for keeping Fulbright’s name on the Fayetteville campus’ college of arts and sciences. The proposal called for adding “a contextualization to the statue that affirms the university’s commitment to racial equality and acknowledges Senator Fulbright’s complex legacy, including his record on international affairs, civil rights legislation, and racial integration.” Fulbright was a University of Arkansas graduate and served as the university’s president for three years starting in 1939. He is known worldwide for creating an international education scholarship in his name. But the university has faced calls to remove his statue and his name from the school over his opposition to integration and civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The San Francisco school board violated state law when it voted to cover up a 1930s mural that critics said is racist and degrading in its depiction of Black and Native American people, a judge ruled Tuesday. Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo said the board failed to conduct an environmental impact review before it voted in 2019 to cover up the sprawling mural at George Washington High School that depicts the life of George Washington, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The 1936 mural was painted by Victor Arnautoff, one of the foremost muralists in the San Francisco area during the Depression. In addition to depicting Washington as a soldier, surveyor and statesman, the 13-panel, 1,600-square-foot mural contains images of white pioneers standing over the body of a Native American and slaves working at Washington’s Mount Vernon estate in Virginia. New Deal scholars have argued that Arnautoff, a Russian-born communist and social critic, critically depicts unsavory aspects of American history in his work. But as early as the 1960s, some students at George Washington High School have argued that the mural’s imagery is offensive and racist. District officials told the Chronicle that they were reviewing the decision. Members can’t take any further action until at least September.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A U.S. appeals court has ruled against a web designer who didn’t want to create wedding websites for same-sex couples and sued to challenge Colorado’s anti-discrimination law. A three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver denied Lorie Smith’s attempt to overturn a lower court ruling throwing out her legal challenge. The Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents Smith, argued that the law forced her to violate her Christian beliefs. In the 2-1 ruling, the panel said Colorado had a compelling interest in protecting the “dignity interests” of members of marginalized groups through its law. The anti-discrimination law is the same one at issue in the case of Colorado baker Jack Phillips that was decided in 2018 by the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court decided the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had acted with anti-religious bias against Phillips after he refused to bake a cake for two men who were getting married. But it did not rule on the larger issue of whether a business can invoke religious objections to refuse service to LGBTQ people. The Alliance Defending Freedom said it would appeal the ruling. “The government should never force creative professionals to promote a message or cause with which they disagree. That is quintessential free speech and artistic freedom,” the group’s senior counsel, John Bursch, said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is embarking on a plan to dedicate Medicaid funds to help address the problem of gun violence and other violent crimes. Under new legislation, financially challenged community-based violence prevention services will be able to receive state and federal Medicaid funds. These programs, which are growing across the U.S., typically involve intervention at the hospital after someone has been shot and intensive case management in the months following the injury to try and break the cycle of violence .Connecticut’s new law requires the state Department of Social Services commissioner by July 1, 2022, to amend the state’s Medicaid plan so it will cover the cost of community violence prevention services for beneficiaries who have received medical treatment for an injury “sustained from an act of community violence,” such as a shooting, and have been referred for services by a licensed health care or social services provider.\n\nDelaware\n\nMillsboro:The Mountaire Farms chicken processing plant has been issued a notice of violation from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control after a contractor digging a ditch for a new pipeline damaged an existing one, causing treated wastewater to spill into Swan Creek. Ironically, the digging was taking place as part of construction of the poultry plant’s new wastewater treatment system, according to the notice. When the pipe broke, the treated effluent filled up the excavated area and ultimately made its way into the new, unfinished pipeline that discharges into Swan Creek. The incident occurred April 24 and Mountaire reported it to DNREC that day, the notice said. An estimated 15,000 gallons of effluent flowed into Swan Creek for about 10 minutes before the source was shut off. DNREC issued the notice of violation to Mountaire on June 15, charging them with unauthorized discharge to surface water. The only action required of Mountaire is that it provide DNREC with documentation of repairs. No fines were levied.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Residents of the 600 block of Irving Street Northwest said D.C.’s urban foresters missed obvious signs that an aging oak tree on the street was ready to topple, WUSA-TV reported. “It was a ticking time bomb,” said Tommy Duren, whose home was badly damaged when the tree came down during storms Monday night. “I don’t know how an arborist gets this wrong.” Two other homes were damaged in the incident. Duren said pruning crews and inspectors should have known the tree was a threat. A spokesman for D.C.’s Department of Transportation, which oversees the Urban Forestry Division, said the last time the tree had been pruned by a city crew was in January. The spokesman described the situation as “force majeure”, a legal term meaning an unforeseeable circumstance. The Urban Forestry Division is responsible for more than 175,000 public trees in the district, according to the agency’s website, which reported the city removed nearly 2,700 trees in the last year.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:Gov. Ron DeSantis held a private meeting Monday with doctors to oppose mask mandates in public schools. DeSantis said he fears that the federal government might try to force mask mandates in schools, saying children would suffer. On Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended indoor masks for all teachers, staff, students and visitors to schools, regardless of vaccination status. “Our view is that this should absolutely not be imposed. It should not be mandated. And I know our Legislature feels strongly about it,” said DeSantis. He predicted lawmakers would hold a special session “to be able to provide protections for parents and kids who just want to breathe freely and don’t want to be suffering under these masks during the school year.” DeSantis didn’t invite media to the discussion, but his office provided a video and transcript of the meeting in the state Capitol. Florida accounted for a fifth of the nation’s new coronavirus infections last week, more than any other state, according to the CDC. But DeSantis has been firmly opposed to lockdown restrictions, mask mandates and vaccine passports, signing a bill into law that prevents businesses to ask for proof of vaccination and local governments from imposing COVID restrictions.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Delta Air Lines is loosening restrictions on basic economy tickets to reduce the deluge of frustrated travelers facing hourslong waits on customer service phone lines. Basic economy tickets usually do not allow any changes to the itinerary, even for a change fee. The airline temporarily allowed more flexibility during the pandemic, but that policy ended earlier this year. Starting Wednesday, however, Delta will temporarily allow changes to basic economy tickets for travel through Dec. 31, 2021, “to help address call wait times as we increase staffing,” CEO Ed Bastian wrote in an update to customers. The changes can be made online without paying a change fee. Delta cut about 18,000 of its 90,000 employees last year through buyouts and early retirements to cut costs amid the pandemic, leaving it short-staffed when travelers rapidly returned to the skies. “The unexpected pace of the return of our customers has resulted in some unforeseen challenges as we ramp up to meet demand and handle a record-breaking level of calls,” Bastian told customers Tuesday. He acknowledged that “the last thing you want is to experience long hold times when you call reservations or receive a notification that your flight schedule has changed.” To alleviate the problem, the Atlanta-based airline also is hiring more than 5,000 people, including 1,300 reservations specialists who will be trained by September and 3,000 in airport customer service and other areas. Delta has hired more than 2,200 people in Georgia this year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii’s Department of Health has updated its guidance to schools a week before the start of another school year during the pandemic. The department’s guidance includes recommendations for wearing masks in all indoor settings and maintaining at least 3 feet of physical distance between students in classrooms, when possible. Masks are recommended outdoors when there’s crowding or prolonged close contact, said acting State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Kemble. The department said schools should consider screening testing for all teachers and staff who have not been fully vaccinated regardless of the level of community transmission. The guidance also includes screening testing for those who are not fully vaccinated to facilitate participation in sports and other activities with a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission. Promoting vaccines against COVID-19 for all eligible children and adults is the top strategy for safe in-person learning, Kemble said. Hawaii’s public school students return to classes Aug. 3.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: About 89% of Idaho residents live in communities where officials said masks should be worn again. The Post Register reported Wednesday that 27 of Idaho’s 44 counties have substantial to high transmission of COVID-19. Central District Health also said it supports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s updated recommendation for masks. Central District Health oversees Ada, Boise, Elmore and Valley counties. The city of Boise on Wednesday started requiring masks indoors at its city-owned facilities. In a statement, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare officials said they were concerned about rising COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Idaho has the sixth-lowest vaccination rate, with only about 46% of all eligible residents being fully vaccinated, compared to 56% of all eligible Americans.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A Michigan-based cannabis company on Tuesday ended its challenge of Illinois’ plan to authorize new marijuana business. Sozo Illinois Inc.’s decision to drop its lawsuit will allow Illinois to proceed with awarding licenses to operate marijuana dispensaries. The state on Thursday is to hold the first of three lotteries to award 55 licenses to applicants that scored 85% or better on their applications for recreational cannabis stores. The licenses have been delayed for more than a year, initially because of COVID-19-related issues. Problems with scoring the applications added to the delay. Sozo Illinois Inc. claimed Illinois law unfairly lowered its chances of getting a license. The lawsuit noted part of the law gives bonus points in scoring applications from Illinois-based companies, and another removed a bonus for hiring 10 people from areas hurt by the war on drugs. The lawsuit sought a court order to stop the lotteries. The Chicago Tribune reported Gov. J.B. Pritzker spokeswoman Charity Greene responded to Sozo Illinois’ actions with a statement saying it has a priority of his administration to establish a legal cannabis industry in Illinois that is equitable and reflects the diversity of the state.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend:Elementary students in South Bend will be required to wear masks when the school year begins next month under the district’s new coronavirus response plan. The plan approved Monday night by the South Bend Community School Corp. board outlines the coronavirus measures that will be in place when the school year begins for students Aug. 11. Students in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade will be required to wear masks indoors, but face coverings will not be required but strongly encouraged among unvaccinated staff and middle and high school students, the South Bend Tribune reported. Staff and middle- and high-school students who are vaccinated can go mask-free, but all visitors to any district school building will be required to wear a mask regardless of vaccination status. Administrators said their decision comes in consultation with health officials and follows similar moves in large school districts, such as Indianapolis Public Schools and Wayne Township, in Indianapolis’ west suburbs. Unlike Indianapolis, which will collect voluntary proof of vaccination for those opting not to wear masks, South Bend’s policy will largely be based on an honor system.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds rejected new federal government recommendations about wearing masks to help slow the rapid spread of a coronavirus variant in the U.S.. Reynolds signed a law in May that prohibits local officials from requiring masks to be worn in schools or businesses. Iowa ranks 21st in the nation when it comes to vaccinations, with 49.4% of the population, or 1.56 million people, fully vaccinated. Like many states, vaccination interest has stagnated in recent weeks. Iowa’s seven-day moving average of daily cases was 241 on Monday, the highest level since May 14.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A central Kansas school district is requiring masks in its buildings, and public health officials in one of the state’s most populous counties are recommending that nearly every resident wear masks in indoor public spaces. Top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature ended Kansas’ state of emergency for the coronavirus pandemic in mid-June, citing a decline in new cases. The Salina district’s board of education voted 5-2 during a special Tuesday night meeting to impose its mask requirement, the Salina Journal reported. The district, which has about 6,900 students, appears to be the first outside the Kansas City area to impose a new mask mandate. It joined the Kansas City, Kansas, district and the neighboring Shawnee Mission district in Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, to require at least some students to wear masks. Meanwhile, the Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health department on Tuesday began recommending that anyone age 2 or older wear masks in schools and other indoor spaces, even though the county has among the highest vaccination rates and the lowest total number of COVID-19 cases per capita among the state’s 105 counties.\n\nKentucky\n\nGeorgetown: A public workshop is planned to discuss options for an aging dam on the north fork of Elkhorn Creek, the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources said. The agency said it will lead a discussion on Aug. 3 about the Great Crossing Dam near Georgetown. A study commissioned by Scott County officials found the low-head dam needs repair but isn’t in danger of immediate failure. Fish and Wildlife said it is considering options that include removing the structure from the waterway, which would improve safety for boaters and swimmers and also improve water quality. The meeting will be held at Great Crossing High School in Georgetown. Those attending will have an opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback to department officials.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: As COID-19 vaccine interest plummeted in Louisiana, the state saw a spike in the number of wasted shots, with more than 79,000 doses trashed largely because health providers couldn’t find enough arms quickly enough. Wasted doses of the vaccines numbered fewer than 1,500 only four months ago. But data provided to the Associated Press by the Louisiana Department of Health showed the unused, discarded shots surged to more than 50 times that number by July 23. Meanwhile, another 161,000 doses of the three COVID-19 vaccines available across the state are scheduled to expire within 14 days – a waste the Health Department hopes to avoid either through a possible federal decision to extend the expiration dates or through increased vaccine interest. Waste is not uncommon in mass immunization efforts, and the doses trashed in Louisiana so far represent less than 1% of the nearly 3.5 million vaccines that reached arms. Louisiana already is only drawing down a sliver of the vaccine doses made available by the federal government each week, despite an all-out push to get people interested in the shots that includes offering $2.3 million in cash prizes and scholarships.\n\nMaine\n\nEast Boothbay: A Maine marine science lab has received $5 million to further research into whether seaweed-based food can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cows. Bigelow Laboratory has been working in recent years on whether the feed supplements can help cut emissions of methane at cattle operations. Methane emissions, which happen when cows belch, allegedly contribute to climate change. The laboratory said the grant is from the Shelby Cullom Davis Charitable Fund and it will build on a project that began in 2019. Nichole Price, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory and the project leader, said the funding will help scientists apply their work in a way that is feasible on a global scale. The lab said it has had success in feed trials with individual herds. One of the biggest questions is how the supplement can be produced in large enough quantities and at a reasonable enough cost to make a dent in worldwide farming operations. Price said new parts of the project will “complement our existing search for the right seaweed solution and enable us to look into some creative ways that we can use what we’re learning to actually solve this global problem.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:The Maryland Office of the State Fire Marshal is investigating three incidents of houses being set on fire on Nokomis Avenue in Salisbury. The first broke out on July 21. A social media post from the Salisbury Fire Department showed crews responded to the blaze just before 6 a.m. and were able to extinguish the fire and clear the scene before 7:30 a.m. Two other fires were reported simultaneously on July 23, just before 10 p.m., according to a news release from the fire marshal’s office. The homes are owned by Milford Twilley Rentals, the fire marshal’s office said, and were left with moderate fire, heat and smoke damage. There were no injuries, but the fire marshal’s office estimated the blazes totaled about $110,000 in damages. Smoke alarms were present for two of the fires but did not activate because the fires were set outside at the back of the homes. The fire marshal’s office said neighbors noticed all three blazes and reported them to the fire department. No arrests have been made. Deputy state fire marshals are asking anyone with information to call (410) 713-3780. Callers can remain anonymous.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An Army officer from Massachusetts who was reported missing in action during the Korean War has been accounted for and is coming home for burial, military officials said. The remains of 1st Lt. Thomas J. Redgate, are scheduled to buried at the veterans’ cemetery in Bourne on Sept. 17, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a statement. Redgate, a member of Battery A, 48th Field Artillery Battalion, 7th Infantry Division, was reported missing Dec. 11, 1950, when his unit was attacked during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, according to the Army. The exact details surrounding his loss were not known, and his remains could not be recovered at the time. He was 24. In July 2018, following a summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea turned over 55 boxes that purportedly contained the remains of American service members killed during the war. The remains were examined at the DPAA’s laboratory in Hawaii, and based on anthropological analysis, as well as DNA and circumstantial evidence, one set was determined to be Redgate’s. Redgate, whose hometown was listed as Boston’s Brighton neighborhood, was accounted for in April 2020, but the announcement was made Wednesday because his family only recently received a full briefing of his identification, the Army said. Redgate’s name is recorded on the Courts of the Missing at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for.\n\nMichigan\n\nMarysville:City leaders have enacted a new law banning chickens, pheasants, badgers, kangaroos, coyotes and even cougars and tigers, the Times Herald of Port Huron reported. The new domestic animals and fowl ordinance that goes into effect in mid-August was crafted after some residents complained about neighbors who owned chickens and crowing roosters, according to Marysville City Manager Randy Fernandez. Marysville’s current ordinance bans “animals or domestic fowl within the city except dogs, cats, birds, fowl, or animals commonly classified as pets,” the newspaper reported. “So, what this basically does is tighten the limit on … no more chickens and some other animals that we would consider livestock, that do not belong in the limits of Marysville or any other city,” Fernandez told city council members Monday. Marysville has about 9,600 residents and is located along the St. Clair River, which separates that part of Michigan from Canada. The new ordinance allows Fernandez to deal with addressing future animal complaints “case-by-case if that’s the way that administration wants to,” City Attorney Al Francis said. However, the inclusion of animals such as chinchillas, doves and ferrets on the banned list might have been a little too much, according to Councilman Dave Barber, who said he knows people who keep such animals. “I get the rest of it, and I feel for the folks who have chickens,” Barber said. “But I question those three.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Department of Health officials said they are investigating a COVID-19 outbreak at a camp for teenagers in the northwestern part of the state. Communications specialist Erin McHenry said state health officials are investigating “a cluster of cases” at the Castaway Club Young Life Camp on Pelican Lake, about 45 miles east of Fargo, North Dakota. The facility typically hosts teenagers from about 10 states, camp manager Greg Johnson said. Johnson said he’s aware of 10 virus cases involving staff members over the past two weeks, with no new infections in the last week. The number of infected guests wasn’t immediately known because cases might have been reported in other states, KVRR-TV reported. Johnson said when the outbreak began, special protocols were put into place that included an indoor mask mandate and in some circumstances an outdoor mask requirement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves does not plan to issue a mask mandate for schools, even as COVID-19 cases are proliferating in a state with one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. “Governor Reeves has no intention of requiring students and staff to wear masks when they’re in school this fall,” his spokeswoman, Bailey Martin, said Tuesday. A few Mississippi school districts have started classes, and others are starting by mid-August. Some parents have raised concerns about the virus spreading among children too young to be vaccinated, and many school districts have said they will not require students or employees to wear masks because the governor has not set a mask mandate.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Garth Brooks fans will have a chance to be vaccinated against the coronavirus when the country music star performs at Arrowhead Stadium on Aug. 7. Chiefs president Mark Donovan said the team plans to take every opportunity to offer vaccinations at Arrowhead, The Kansas City Star reported. Donovan said the organization isn’t sure if it will be able to use Arrowhead Stadium as a vaccination site on Chiefs game days this fall but “we’re trying to work through that as well.” A vaccination clinic was held at Arrowhead Stadium in the spring.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Health officials have issued a safety advisory for a lake just outside Yellowstone National Park after harmful algal blooms toxic to humans and animals were detected. The bloom of algae was in Hebgen Lake, a reservoir in southwestern Montana near the borders of Idaho and Wyoming, officials said. NorthWestern Energy monitors six locations across the reservoir weekly, said company spokesperson Jo Dee Black. Warmer water temperatures and a lower-than-usual water level is causing more algae growth earlier in the season than in a typical year, Black told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. Blue-green algae is native to Montana’s freshwater lakes and reservoirs and not all varieties are harmful. But some algal blooms produce toxins that pose a risk to people, pets and livestock when ingested or through prolonged contact, according to NorthWestern Energy and the Gallatin City-County Health Department. Don’t drink, swallow or swim in water that has harmful blooms, officials said. The blooms can look like pea soup, grass clippings or green latex paint and are typically suspended in the water and can appear as floating mats.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Police have arrested a man accused of attacking and shooting another man in the neck with a BB gun for wearing a mask. The incident happened Tuesday in the vestibule of a midtown grocery store as one man was leaving and another was entering, the Omaha World-Herald reported. One man was not wearing a mask, police said, and ran up to and spit on the other man, who was wearing a mask. A fight ensued, and police said the unmasked man pulled out a BB-gun replica of a pistol and shot the other man. The injured man told officers that when he demanded to know why he was attacked, the unmasked man responded, “You’re on the other team.” The victim suffered injuries to his face, neck and shoulder and had to pull a pellet out of his shoulder, he said. Officers arrested the accused shooter on suspicion of felony terroristic threats and misdemeanor assault.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Nevada print news organization and the American Civil Liberties Union are suing to ensure access to what could be the state’s first execution in 15 years. A federal lawsuit invoking First Amendment rights seeks a court order banning state prisons chief Charles Daniels from preventing witnesses, including reporters, from observing the lethal injection of convicted killer Zane Michael Floyd. State and federal judges have put off Floyd’s execution until at least late October to allow time for appeals to be heard. Aides to Gov. Steve Sisolak and state Attorney General Aaron Ford declined to comment on the lawsuit filed by ACLU attorneys Friday in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas. Ford’s office represents state officials in several court challenges of the execution plan. The lawsuit said witnesses should have “uninterrupted viewing” of the condemned man from the time he enters the execution chamber until he is declared dead, with an unfettered ability to hear and see the process. It points to an execution manual released in June, allowing the prisons chief to choose the number and names of media representatives. Floyd, who was a Marine, received the death penalty in 2000 for killing four people and wounding a fifth with a shotgun at a Las Vegas supermarket in 1999. He also was convicted of repeatedly raping a woman the night before the rampage. The last person executed in Nevada was Daryl Mack, who asked to die in 2006 following his conviction in a 1988 rape and murder in Reno.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu said New Hampshire will not be issuing new mask guidance following the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that even fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas where COVID-19 transmission is substantial or high. Four of New Hampshire’s 10 counties and the city of Nashua are experiencing moderate transmission, and the rest of the state is seeing minimal transmission, according to figures released by the Department of Health and Human Services. “At this point, it isn’t about the government providing that bubble of safety around individuals,” Sununu told WMUR-TV. Instead, he said it’s about the individual taking on personal responsibility. “It is your choice,” Sununu said. “We have all the power to protect ourselves and the community, and that’s getting the vaccine. It’s safe. It’s easy.” More than 53% of the state has been fully vaccinated. Sununu said he’s frustrated that more residents are not vaccinated, given the extensive effort made by the state to get vaccines out to the public, but he said he understands it is a personal choice.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Vaccinated and unvaccinated residents in New Jersey should wear masks indoors when there is an increased risk of spreading the coronavirus, Gov. Phil Murphy said. Murphy said the state’s coronavirus metrics are going in the wrong direction, and new data suggested the delta variant is more transmissible, “which is why we are making this strong recommendation.” Instances where masks are recommended include: crowded indoor settings, those involving close contact with others who aren’t fully vaccinated and those where someone’s vaccine status is unknown. Murphy made the recommendation in a joint statement with Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli. Murphy’s recommendation didn’t address schools. Murphy spokesperson Alyana Alfaro Post said Wednesday there was no update yet on masks in schools. New Jersey has among the highest percentages of people vaccinated in the country.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: A bountiful wildflower bloom at Bandelier National Monument is drawing some early risers who want to avoid the midday crowds, and the visitors center is responding to accommodate them. Starting Sunday, the visitor center will open a half-hour earlier at 8:30 a.m. Acting Superintendent Dennis Milligan said that will give staff more time to hand out information on trails and safety. The Southwest has been inundated with rain during the monsoon season, bolstering wildflowers. Mariposa lilies, harebells and shooting stars are abundant along trails like the Cerro Grande and Alamo Boundary at Bandelier. Monument officials said the massive wildflower bloom should last for several more weeks. They said visitors should feel free to photograph the flowers but don’t pick them so others can enjoy the view. Visitation to the monument that features canyons and ancient cliff dwellings dropped drastically during the pandemic. Officials said they’re now seeing a 157% increase in visitation since 2019.\n\nNew York\n\nSouthampton: A village in the Hamptons will pay its outgoing police chief more than $774,000 for unused sick and vacation time after village officials voted to end his contract. Southampton Village Police Chief Thomas Cummings’ contract contained provisions that allowed for the large payout, Newsday reported Wednesday. The village board voted on July 20 to end his contract on Sept. 10 and approved the payout. The agreement calculated 686 unused days at $1,095 per day, plus almost $23,000 in retroactive per diem pay. The newspaper obtained the information through public records requests. Cummings, 57, has been police chief in the village of the wealthy enclave since 2011, after joining the department in 1987. He had clashed with Mayor Jesse Warren, who won reelection in June, the newspaper reported. Warren criticized the contract that allowed the large payout in a statement Tuesday. Cummings did not respond to a request for comment from the newspaper. He and his wife will also get medical and dental benefits without premiums for the rest of their lives, unless his wife were to remarry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina’s health department will require workers, volunteers and others at 14 state-run health care facilities to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 by Sept. 30 unless they qualify for a medical or religious exemption, according to a memo. The Associated Press obtained a departmental FAQ about the vaccine mandate that said those who don’t get fully vaccinated or exempted by the deadline could face “disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, for unacceptable personal conduct.” Republican House Speaker Tim Moore first shed light on the development through a news release Tuesday night. Although he is vaccinated and encourages others to get the shots, he said he believes residents should have the ability to make their own decisions without fear of reprisal. The speaker also noted that none of the available COVID-19 vaccines the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for emergency use have thus far received full FDA approval. North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services did not comment on Moore’s criticism, but confirmed it will require many within the Division of State Operated Health Facilities to get vaccinated. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s office has not responded to questions about whether the governor supports a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for state workers.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWatford City: The operator of an oil well pad where a fire has been burning since last week in McKenzie County has brought in a specialized emergency response crew to get a handle on the blaze. The well pad is located on federal land just south of Lake Sakakawea northeast of Watford City. Its operator, Petro-Hunt, is working with Texas-based Wild Well Control. “They can come in and know how to analyze or diagnose the problem and get to it,” said Dave Glatt, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. McKenzie County Emergency Manager Karolin Jappe said authorities have closed roads in the area and are asking people to avoid driving or boating near the fire, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The cause of the fire, which broke out Jan. 22, is unknown. Clouds of black smoke are rising from the blaze, causing state environmental officials to encourage nearby residents to monitor their local air quality at www.airnow.gov. Air quality is already poor in parts of North Dakota because of wildfire smoke from the western U.S. and Canada. Petro-Hunt initially reported to the state that an estimated 100 barrels of oil and 100 barrels of saltwater spilled at the site. The true volume of the spills is not yet known, Glatt said. The fire is contained to the well pad, and it has not resulted in any injuries, according to Petro-Hunt.\n\nOhio\n\nAkron:A vandal defaced a large LeBron James-inspired “Space Jam” mural in Akron. A red clown nose was spray painted on James’ face, along with the words “LA FLOP” sometime early Monday morning on the artwork created by Copley artist Chardae Slater on the front of a West Market Street business. The mural is located not far from James’ alma mater, St. Vincent-St. Vincent High School, and the I Promise School he helped found for at-risk Akron children. Akron Police have been alerted to the vandalism and Slater said she’s hopeful businesses near the mural will be willing to share any security camera footage they might have that captured the culprit or culprits. James’ representatives did not return a request for comment Monday about the recent vandalism. Slater said it might take up to two weeks to fix the mural. “It’s fixable,” she said. “It’s just oh my God. I’m trying to keep positive.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: City employees who are unvaccinated for the coronavirus will not receive hazard leave if they contract the illness, Mayor G.T Bynum said. Hazard leave is paid leave that is not counted against sick days or vacation days, city spokesperson Michelle Brooks said. Affected unvaccinated employees could use sick days or vacation if they become ill with the virus. Ascension St. John Hospital in Tulsa announced its employees would be required to become vaccinated by Nov. 12, with exemptions possible for medical or religious regions. “Tens of thousands of Ascension associates have already been vaccinated with the available vaccines, as have millions of people across the country and the world,” Ascension said in a statement. “But we must do more to overcome this pandemic as we provide safe environments for those we serve.” Ascension joins OU Health, Mercy and SSM Health as hospitals in the state requiring employee vaccinations.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:A former Oregon lawmaker who was expelled for letting violent protesters into the state Capitol pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of official misconduct. The Statesman Journal reported that Mike Nearman was sentenced to 18 months probation, during which he will need to complete 80 hours of community service and is banned from the Capitol building and grounds. He will also pay $200 in court fees and $2,700 to the Oregon Legislative Administration for damages done during the Dec. 21 riot. As part of the agreement in Marion County Circuit Court, a count of criminal trespass was dismissed. Last month, Nearman, a Republican from Polk County, became the first member of the Oregon House to be expelled in its 160-year history. The House voted 59-1 to remove him from the Legislature for disorderly behavior. Nearman was seen on security video opening a door to protesters on Dec. 21 as lawmakers met in emergency session to deal with economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Protesters barged into the building, which was closed to the public because of pandemic safety protocols, got into shoving matches with police and sprayed officers with bear spray. Some of the protesters had guns.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf said he is not considering a statewide mask mandate as coronavirus cases surge in Pennsylvania and across the country, and his administration said it is not requiring masks in schools. Wolf, speaking on KDKA-AM in Pittsburgh, said his strategy to fight the spread of COVID-19 has been the vaccine, and will continue to be. The masking mandate was for when there was no vaccine, Wolf said. “People have the ability, each individual to make the decision to get a vaccine,” Wolf said. “If they do, that’s the protection.” Wolf’s administration also said it is not considering mandating masks in K-12 schools. However, it said it is recommending that Pennsylvanians and Pennsylvania schools follow federal guidance on mask-wearing.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s two largest health care systems are requiring all employees to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. The announcements Tuesday by Lifespan and Care New England – which are moving toward a merger – came as the delta variant of the coronavirus continues to spread and the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention issued new face-covering guidelines. “It is our responsibility to keep our patients, and our staff, safe. This program will be based on the best evidence that we have to date about preventing transmission of COVID-19,” Dr. James Fanale, Care New England’s chief executive, said in a statement. Care New England said it would “move toward” requiring vaccinations by first requiring that all managers receive a first dose before Labor Day. More details will be released within the next seven to 10 days. Lifespan announced that its vaccine mandate will go into effect Sept. 1, and it is the system’s goal to have all employees show proof of immunization within 60 days. Lifespan operates Rhode Island, Hasbro Children’s, Bradley, Newport, and The Miriam hospitals. Care New England operates Butler, Kent, and Women & Infants hospitals.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Health officials are looking for people who might have come in contact with a rabid puppy or its missing littermate along the Georgia-South Carolina border. The Department of Health and Environmental Control said the agency recently identified a rabid puppy that was born in Edgefield County, near Lanier Road in the town of Johnston. The small, tan-and-white pit bull puppy was approximately 7 weeks old and weighed about 5 pounds. The dog and a littermate were taken to Augusta, Georgia, between July 14 and July 17. Both puppies were also taken to a gathering in Clearwater, South Carolina, about that time, the agency said. The rabid puppy was also taken to a birthday party in Florence, South Carolina. Health officials have yet to find the littermate or identify its rabies status. The health agency is now searching for people who attended the Clearwater gathering or might have had contact with the littermate puppy. “We are deeply concerned about all persons involved, as rabies is fatal if left untreated after exposure,” said Dr. Gil Potter, Midlands Region Medical Director. People who came in contact with the puppy’s saliva should seek medical attention, as they might have been exposed to rabies, the agency said. Animals can shed the virus for up to two weeks before showing symptoms of rabies.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Staff and inmates at South Dakota prisons are no longer required to wear masks following an order from Gov. Kristi Noem lifting the requirement. Among neighboring states, South Dakota is the only one to lift a mask requirement in prisons, the Argus Leader reported. Noem’s move was spurred by a meeting she had with employees at the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls. They cheered when she told them they could remove their masks during a meeting Friday. The governor was at the prison to respond to an ongoing human resources investigation into complaints of low employee morale, shorthanded prison staff and insufficient tactical gear for corrections officers. Noem’s spokesman Ian Fury told the Argus Leader the governor would have made the move even sooner if she was aware of the Department of Corrections policy. He said it was “common sense” given the rate of virus cases and would help boost employee morale. The Department of Corrections said 70% of inmates have received at least one vaccination. It does not track the vaccination rate among staff.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A group of state Senate Republicans are urging the public to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, a move that comes as case numbers are beginning to again climb throughout the state. “Unfortunately, efforts to get more people vaccinated have been hampered by politicization of COVID-19,” the group of 17 lawmakers wrote in a letter Tuesday. “This should not be political.” Tennessee has faced increased national scrutiny over its low COVID-19 vaccination rates after the Department of Health fired its top vaccination chief and briefly halted outreach for childhood vaccines. Some GOP leaders have since gone on the defensive, with Gov. Bill Lee urging Tennesseans to get a COVID-19 shot after remaining mum on the subject for several weeks. On Tuesday, Senate Republican leadership reiterated that getting the vaccine was a “personal choice” but encouraged people to talk to their doctor about the vaccination.\n\nTexas\n\nLa Porte: Two people are dead and 30 were hospitalized after a chemical leak at a Houston-area plant, officials said. LyondellBasell said that about 100,000 pounds of a mixture that included acetic acid was released in the leak that started Tuesday night at its La Porte Complex. The company said that the “all clear” was given early Wednesday, and that the leak had been isolated and contained. The company said air monitoring was ongoing and hasn’t shown “actionable levels.” Two contractors were killed and 30 workers were taken to local hospitals for evaluation and treatment, the company said. Of those, it said 24 were treated and released. The names of the contractors who died were not immediately released. The cause was under investigation, the company said, adding it was cooperating with authorities. Harris County Fire Marshal Laurie Christensen said that the chemicals involved can severely burn skin and are toxic if inhaled.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Flash floods caused extensive damage in Cedar City and led Mayor Maile Wilson-Edwards to declare a state of emergency. Residents of the basement apartments at University West Apartments said they lost everything they own after the flood waters reached several feet high, Fox13 news reported. Cheryl Beeston said her daughter and son-in-law, Cheyenne and Kyle Brunson, were at work when the floods hit, but their home is ruined. “It’s worse than I ever expected. They’ve been married – it’ll be five months tomorrow – and they’ve lost everything,” she said. One volunteer did manage to find her daughter’s wedding ring, though. “We’re so grateful for that,” Beeston said. “We’re grateful for all the help that’s here.” Parts of the Southern Utah University campus, including the stadium were also damaged alongside entire neighborhoods, business complexes and roads. A Walmart parking lot became a waist-high pond and drivers waded out to their cars with help from Walmart employees.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:More than a dozen blood donation opportunities are scheduled across Vermont in August as the American Red Cross is reporting a severe blood shortage. The need for donations is higher this summer as more people are seeking treatment after deferring care during the coronavirus pandemic, Northern New England Red Cross spokeswoman Mary Brant told the Burlington Free Press. Organ transplants and elective surgeries have increased. Hospital emergency rooms also are handling more trauma cases, Brant said. The Red Cross has been distributing 12% more blood products to hospitals across the country than it was during the same time last year, the newspaper reported. Vermonters are urged to make an appointment now to give blood by calling 1-800-RED CROSS, visiting redcrossblood.org or downloading the Red Cross Blood Donor app on a smartphone.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam introduced two more spending proposals for the state’s $4.3 billion share of federal coronavirus relief money, calling for investments in clean water projects and more than $860 million to replenish the fund that pays unemployment benefits. The Democratic governor has been incrementally rolling out his spending plans ahead of a special legislative session that begins next week, when lawmakers will vote on how to allocate the money from the American Rescue Plan.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee said the state will follow federal guidance and recommend that people wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas where there is a worrying rate of COVID-19 - including people who are fully vaccinated. Inslee also said the state will continue to require that all students and employees of K-12 schools wear masks when instruction resumes for the upcoming school year. Inslee’s office said the masking guidance for the general public indoors in places with a substantial or high COVID-19 rate is a recommendation only, but the school masking requirement is state law. Health officials in more than a half-dozen western Washington counties were already recommending mask-wearing in indoor public spaces regardless of vaccine status because of a rise in COVID-19 cases and the highly infectious delta variant.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClarksburg: The Clarksburg Water Board has made $416,000 available in its budget to address lead found in some customers’ household drinking water. The board won’t make capital purchases this year and postponed buying items including lab equipment and three trucks, The Exponent Telegram reported. “These items are needed. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be in the budget,” Jason Myers, the board’s general manager, said at a meeting on Tuesday. “However, with public health in mind … we’re willing to forgo this.” The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources said funds are available to help with the problem but asked the board to outline how much of its own money could be used, according to Myers. On top of available aid from the health department and the Environmental Protection Agency, the board plans to request funding from the West Virginia Infrastructure and Jobs Development Council. The region’s planning and development council is also helping to find funding sources. Of the 120 water samples collected for lead testing that were returned as of Tuesday afternoon, only one was above an allowable limit set by the EPA. The lead issue was discovered when drinking water samples were collected from the homes of three children diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels. The toxic metal can be particularly harmful to children. Multiple sources of exposure were identified, so the water couldn’t have been the sole cause of the higher levels.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party said he is stepping down from the volunteer position he has held since April 2019. Andrew Hitt departure comes just over a year before the 2022 midterm elections, where Republicans are trying to retain the U.S. Senate seat held by Ron Johnson and defeat Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. Hitt, 43, said he will leave the post upon election of a successor, which will take place by early September. Hitt, from Appleton, is an attorney with the Michael Best and Friedrich law firm and also is a partner in its lobbying arm, Michael Best Strategies. Hitt said he was leaving to focus on his family and private sector career. “It’s bittersweet to step down now with such an exciting election cycle ahead, but I know it is the right thing to do for my family and employer after the sacrifices they made so I could provide steady leadership at a crucial time,” Hitt said in a statement. Hitt was a visible chairman, working closely with party activists, insiders and office holders, raising money and also being the public face for the GOP in the media. During his time as chairman, the state GOP opened its first office in Milwaukee and also suffered a cyberattack where $2.3 million was stolen.\n\nWyoming\n\nDayton: Investigators found a man dead after a boy allegedly told authorities in Montana he killed his father. The 15-year-old allegedly confessed to authorities in the Hardin, Montana, area, leading investigators to find the body at a home in Dayton early Wednesday, Sheridan County sheriff’s officials said in a statement. Sheriff’s officials didn’t identify the boy or dead man. Sheriff’s officials and Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation agents were investigating, according to the statement. There was no threat to the public and people should keep away from the home to allow a thorough investigation, Undersheriff Levi Dominguez said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/28"}]}

But a law enforcement official who briefed reporters speculated that it may have fallen out of a local police officer’s pocket.\n\nWhat’s more, the security lapse illustrated how weeks of careful planning involving the Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies can quickly be disrupted by something as simple as a misplaced piece of paper.\n\nThe Northern Ireland security operation, code-named “Op Rondoletto,” involved weeks of planning and nearly 3,000 local police officers. The planning document, which carried the all-caps heading “OFFICIAL SENSITIVE,” didn’t include any information about the operations of the Secret Service, which oversees the president's security during foreign trips, or its security plan.\n\n'Northern Ireland will not go back':Biden calls for sustained peace amid political unrest\n\nMost of Belfast's city center was barricaded off to residents during Biden's visit marking the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which ended three decades of civil war in Northern Ireland.\n\nBelfast is a city with a long history of violence. Just days before Biden’s arrival, police disrupted a potential bombing attack targeted for Londonderry, Northern Ireland, by members of the New IRA, a paramilitary group affiliated with the Irish Republican Army, according to The Belfast Telegraph.\n\nThe report said there was no evidence to suggest that Biden was the target of the bombing plot but that the group intended to carry out the attack during his visit.\n\nBiden touched upon the city’s violent past during his speech Wednesday at Ulster University in Belfast. The president specifically mentioned the attempted murder of John Caldwell, a police detective who was shot in March. Northern Ireland law enforcement believe the attack was carried about by the New IRA.\n\n“Northern Ireland will not go back, pray to God,” Biden said.\n\nSecret Service has faced security challenges\n\nThe Secret Service has faced its share of security challenges during the Biden administration, including successfully navigating the president's surprise visit to Ukraine in February ahead of the anniversary of Russia's invasion.\n\nThe Ukraine visit was kept secret because of security concerns, part of an operation that the White House said had been ''meticulously planned\" for months.\n\nLast September, when Biden traveled to London for Queen Elizabeth II’s state funeral, the Secret Service was forced to deal with an unusual demand when the British government advised dignitaries to avoid taking private transportation and said they would be escorted to the service in buses.\n\nWhen Biden travels, domestically or abroad, he typically arrives aboard Air Force One. If transportation is needed when the president's plane lands or circumstances do not allow him to take the aircraft, he travels in the heavily armored black presidential limousine known as The Beast or climbs aboard Marine One, the presidential helicopter.\n\nIn the U.K., it's not unusual for senior members of the royal family to be bused into crowded areas for important events. But the idea of the leader of the free world hopping a bus to a major event raised concerns not only about his own security but also about the safety of other leaders who would potentially be riding with him.\n\nIn the end, the British government allowed Biden to take The Beast to the service at Westminster Abbey. Other world leaders shared a bus.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison, Collins @mcollinsNEWS, and Johnson @bykevinj", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/02/raven-story-stamp-willie-nelson-hells-angels-news-around-states/117772976/", "title": "Raven Story stamp, Willie Nelson: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: A dive bar known to two generations of University of Alabama students, football fans and music lovers has ended its run. Egan’s Bar shut down over the weekend after 42 years in Tuscaloosa on a stretch of nightspots and restaurants called “The Strip.” A “Last Call at Egan’s” event was held Saturday, with Sunday the final day in operation. Owner Mike McWhirter said he’s selling Egan’s and plans to move to Texas for a job opportunity with his son. Another bar, Unique, will open at the same location this month. McWhirter, a longtime regular who took over the popular bar in 2018, said he made the hard decision to sell Egan’s within the past month, and the decision to close was tough. “To see that era end is a little difficult, and I’ve had my reservations, but being with my family is incredibly important to me,” McWhirter said. Bands including the Grammy-winning Alabama Shakes have played at Egan’s. It’s unclear what will become of a well-known sign that hangs over the door that reads: “Thick Smoke. Dim Lights. Loud Music. Welcome to Egan’s.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Alaska Native artist Rico Worl has created a stamp for the U.S. Postal Service that he hopes will be a gateway for people to learn about his Tlingit culture. A ceremony marking the release of Worl’s Raven Story stamp was held Friday in Juneau, where Worl lives. The event featured dancers, including Worl, and the telling of a version of the Raven story. Two ravens, birds that are ubiquitous in Juneau, happened to fly overhead after the story was told. Worl said his Twitter following exploded from five to more than 8,000 after he shared the Postal Service’s tweet highlighting the stamp announcement last month, with his own quote tweet adding: “I did a thing.” Raven, a trickster or transformer, is a key figure in Tlingit culture. Worl described as an influence for the stamp a story in which Raven discovers that a clan leader had in his possession the sun, moon and stars. Raven assumed human form to share those items with the world. The stars were in the last box Raven opened. In a statement, Worl said he wanted to showcase “a bit of drama,” with Raven trying to hold onto as many stars as possible while transforming back into bird form during a frenzied escape. The Sealaska Heritage Institute, which hosted the unveiling in front of its building, said this is the first stamp by a Tlingit artist.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state on Saturday reported more than 2,000 newly confirmed COVID-19 infections for the first time in nearly five months amid a continuing increase in its rolling average of new cases and more coronavirus-related hospitalizations. “Unlike last summer when we were headed into school w/ declining rates, the match has been lit and the kindling is aflame this time,” Dr. Joe K. Gerald, a University of Arizona researcher who tracks COVID-19 data, said on Twitter. In another development, a Republican legislator who supported a measure enacted in late June to prohibit school districts from requiring mask-wearing, said she has asked government lawyers to determine when the prohibition takes effect. Sen. Kelly Townsend’s requests Friday to the Legislature’s legal office and the state Attorney General’s Office was a response to Phoenix Union High School District’s announcement that it will require students, staff and visitors to wear masks to help curb the spread of COVID-19. The prohibition in budget legislation is retroactive to July 1, but the budget legislation itself doesn’t take effect until Sept. 29. “It is clear we still have an issue with rogue school boards when it comes to forcing masks,” Townsend said in a statement. District officials said they were most concerned about protecting health and safety.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The superintendent of the city’s schools on Friday called for suing to overturn the state’s ban on mask mandates, saying he wasn’t confident legislators would allow local school boards to impose their own requirements. Superintendent Mike Poore said he’ll ask the Little Rock School Board to challenge the state law prohibiting state and local government entities from requiring masks. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who signed the ban in April, said Thursday that he’ll call the majority-GOP Legislature back into session this week to lift the ban for K-12 public schools. Hutchinson and legislative leaders have said they face an uphill battle in changing the law, especially since it would need two-thirds support in the House and Senate to take effect before school begins. “I’m not confident that will occur,” Poore said in a YouTube video released by the district. “This lawsuit allows us a place in order to take this situation to the judicial branch and act on (the ban).” If approved, Little Rock’s lawsuit would be among at least two expected in the coming weeks challenging Arkansas’ ban as the school year approaches. A group of parents is also expected to file a lawsuit challenging the ban’s constitutionality.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The FBI is investigating what one commercial airline pilot said might have been an airborne person with a jetpack, high in the busy skies near Los Angeles International Airport. The Los Angeles Times reports the Boeing 747 pilot radioed to report “a possible jetpack man in sight” about 6:12 p.m. Wednesday, according to a recording from the website LiveATC. The pilot spotted an object that might have resembled a jetpack 15 miles east of LAX at 5,000 feet altitude, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson told the newspaper, saying: “Out of an abundance of caution, air traffic controllers alerted other pilots in the vicinity.” “Use caution, the jetpack guy is back,” said one air traffic alert. “Did you see a UFO?” one air traffic controller asked a pilot. “We were looking but we did not see Iron Man,” the pilot responded. The FBI is working with the FAA to investigate the report, FBI spokesperson Laura Eimiller told the Times in an email. The agency has already looked into three other possible jetpack sightings in the skies above Los Angeles and has “not been able to validate any of the reports,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: More than 100 people had to spend the night on a highway, including nearly 30 who took refuge in a tunnel, after rain over an area burned by a wildfire once again triggered mudslides in western Colorado, authorities said Friday. The people were caught with their vehicles on Interstate 70 in Glenwood Canyon on Thursday night. Those in the tunnel were stuck for about nine hours until crews could carve out a path through the mud to reach them about 6:30 a.m. Friday, Garfield County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Walt Stowe said. The tunnel serves as a 24-hour operations center for the Colorado Department of Transportation, so it is relatively well-lit and has telephones, Stowe said. No injuries were reported. The transportation department accounted for 108 people, including 29 in the tunnel, who were stuck on the highway overnight. Between 65 and 70 people remained stranded at a rest stop Friday afternoon as crews worked to punch a safe passage through the debris. Mike Goolsby, a regional director for the transportation department, said the area was affected by about 10 slides, some 12 feet deep and up to 150 feet wide. Glenwood Canyon has cliffs towering up to 2,000 feet above the Colorado River, making it prone to rockslides and mudslides.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Supporters of Nelson Pinos, an Ecuadorian immigrant who first sought sanctuary from a federal deportation order in a New Haven church in 2017, are celebrating his temporary reprieve. The father of three, who has lived in the U.S. for 29 years, learned last week that immigration authorities have granted him a one-year stay, and supporters said Saturday that he has left the church for now. At the celebration Saturday, supporters of Pinos, 47, vowed to make sure he gets to remain in the country permanently, noting that the fight for his freedom and the freedom of other immigrants without legal status is far from over. “Today, we are not only celebrating a temporary stay, but we’re sending a loud message about a broken process,” said Miguel Castro, chairman of the Connecticut Hispanic Democratic Caucus. “This is the time to fix it and fix it good so families like Nelson and his wife and his children and many like him will never, ever go through something like this ever again.” Organizers of Saturday’s event said Pinos is the last of the sanctuary-seekers in Connecticut to be given a stay of deportation. Pinos could not attend Saturday’s celebration because he was quarantining after being exposed to someone infected with the coronavirus. But he thanked the crowd by cellphone.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: School officials across the state are trying everything to find bus drivers as a shortage causes logistical nightmares all over the country. Among the efforts are programs that would pay drivers more money, increase their wages if they service more than one route, and offer bonuses for steady attendance. But at least one school, EastSide Charter, might have a different solution: paying parents. The school on Tuesday launched a survey to determine the interest level in a program that would offer parents $700 per year per student to drop off their children and pick them up from the Wilmington school. “We’re looking at every idea right now,” said Aaron Bass, the school’s CEO. He said officials around the state are considering many options, even providing passes for students to take public transportation to school. That, however, wouldn’t work at EastSide, which services students through the eighth grade. “I can’t put a 5-year-old on a DART bus and say, ‘Good luck,’ ” he said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Local music venue the Anthem finally reopened Friday, kicking things off with a special one-night-only performance from comedian and D.C. native Dave Chappelle, WUSA-TV reports. The first musical guest at the reopened venue will be Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons on Aug. 7. Other upcoming shows include Modest Mouse, Kesha and Glass Animals. Masks are required inside the Anthem. Chapelle’s untitled documentary, meanwhile, was screened at the Kennedy Center on Sunday. The film centers on Chappelle’s current home in rural Ohio as the town deals with the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and as the community undergoes a cultural evolution following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which galvanized protests around the country against racial injustice and mistreatment at the hands of police.\n\nFlorida\n\nSebring: The 22-year project to restore the Kissimmee River from a straight, human-made channel to its natural meandering state has marked a major milestone. Officials involved in the nearly $1 billion Kissimmee River Restoration Project said at an event Thursday that 44 miles of the waterway have been returned to its curving path in central Florida. The project began in 1999 amid evidence that converting the river to a straight flood control canal in the 1970s damaged the environment, dumping more polluted water into Lake Okeechobee, sharply reducing waterfowl and bald eagle populations, and harming fish and invertebrates. The Kissimmee River’s restored floodplains and oxbows will help clean water laden with nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural runoff, which has fed harmful algal blooms, plaguing the lake for decades. “Not only are we keeping water in the watershed and delivering it in the right volumes and frequencies; we’re also connecting with the floodplains where it cleans the water before it heads down into the lake,” said South Florida Water Management District Executive Director Drew Bartlett. Now that construction is complete, the next step is to increase storage in headwaters lakes and mimic how the river once naturally flowed. That will be done by 2026, officials said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republican lawmakers have started a process that could lead to a takeover of elections in the state’s most populous county. Many in the GOP continue to claim that wrongdoing in reliably Democratic Fulton County had stolen the 2020 election from Donald Trump, even though an independent monitor found no evidence of fraud or impropriety. Lawmakers are using a tool created by Georgia’s sweeping new election law to exert influence over local elections. Democrats and voting rights advocates decry the takeover provision as an invitation for political interference. The county, with about 11% of the state’s electorate, includes most of the city of Atlanta. But Fulton County has been plagued with problems for years, and Republicans say it’s time for answers. State House Speaker Pro Tem Jan Jones and four other GOP state representatives whose districts include parts of Fulton submitted a letter Friday to the State Election Board demanding a performance review of the county’s board of registration and elections. “I wrote the letter as a representative of constituents who have expressed concerns over the sloppy manner in which elections were conducted in Fulton County in 2020 and in the years leading up to then,” Jones, who represents a suburban north Fulton district, said Friday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials announced 622 new coronavirus cases Friday, the highest number of confirmed infections since the start of the pandemic. The total included cases from lab reporting delays from the prior three days, officials said, but the number is still a significant spike for the state of about 1.4 million people. The seven-day positivity rate rose to 5.1%. Officials said the average daily case count from the prior three days had topped 300. Previously, the record-high total for confirmed cases in a single day was 355, set in August 2020. Officials said the surge is associated with the highly contagious delta variant and encouraged people to get inoculated against COVID-19. “The pandemic is not over, and the best way forward is for people to get vaccinated,” Gov. David Ige said. Just over 60% of Hawaii residents are fully vaccinated. Hawaii Department of Health Director Libby Char said about 25% of the new infections are among children, but officials still plan to have kids return to school this week. “There is risk involved in everything. But I think we also have to be cognizant that there is a cost to not having children in school and having them fall further behind in learning and the continued social isolation,” Char said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Boise Police Department says officers removed flags emblazoned with the emblem of the neo-fascist Proud Boys organization after someone hung them from several overpasses on a busy interstate. Police spokesperson Haley Williams told the Idaho Statesman that officers removed the flags Saturday morning. It wasn’t immediately clear who hung up the flags on Interstate 84 overpasses in Boise, but Williams said anyone with information should contact the police department. The Proud Boys are considered a hate group by organizations like the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Proud Boys members describe themselves as a politically incorrect men’s club for “Western chauvinists.” Several members of the group have been charged in federal court with offenses related to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The flags mark the second recent public display from the neo-fascist group in southern Idaho. Proud Boys members marched in a Sagebrush Days community parade in Buhl in early July, raising concerns for many. At the time, the Buhl Chamber of Commerce, which organizes the parade, told The Times-News newspaper in Twin Falls that it would not “feed into any negative propaganda” about the Proud Boys’ appearance.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The University of Illinois Chicago has received $6 million from the federal government to test a potential treatment for COVID-19. Researchers say the drug candidate, called VT-109, has been shown to help restore function to damaged lungs, among other things. The drug, administered as an intravenous treatment, will be tested in pre-clinical animal models of COVID-19 to determine efficacy and toxicity before human trials are considered. The money comes through a technology and therapeutic development award from the U.S. Department of Defense, university officials announced in a recent news release. Researchers hope the testing will culminate in an application to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration program overseeing how potential drugs are evaluated for human clinical trials. It could take three or more years to get to that point, researchers estimate. Research on the drug has already been funded by awards from UIC and the National Institutes of Health, among others.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than 200 police agencies across the state will be boosting their patrols this fall to crack down on school bus stop-arm violations and dangerous driving near school bus stops and in school zones. Gov. Eric Holcomb announced the extra patrols Wednesday and urged motorists to keep watch for school buses in the weeks ahead. “We’re entering back-to-school season in Indiana, which means motorists need to watch for buses and drive cautiously at all times,” Holcomb said in a statement. Bus drivers and school transportation officials will help police identify areas where extra patrols are most needed under Indiana’s SAVE blitz, which stands for Stop Arm Violation Enforcement. That program is supported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute, The Journal Gazette reports. In 2019, Indiana lawmakers approved tougher penalties for drivers who pass school buses with extended stop arms after three children were fatally struck while crossing a highway to board a bus. A spring police enforcement period netted more than 5,600 citations, including 251 for stop-arm violations, 309 for texting while driving, and almost 1,900 for speeding, the Criminal Justice Institute said in a news release. About 1,700 warnings also were issued.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds has no plans to offer $100 incentives to Iowans to get COVID-19 shots after President Joe Biden pleaded with states and local governments to use federal funds to entice people to stop the rapid spread of a coronavirus variant, an aide said Friday. While many states and some Iowa counties have offered incentives for citizens to get vaccinations, Iowa’s governor continues to call for citizens to get vaccinated while repeating that ultimately it’s their choice. Iowa had 49.5% of the population fully immunized as of Thursday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That ranks 21st in the nation. Vaccination rates have fallen rapidly in the state since the spring, from a seven-day average of more than 17,000 people becoming fully vaccinated in May to 1,402 in recent days. Reynolds spokesman Pat Garrett said Friday that the governor has no plans to comply with Biden’s offer Thursday for states to spend $100 in federal funds for each newly vaccinated person. In an email, Iowa Department of Public Health Sarah Ekstrand said the state’s strategy is unchanged from its current “education and communications efforts.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly on Friday recommended that nearly everyone inside K-12 schools or riding school buses in the state be required to wear a mask, and Kansas State University will require masks in its buildings, whether people are vaccinated against COVID-19 or not. Kelly’s office issued updated guidance for elementary, middle and high schools in response to a surge in new COVID-19 cases over the past five weeks tied to the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. She also is citing revised recommendations on masks from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We know our children belong in the classroom, but it’s critical that we provide Kansas school districts with support and tools they need to keep our kids safe,” Kelly said in a statement. Last week she issued a mask mandate for state government workers and visitors to state buildings in most of Kansas’ 105 counties. Kansas State cited that order and the CDC’s new guidance on masks in announcing its mandate for people to wear masks indoors when not alone. It takes effect Monday on Kansas State’s main campus in Manhattan, its Polytechnic Campus in Salina and its satellite campus in Olathe. The University of Kansas is also recommending that everyone wear masks indoors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Lottery smashed its sales record in its just-completed fiscal year, with the boon largely due to a lack of other entertainment options during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the head of the 32-year-old organization. The Kentucky Lottery announced last week that from July 2020 through June 2021, the organization saw total sales of $1,586,325,000. That marked a 31.8% increase, or $382.9 million in additional sales, from the prior fiscal year. Mary Harville, Kentucky Lottery president and CEO, said that during the start of the pandemic in March 2020, “things started to close, including a lot of entertainment venues.” But “places that sell lottery tickets – grocery stores, convenience stores and gas stations – stayed open,” said Harville, the first female head of the organization. She said while other items sold out at stpres during the early months of the pandemic, her team ensured ticket dispensers and vending machines were “fully stocked.” That helped out retailers, who received more than $90 million in commissions through Kentucky lottery sales. The record-breaking year for sales also paid its dividends for Kentucky, as proceeds to the commonwealth totaled a historic $354.8 million – which is $76.3 million, or 27.4%, more than last year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nWest Grand Terre Island: Excavators, bulldozers and a dredge miles away from them are working on a $100 million project to raise and reshape a barrier island. West Grand Terre Island helps protect communities from New Orleans’ west bank to Bayou Lafourche from hurricanes and storm surge, depending on the storm’s direction, said Greg Grandy, deputy executive director of Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. But like East Grand Terre Island, where some of the BP oil spill’s iconic images were made, West Grand Terre was heavily oiled during the 2010 spill and was severely eroded before that. The two islands were one when Jean Lafitte and his Baratarian pirates made Grand Terre and nearby Grand Isle their headquarters but now are more than a mile apart. About $100 million in spill restoration money is being used to restore and create about 256 acres of beach and dune and 143 acres of marsh on West Grand Terre. About $2 million from various other sources was used to remove a fisheries lab destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. “It is one of the most historically and ecologically important barrier islands in Louisiana,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said when funding for this and two other projects was announced in May.\n\nMaine\n\nBelfast: The hospital in a community that was the epicenter of a so-called superspreader event plans to require all staff to be vaccinated against COVID-19, becoming the first hospital in Maine to do so. All staff at Millinocket Regional Hospital will be required to be fully vaccinated with either Pfizer or Modern vaccines within six weeks of final approval by the Food and Drug Administration, officials said. “Millinocket Regional Hospital is committed to providing a safe working environment for all employees and the safest environment possible for patients to receive care,” said Dr. Robert Peterson, the hospital’s chief executive officer. A wedding nearly a year ago in the Millinocket area was linked to outbreaks in at least two other locations in Maine, with more than 170 people contracting the coronavirus and seven deaths since then. Several other Maine hospitals are in discussions about vaccine requirements after national organizations, including the American Medical Association and the American Nursing Association, urged them to do so. More Maine hospitals are expected to follow Millinocket in announcing vaccine mandates for employees in the near future, Steven Michaud, president of the Maine Hospital Association, told the Portland Press Herald.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The family of a Maryland woman who unwittingly spurred a research bonanza when her cancer cells were taken without her knowledge in 1951 has hired a prominent civil rights lawyer to seek compensation from pharmaceutical companies. The relatives of Henrietta Lacks have hired Ben Crump, an attorney who has represented the families of a number of Black people who have died at the hands of police and vigilantes in recent years. Those clients include the families of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin and Breonna Taylor. The Baltimore Sun had reported that a lawyer for the Lacks family said a legal team was investigating lawsuits against numerous potential defendants. Cells taken from Lacks have been widely used in biomedical research. The so-called HeLa cells became crucial for key developments in such areas as basic biology, understanding viruses and other germs, cancer treatments, in vitro fertilization and vaccine development. Lacks became famous in 2010 with publication of Rebecca Skloot’s best-selling book, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.” As that book relates, Lacks was under anesthesia on an operating table at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore one day in 1951, undergoing treatment for cervical cancer, when a surgeon shaved tissue from her tumor for a research project.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gambling regulators, in response to complaints, want to know why two of the state’s casinos have not yet brought back poker. Bruce Band, deputy director of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission’s Investigations and Enforcement Bureau, said at a meeting Thursday that the commission normally receives about five complaints a month but lately has been receiving about 50 per month, many of them regarding poker, the Boston Herald reports. When casinos reopened after being shut down during the pandemic, the commission limited poker tables to four players. Encore Boston Harbor and MGM Springfield said that limit would not have made poker profitable enough to bring back. Even though the limit was lifted in May, poker has still not returned. Encore executive Jacqui Krum told the commission that what was once the poker area has been repurposed during COVID-19 and that the casino is having trouble hiring. “We remain in continual hiring mode. We simply cannot find enough dealers, cashiers or food servers,” Krum said, adding that reopening poker right now would require shutting down other games.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The White House and Canada have issued a joint statement of support for a commuter bridge that when completed will span the Detroit River, connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. The statement issued Thursday calls the Gordie Howe International Bridge “a top infrastructure priority” for both governments. It comes as Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican senators try to work out a compromise over a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure package. “This full-throated support of this vital bridge comes as President Biden and Congress continue to make progress on bipartisan and significant investment in transportation and other infrastructure,” Michigan Gov. Whitmer said in her own statement. “The ongoing construction of this bridge has created jobs on both sides of the border, and will continue to spur economic development for many years to come.” In 2012, then-Gov. Rick Snyder and former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper struck a deal calling for Canada to pay for the bridge after the Republican governor ran into opposition in the GOP-led Legislature. The $4.4 billion, six-lane span is expected to open in late 2024. It’s named for Gordie Howe, a native of Canada and hockey legend who starred for the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has extended an air quality alert until noon Tuesday for the entire state, due to what authorities are calling an “unprecedented significant air quality event.” Minnesota has been dealing with smoke from Canadian wildfires that has created some of the highest particulate readings on record. An air quality alert was set to expire Friday afternoon, but it was extended through Tuesday and includes the whole state. The wildfires are north of the Canadian border in Ontario and Manitoba. The MPCA said smoke would continue pouring into the state into Sunday. High pressure will build over the area, and the smoke will recirculate under that high pressure through Tuesday, leading to a prolonged period of heavy smoke. The agency said fine particle levels are expected to reach the purple category, a level considered very unhealthy for everyone, across north-central and south-central Minnesota. That area includes Roseau, Hibbing, Brainerd, St. Cloud and the Twin Cities. It also includes the tribal nations of Red Lake, Leech Lake and Mille Lacs.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: A movie called “My Stolen Life” started filming last week in this city that has a wide view of the Mississippi River. The film, for the Lifetime network, is about twin sisters who have endured a traumatic situation. One becomes a famous writer, and the other is driven mad. The Vicksburg Post reports the movie features several Vicksburg landmarks and some local faces. Vicksburg Police Chief Penny Jones plays herself in one scene. “The film wasn’t originally set in Vicksburg, but we came here and didn’t want to try to make it look like it was set somewhere else,” producer Liana Rae Perez said. Filming locations include the B.B. Club, Vicksburg’s riverfront murals and downtown area, and the antebellum home Anchuca. The film is directed and produced by Atlanta native Dylan Vox.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: St. Louis County Police Chief Mary Barton, who has been criticized for her handling of racial discrimination complaints, announced Friday that she will retire. Barton, who was appointed chief in April 2020, said she would step down after a leave of absence that was scheduled to begin Sunday. The leave will allow her to continue to be paid while she uses accrued vacation time, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. The Board of Police Commissioners and the St. Louis County Council have criticized Barton over her performance, particularly her response to racial discrimination within the department. The Ethical Society of Police, which works for racial and gender equity in St. Louis and St. Louis County, also criticized Barton, who is white. In response to the criticism, Barton said she was doing her best to make positive changes. “I have done my job in a professional manner, and I have moved this police department forward,” she said in April. “Myself and the Board of Police Commissioners are committed to moving this police department forward.”\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Authorities ordered evacuations along the shore of a northwestern Montana lake Sunday as winds pushed a wildfire toward the area. The Finley Point/Yellow Bay Fire Department said in a social media post that flames had crossed Montana Highway 35 and were pushing toward Flathead Lake on Sunday morning. The evacuation order included Finley Point the Skidoo Lane area and houses located along a 6-mile stretch of Highway 35 north of Polson. The fire detected Saturday morning 8 miles east of Polson is believed to be human-caused, the Flathead Beacon reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nBellevue: Offutt Air Force Base south of Omaha has announced it is reinstating a mask mandate, requiring all employees, contractors and visitors to wear face masks indoors. The requirement applies to everyone, even those who have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The military base outside Bellevue said in a social media post that the new requirement came from the defense secretary’s office and was triggered by rising coronavirus cases in Sarpy County. The requirement went into full effect Friday. Additionally, the post said, those who are not vaccinated must maintain a distance of 6 feet from others, as outlined in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.\n\nNevada\n\nIncline Village: Transportation officials at Lake Tahoe say they are experimenting with a new effort to try to change the behavior of visitors who fill up an overcrowded parking area for one of the lake’s most popular beaches by hitting them in their wallets. The parking lot was built when roadside parking in the area was prohibited for safety concerns on the edge of the lake south of Incline Village. It’s at the start of the newly constructed trail that leads to Hidden Beach. Under the plan, parking fees cost as much as $6 or $7 an hour depending on the day and time the visitor arrives. In addition, visitors can’t use cash to park there – the machines only accept credit cards. Tahoe Transportation District Manager Carl Hasty told the Nevada Appeal the fees are an experiment to see if visitor patterns can be changed so that not everyone arrives at peak beach times from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. He said it’s a “pilot effort to incentivize people to come when it isn’t the peak time.” The problem, he said, is that Hidden Beach is so popular that there just isn’t room for everyone who wants to visit, especially during the summer from May through early September. He said the parking fees are lower during spring and fall. They are also lower on weekdays than they are Friday through Sunday but higher on holidays.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Republican Gov. Chris Sununu on Friday vetoed a bill that would have moved up the date of state primary elections from September to the first Tuesday in August. New Hampshire is known for its first-in-the-nation presidential primary every four years, but its state primary, held the second Tuesday in September, is one of the nation’s latest. Sununu, in his veto message, said he agrees with Secretary of State Bill Gardner, who’s run New Hampshire’s elections for 45 years, that the bill “creates more problems than it solves.” Sununu said the date change would move the elections and the campaign season into the middle of the summer, a time when more people would be enjoying their vacations than participating in the electoral process. He also said that moving the date to the summer could make it harder for communities to recruit poll workers and election day volunteers. The governor said some advocates of the bill “point to the supposed challenge of election officials meeting the deadlines to send absentee ballots to members of the military or other overseas Granite Staters.” But Sununu said New Hampshire has never failed to meet those deadlines.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: New mothers will soon be able to get up to three free visits from nurses after giving birth under a new state program designed to support healthy development and reduce postpartum complications, including death. With Gov. Phil Murphy’s signing Thursday of the Statewide Newborn Home Nurse Visitation Program, New Jersey is now the second state in the country, after Oregon, to offer home nurse visits to infants and their parents. But Murphy said New Jersey’s program is the “strongest” and “most comprehensive.” “Today we take a huge step forward in making our state the safest in the nation to both have a child and raise a child,” Murphy said at a ceremony in Newark. New Jersey has a long way to go to achieve that goal. In a country with the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, New Jersey has a “crisis” of dying mothers, as bill sponsors have said. The state ranked 45th in the nation in maternal mortality in 2018, with 38 deaths per 100,000 births, according to the United Health Foundation. The Murphy administration ranks it even worse, 47th in the U.S. Black women in particular are at high risk in New Jersey. According to Nurture NJ, they are seven times more likely than white women to die after childbirth, and Black babies are three times more likely to die within a year.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The second-ranking legislator in the state House of Representatives resigned Friday amid criminal investigations into her ties to a private contractor for the Albuquerque school district where she also works. Democratic House leaders announced the resignation of Majority Leader Sheryl Williams Stapleton while the investigation continues into possible racketeering, money laundering, kickbacks and violations of a law governing the conduct of state lawmakers. Stapleton said in her resignation letter that she “unequivocally” denies the allegations against her but decided she must devote her time and energy to fully defending herself. “I have made the difficult decision that it is in the best interest of the state,” she wrote in the letter to Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver. Stapleton, who began serving in the Legislature in 1995, oversees career technical education for Albuquerque Public Schools, the largest school district in the state and the top employer in the city. She has been placed on paid administrative leave by the school district. No charges have been filed against her.\n\nNew York\n\nMineola: Lawmakers in a suburban county are set to vote Monday on a proposal that would allow police officers to sue protesters and collect financial damages – a move civil rights activists say is payback for demonstrations after the police killing of George Floyd last year in Minneapolis. Newsday reports that the bill being considered by the Nassau County Legislature would make police officers and other first responders a protected class under the county’s Human Rights Law, which currently bars discrimination based on race, religion, gender and sexual orientation. No other professions are protected under the Human Rights Law. The bill would allow a lawyer for the Long Island county to sue protesters on behalf of officers and calls for fines of up to $25,000 for anyone who harasses, menaces or injures an officer. The fine amount would be doubled if the offending behavior happened “in the course of participating in a riot,” the bill says. Civil rights lawyer Frederick Brewington told reporters Friday that the bill violates free speech rights and, if passed, will have a chilling effect on protesters. The NAACP said it will bring members to Monday’s vote. “This is intended to evoke fear in the community,” Brewington said. “This is payback. It’s not right. It’s not acceptable, and it is against the law.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Another historically Black university in North Carolina has announced it will pay off all outstanding balances for students as a response to pandemic-related debt. Johnson C. Smith University will cancel about $300,000 in debts, The Charlotte Observer reports. Last month, Livingstone College in Salisbury said it would forgive more than $2.8 million in debt for students who attended during the 2021 spring semester. N.C. Central University in Durham has cleared more than $10 million in student debt, using federal COVID-19 relief funds to help a fourth of the student population. Many of these programs are possible because of the federal CARES Act. The funds also provided all returning JCSU students with direct relief last fall: $2,500 for returning students and $2,000 for new students, according to the university. Also, Pfeiffer University, a private school in Misenheimer, announced Thursday that it would eliminate $425,000 in student debts.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The State Water Commission on Friday approved $5 million in new aid to help ranchers who are battling drought conditions this summer. As part of the aid, the commission approved two additional water supply assistance programs and allocated more money to an existing program, Gov. Doug Burgum and Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said in a joint statement. “North Dakota producers continue to face unprecedented drought conditions that are devastating crops, decimating livestock herds and destroying billions of dollars in value on farms and ranches that have been built over generations,” said Burgum, who chairs the State Water Commission. “The relief approved today will help livestock producers manage this adversity and invest in infrastructure that builds resiliency against extreme drought conditions now and in the future.” The latest U.S. Drought Monitor map, released Thursday, shows more than half of North Dakota is in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories, the Bismarck Tribune reports. All of the state is in some form of drought. State officials say conditions driven by lack of precipitation and record heat are the worst in at least 30 years.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The difference in foster care payments between licensed caregivers and relatives stepping in to help “is neither ideal nor even satisfactory,” a judge said as he dismissed a lawsuit seeking to close that gap. Federal Judge Michael Barrett acknowledged that children cared for by relatives deserve more money but said advocates suing over the payment discrepancies didn’t have a claim under federal law. At issue are relatives who aren’t licensed caregivers but are approved to care for children taken from their parents. The arrangement is often referred to as kinship care. Child advocates argue the state must follow a 2017 federal appeals court decision ordering equality in payments to kinship caregivers, and in November they sued to force adherence to that ruling. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law late last year providing a partial fix. The plan authorizes a $10.20 per child per day payment for kinship caregivers for up to nine months. Advocates say that money falls far short of what licensed foster care parents receive, citing as an example the $1,500 to $9,667 monthly payments per foster child in Hamilton County, home to Cincinnati.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Republican Party faced fierce criticism Friday for a Facebook post likening COVID-19 vaccine mandates to the persecution of Jewish people in Nazi Germany. The post on the party’s official Facebook page urged people to call the lieutenant governor and ask him to call a special session to prohibit employers from requiring their employees to get vaccinated. It featured a picture of a yellow Star of David with the word “unvaccinated” on it and said: “Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.” Roberta Clark, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Greater Oklahoma City, called the post “highly inappropriate” and urged party officials to apologize. “To compare the actions taken by Nazi Germany to a public health discussion is ill-informed and inappropriate,” Clark said. “An apology is really appropriate, and it shows leadership and sensitivity to the harmful impact this has made.” John Bennett, the party’s new chairman, didn’t immediately respond to a phone message left at the party’s headquarters. The party’s vice chairman, Shane Jemison, said Friday that he wasn’t certain who created the post, but he called it “beyond abhorrent.”\n\nOregon\n\nJoseph: More than 150 Nez Perce (Niimiipuu) people returned and blessed part of their homeland Thursday, a hundred years after the U.S. Army drove them from the Wallowa Valley in eastern Oregon. In direct violation of the 1855 Treaty of Walla Walla, the Nez Perce in 1877 were forced from their 7.5 million-acre homeland to a 750,000-acre reservation in Idaho. For years, the tribe has worked to keep a connection to the ancestral land from which it was driven. Last year, it successfully reclaimed part of that land. The Nez Perce tribe purchased a 148-acre property in Joseph – known as Am’saaxpa, or Place of Boulders – in December but could not formally perform a blessing ceremony until Thursday due to COVID-19 concerns. The property had been privately owned and operated as a ranch for more than a hundred years. It is located at the edge of the city’s rodeo grounds. Surrounded by the Wallowa Mountains, the property rights include the house near Airport Road built in 1884, barns, grassland, and Wallowa River frontage where the Nez Perce would camp and catch sockeye salmon. It also includes the ridge where Chief Joseph once held council.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A new dashboard of real-time data on prison and parole populations shows the state has made strides to reduce racial inequity, but Black and Latino residents are still greatly overrepresented in prisons and on parole. The dashboard built by the group Recidiviz, a tech nonprofit that partners with governmental agencies to use data to reduce incarceration with a focus on racial inequities, was made public Friday and includes information on prison and parole populations as well as a tab to specifically look at racial disparities in the system. Pennsylvania officials hope the dashboard can be used to track the outcomes of current criminal justice practices and shape future policies. “Transparency creates a common language for all of us to talk about the criminal justice system, what’s working and what’s not, and to chart a path forward,” said Clementine Jacoby, the executive director of Recidiviz. It’s the second public dashboard the group has built in partnership with a state – North Dakota was the first – and they hope more states will agree to partner in the future. Jacoby said the dashboard tab that looks at racial disparities is important because it shows leadership at the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections is making equity a priority.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Public schools in the state are now required to teach a comprehensive African American history and heritage curriculum under legislation signed into law Friday by Gov. Daniel McKee. “The inclusion of African heritage and history in Rhode Island curricula is long overdue,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “I hope that Rhode Island will lead the nation in the effort to educate our young people on a full scope of history, including teaching students about events that took place right where they live.” The curriculum was developed by Rhode Island historical and academic institutions. The ceremonial bill signing took place at the Old Brick School House in Providence, a building that dates to 1769 and in 1828 became a city-supported school for Black children. “Knowing this truth is essential to a united society and I am very happy that these lessons will finally be presented to our students, and adults as well, so that they may go forth into the world truly knowing the many parts of our society that work for everyone and that sadly, currently there are still too many remaining caught in a cycle of intolerance and injustice,” state Rep. Anastasia Williams, D-Providence, said in a statement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: South Carolinians receiving federal food aid will continue to get extra emergency benefits through the end of the year, even though a pandemic-related state of emergency ended last month. State officials announced Friday that they were extending the deadline for the additional federal supplements, which were set to expire Aug. 1 after Gov. Henry McMaster brought the state’s COVID-19 state of emergency to an end in June. The Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program serves 610,000 people in about 295,000 households in South Carolina. On average, each household has received an additional $177 per month in emergency supplements throughout the pandemic. McMaster has authorized the state’s Department of Social Services to ensure residents continue receiving the extra benefits until Dec. 31 or the end of a federal public health emergency order, whichever comes first. “Our moral and ethical duty during the COVID-19 pandemic is to protect the lives of the most vulnerable South Carolinians – our elderly, young and at-risk population,” wrote Gov. Henry McMaster in a letter to the state’s Department of Social Services. The social services agency received approval Thursday from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to continue providing the emergency benefits.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: Law enforcement agencies are preparing for the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and are on alert for increased outlaw gang activity. The weeklong event that begins Friday is in its 81st year, and some believe that may mean a larger Hells Angels presence than usual. The number “81” is metonym and shorthand for Hells Angels, with H being the 8th letter of the alphabet and A the first. Meade County Sheriff Ron Merwin told KOTA-TV law enforcement is aware of the significance. “I would suspect that we’re going to have at least the normal number of Hells Angels around here,” Merwin said. “We might have a few more than normal. My suspicion is they might have some activities here because of the 81st.” Merwin said that although the biker crowd is largely respectful to law enforcement, officers are preparing for any confrontation that may occur. “I think one thing kind of leads to another, and trouble finds them,” Merwin said. “But I don’t suspect that they come here openly looking for it. They just don’t back down from it either.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Authorities on Saturday night reopened the Interstate 40 bridge linking Arkansas and Tennessee that had been closed ever since a crack was discovered in the span in May. The Hernando DeSoto Bridge, a key artery for U.S. commerce, reopened to the public for eastbound traffic, according to video shared by the Tennessee Department of Transportation. The eastbound lanes had previously been scheduled to open Monday, but officials recently moved up those plans. The state transportation department has said it plans to reopen the bridge’s westbound lanes next Friday, though it said that could also get moved up. The I-40 bridge over the Mississippi River was shut down May 11 after inspectors found a crack in one of two 900-foot horizontal steel beams critical for the bridge’s structural integrity, forcing thousands of trucks and cars to detour to the nearby Interstate 55 bridge during the I-40 bridge’s repairs. Beverly Robertson, CEO and President of the Greater Memphis Chamber, celebrated the news of the reopening. “The trucking industry has lost a lot with us being the third-busiest trucking corridor in the country. So many goods and services come here and then go out from there,” Robertson told WREG-TV.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Country music legend Willie Nelson led more than a thousand spectators in singing “vote them out” Saturday from the steps of the Texas Capitol during a rally wrapping up a four-day march in support of Democratic state legislators who bolted for Washington two weeks ago to block GOP-backed voting restrictions. Families with lawn chairs spread out across the sprawling Capitol greens in Austin. Clergy, politicians, constituents and musicians all spoke out about the proposals to impose voter ID requirements, limit ballot drop boxes and mail voting, and strip local officials of their election authority. The special session that the exodus by Texas Democrats halted is set to expire this week, but Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has pledged to schedule a new one as soon as the lawmakers return to the state. “If you don’t like who’s in there, vote them out,” Nelson sang, inviting he crowd to join him in singing lyrics he’d previously written about taking a stand at the ballot box. “I felt like I needed to be here. It is a history-making event that is so necessary right now,” said Brenda Hanson, 75, of Austin. “I am a descendant of slavery, and I am not interested in moving back; I want to see this country go forward.” Hanson said she is disabled but otherwise would have participated in the nearly 30-mile walk.\n\nUtah\n\nSpringdale: Five shuttle bus drivers at Zion National Park have quit over verbal abuse they’ve experienced from visitors angry about mask requirements on board, the park superintendent said. The iconic red-rock park in southern Utah is the third most visited in the nation, and visitation is only increasing. The shuttle buses are the only vehicles allowed on the road through the main canyon during the busy season. While mask mandates have been lifted in the rest of the state, face coverings are still required on the federally run shuttle buses. Zion National Park Superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh told the Springdale town council July 14 that the contractor running the buses has seen five recent resignations. “It seems unnecessary for that issue to develop,” he said. Rangers are also hearing visitor “frustrations” over masks, said Zion spokesperson Amanda Rowland. The park is working with the gateway town of Springdale to provide messaging on the mask mandate, she said.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: A giant ladderback chair that stands 19 feet tall may be big, but it wasn’t tough enough for some vandals. Damage to the massive “Big Chair” made from 3,000 pounds of cedar and white pine was captured early Thursday by surveillance video outside a credit union where the chair sits. The video shows two male and two female suspects climbing and jumping on the chair. The original chair was built in the late 1940s and became a popular roadside attraction. Over the decades it has been rebuilt several times. The security video captured the moment the joints gave way, apparently injuring one of the vandals, who was seen being helped away. The Bennington Banner reports the weight of the people who climbed on the chair caused the sockets that held the cross pieces to split wide open. Now the chair’s wooden joints are in splinters, and the rope seat is no longer in place. “We have people on a daily basis come and take pictures with the chair. They drive here specifically to see it,” said Linda M. Bow, the chief business officer for the Tri State Area Federal Credit Union’s Bennington branch. “It’s going to be hard to replace,” Bow said. “It wasn’t meant for climbing.”\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: A judge has upheld most of a lawsuit Liberty University filed against its former leader Jerry Falwell Jr. after an acrimonious parting last year. The lawsuit survived its first round of legal challenges Friday as Falwell’s attorneys argued motions seeking its dismissal before Lynchburg Circuit Judge Fred Watson, The News & Advance reports. Falwell’s departure from the evangelical school founded by his father came after Giancarlo Granda, a younger business partner of the Falwell family, said that he had a years­long sexual relationship with Falwell’s wife, Becki Falwell, and that Jerry Falwell participated in some of the liaisons as a voyeur. Falwell denied the report and has alleged Granda extorted the family, which Granda denied. Liberty claims Falwell crafted a “well-resourced exit strategy” from his role as president and chancellor at the school in the form of a lucrative 2019 employment agreement while withholding damaging information about the personal scandal that exploded into public view the following year. The agreement included a raise, which Falwell has said amounted to $250,000, and a $2.5 million severance package. The lawsuit demanding at least $10 million alleged Falwell breached fiduciary duties to the school and entered into a business conspiracy against it.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: New findings from an Oakland-based nonprofit that spent recent months analyzing Seattle’s 911 calls say up to half the calls city police receive can be responded to without armed, sworn officers. The Seattle Times reports police, while generally supportive of the findings, say they have questions about how realistic that number is. The report, published this week, is a result of part of Mayor Jenny Durkan’s plan, launched last year, to reimagine policing in Seattle. The National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform found at some point in the future, an “alternative, non-sworn response” could be appropriate for up to 49% of Seattle Police Department calls, or about 685,000 dispatch responses between 2017 and 2019. The institute also found about 80% of Seattle Police Department calls are noncriminal responses, though it noted that some calls not coded as a criminal incident might still involve some criminal behavior. As for shorter-term changes, the report noted about 12% of calls, including “person down” and low-priority welfare checks, “can and should be explored for alternative responses” in the near future.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: An airport serving the city will soon have a new name: West Virginia International Yeager Airport. The airport board approved the name change Wednesday, effective Jan. 1. The Charleston airport said the change to include “international” in the name is permitted with a U.S. Customs building at the airport that will be completed in December. Yeager is one of 31 commercial airports without a city, state or region in the name, the airport said in an email. There are only five states without an international airport, the email said. It is hoped the name change will help market the state to business and leisure travelers and attract future air service, the airport said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The number of new daily coronavirus cases reported in the state has surpassed 1,000 for the first time in months, fueled by the spread of the more contagious delta variant, health officials said Friday. The Wisconsin Department of Health reported 1,058 new cases of COVID-19 in the state Friday – the highest since April 8. The number of cases that stem from the delta variant has doubled. The seven-day average of daily cases in Wisconsin has increased for the 24th straight day. Wisconsin Department of Health Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk said vaccination against COVID-19 is key to stopping the virus’s spread. “The proportion of sequenced tests that are the delta variant is high in our state, and high throughout our country. We know the spread is related to that variant. And when we look at the data, it is important to remember that increased spread also increases the danger of new variants developing,” she said. More than 49% of Wisconsin residents have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and nearly 52% had received at least one dose as of Friday, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. From mid-July to Tuesday, statewide hospitalizations due to COVID-19 have increased 51%. Health officials say that number is expected to grow.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A public ceremony to commemorate the life of former U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi will be held Friday at the Gillette College Pronghorn Center, the Gillette Memorial Chapel announced. Enzi, a Wyoming Republican known as a consensus-builder in an increasingly polarized Washington, died last week after he broke his neck in a bicycle accident near his home in Gillette. He was 77. He served 24 years in the U.S. Senate, 10 years in the Wyoming Legislature and eight years as Gillette’s mayor. The ceremony is set to begin at 1 p.m. and will be officiated by Pastor Donavon Voigt of First Baptist Church. Instead of flowers, the funeral home suggests making donations to Project Mercy, an organization combatting poverty in Ethiopia; the Mike and Diana Enzi Scholarship Fund at the University of Wyoming; and the Wyoming Community Foundation Mike & Diana Enzi Charitable Fund.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/02"}]}

FBI agents searched the dumpster outside his house and found a military-style helmet, a mounting bracket used to attach a camera to the helmet and a GoPro camera.\n\n\"A search of the Defendant’s primary and secondary residences – that of his mother and father – also revealed the existence of a virtual arsenal of weapons, including bolt-action rifles, rifles, AR and AK-style weapons, and a bazooka,\" prosecutors said.\n\nMore:How did the FBI track down Jack Teixeira, who is charged with classified documents leak?\n\nTeixeira also appeared fixated on mass killings, according to prosecutors:\n\nIn November 2022, he said he would “kill a (expletive) ton of people” because it would be “culling the weak-minded.”\n\nIn February 2023, he told a social media user he was tempted to convert a specific type of minivan into an “assassination van.”\n\nIn February 2023, he sought advice from another social media user for what type of rifle would operate easily from the back of an SUV. He described how he would shoot in a “crowded urban or suburban environment.”\n\nFBI Special Agent Luke Church said in a court filing Teixeira used his government computer in July 2022 to search the following terms: “Ruby Ridge,” “Las Vegas shooting,” “Mandalay Bay shooting,” “Buffalo tops shooting,” and “Uvalde.” The searches were unrelated to his job, according to Church.\n\nTeixeira also represents a risk of fleeing country because he faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted and the loss of his military career, prosecutors said. He may still have access to a trove of classified documents that “would be of tremendous value to hostile nation states that could offer him safe harbor and attempt to facilitate his escape from the United States,” prosecutors said.\n\nMore:How Jack Teixeira, a 21-year-old guard leaked documents from deep inside the Pentagon\n\n“The Defendant has already proved himself to be untrustworthy. The Defendant has already proved himself to be a danger to the U.S. national security,” U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins said in a court filing to keep Teixeira detained. “And in light of the physical danger posed by the Defendant if released, there is simply no condition or combination of conditions that can be fashioned to adequately address and mitigate the risk posed by his release.”\n\nTeixeira's lawers: He represents no flight risk, owns guns legally\n\nTeixeira’s lawyers, public defenders Allen Franco and Brendan Kelley, argued that he should be released pending trial because he will be monitored by his parents and the military. Teixeira is still an active-duty airman first class, and a senior master sergeant has been designated to maintain regular contact with him, the lawyers said.\n\nTeixeira lived with his mother and stepfather, a veteran of the 102nd Intelligence Wing who retired after 34 years in the military. Teixeira was arrested without incident in his mother’s driveway.\n\n“This presence and compliance, despite the overt incentive to flee, is direct evidence that he poses no legitimate risk for nonappearance and noncompliance with court procedures,” the lawyers said.\n\nHis lawyers said Teixeira’s guns were stored so safely that federal agents needed a drill to get into the safe.\n\n“At the time of his arrest, Mr. Teixeira legally owned and stored firearms in a locked gun safe at his mother’s residence in compliance with his Massachusetts license to carry,” the lawyers said.\n\nThe lawyers suggested conditions on his release including confinement to his residence unless visiting relatives or work, no access to the internet and a $20,000 bond. The lawyers disputed the government’s accusation that a hostile government would seduce him to leave the United States.\n\n“If the Court finds that Mr. Teixeira currently poses a serious risk of flight or obstruction, he is still entitled to pretrial release because there are ample release conditions available to reasonably assure both his presence at trial and compliance with judicial procedures,” the lawyers said.\n\nJudge voices skepticism of defense arguments\n\nTeixeira entered the detention hearing in Worcester, Massachusetts, in orange prison garb. His handcuffs were removed before he sat down.\n\nHennessy voiced skepticism about defense arguments that Teixeira never intended for the classified documents to be distributed widely on the internet.\n\n“Somebody under the age of 30 has no idea that when they put something on the internet that it could end up anywhere in the world?” Hennessy asked. “Seriously?”\n\nNadine Pellegrini, chief of the national security division in the U.S. attorney’s office, told Hennessy the defendant’s threatening words and behavior were “not speculation.\"\n\n\"It is based on what we know to date,\" she said.\n\nPentagon suspends officials at Teixeira's base\n\nThe Air Force has suspended the top commander and two other officials at the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis Air National Guard Base where Teixeira served, according to Ann Stefanek, an Air Force spokesperson.\n\nThe Air Force has also temporarily removed the commanders’ access to classified systems.\n\nThe suspensions follow the opening of an Air Force inspector general's investigation of the leak of classified information by Teixeira.\n\nTeixeira had been called up to active duty in September along with other Guardsmen at the base. Airmen there help sift through the torrent of intelligence the Air Force collects by through spy drones and other aircraft.\n\nTeixeira’s job, essentially an IT tech for the intelligence, gave him access to the Pentagon’s internal computer systems, including one of the most sensitive. Known as the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System, or JWICS, it is essentially the Pentagon’s internet for classified documents.\n\nTeixeira would have had access to JWICS to help maintain it, not as an intelligence analyst, according to Scott Murray, a retired Air Force colonel and intelligence expert. Teixeira likely wouldn’t have had unfettered access to the most sensitive information such as the President’s Daily Brief, a distillation of the latest critical intelligence collected around the world.\n\nStill, Teixeira’s access allowed him to see – and pilfer – a trove of sensitive information, including daily battlefield updates and assessments of U.S. allies and adversaries. It’s estimated that hundreds of people inside the federal government, including contractors, have similar access.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/13/jack-teixeira-pentagon-leaks-documents-military/11658107002/", "title": "Who leaked the Pentagon documents?

Located in southeastern Massachusetts, the town is about a 30-minute drive from Providence, Rhode Island. His most recent address was also listed as the home of two adults in their 50s, most likely his parents.\n\nTeixeira is a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard and leader of the Discord group where more than 100 classified documents were leaked during the last few months.\n\nIn that Discord group, a popular chat app among gamers, called Thug Shaker Central, one individual leaked several classified documents that provided U.S. insight into the war in Ukraine and other military activities.\n\nPentagon document leak:Here are the biggest takeaways after U.S. military secrets leaked\n\nWhat Pentagon documents is Teixeira suspected of leaking?\n\nTeixeira is suspected of leaking hundreds of classified military documents to the Discord group. Members of the group told the New York Times and the Washington Post that they referred to the leader as \"O.G.\" but declined to identify him by name.\n\nThe Justice Department announced Saturday that it would be opening an investigation into the leak of the classified documents which were labeled secret and not for distribution to foreign governments. The documents provided specific details behind U.S. forces in the region and Ukraine's use of ammunition in the war.\n\nFollowing his arrest on Thursday, Teixeira was charged with alleged unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense information, Garland said.\n\nWhat was Jack Teixeira’s job in the military?\n\nTeixeira worked for the Massachusetts Air National Guard’s 102nd Intelligence Wing, which is located at the Otis Air National Guard Base in Cape Cod.\n\n“Our mission is to provide worldwide precision intelligence and command and control along with trained and experienced Airmen for expeditionary combat support and homeland security,” the wing’s website says.\n\nHis rank is Airman 1st Class, according to his military service record, a low rank. His job title is Cyber Transport Systems Journeymen, a job that requires repairing communication systems, according to the Air Force website.\n\nCould Jack Teixeira be tied to extremism?\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, experts were already suggesting Teixeira may have been influenced by right-wing extremism to take the actions he did.\n\nCiting the Washington Post reporting that a person it identified as the leak suspect can be seen in a video yelling ”a series of racial and antisemitic slurs into the camera,” Wendy Via and Heidi Beirich, co-founders of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, cautioned if investigators are correct and the leak came from inside the military “this should be a massive wake up call for the US government.”\n\n“There are infinite reasons why it's dangerous to have far-right, racist, and anti-government characters infiltrating the U.S. military, and national security is one of the most important,” Via and Beirich wrote in a statement.\n\nDaryl Johnson, a security consultant and former senior analyst for domestic terrorism at the Department of Homeland Security, agreed.\n\n“We've got counterintelligence threats because these people have clearances, which they should not have,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson cautioned Thursday that it was still unclear whether Teixeira had politically extremist views, but pointed to the Post’s reporting about the racist statements as strong evidence of a motive in leaking the documents.\n\n“It’s smoke at this point,” he said. “It’s not a fire.”\n\nWhat is the Discord group?\n\nThe Discord group consisted of around 20-30 members, most of which were young men and teenagers according to multiple media reports. Teixeira was the leader of the group and went by the handle “jackthedripper,” the Washington Post reported Thursday.\n\nThe group bonded over Discord during the pandemic when they were stuck at home and isolated from the outside world, according to the New York Times and the Washington Post. In the group, members shared racist memes and interests in guns and video games.\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/14/teixeira-leaks-pentagon-ukraine-arrest/11657137002/", "title": "Here's why the US can't stop military and intel members from leaking ...", "text": "First there was Army soldier Chelsea Manning, and after that intelligence contractors Edward Snowden and Reality Winner. All of them were 20-somethings charged with leaking highly classified documents they had access to as part of their government work and disclosing some of America's most closely guarded secrets.\n\nOn Thursday, federal authorities arrested yet another suspected young leaker of top-secret U.S. intelligence: Jack Teixeira, a low-ranking member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard.\n\nTeixeira, 21, is charged with the unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense information about the war in Ukraine and U.S. efforts to spy on its enemies and allies. The disclosures over the past week have exposed sensitive information about the U.S.-assisted war effort in Ukraine and the fragile wartime relationship between Washington and its allies.\n\nMore:Pentagon document leak: Here are the biggest takeaways after U.S. military secrets leaked\n\nTeixeira, an enlisted airman first class, is a member of the 102nd Intelligence Wing based in Cape Cod. Media reports say he posted the documents to an online group of young men and teenagers who came together over their shared love of weaponry, video games and racist online memes.\n\nWhy do these kinds of damaging intelligence leaks keep happening? And perhaps more important, what can the U.S. military and intelligence establishment do to prevent it from happening again?\n\nExperts, including former U.S. intelligence officials, told USA TODAY that there are no easy fixes to the problem. That's especially the case because of the vastness of the military and intelligence bureaucracy, which has millions of people – many of them independent contractors – with top-secret security clearances.\n\nAnd in a post-9/11 world where government agencies are required to share whatever they can with whomever they can, no amount of \"Insider Threat\" monitoring is bound to catch all wrongdoers, they said in interviews.\n\n\"It's a very complex system, so there are no simple solutions,\" said Glenn Gerstell, the National Security Agency's general counsel from 2015 to 2020. \"But maybe all those millions of people don't need access to everything the way we've got things going now.\"\n\nSimilarities between leakers\n\nAccording to military records, Teixeira joined the National Guard in 2019 and worked at Otis Air National Guard Base. His job title: cyber transport systems journeyman.\n\nTeixeira is awaiting a court appearance Friday in the case and has not entered a plea. But military security experts and former U.S. intelligence officials told USA TODAY there are many similarities between Teixeira and the other young \"grunts,\" or low-level operators and analysts who have been charged with stealing and leaking similarly classified documents.\n\nChelsea Manning was a 23-year-old Army intelligence analyst in 2010 when she stole and leaked more than 700,000 classified documents, including battlefield reports on Iraq and Afghanistan and State Department cables. Manning, who said she provided the documents to Wikileaks as a form of protest, was convicted and spent four years in prison before being pardoned by President Barack Obama.\n\nMore:Who leaked the Pentagon documents? What we know about Jack Teixeira, the suspected DOD leaker\n\nIn 2013, there was the case of 29-year-old Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency intelligence contractor in Hawaii who leaked a massive trove of classified documents that disclosed details about top-secret U.S. intelligence-gathering and surveillance programs. Snowden, who was charged under the Espionage Act, fled to Russia, where he lives today as a fugitive from U.S. justice. He has said he leaked the documents to protest U.S. domestic and foreign policy.\n\nIn 2017, 25-year-old Reality Leigh Winner, a linguist for an NSA intelligence contractor in Georgia, was arrested and charged with giving a media organization a classified U.S. government report about Russian hacking attempts that targeted U.S. voter registration information. She served about three years of her five-year prison sentence and was released in June 2021.\n\nIn the latest case, authorities have not said whether Teixeira is accused of leaking documents to make a political statement. A Pentagon spokesman, Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, declined to comment on case details at a press briefing, citing an ongoing Justice Department investigation.\n\nBut, Ryder, said, “this was a deliberate criminal act.\"\n\nTeixeira posted the documents to Discord, a social media and messaging platform popular among gamers, in an online group called Thug Shaker Central, according to The New York Times and The Washington Post.\n\nMembers of the group did not identify Teixeira by name but referred to the person posting dozens of top-secret documents in recent months as OG, their de facto leader, the reports said. Some said he might have been doing it simply to share – and show off – the secrets he knew to a small circle of online friends who bonded over video games.\n\nAccording to The Times, \"One of the friends said the O.G. had access to intelligence documents through his job.\"\n\nWhat has been done to catch leakers?\n\nAfter each of the cases, authorities have promised to crack down on leaks. That has included stricter controls over who has access to intelligence, and what some people can download or print from certain government computers, according to Gerstell and Gavin Wilde, a former senior information security official at the NSA and the National Security Council in the White House.\n\nIn the current case, the documents in question – some of them posted on Twitter – appear to be photocopies of printed documents, according to a USA TODAY review of some of them.\n\nPeriodically, authorities also have beefed up \"Insider Threat\" programs at their respective agencies that are designed to catch disgruntled employees who might want to steal information and weaponize it for financial or political gain.\n\nOne problem is that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which has oversight of all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies, has little ability to curtail information-sharing between or within agencies. In fact, its job is to promote such liaisons.\n\nGiven the patchwork of big and small military and intelligence units, it's impossible to take a 'one size fits all' approach to the problem, Wilde told USA TODAY.\n\nAs a result, efforts to actually stop classified information theft at the source, including scrutinizing who is actually downloading electronic documents or printing them out, have been done only in fits and starts and not on a mass scale, said Wilde, a senior fellow in the Technology and International Affairs Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"We can track a terrorist across the globe pretty seamlessly by now, but we don't have a very good way of saying, 'Hey, why are you printing out so much stuff when your title doesn't seem to denote that you need to be doing that?' \" Wilde said. \"There's probably major investments that should have gone into being able to track and adjudicate print privileges and to throw up other red flags.\"\n\nWell-meaning changes with dangerous consequences\n\nGerstell said two of the main reasons there are gaping holes in the information security apparatus began with intelligence-sharing reforms that were instituted years ago and with the best of intentions.\n\nOne came in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, and the failure of U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies to \"connect the dots\" and uncover the plot beforehand.\n\n\"We never wanted to be in a position again where we looked back and said, 'Oh, we knew this information but we couldn't access it and therefore, some terrible accident or disaster has occurred,' \" Gerstell said.\n\nThat fear infused the government at all levels with the mandate to share intelligence wherever possible, including widely disseminating the kind of top-secret warfighter intelligence that was posted online in recent months.\n\nThe second change, Gerstell said, came after the Iraq War underscored problems with faulty intelligence analysis. The Pentagon, CIA and other agencies sought to bend over backward to share not only the information they were getting, he said, but also how they were getting it and what it meant.\n\n\"But you put these two things together and you wind up in a situation where we've enabled seemingly lower-level people to have access to a great amount of information while giving lip service to the need-to-know principle\" necessary for protecting classified information, he said.\n\nUsing intel to gain online respect\n\nThe documents posted to the private online Discord community were discussed online but were meant to be purely informative, members of Thug Shaker Central told The New York Times. It reported that while many of the documents were related to the war in Ukraine, the group's members said they took no side in the conflict.\n\nThe documents began to get wider attention only when one of the teenage members posted some to a public online forum. From there they were picked up by Russian-language Telegram channels, The Times reported.\n\nJames Ivory, a Virginia Tech professor who monitors the intersection of social media, video gaming and international intelligence, said the news reports – if true – underscore the virtually impossible task of monitoring the online activities of young military service members.\n\n\"The defense community has no small number of people working in roles where they are far removed from the battlefield but have access to classified information that will gain them authority and credibility among others fascinated with the military, including gamers\" like those on Discord, Ivory told USA TODAY.\n\n\"The temptation for young people with security access to leverage their knowledge as a way to gain cachet among military-interested communities will continue to be a common risk in online communities,\" Ivory said.\n\nAfter latest leak, are there more to come?\n\nWith Teixeira in custody and awaiting a court appearance, experts said it's unlikely that more of them will be posted given his arrest Thursday afternoon. But many of them could have been shared beforehand.\n\nGarland said little beyond the immediate charges facing Teixeira at a brief news conference Thursday at Justice Department headquarters.\n\nRyder, the Pentagon spokesman, also did not discuss details of the case but said that stringent guidelines are in place to protect classified information and that the whole system is under review.\n\nAsked why such a junior member of a National Guard unit might have access to such top-secret material, Ryder would not comment on Teixeira.\n\nBut, he said, “we entrust our members with a lot of responsibility at a very early age. Think about a young combat platoon sergeant and the responsibility and trust that we put into those individuals to lead troops into combat.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/26/pentagon-leak-suspect-threat-access-info/11749894002/", "title": "Pentagon leak suspect may still have access to secret info: Feds", "text": "Alanna Durkin Richer and Eric Tucker\n\nAssociated Press\n\nFederal prosecutors will urge a judge Thursday to keep behind bars a Massachusetts Air National guardsman accused of leaking highly classified military documents, arguing he may still have access to secret national defense information he could expose.\n\nIn court papers filed late Wednesday, the Justice Department lawyers said releasing 21-year-old Jack Teixeira from jail while he awaits trial would be a grave threat to the U.S. national security. Investigators are still trying to determine whether he kept any physical or digital copies of classified information, including files that haven’t already surfaced publicly, they wrote.\n\n“There simply is no condition or combination of conditions that can ensure the Defendant will not further disclose additional information still in his knowledge or possession,” prosecutors wrote. “The damage the Defendant has already caused to the U.S. national security is immense. The damage the Defendant is still capable of causing is extraordinary.”\n\nA detention hearing is scheduled for Thursday in the federal court in Worcester, Massachusetts, for Teixeira, who has been in jail since his arrest earlier this month on charges stemming from the highest-profile intelligence leak in years.\n\nProsecutors said in their filing that Teixeira’s attorneys have indicated they will urge the judge to release him to his father’s home. As of late Wednesday, Teixeira’s attorneys hadn’t filed court papers arguing for his release.\n\nTeixeira has been charged under the Espionage Act with unauthorized retention and transmission of classified national defense information. He has not yet entered a plea, and his attorney declined after last week’s hearing to speak to reporters.\n\nHe is accused of distributing highly classified documents about top national security issues in a chat room on Discord, a social media platform that started as a hangout for gamers. The leak stunned military officials, sparked international uproar and raised fresh questions about America’s ability to safeguard its secrets.\n\nLEAKED PENTAGON DOCUMENTS:Air National Guardsman arrested; Jack Teixeira expected in court Friday\n\nIn describing Teixeira as a danger to the community, prosecutors wrote that the suspect, who owned multiple guns, repeatedly had “detailed and troubling discussions about violence and murder” on the platform where authorities say he shared the documents. In February, he told another person that he was tempted to make a minivan into an “assassination van,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nProsecutors also disclosed that Teixeira was suspended during high school when a classmate overheard him discussing Molotov cocktails and other weapons and racial threats.\n\nProsecutors alleged in their filing that Teixeira took steps to destroy evidence after news outlets began reporting on the documents leak. Authorities who searched a dumpster at his home found a smashed laptop, tablet and Xbox gaming console, they said.\n\nTeixeira’s detention hearing was supposed to be last week but was delayed at the last minute after defense attorneys said they needed more time to “address the issues presented by the government’s request for detention.” Teixeira, who has been in jail since his April 13 arrest, did briefly appear in court in Boston last week to waive his right to a preliminary hearing.\n\nThe leaked documents appear to detail U.S. and NATO aid to Ukraine and U.S. intelligence assessments regarding U.S. allies that could strain ties with those nations. Some show real-time details from February and March of Ukraine’s and Russia’s battlefield positions and precise numbers of battlefield gear lost and newly flowing into Ukraine from its allies.\n\nAuthorities have not disclosed an alleged motive. Members of the Discord group have described Teixeira as someone looking to show off, rather than being motivated by a desire to inform the public about U.S. military operations or to influence American policy.\n\nThe Justice Department has said its investigation is continuing, and the Pentagon has said it would conduct its own review of access to sensitive intelligence to prevent a similar leak in the future.\n\nBilling records the FBI obtained from Discord were among the things that led authorities to Teixeira, who enlisted in the Air National Guard in September 2019.\n\nPENTAGON DOCUMENTS:What we know about Jack Teixeira, the suspected DOD leaker\n\nHis specialty in the Air National Guard was as a “cyber transport systems specialist,” essentially an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks. In that role, Teixeira would have had a higher level of security clearance because he would have also been tasked with responsibility to access and ensure protection for the network, a defense official told the AP.\n\nInvestigators say Teixeira was the leader of an online private chat group on Discord called Thug Shaker Central, where enthusiasts talked about their favorite types of guns, shared jokes and held a running discussion on wars that included talk of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA Discord user told the FBI that a username linked to Teixeira began posting what appeared to be classified information roughly in December.\n\nTeixeira was detected on April 6 — the day The New York Times first published a story about the breach of documents — searching for the word “leak” in a classified system, according to court papers. The FBI says that was reason to believe Teixeira was trying to find information about the investigation into who was responsible for the leaks.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/28/jack-teixeira-security-clearance/11751171002/", "title": "How did Jack Teixeira, the military leaker, get a security clearance?", "text": "Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts Air National guardsman accused of leaking highly classified military documents, said in November 2022 that if he had his way, he would kill a \"ton of people” because it would be “culling the weak minded,\" according to a new Justice Department motion in the case.\n\nIn February 2023, Teixeira allegedly told someone on social media that he was tempted to make a specific type of minivan into an “assassination van,” the Justice Department said.\n\nAnd a few years earlier, Teixeira \"was suspended in high school based on concerning comments (he) made about Molotov cocktails and other weapons,\" the motion said.\n\nBut if he was such a danger to the public, experts are asking, why did Teixeira get a top-secret security clearance?

He noted that the Justice Department also said Teixeira was denied an application for a firearms identification card because of local police department concerns.\n\n\"But that didn’t hold up his (top-secret) TS/SCI clearance,\" Strzok said. \"No senior leader in DOD should sleep easy tonight. If this obviously unsuitable behavior got through the background investigation process, how many other unidentified security clearance issues remain out there?\"\n\nA TS/SCI clearance, short for Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information, is one of the highest U.S. military and intelligence security clearances available. Teixeira reportedly had one because of his job in IT and his past work at Fort Bragg, where he probably had access to the military's Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System.\n\nTeixeira has been charged with the unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national defense information about the war in Ukraine and U.S. efforts to spy on its enemies and allies. The disclosures exposed the fragile wartime relationship between Washington and its allies.\n\nAn airman first class, Teixeira joined the Air National Guard in September 2019. Until his arrest April 13, he worked at Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts.\n\nOn Thursday, Magistrate Judge David Hennessy said he would make no immediate decision on whether to release Teixeira into home confinement and returned Teixeira to lockup. He has yet to enter a plea in the case.\n\nThe Pentagon's response\n\nUnder the current system, background checks are conducted by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, according to Mark Zaid, a Washington attorney who specializes in security clearances.\n\nThe Pentagon has disclosed few specifics of what it knows about the Teixeira case and whether background investigators took appropriate steps to review his background.\n\nOn Thursday, Pentagon chief spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said he couldn’t comment specifically on the new revelations, citing the Justice Department investigation.\n\nBut he said the Pentagon has a continuous vetting process for those in the military holding a security clearance that includes “near real-time monitoring” that is supported by automated record checks that pull data from data sources that include criminal, financial and public records.\n\nThe security clearance investigation also includes \"a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept ... where you are interviewed, friends, family, acquaintances are interviewed,\" Ryder told reporters.\n\n“But in terms of individual searches and what those are and the context of what those searches may be and why, it's important to obviously look at each of those cases individually, and as it relates to this airman, that's something that the investigation will have to tell us,” Ryder said.\n\n“As you've heard us say,” Ryder added, \"the department is looking not only at our intelligence processes and procedures as it relates to security or sensitive information and who has that information but also looking at the process by which we clear and vet individuals for security clearances.”\n\nWho leaked the Pentagon documents?

Those cases raised questions about the effectiveness of the background screenings and whether authorities were properly monitoring them for signs of trouble.\n\nSuch warning signs, many of which authorities say Teixeira has demonstrated, include inappropriate and potentially violent social media postings and personal interactions with other people.\n\nBut problems remain in the system, according to experts such as Glenn Gerstell, general counsel for the National Security Agency from 2015 to 2020.\n\n“The Teixeira case shows, once again, how difficult it is to rigorously vet people who are going to be entrusted with classified secrets,\" Gerstell said.\n\nGerstell said one especially thorny problem is that background check investigators must not violate civil liberties safeguards.\n\nThe allegations in the Justice Department filing indicate that the government needs to do a more effective job in uncovering some of the other factors that don’t directly relate to traditional counterintelligence threats, Gerstell said. \"It’s a really tough problem – uncovering misfits, as opposed to traditional concerns over foreign powers.\"\n\nHe noted that it’s especially difficult to uncover social media posts that might reveal concerns.\n\n\"We can probably balance civil liberties and due process and privacy on one hand with being a little more vigilant and vigorous in this area of vetting and screening people and watching them,\" Gerstell said. \"And if you're going to get a job in this area, that's the price you're going to pay – you're going to be subject to a heightened level of scrutiny. And if you don't like it, don't take the job.\"\n\nExtensive vetting is supposed to happen. But did it?\n\nTeixeira would have been subject to extensive vetting to receive his security clearance to work at the 102nd Intelligence Wing, said retired Air Force Lt. Gen. L. Scott Rice, who led the Massachusetts National Guard and, at the Pentagon, the Air National Guard.\n\nScreeners would have interviewed people who knew him and asked those people for more references on him, Rice said. That Teixeira had a stepfather in the military probably would have been viewed favorably.\n\nTeixeira would need the clearance to work on the computer hardware and software needed at Otis to help Air Force analysts sort through intelligence data – poring over video collected from spy planes, for instance – that flowed in from around the world, Rice said.\n\n“They need to boil down data into manageable, understandable information,” Rice said, “something actionable for decision-makers.”\n\nTeixeira would have worked in the background. “This guy was a kind of tech, making sure things work right,” Rice said. The military depends on thousands of young, trained personnel with high-tech skills to work in the “vault” where secret information is processed.\n\nHe would have had access to the system but had no business rifling through reports, Rice said.\n\nAir Force investigators and the FBI will now be tasked with determining what was missed in screening Teixeira, Rice said. The suspension of senior commanders in the 102nd Intelligence signals that some steps were missed.\n\n“Pure speculation, but there may have been a deviation from procedure,” Rice said.\n\nGaps in the clearance system\n\nZaid was one of several experts who told USA TODAY that gaps remain, especially when it comes to young military personnel.\n\n\"Generally, when conducting a security clearance background investigation, the government does not look before the individual's 18th birthday, unless – as in Teixeira's case – the individual needed to show two years of prior education.\"\n\nZaid said Teixeira's case underscores how new policies need to require that applicants reveal all social media usernames on their security background questionnaires. What's more, he said, the federal government should consider monitoring publicly available online postings by clearance holders.\n\n“The security clearance process isn’t going to catch anything and everything, but there are real questions here about the sufficiency of what was done,\" said Bradley Moss, another Washington lawyer who specializes in matters involving security clearances for military and intelligence officials.\n\nOne of the most significant red flags in the new court filing, Moss noted, was that Teixeira apparently was suspended in high school because of violent commentary, something his lawyers argue was known about and vetted before he got his security clearance.\n\n\"How much of the details were vetted by the Air Force, and did it require a supplemental mental health evaluation to assess the issue?\" Moss asked. \"Did the Air Force speak with relevant friends and associates about Teixeira's personal behavior in the context of that incident? These are basic investigative steps that are supposed to be taken.”\n\nFollow Josh Meyer on Twitter at @JoshMeyerDC", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/04/28/robert-rundo-rise-above-movement-arrested-in-romania/11753628002/", "title": "Robert Rundo, wanted in white supremacist rallies, arrested in Europe", "text": "Tucker Carlson, a leading amplifier of far-right extremist conspiracy theories to mainstream audiences, has parted ways with Fox News.

Pearson ...", "text": "Melissa Brown\n\nNashville Tennessean\n\nTen days after a shooter unloaded 152 rounds at a Nashville school and killed six people, Tennessee House Republicans on Thursday expelled from the General Assembly two Democratic lawmakers for breaking House rules and mounting a gun-reform protest on the chamber's floor.\n\nAfter hours of fiery debate, the House expelled Reps. Justin Jones, D-Nashville, on a 72-25 vote, and Rep. Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, 69-26, in a move that put the nation's eyes on Tennessee and its politics.\n\nBut the House failed to achieve the two-thirds majority needed to kick Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, out of the chamber. The effort to expel Johnson failed on a 65-30 vote, as chants \"Gloria! Gloria!\" rang out in the House chamber.\n\nThe historic, party-line expulsion process has roiled political tensions as the state continues to grapple with the deadliest school shooting in its history. The debate drew widespread attention beyond Tennessee, with the nation's eyes on the Volunteer State and thousands of protesters objecting to the expulsion.\n\nTennessee three:What to know about the House Democrats targeted for expulsion by Republicans\n\nWith the expulsions, Republicans removed two of the youngest Black lawmakers in the General Assembly, further reducing an already small minority caucus.\n\nStill, with the expulsions, Republican leadership have elevated the two lawmakers’ political profiles, possibly with little long-term gains for the chamber as Pearson and Jones could be reappointed to their seats within days or weeks.\n\n\"What is happening here today is a farce of democracy,\" Jones said at the beginning of his 20-minute defense, after gazing up at a packed gallery holding signs in his defense. \"What is happening here today is a situation in which the jury has already publicly announced the verdict. What we see today is just a spectacle. What we see today is a lynch mob assembled to not lynch me, but our democratic process.\"\n\nJones at one point took a long pause, taking a few sips of water, allowing the chants of \"whose house, our house,\" to flow into the chamber from the crowd gathered outside.\n\n\"Your extreme measure is an attempt to subvert the will of voters who democratically elected us as representatives to speak and to passionately fight for them,\" Jones said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a statement on Thursday night: \"Today’s expulsion of lawmakers who engaged in peaceful protest is shocking, undemocratic, and without precedent. Rather than debating the merits of the issue, these Republican lawmakers have chosen to punish, silence, and expel duly-elected representatives of the people of Tennessee.\"\n\nStay in the conversation on politics:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nThe expulsions for the two were effective immediately, leading Jones to gather his personal items from his desk. He later took a seat in the House gallery, now as a member of the public watching the legislative hearing below him.Lawmakers considered the fate of the three Democrats steps away from hundreds of protesters whose chants permeated the House doors, while more than 200 people stood in silence in the House galleries, many holding signs decrying the proceedings. Protesters continued to call on Republican lawmakers to pass gun reform and slammed the efforts to expel the lawmakers, who have been dubbed the \"Tennessee three.\"\n\nThe trio was accused of breaching decorum and floor rules for speaking at the House podium on March 30 without recognition.\n\nPearson and Jones, both freshman lawmakers who had previously clashed with leadership on other issues this session, walked up to the House podium during a floor session and using a bullhorn began leading gun reform chants, echoing the shouts of protesters packed into the Capitol rotunda. The pair, later flanked by Johnson, grew frustrated as House leadership moved on to regular business just days after the mass shooting.\n\nHouse Republicans showed a video montage of the events during the expulsion debate, over the objections of Democrats. The video included footage taken from the House floor by a lawmaker, and Democrats accused Republicans of breaking House rules forbidding members from recording floor sessions. The debate then centered on whether the House was formally in session at the time the lawmaker took the video.\n\n“This is just not about one specific instance or one specific rule that may have been broken. The rules here are for order,” said Rep. Johnny Garrett, R-Goodlettsville, who led the GOP arguments against Jones. “We owe that to the constituents that we represent across this state.”\n\nThe expulsions will strip more than 200,000 Tennesseans of their elected representation and marks just the fourth time since the end of the Civil War in which the House ousted sitting lawmakers. No House member has ever been removed from elected office for simply violating decorum rules.\n\nAfter relieving the lawmakers of committee assignments and shutting off their building access over the weekend, the Republican supermajority moved swiftly Monday to start the expulsion process, among the first legislative actions taken by the General Assembly related to the March 27 mass shooting that killed six, including three 9-year-olds.\n\nSarah Neumann, the mom to a 5-year-old who attends The Covenant School, watched the expulsion hearings from the House gallery. Pearson at one point went upstairs to give her a hug.\n\n\"I just want Noah to know I did something for him,\" she said, noting she wanted to come to the Capitol to honor the Covenant victims Katherine Koonce, Mike Hill, Cynthia Peak, Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney, and she thinks of the shooter's family as well.\n\nThousands of Tennesseans have marched en masse on the state Capitol three times in the 10 days since the tragedy, demanding gun reform measures the ruling party is hesitant, if not outright opposed, to publicly support.\n\nCovenant School shooting in Nashville:3 children, 3 adults dead; victims' names released\n\nPearson later said he could not \"sit idly by\" after lawmakers that day walked through a gauntlet of protesters, many of whom were teenagers, screaming for gun reform.\n\n\"If this House decides to expel me for exercising our sacred First Amendment right to help elevate the voices in our community who want to see us act to prevent gun violence, then do as you feel you must,\" Pearson told his colleagues in a Monday letter. \"We must always stand up for what we believe to be right and just, we must say no to more gun violence. We must prioritize the voices of thousands of families that are hurting due to this country's gun violence epidemic, especially in communities like District 86.\"\n\nThe trio were not recognized to speak, an official breach of floor rules, which led House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, to recess the House and huddle with leadership for nearly an hour. Democratic leadership led the three off the floor, and they later continued on with House business. But within days the lawmakers were stripped of their committee assignments and lost badge access to the legislative office building.\n\nSexton later likened the events to an \"insurrection,\" even comparing the peaceful protest that resulted in zero arrests to the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol. Though he later walked back the comments, saying his remarks were directed at the three lawmakers and not protesters. Sexton this week said he considered the unprecedented floor protest an act \"against civil authority.\"\n\n\"What they did was try to hold up the people's business on the House floor instead of doing it the way that they should have done it, which they have the means to do,\" Sexton said. \"They actually thought that they would be arrested, and so they decided that them being a victim was more important than focusing on the six victims from Monday. And that's appalling.\"\n\nGOP wields supermajority power\n\nThe Thursday vote was widely viewed as a certainty as soon as the Republican caucus voted to file expulsion resolutions. For some, the partisan expulsions are a stark reminder of the supermajority power Republicans have amassed over the state's Democratic, urban areas.\n\n“I'm devastated. I am,” said protester Ashley Anderson, rain dripping off her hood as she stood in line to enter the Capitol. “There's so many emotions that go into how I feel about it. It's really hard to put words to it that this. It's fascist. It is undemocratic. You're leaving 200,000 constituents of the state without any representation. What is this? This is our freedom at stake.“\n\nJones' removal would mark the third major circumvention of Nashville voters in the last year, after an aggressive congressional redistricting effort in 2022 split Davidson County and parceled its majority-Democratic voter base into Republican-held districts. More recently, infuriated after the Nashville council blocked a bid to host the Republican Nashville Convention, lawmakers drew up multiple bills to shrink the Metro Council and snatch back control of governing boards such as the local airport and sports authorities.\n\nIn General Assembly history, a partisan expulsion vote like Thursday's is unusual, and an expulsion push over a decorum breach is unprecedented.\n\nEmotions ran high on Thursday morning after Jones opposed a school safety bill presented by Republicans, arguing it would further militarize schools while not addressing gun reform issues. Other Democrats said they were concerned the bill treats the \"symptoms\" of school shootings, not the problem.\n\n“That’s what is supposed to happen on this House floor when we debate legislation. We hear each other, we don’t hear the hate, we don’t hear the vitriol. It worked today, it can work for the future,” Garrett said. “One week ago, it didn’t work. One week ago we had members take it upon themselves to rush the well and stop the people’s business.\n\nGarrett said the protest, by shutting down the work of the House, “silenced 7 million” Tennesseans. Protesters in the gallery shook their heads as he spoke.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Karen Camper, D-Memphis, defended her colleagues.\n\n\"Rep. Jones represents thousands of people in this state whose voices have been silenced time and time and time again,\" she said. \"We had just had this mass shooting, and he only wanted to elevate the voices of those people. For a simple rule violation, we have elevated this to the highest level of admonishment. That’s not democracy.\"\n\nPast expulsions bipartisan votes\n\nThe House last expelled a sitting lawmaker in 2016, when the chamber voted 70-2 to remove then-Rep. Jeremy Durham, R-Franklin, over allegations he had harassed nearly two dozen women while in office. In 1980, then-Rep. Robert Fisher was expelled on a 92-1 vote after a bribery conviction.\n\nSix lawmakers were ousted during an 1866 special session after they tried to prevent Tennessee from ratifying an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to provide citizenship to former slaves.\n\nThe Senate expelled a member for the first time last year following the conviction of Sen. Katrina Robinson, D-Memphis, on federal wire fraud charges.\n\nAn ethics committee was convened to investigate Robinson's case before it was brought to a vote, which Bruce Oppenheimer, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, said is typical procedure. Special committees took up the Durham and Fisher cases.\n\nJohnson this week decried the expulsion as a double-standard and politically motivated. Last year, former House Speaker Glen Casada, R-Franklin, faced federal charges related to alleged crimes committed while in office was allowed to finish out his term, while current leadership in 2019 declined to support expulsion charges against former Rep. David Byrd, who was accused of sexually assaulting teenagers when he was a basketball coach decades earlier.\n\nLawmakers have contentious history with the three\n\nAll three lawmakers have at times publicly clashed with Republican leadership prior to The Covenant School shooting.\n\nWhile Jones is a freshman lawmaker, he is no stranger to the Capitol and led public protests against the lawmakers who later became his colleagues. In 2019, he led sit-ins to call for the removal of the bust of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from the Capitol, and was once arrested for tossing liquid at the former House speaker.\n\nRep. Gloria Johnson:'I wouldn't be here today' under current abortion ban\n\nJohnson was first elected to her Knoxville district in 2012 after retiring from teaching. After losing a reelection campaign twice to a Republican opponent, she won the seat back in 2018 and last year won election in a new district after redistricting.\n\nShe's long been an outspoken Democrat, particularly decrying Tennessee's no-exceptions abortion ban in recent months.\n\nPearson joined the legislature via appointment, following the death of Rep. Barbara Cooper, D-Memphis, last fall. Like Jones, the 28-year-old rose through local advocacy circles, co-founding a grassroots organization now credited with stopping a proposed crude oil pipeline from cutting through South Memphis backyards.\n\nHouse Republicans publicly scolded Pearson after he wore a traditional West African dashiki on the House floor on his first day in office.\n\nThe path forward\n\nDespite the high-profile expulsions, the three could technically return to the House within days.\n\nThe Tennessee Constitution allows a county governing body to appoint an interim representative in the case of a vacancy, an authority General Assembly Republicans could not easily revoke.\n\nAn expulsion does not disqualify a former representative from running for office, which could mean one of the expelled lawmakers could be appointed interim, run for reelection and be reseated in the General Assembly within months.\n\nRep. Gino Bulso, R-Brentwood, repeatedly stated Jones wanted to be expelled, but noted the Constitution would allow him to elected again after expulsion. “If after looking at his conduct, they vote he come back, we will recognize him as a representative,” Bulso said, referring to the floor protest as a \"mutiny.\"\n\nMore:What happens when Tennessee House members get expelled? Here are some answers\n\nThe trio has demurred this week on future plans, instead choosing to focus on the upcoming expulsion vote. Johnson on Monday indicated she was consulting with lawyers, though one attorney said pursuing a lawsuit could be an uphill battle given as the state Constitution gives the legislature express authority to discipline and expel its own members.\n\n\"Ultimately, it falls under the separation of powers,\" attorney David Raybin said. \"The constitution prevents the legislature from interfering too much with the courts. Similarly, the constitution prevents the courts from interfering with the inner-workings of the legislature. A court would decline to review that.”\n\nVivian Jones, Nicole Hester, Angele Latham, Katherine Burgess and Tyler Whetstone contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/04/12/tennessee-three-second-expelled-lawmaker-could-return-after-removal/11641568002/", "title": "Second of two Tennessee lawmakers expelled by Republican ...", "text": "Justin Pearson, one of two Black Democratic state legislators whose expulsion earlier this month by Tennessee’s Republican-led House provoked a national backlash, was reappointed Wednesday to his seat in the state’s House of Representatives.\n\nSeven of Shelby County's attending commissioners unanimously voted for Pearson, D-Memphis, to fill the interim seat in Tennessee's District 86.\n\nWith the vote, Pearson will join Rep. Justin Jones, D-Nashville, who returned to the House Monday backed by Nashville’s Metro Council. Both had been removed for leading gun-reform protests on the chamber floor following last month’s mass shooting at a Nashville elementary school.\n\nCommissioner Erika Sugarmon praised Pearson after the vote.\n\n\"My heart is singing,\" the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported Sugarmon as saying. \"You belong on the national level. … We need you here right now in this moment to continue the fight in Nashville. It’s not going to end today or tomorrow. It’s a journey.”\n\nPearson told those assembled after the vote that \"we do not speak alone.\"\n\n\"We speak together,\" he said. \"We fight together. So, a message for all the people in Nashville who decided to expel us: You can’t expel hope. You cant expel our voice. You sure can’t expel our fight.\"\n\nPosts on social media showed hundreds of marchers accompanying Pearson, his fist pumping in the air, as he headed from Memphis' National Civil Rights Museum through downtown toward Wednesday's special session at the county administration building.\n\nWhy were the lawmakers expelled?\n\nHundreds had assembled in the House galleries on March 30 to demand gun reform after six people, including three students, were fatally shot at The Covenant School in Nashville, the Volunteer State’s deadliest school shooting.\n\nBoth Pearson and Jones, who are Black, had employed bullhorns during the protest and were expelled for violating House decorum. Along with Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, the so-called “Tennessee Three” had come under fire for approaching the podium in session without being recognized.\n\nOn April 6, the House Republican supermajority removed Jones by a 72-25 vote and Pearson by a 69-26 vote after hours of rancorous debate. Johnson, who is white, avoided expulsion by one vote.\n\nMonday, Nashville’s progressive-leaning council, responsible for filling Jones’ vacancy, voted to reappoint him to his seat on an interim basis pending a special election. Hundreds of cheering supporters likewise flanked Jones as he returned to the Capitol shortly afterward to be sworn in.\n\nSenators call for DOJ investigation\n\nThe expulsions had sparked broad national fallout, prompting a reaction from President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and the NAACP, which framed the incident as “horrific (but) not surprising…. Especially, in the South.”\n\nIn his defense prior to his expulsion, Jones called the process “a farce of democracy.”\n\nWednesday, Sen. Raphael Warnock and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter Wednesday to Attorney General Merrick Garland urging the Department of Justice to investigate the expulsion of two Black lawmakers from the Tennessee General Assembly.\n\nThe letter, also signed by Sens. Chris Murphy, Alex Padilla, and Brian Schatz, asked Garland “to use all available legal authorities” to determine whether the expulsion of state Reps.

President Joe Biden spoke by phone with the ousted lawmakers and Vice President Kamala Harris visited them in Nashville. The NAACP described the ousters as \"horrific (but) not surprising.\"\n\n\"Extremist legislators, funded by corporate interests, have a history of undermining our democracy and failing to protect their constituents – especially in the South,\" the NAACP said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that Republicans may think they won in Tennessee, \"but their fascism is only further radicalizing and awakening an earthquake of young people, both in the South and across the nation.\"\n\nWhy were Tennessee Democrats being expelled?\n\nJones, Pearson and, Johnson dubbed the \"Tennessee three,\" faced expulsion for protesting over gun reform after three students and three staff members of The Covenant School were killed in a shooting in the school on March 27. Three days later, Jones and Pearson approached the House podium without being recognized, a breach of chamber rules. They led protesters in the galleries in several chants calling for gun reform.\n\n\"Their actions are and will always be unacceptable, and they break several rules of decorum and procedure on the House floor,\" Sexton claimed days later in a social media post. \"Their actions and beliefs that they could be arrested on the House floor were an effort, unfortunately, to make themselves the victims.\"\n\nJohnson has suggested race was likely a factor on why Jones and Pearson were ousted.\n\n“I don’t think there’s a question how those two young, Black men were spoken to was in a different manner than the way I was spoken to,\" she said.\n\nBut GOP leaders have said Johnson's actions were less egregious – she was a less-active participant and had not used a megaphone. They said the expulsions had nothing to do with race but were necessary to avoid setting a precedent that lawmakers’ disruptions of House proceedings would be tolerated.\n\n'WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIX IT':Why lawmakers see no chance of major gun law changes after Nashville\n\nSTAY IN THE CONVERSATION:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/10/justin-jones-reinstated-following-expulsion-tennessee-house-representatives/70099905007/", "title": "Justin Jones returns to state legislature after unanimous Nashville ...", "text": "Justin Jones became the first Tennessee House representative to be expelled for breaking decorum rules on April 6 for leading a chant for gun reform on the floor of the House chamber.\n\nNashville's council is responsible for appointing an interim representative to fill the vacancy for the District 52 House seat until a special election is held.\n\nJustin Pearson, D-Memphis, was also expelled for his role in the protest.

Justin Jones left the Tennessee Capitol on April 6, expelled from the House of Representatives for leading a gun-control protest from the floor following a deadly Nashville school shooting. On Monday, hundreds of jubilant supporters marched alongside him as he walked up the Capitol steps to take back his seat.\n\n\"I want to welcome the people back to the people's house.

The House supermajority expelled Jones and Pearson after hours of fierce debate, but failed by one vote to achieve the two-thirds majority needed to oust Johnson.\n\nNashville's progressive-leaning council, responsible for filling the Nashville vacancy, unanimously voted Jones back into the District 52 House seat Monday afternoon in a move intended to send \"a strong message to our state government and across the country that we will not tolerate threats to our democracy,\" Council member Delishia Porterfield said.\n\nJones will serve as an interim representative until a special election can be held to permanently fill the position. He is eligible to run for reelection.\n\nPearson joined Jones and the throng of supporters on the short walk from the historic Metro Nashville Courthouse to the Capitol steps, where Jones picked up a megaphone.\n\n\"Today we sent a clear message to Speaker Cameron Sexton that the people will not allow his crimes against democracy to happen without challenge,\" he said. \"This is not about one person. It's not about one position. It's about a movement of people empowered to restore the soul of what this building should represent and that is democracy.\"\n\nChancellor I'Ashea L. Myles led Jones in his oath on the steps of the Capitol as cheers erupted from the crowd. When he was done, Jones raised his fist into the air.\n\nMinutes later, Jones walked arm-in-arm with Johnson back into the chamber to raucous cheers from supporters in the galleries. He took his seat just after the House gaveled into session. He had not missed any bill votes since his expulsion Thursday.\n\nSexton, R-Crossville, who was among those leading the charge for the trio's expulsion, called on Jones to speak soon after he reclaimed his seat.\n\n“Today, 78,000 people have a voice in this chamber once again,” Jones said. \"No expulsion, no attempt to silence us will stop us, but only galvanize and strengthen our movement. We continue to show up in the people's house. Power to the people!\"\n\nSexton gaveled onlookers in the gallery to order twice before Jones finished his speech.\n\nIn Shelby County, at least one of 13 county commissioners has vowed to similarly reappoint Pearson to his house seat. The commission will meet Wednesday to consider the matter.\n\n'Give them their voice back'\n\nEarlier Monday afternoon, six red and black ribbons affixed to the Nashville Council clerk's desk memorialized the three children and three adults killed in the Covenant School shooting. Nashville Mayor John Cooper opened the special-called meeting with incisive remarks.\n\n\"This afternoon's vote is unprecedented, but so was the action taken to expel members of the legislature,\" Cooper said. \"Voters in District 52 elected Justin Jones to be their voice in the statehouse, and that voice was taken away this past week, so let's give them their voice back.\"\n\nPorterfield, who ran against Jones for the District 52 seat and lost in the August 2022 primary, nominated Jones to be reappointed. Voters chose Jones, and they made the right choice, she said.\n\n\"Our community members are more than capable of selecting their representative, and their will should have never been undermined,\" Porterfield said. \"Rep. Jones was honest about who he was: a bold and unapologetic advocate for the community. The people chose their representative.\"\n\nJones won the Nashville Council vote 36-0. Three voting members were absent.\n\n\"When I went to the well to speak from the megaphone, I wasn't going up there as Justin,\" Jones said. \"I was going up there on behalf of 70,000 people in District 52.\"\n\nJones called for House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, to resign.\n\nAs the crowd of supporters holding \"No Justin, no peace\" signs poured out of the Nashville Courthouse and began their walk to the Tennessee Capitol building after the council's vote, the public square filled with the sound of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech played to upbeat music.\n\nExpulsions draw national attention\n\nExpelling Pearson and Jones, two of the youngest Black lawmakers in the state's General Assembly, shrank an already small minority caucus in the state legislature. Johnson, a white woman, said she believed Jones and Pearson were treated differently in their expulsion votes due to their race, an allegation Rep. Jody Barrett, R-Dickson, later vehemently denied.\n\nThe expulsions brought Tennessee politics to the national stage, putting a rare spotlight on Tennessee Democrats.\n\nOnly two other house members have been expelled since the 1800s, and both instances involved criminal charges or sexual misconduct allegations, and ended in bipartisan votes after special committee inquiries.\n\nMore:Republicans' expulsion of 2 Black members draws comparisons to Tennessee's 'dark history'\n\nHouse Republicans pushed for Jones, Pearson and Johnson to be expelled rather than censured to protect House integrity, they said.\n\n\"What they did was try to hold up the people's business on the House floor instead of doing it the way that they should have done it, which they have the means to do,\" Sexton said.\n\nAs Senate business began Monday, House Majority Leader William Lamberth, R-Portland and Republican Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison, R-Cosby said they would “welcome” Jones and Pearson back to the chamber if they are reappointed, and advised them to follow chamber protocol.\n\n“Tennessee’s constitution provides a pathway back for expulsion. Should any expelled member be reappointed, we will welcome them,” Lamberth and Faison said in a joint statement. “Like everyone else, they are expected to follow the rules of the House as well as state law.”\n\nThey added that Republican members “continue to mourn the six lives lost,” and “remain focused on solutions that ensure every child and parent feels safe in every community.”\n\nMelissa Brown contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/13/republicans-expulsion-vote-energized-national-democrats-but-likely-wont-jeopardize-the-gops-hold-on/70105164007/", "title": "The politics of expulsion: How Republicans handed Democrats a ...", "text": "The expulsion stemmed from three Democratic lawmakers breaking House rules to lead a gun-reform protest from the chamber's floor.\n\nRepublicans moved swiftly to take action, expelling two of the three in a historic vote.\n\nBut the Democrats received widespread attention and were quickly reappointed to the House until special elections can be held later this year.\n\nShouting “Welcome home!

Justin Jones, D-Nashville and Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, were expelled from their elected seats in partisan votes during a six-hour expulsion hearing on Thursday. Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, survived expulsion by a single vote, as seven Republicans broke with their party and voted to keep her in office.\n\nThey leveraged the national spotlight, accusing the Republican supermajority of shutting their voices out of the legislative process, and highlighting misdeeds of former Republican House members who did not face censure.\n\nWhile Johnson successfully defended her actions by focusing her defense on specific accusations, Jones and Pearson claimed Republicans’ move to oust them was fueled by racial prejudice and would bring an “end to democracy.”\n\nFor hours, the two held court from the House chamber, giving rousing speeches in their defense and continuing their calls for gun control. They did so on a stage they didn't have before as two freshman lawmakers.\n\nExpulsion vote:GOP expels Democratic Reps. Justin Jones, Justin Pearson from House over gun-control protest\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans spent much of their time trying to get the three to repent for their rule violations, or admit wrongdoing — which they were adamantly denied. Several GOP members argued that representing constituents with activism is not a valid basis for violating chamber rules to which every representative is bound. They also argued that if Jones and Pearson genuinely wanted to bring the change they’re calling for, they should “file a bill.”\n\nWere two young Black men forced out of elected office and 140,000 Tennesseans disenfranchised by a racist totalitarian Republican supermajority that rules the legislature with an iron grip? Or did Republicans take justified action within House rules to deal consequences on two members who held the chamber hostage by leading a protest instead of sponsoring legislation to bring the change they called for?\n\nHere are key takeaways from the historic day at the state Capitol.\n\nDemocrats took advantage of national platform\n\nDemocrats have little legislative power in the Tennessee General Assembly. So when the spotlight turned on them, they took full advantage of the opportunity.\n\nJones and Pearson, two millennial lawmakers, knew how to work the cameras from the moment they arrived at the Capitol. Through the throng to the chamber, they walked slowly — as if to a funeral dirge. Pearson and Johnson raised their clasped hands, and Johnson held Jones’ arm. Jones wore a white suit and white shoes, the color of innocence — a nod to his earlier claim of political martyrdom.\n\n“Today is Maundy Thursday, the day of betrayal,” Johnson’s attorney, former Rep. John Mark Windle said in her defense. “Isn’t it fitting these allegations are made during Holy Week?”\n\nThe trio have characterized the expulsion proceedings as a “political lynching,” and highlighted racial dynamics they said were at play.\n\nThe vote:How Tennessee lawmakers voted in Thursday's House expulsion debate\n\nTennessee three:What you need to know about the expulsion of Democratic TN lawmakers\n\n“What we see today is just a spectacle,” Jones said during his defense. “What we see today is a lynch mob assembled to not lynch me, but our democratic process.”\n\nIn an effort to draw attention back to calls for gun reform, all three Democrats repeated the names of the six victims who were killed at The Covenant School on March 30. But repeatedly during his defense, Pearson mispronounced the name of 9-year-old Hallie Scruggs, daughter of a pastor at Covenant Presbyterian Church and one of the victims in the shooting.\n\nSeveral times during his speech, Jones dramatically paused to drink water as protestors outside the House chamber cheered in response, the sounds carrying inside.\n\nAt one point, Jones reprised the call he made one week before from the same podium: “no action, no peace.”\n\nCrowds watching on screens outside echoed back, as Jones took a dramatic pause.\n\nRepresentation or activism?\n\nCalling out Republicans for not recognizing thousands of protestors outside, the trio said Thursday they were compelled to protest with bullhorn, breaching House protocol, because they needed to represent their constituents, but Republicans refused to call on them.\n\n“I am able to speak because the people of my district sent me here,” Jones said. “Speaker Sexton is not my constituent. Speaker Sexton is not a king. Speaker Sexton is not God, though he may want to be. I don’t know how many times the speaker has gaveled me out of order for simply doing my job as a representative.”\n\nRepublicans criticized them, arguing that as elected representatives, they already had the power to propose the policy changes they were calling for during the protest. And, as elected representatives, they are obliged to follow the rules of the chamber.\n\n“You know what you could do? You could maybe compile a piece of legislation that could do that, instead of sitting back and criticizing folks who have worked really hard for the past two decades to do so,” said Rep. Andrew Farmer, R-Sevierville, who sponsored the resolution to expel Pearson. “If you want to conduct business in this house, file a bill. Be recognized, stand there and present it, and pass it.”\n\nHouse Majority Leader William Lamberth, R-Portland, argued that in interrupting and holding the House hostage during their protest, the three stifled the voices of the millions of constituents represented by other members.\n\n“You came to the well of this chamber and silenced 96 other voices,” Lamberth said. “You don’t seem like you believe that any of us care about our constituents as much as you care about yours.”\n\nGOP supermajority accused of shutting Democrats out\n\nAll three Democrats accused Republicans of shutting the Democratic minority out of the legislative process by cutting off microphones during debate, refusing to call on Democrats, and “calling the question” (a legislative action that ends debate on a bill) before Democrats have had time to weigh in.\n\n“Each of you have an obligation to stop turning the people's house into your own club,” Pearson said. “The folks that sit in committees with you, who got elected just like you, who swore the same oath that you swore – they deserve a voice in these committee rooms. And we deserve a break on this House floor.”\n\nDuring debate, other Democrats chimed in, accusing Republican leadership of killing their bills, only allowing certain members to have their bills passed, requiring Democrats to submit questions in advance for certain committee proceedings, and not calling on Democrats during committee meetings and at times on the House floor.\n\n“The erosion of democracy in the state legislature is what got us here,” Pearson said. “It wasn’t walking up to the well: it was being disruptive to a status quo that silences the minority.”\n\nHouse Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Sexton, disputed the claims during a news conference after the expulsion votes, saying that since he took up the speaker’s gavel “more voices have been heard.” He said more Democratic bills have been passed, noting that six bills sponsored by Democrats passed Thursday on the House floor.\n\n“You were here. You saw it. Those were good bills that made it through committee and made it to the floor,” Sexton said. “We’re not upholding their bills. We’re not pushing back their bills. We’re not purposely killing their bills.”\n\nAired GOP’s dirty laundry from years past, hurled personal accusations\n\nSeveral Democrats argued that expulsion – a nuclear option – was far to heavy a penalty for a minor rule infraction, especially when compared to those of some Republican colleagues who faced federal investigations and indictment, criminal charges, or committed other undignified actions, but never faced expulsion.\n\n“For years, one of your colleagues who was an admitted child molester sat in this chamber: no expulsion,” Jones said during his speech. “One member sits in this chamber who was found guilty of domestic violence: no expulsion. We had a former Speaker sit in this chamber who is now under federal investigation: no expulsion. We have a member still under federal investigation: no expulsion. We had a member pee in another member’s chair in this chamber: no expulsion.”\n\nFor instance, former House Speaker Glen Casada, R-Franklin, is currently under federal indictment on corruption-related charges. He did not run for reelection amid the federal charges, but no action was taken to remove him from his seat. No action was taken against former Rep. David Byrd, R-Waynesboro, who faced child sexual abuse allegations from decades earlier.\n\nIn response, Rep. Sabi “Doc” Kumar, R-Springfield, accused Jones of having called him “brown face” after a recent committee hearing.\n\n“In all those 53 years in America, I have never encountered a racial slur. I’m really not sure any of that applies to me. I live a good life,” Kumar said. “Yet, you on tape called me a ‘brown face.’ Yes, sir. It’s on tape. It’s on tape. You called me that after a committee meeting on that same day. … You shoved your finger in my face and said, ‘Kumar, they will never accept you.’ You said it twice, and you were so intimidating that the sergeant at arms without my invitation came in to intervene between us.”\n\nJones later explained from the podium that he had said Kumar “put a brown face on white supremacy.” Kumar is the only non-white member of the Republican caucus.\n\nThe end of democracy?\n\nThroughout the proceedings, the three Democrats declared that their expulsion would signal the “end of democracy” in Tennessee. Spectators outside seemed to agree.\n\n“Fascists! Fascists!” some chanted.\n\n“Shame! Shame!” others said.\n\nTo both the media and those in the House chamber, Pearson and Jones characterized their expulsions as “a sad day for democracy,” an “attack on democracy,” “persecution,” and an attempt to “disenfranchise our constituents.”\n\nBut expulsion proceedings did not breach the chamber’s rules and protocol, or the state Constitution. The legislature has wide latitude to conduct its own business.\n\nAppointing authority for an interim member now goes to county legislative bodies, where Nashville’s Metro Council has already set a special meeting during which Jones will likely be reappointed. Special elections to formally re-fill Jones and Pearson’s seats would likely come this summer and fall.\n\nThursday afternoon, Jones reactivated his campaign fundraising website. By Friday morning, a “Tennessee Three” political action committee was formed to fundraise for their reelection.\n\nBoth the Tennessee Republican Party and Tennessee Democratic Party are also fundraising.\n\nGOP sought contrition\n\nThroughout their cross examinations of the three, Republicans sought their remorse and contrition for interrupting the House.\n\nRep. Gino Bulso, R-Brentwood, repeatedly tried to get Johnson to apologize, saying he didn’t “see any remorse”\n\n“What you've heard here this afternoon from the representative from Knox County is not contrition,” Bulso told colleagues. “She's not even willing to agree with me on anything that her conduct was disorderly or that she disrupted the proceedings.”\n\nAfter the vote, Sexton said that he was told that the three planned to apologize on Monday evening – as is a usual practice on the House floor when personal disputes arise.\n\n“The Democratic caucus told me that Monday night they were going to stand up individually and apologize. They never did. I do not know why,” Sexton said. “It's hard to go back and say if it would have made a difference because it never happened.”\n\nOn Thursday, none of the three were contrite.\n\n“I will apologize when the speaker and you all apologize to the families of Covenant,” Jones said. “When you apologize to the families from the Waffle House. When you apologize to the many countless victims of gun violence because of your reckless laws that proliferate weapons of war in our communities.”\n\nStill, Republicans said that if the two come return as interim appointments or get reelected, they would welcome them back, provided they follow House rules.\n\nBulso said so during the debate. So did Sexton.\n\n\"If the people of their district wish to reelect them, they can do so,\" the speaker said after the vote. \"That's the process.\"\n\nAnd on Thursday night, the House GOP caucus, while accusing the Democrats of violating state law, said much the same.\n\n\"If elected to come back and serve their constituents in the Tennessee House of Representatives, we hope they will act as the thousands who have come before them - with respect for our institution, their fellow colleagues, and the seat that they hold. We look forward to continuing to defend the voices of ALL Tennesseans,\" the Republicans said in a statement.\n\nTo what extent did race come into play?\n\nRepublicans expelled two young Black lawmakers, but fell one vote short of expelling a white woman. Since the vote, Jones, Pearson and others have framed their expulsions as an act of racism by the overwhelmingly white Republican supermajority.\n\n“The state in which the Ku Klux Klan was founded is now attempting another power grab by silencing the two youngest Black representatives and one of the only Democratic women in this body,” Jones said. “That is what this is about.”\n\nRepublican leaders dispute that race had anything to do with how members voted. Lamberth told reporters Thursday that representatives who voted not to expel Johnson did so based on evidence presented during the hearing.\n\nRelated:Republicans' expulsion of 2 Black members draws comparisons to Tennessee's 'dark history'\n\n“Our members literally didn't look at the ethnicity of the members that were up for expulsion,” Lamberth said. “The strength of the evidence against two of the representatives was stronger than the other. Representative Johnson said very clearly from the well, that she didn't chant, that she didn't have a sign, and that she didn't have a bullhorn. Our members took into account the evidence that was presented and that's what they made the decision on.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Karen Camper, D-Memphis, told reporters Thursday that the members likely felt “some racial undertones” to the vote “because of their experience in the halls of this General Assembly.”\n\nSen. Charlane Oliver, D-Nashville, came in with Jones in the 2023 freshman class and said she's watched “a lot of political bullying going on behind the scenes” directed at Jones.\n\n“This idea that he and Rep. Justin Pearson must apologize is a mindset set in white supremacy. A mindset that we, as Black folks are not on par or peers to them, and we must be inferior and subservient to their demands,” Oliver said. “I can't tell you how many times Rep. Jones has come into my office after something has happened on the elevator, or a conversation with leadership where they called him a worthless human being. That's not leadership.”\n\nRep. Jesse Chism, D-Memphis, said Thursday's expulsion hearings looked like a “Jim Crow-era trial.”\n\n“We saw two Black men fighting for their careers, fighting for their reputations, fighting for their political lives,” Chism said.\n\nMembers of the Black Caucus, who flanked Jones as he defended himself on Thursday night, followed the former representative out of the House chamber after the vote. Many were fighting back tears, Chism said, which finally spilled when they returned to their desks without Jones.\n\n“It was a shame to see some of the smirks, some of the smiles, that some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle had when they saw our tears,” Chism said. “Yesterday was a shame. The world saw it. Anybody on that side of the aisle that voted to remove our members should be ashamed of themselves.”\n\nMelissa Brown contributed to this report.\n\nReach Vivian Jones at vjones@tennessean.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/05/tennessee-house-lawmaker-expulsion-vote-future-of-gop/70081721007/", "title": "Tennessee Republicans push to expel lawmakers may set future ...", "text": "Republicans are expected to vote on Thursday to remove three Democrats from the House.\n\nThe expulsion vote comes after the three lawmakers broke House rules and led chants for gun control from the House floor.\n\nTennessee’s Republican supermajority is poised to take the unprecedented move of expelling three Democrats as punishment for violating House decorum rules by using a bullhorn on the House floor to lead a protest calling for gun reform.\n\nHouse members are expected to vote Thursday to remove Reps. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, Justin Jones, D-Nashville, and Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, from elected office after the trio brought the chamber to a halt for nearly an hour last week by speaking out of order following the deadly shooting at The Covenant School – a move House Speaker Cameron Sexton later likened to “an insurrection.”\n\n“What they did was try to hold up the people's business on the House floor instead of doing it the way that they should have done it, which they have the means to do,” Sexton said. “They actually thought that they would be arrested. And so they decided that them being a victim was more important than focusing on the six victims from Monday. And that's appalling.”\n\nFollow along:Live updates as Republicans seek ouster of three Democrats who led gun reform chants\n\nHouse leadership has never overridden a member’s election for simply violating House rules. Only two House members have been expelled from the chamber since the 1800s, both after either criminal charges or sexual misconduct allegations. Both of those times, in 1980 and 2016, followed special committee inquiries and were bipartisan votes.\n\nExpulsion:Tennessee GOP begins expulsion process for 3 Democrats, House session devolves into chaos\n\nThe expulsion vote — along with the deadly Covenant shooting and subsequent demonstrations — has thrust Tennessee and its politics onto the national stage, drawing attention from Republicans and some of the highest-ranking Democrats in the country.\n\nIt has also given Tennessee Democrats a fundraising opportunity while illustrating the power the Republican supermajority has over legislative business and even representation in Democratic districts. Experts say the expulsion vote will set a precedent for the Tennessee General Assembly going forward.\n\n“They're trying to make us an example. This is a political lynching. But we will not back down,” Jones told reporters Monday, echoing words of expelled former Sen. Katrina Robinson, who at the time of her 2022 ouster called the GOP majority’s move “procedural lynching.”\n\nIf Republicans vote to remove the three members on Thursday, they might not be gone for long. The Tennessee Democratic Party is already fundraising to back the three in special elections. If constituents send them back, Tennessee’s Constitution does not allow members to be expelled twice for the same offense.\n\nPolitical martyrdom rockets ‘Tennessee Three’ to the national stage\n\nJones, Johnson and Pearson — dubbed “The Tennessee Three” — have garnered international media attention since the protest and looming expulsion vote, sparking a trending hashtag on social media this week and drawing messages of support from some of the highest-ranking Democrats in the country.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre characterized the expulsion proposal as “shrugging in the face of yet another tragic school shooting” during a press conference Tuesday.\n\nTennessee Capitol protest explainer:Here's what did and did not happen\n\nThousands of students marched on the Capitol to \"confront their lawmakers for their failure to keep them safe at school, and what did these Republican legislators do?\" Jean-Pierre said. \"They're trying to expel these three Democratic legislators who joined in the protests.”\n\nFormer Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts joined numerous lawmakers across the country in sharing her support for the three, calling expulsion “infuriating and anti-democratic.”\n\nJones rhetorically claimed political martyrdom on Monday as he paralleled the trio’s indecorous behavior to that of “a revolutionary brown-skinned Palestinian named Jesus who engaged in good trouble” when he cleansed the temple before his crucifixion.\n\n“Jesus engaged in an act out of decorum because he knew that the dignity of the people who were being dishonored was more important than decorum,” Jones said on the House floor Monday. “God is not pleased with injustice and that light will shine, and no matter what you do to us, we will not bow down.”\n\nOn the flip side, the three have drawn ire from conservative media as Sexton has appeared multiple times on Fox News to criticize the interruption.\n\n\"[Jones] is trying to make this about the protestors. He's trying to make this about what people were protesting about. Their voices were not silenced. This has nothing to do with anything outside the House chamber,\" Sexton said Wednesday. \"The three individuals stormed up to the well where you speak from without being recognized. Did not display decorum. They disrupted the proceedings, and we had to shut down. They pulled out a megaphone and started to lead the balcony in protests for the next 30 to 45 minutes. Their actions on the House floor rises to the level of expulsion. We cannot allow for these types of things to take place in the people's house.\"\n\nRep. Gino Bulso, R-Brentwood, sponsor of the resolution to expel Johnson, roundly criticized the three during a podcast appearance on the conservative Daily Wire on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"They voluntarily disqualified themselves from further service,\" Bulso said. \"Rather than comply with their oath to the Constitution and comply with the rules, they decided to go outside of the House and effectively shut it down. And so what we're simply doing is recognizing that they've voluntarily chosen to put themselves outside the House and formally expel them.\"\n\nPast expulsions:Tennessee legislative expulsions: From sexual misconduct to opposing rights of former slaves\n\nMeanwhile, both sides seem to be capitalizing off the controversy, either with political capital or campaign cash. Within hours of the House vote Monday, Tennessee Democratic Party Chair Hendrell Remus sent out a fundraising appeal to send the trio back.\n\n“This behavior is dangerous — they’re operating like a fascist regime,” Remus wrote in a fundraising email sent Tuesday. “This is a radical abuse of power for clear political reasons. We need to be prepared to re-elect the Tennessee Three if they are removed.”\n\nA separate GoFundMe set up to raise money for the group’s legal expenses had raised more than $20,000 as of Wednesday.\n\nPrecedent set for decorum-based removals\n\nExpulsion of a member for a rules violation is unprecedented in the chamber’s 227-year history, but could lay groundwork for future removals.\n\nBruce Oppenheimer, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University, told The Tennessean that typically an ethics committee investigation occurs before an expulsion vote.\n\n“Normally, expulsion from a legislature is an extreme sanction that involves indictment and conviction of a crime or a severe ethical violation,” Oppenheimer said. “Even when an ethical violation is incurred, lesser penalties of a reprimand or censure would be assessed in most cases.”\n\nCompared with others who have been ousted from the legislature, Oppenheimer said the decorum violation “seems modest, almost to the point of being trivial.”\n\nFor example, in 2016, then-Rep. Jeremy Durham, R-Franklin, faced sexual misconduct allegations and an attorney general's investigation. And in the Senate last year, Robinson was federally indicted in July 2020 and retained her seat and voting power for more than a year as her legal case played out before the Senate voted to remove her in February 2022 after her conviction.\n\n“It would be incumbent on the Speaker to cite precedent for this type of action,” Oppenheimer said.\n\nThe three fight back\n\nJohnson suggested on Monday she would consider a lawsuit if ultimately expelled, though she declined to comment further on what legal remedy she thinks she could pursue. House Democratic Caucus spokesperson Ken Jobe said Monday the three were exploring several options to respond.\n\nDavid Raybin, a Nashville attorney, said legal precedent suggests the courts would not intervene in a legislative expulsion process. The issue has been “pretty well settled” in multiple cases in other states and federally, though not in Tennessee, when courts decline to weigh in on a “political question.”\n\nTennessee three: Tennessee three: What to know about the House Democrats targeted for expulsion by Republicans\n\n“The Constitution gives the House and the Senate the exclusive authority to discipline its own members. That's what's known as a political question under the Constitution,” Raybin said. “Ultimately, it falls under the separation of powers. The constitution prevents the legislature from interfering too much with the courts. Similarly, the Constitution prevents the courts from interfering with the inner-workings of the Legislature. A court would decline to review that.”\n\nStill, if expelled, the three members could theoretically regain their lost seats without seeking a legal remedy: There's nothing in the Tennessee Constitution preventing a person from seeking reelection for a lost seat or even being appointed as interim while the district awaits a special election. They also could not be punished a second time for the March 30 floor protest, if they're expelled for that incident on Thursday.\n\n“The only reason they wouldn't be able to run again or be reelected again is if they were disqualified, such as, theoretically, being convicted of a felony,” Raybin said.\n\nMeanwhile, after a tussle on the House floor Monday evening, Jones has filed a police report accusing Rep. Justin Lafferty, R-Knoxville, of assault.\n\nJones said Lafferty shoved him and snatched his phone away during a physical confrontation as the gallery was being cleared. He has shared video depicting some sort of confrontation between the two. In the immediate aftermath, other lawmakers formed a heated scrum around the two before the situation was defused.\n\nIn a statement, Lafferty did not deny pushing Jones but said the Democrat \"shoved his phone in my face in a threatening manner.\"\n\n\"I reacted as anyone would,\" Lafferty said. \"Attempts to characterize this as anything else are misleading and false. The three members who are in danger of losing their jobs are desperate to deflect attention away from their actions.”\n\nMetro Nashville Police Department spokesperson Kris Mumford confirmed Jones filed the report Monday night, but the department declined to release the report due to the ongoing investigation. A detective has yet to be assigned but will be, Mumford said.\n\nVote illustrates GOP control over both lawmaking and representation\n\nExpelling three elected members from the legislature illustrates the iron grip of the Republican supermajority has on both legislative business and representation — even in Democratic districts.\n\nThe General Assembly is already prepping for the expulsions: Johnson on Thursday confirmed legislative staff informed her she would lose health insurance if expelled, though she was advised of a previous situation where a lawmaker retained his state insurance by resigning before he could be expelled.\n\nThe vote comes one year after the GOP-controlled body redrew Congressional districts to divide Davidson County into three, paving the way for three Republicans to represent the Democratic stronghold in Congress.\n\nIt also follows Republican efforts this year to reduce the size of Nashville’s Metro Council by half, overhaul membership of Nashville’s Airport Authority and Sports Authority boards and end special tax authority around Nashville’s convention center.\n\nNow, House leadership could override the votes of 210,000 constituents for violating House rules on speaking – despite already holding the ability to pass bills regardless of any Democratic opposition.\n\n“Expulsion will be seen by some as punishing dissent,” said Ken Paulson, director of the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee State University. “The legislature has some options when it comes to boisterous behavior in its chambers. It can view the chanting and shouts as an emotional reaction to a community tragedy and recognize the important role the right of petition plays in American society, while reprimanding errant lawmakers without eliminating their voices and viewpoints.”\n\nSexton initially stripped Johnson and Jones of their committee assignments as a sanction. But presiding over the vote also demonstrates Sexton’s power over both House procedure and membership, and energizes his conservative base.\n\nIt’s still possible that expulsion will not happen on Thursday — Rep. Antonio Parkinson, D-Memphis, asked colleagues to back down and pray about the vote before session on Thursday\n\n“Every one of us, whether you were in the scuffle or whether you were part of creating martyrs out of other members — this is not us,” Parkinson said. “We didn't look like leaders a few minutes ago. We're bigger than that. We're better than that.”\n\nMelissa Brown contributed to this report.\n\nReach Vivian Jones at vjones@tennessean.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/13/tennessee-three-a-week-after-expulsion-justin-pearson-of-returns-to-state-house/70108301007/", "title": "Tennessee three: A week after expulsion, Justin Pearson of returns ...", "text": "Rep.

Justin Jones, D-Nashville, were expelled by Tennessee Republicans last week for interrupting House business amid gun reform protests at the Capitol on March 30, just days after the deadly Covenant school shooting rocked Nashville and the nation. Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, survived an expulsion effort by a single vote.\n\nPearson on Thursday read off the names of the Covenant shooting victims before criticizing the Republican supermajority for taking up expulsion proceedings amid historic public protests at the Capitol calling for gun reform.\n\n\"Gun violence is impacting and hurting every part of our community, and all people within our community, and the solutions offered are not good enough,\" Pearson said. \"They are not the ones that can keep us safe and protect us. Unfortunately, the solution offered by the Republican Party in the state of Tennessee was to try and expel us, try and expel our voices and silence our fight for an end to gun violence. They worked to expel our constituents' representation by subverting our democracy for their mobocracy.\"\n\nThe expulsion of the two youngest Black lawmakers drew immediate demonstrations in Nashville and widespread condemnation across the county. While Republicans argued the trio's unprecedented action to lead the public House galleries in gun reform chants required unprecedented consequences, opponents argued expulsion was an extreme step to take that stripped over 150,000 Tennesseans of their elected representation.\n\nIn the end, the pair swiftly returned to Nashville as newly bolstered rising stars with energized political bases.\n\nThough the state constitution gives the General Assembly authority to steward its own membership and mete out punishment as the body sees fit, county legislative bodies have the authority to tap interim appointments to fill empty seats. The Nashville Metro Council and the Shelby County Commission did just that and returned the two lawmakers to the House.\n\nPearson missed a single day of floor votes following his expulsion, while Rep. Justin Jones was able to return to the General Assembly in time for a Monday floor session.\n\nMore:Justin Pearson reappointed to Tennessee House of Representatives by Shelby County Commission\n\nRep. Torrey Harris, D-Memphis, on Wednesday evening delivered documentation of Pearson's reappointments and the Shelby County Commission meeting minutes to the General Assembly, which is required to certify the interim appointment. Harris posted a video, set to the Rocky theme, of him clutching the documents and sprinting up the steps outside of the Capitol, a moment of levity in a week of political turmoil.\n\nHarris said he wanted to help his colleagues in any way he could.\n\n\"I feel like our democracy is about to start working again, to the point where the people are going to get heard,\" Harris said, expressing optimism outside of Pearson's swearing in. \"What they did triggered a whole national movement where people are paying attention to what's going on in Tennessee. It puts our leadership on notice that they have to treat people right, they have to listen to everyone, they have to follow by what the people want and not just what their rules are.\"\n\nMore than 100 supporters gathered outside the Capitol to cheer on Pearson Thursday morning. Pearson’s parents both took the podium before their son, with his mother reciting Maya Angelou’s poem \"Still I Rise.\"\n\nAhead of his oath, Pearson asked Memphis constituents who had traveled to Nashville to gather in front of the podium.\n\n“This is a people-powered movement, not a politician’s movement,” Pearson said.\n\nPearson first came to office following the death of Rep. Barbara Cooper, D-Memphis.\n\nSince March 14, Pearson has won a general election, officially swore in as an elected member of the House of Representatives, where he'd been serving an interim appointment after winning the January primary, was expelled and received a second interim appointment before swearing in, again, on Thursday.\n\nHe and Jones will have to face a special election later this year.\n\nInside the Capitol, Phillip Shade, a former Metro teacher and Vietnam War veteran, said he had to come to the statehouse to meet Pearson. Shade opposes plans to put additional armed guards in schools, which he warned would turn schools into \"armed encampments.\" Outside the House chamber, Shade ran into Pearson and shook his hand.\n\n\"I'm so proud of you, it brings a tear to my eye,\" Shade said.\n\nBoth lawmakers were back at their desks on Thursday morning amid an ongoing House session, which later ground to a temporary halt after Democrats objected to Republicans voting to cut debate on a controversial college instruction bill.\n\nJones and Pearson rose in opposition of a bill carried by Republicans that would amend a \"divisive concepts\" law passed last year. The law would add a mechanism to allow people to report \"alleged violations\" that occur at higher education institutions.\n\nJones called the law bigoted, and his mic was eventually turned off by House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville.\n\nRepublicans used a procedural vote to cut off debate, which Democratic Caucus Chairman John Ray Clemmons, D-Nashville, sharply criticized. Rep. G.A. Hardaway, D-Memphis, suggested lawmakers had discussed allowing longer debates amid the political turmoil of the last two weeks, though Sexton pointed to House rules that allow members to call for a debate closure vote.\n\n\"I would urge caution among this body about walking any further off this cliff on issues of such importance,\" Clemmons said.\n\nThe bill ultimately passed on a party-line vote.\n\nReach Melissa Brown at mabrown@tennessean.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/24/tennessee-three-representatives-biden-white-house/11712523002/", "title": "'This is not a moment.

Justin Jones, D-Nashville, Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, and Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, sat down with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for about an hour in the Oval Office.\n\nIt marked the culmination of the lawmakers' rising profiles as they've come to symbolize the push for stronger gun laws – and, to some, democracy itself – amid Republican resistance. The lawmakers said they're out to show gun reform is possible even in a solidly Republican state like Tennessee.\n\n\"This is not a moment. It is a movement,\" Jones said, adding that \"continued people pressure\" will be required to pass gun reform in Tennessee and beyond. \"We come from a state where we have an NRA-endorsed governor calling a special session on guns –something that's unheard of – because of people power.\"\n\nTennessee Republicans voted this month to expel Jones and Pearson, who are both Black, after they broke decorum by protesting for gun control on the House floor. Johnson was targeted by Republican leadership but kept her seat by a single vote.\n\nThe decision, led by Tennessee's Republican House speaker, Cameron Sexton, turned the trio into national heroes of the left.\n\n\"You're standing up for our kids, you're standing up for our communities,\" Biden told the lawmakers, kicking off their meeting. \"What the Republican legislature did was shocking, it was undemocratic.\"\n\nIn Tennessee's Republican-supermajority legislature, Democrats are virtually powerless, relegated to play to their bases with speeches and long-shot bills, but lacking the votes to pass laws.\n\nBut the \"Tennessee Three,\" as they became to be known, are no longer backbenchers even though their push for gun reform in Tennessee hasn't succeeded.\n\nJones said he told Biden that \"sometimes we have to do something outside of the ordinary\" to produce change.\n\n\"If we can do it in the South, the South is going to set the tone for the rest of the nation,\" he said. \"I cannot emphasize that enough. We come from Tennessee – Tennessee, that they say is a place that is forgotten, a place that is impossible for change.\"\n\nMore:'Tennessee Three' lawmakers Justin Jones, Justin Pearson and Gloria Johnson to meet with Joe Biden at White House\n\nResonating beyond the Volunteer State\n\nThe Tennessee General Assembly adjourned this year's legislative session Friday without taking major action on gun control in the four weeks since a deadly March 27 mass shooting at The Covenant School, a private Christian school in Nashville, killed three children and three adults.\n\nIn fact, the Tennessee Republican majority passed legislation that protects gun manufacturers from liability in lawsuits after shootings.\n\nYet the Tennessee Three are still optimistic for action during a special legislative session called by Republican Gov. Bill Lee for lawmakers to consider a measure that would allow law enforcement to temporarily take away firearms from individuals considered threats to themselves or others.\n\nIt's unclear whether enough Republicans in the House will support the proposal for approval. Even whether to call it a red-flag law has set off debate.\n\n\"The message has been very clear from Tennesseans – both Republican and Democrat, white and black, and rich and poor – that something must be done,\" Pearson said. \"And in this special session, the expectation is that a law gets passed that can actually protect our communities.\"\n\nMore:Second of two Tennessee lawmakers expelled by Republican majority reappointed Wednesday\n\nWhile the Tennessee Three haven't turned their fame into legislative victories at home, their influence extends beyond their home state. The White House sees their story as the epitome of Americans' frustration with gun laws: another mass shooting followed by inaction from lawmakers, particularly Republicans.\n\n\"These people are parents. We don't think of them as Republicans and Democrats,\" Johnson said of the thousands of protesters who have demanded action on guns at the Tennessee state Capitol. \"They want to put their kids first. They want to put their kids before guns.\"\n\nBiden's meeting with the Tennessee Three followed a virtual meeting Biden held with the three lawmakers earlier this month and a rally Harris held with them in Nashville.\n\nBiden, who is expected to formally announce his 2024 reelection campaign Tuesday, renewed his calls for Congress to reinstate a national ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines after the Nashville mass shooting. He made similar appeals after shootings in Louisville, Ky.; Monterey Park, Calif.; Michigan State University; Buffalo, N.Y.; Uvalde, Texas; and elsewhere.\n\nA recent poll by Gallup found America's frustrations with gun laws is at an all-time high, with 63% expressing dissatisfaction. The issue resonates, in particular, with suburban voters who helped Democrats outperform expectations during last year's midterm elections and were critical to Biden's 2020 election win.\n\n\"Americans are sick of our gun violence epidemic and were outraged to see the response from Tennessee Republicans to expel two young Black men who are fighting for gun safety instead of passing laws proven to save lives,\" said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, which pushes for gun control.\n\nMore:OnPolitics: Most Americans side with 'Tennessee Three' on protest, poll finds\n\n'You cannot expel hope. You can't expel a movement.'\n\nJones and Pearson were quickly reappointed to their seats by the local legislative bodies in Nashville and Memphis. Johnson, who survived her expulsion vote, noted afterward that she's the only white lawmaker of the three.\n\nThe tension at the statehouse continued after Jones and Pearson returned. Both lawmakers objected to having their microphones cut off by Republicans during debate on anti-trans legislation Friday before lawmakers left Nashville for the year.\n\n\"The world is watching and you're acting like fascists!\" Johnson reportedly shouted from her desk.\n\nThe charismatic Jones, 27, the youngest member of the Tennessee legislature, has gotten the most national attention – so much so that a Washington, D.C., public relations firm is helping him field media requests. After the Nashville Metro Council voted to reappoint him, Jones led hundreds down Rep. John Lewis Way in a triumphant walk back to the state Capitol to reclaim his House seat.\n\nA well-known local activist before he entered public office, Jones was elected for the first time in November in his heavily Democratic district after winning the party's nomination by 238 votes last August. Jones started a campaign for Congress in 2020 to try to unseat then-U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper but failed to collect enough signatures to qualify.\n\n\"Our hope is not in this legislature,\" Jones said ahead of the White House meeting. \"But what gave me hope this session was the people. And I think that the Republican Party has lost a generation. Gen Z is going to shake things up come 2024. And it's going to transform this state, like we saw in other states like Nevada and Georgia.\"\n\nPearson, 28, just completed his first session as well. He came onto the political scene in Memphis when he co-founded the grassroots organization Memphis Community Against the Pipeline in response to a planned crude oil pipeline that would cut through backyards in South Memphis.\n\nPearson rattled Tennessee Republicans on the first day of session when he wore a traditional West African dashiki on the House floor. Now, he's considered a potential replacement to U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Memphis, whenever he decides not to run again.\n\n\"You cannot expel hope and you can't expel a movement,\" Pearson said.\n\nMore:Politics of expulsion: Did Republicans hand Democrats major win with Tennessee Three vote?\n\nJohnson, 60, a retired teacher from Knoxville, was first elected to the legislature in 2012, lost her seat in 2014, but was later reelected in 2018.\n\nShe has long drawn the ire of Republicans. Two years ago, Johnson famously moved her desk into a hallway in Tennessee's legislative building in defiance after she was assigned a small, windowless conference room as her office.\n\nJohnson said the struggle for gun reform in Tennessee has fueled a movement nationally, pointing to a scene Tuesday: an estimated 9,000 people in Nashville locking arms from Monroe Carrell Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt University to the State Capitol, in support of gun reform. She said Democrats from Kentucky, where an April 10 shooting at a Louisville bank killed five people, joined the protest.\n\n\"We want legislation here for Tennessee. That's who we represent,\" Johnson said. \"But if we can help motivate and energize young people across this country to get active and get in the movement – absolutely.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/24"}]}

Ad Free for $15.99/month: Two concurrent streams, 1080p HD, up to 30 offline downloads, 5.1 surround sound quality.\n\nTwo concurrent streams, 1080p HD, up to 30 offline downloads, 5.1 surround sound quality. Ultimate Ad Free for $19.99/month (new): Four concurrent streams, up to 4K Ultra HD resolution, 100 offline downloads, Dolby Atmos sound quality.\n\nWill I still be able to get Discovery+ as a stand-alone service?\n\nYes. Discovery+ will remain available to subscribe to separately, for $4.99 a month (or $6.99 ad-free). But a stand-alone version of Max without the Discovery content will not be available\n\nWill cable HBO subscribers still get access to the Max streaming service?\n\nYes.\n\nIs Max going to cancel and disappear my favorite shows and movies as HBO Max did?\n\nUnder WBD leadership, HBO Max made controversial cost-cutting decisions that included shelving the mostly-finished \"Batgirl\" film and removing shows like \"Westworld\" from the streaming service entirely. Several projects were canceled to take advantage of tax write-offs, enabling the company to deduct the value of production costs for projects it deemed unpromising or that weren't prompting new subscriber signups. However, leadership has indicated that those write-downs won't be a major part of the strategy moving forward.\n\nWhat new shows can I expect on Max?\n\nWBD executives promised 40 new shows and seasons every month on Max. The biggest new shows announced included \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight,\" a new \"Game of Thrones\" spinoff, produced by George R.R. Martin, and a live-action \"Harry Potter\" TV series with new actors in the iconic roles, executive produced by J.K. Rowling.\n\nSome of the other new shows and films he announced included: A series about Colin Farrell's Batman villain \"The Penguin,\" \"It\" prequel series \"Welcome to Derry,\" a new \"Big Bang Theory\" spinoff; and unscripted series with Robert Downey Jr. and Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/12"}]}

Dr. Peter Hotez, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, calls these many new lineages “Scrabble variants” because they contain letters like X and Q that get high scores in the game.\n\nThe new variants descend from slightly different branches of the Omicron family tree, but they have evolved to share some of the same changes in their genomes that help them slip past our immunity against the virus.\n\nThe gaggle of new variants have been gaining ground against BA.5, which has dominated Covid-19 infections in the United States since July. BA.5 now accounts for 49.6% of new infections in this country.\n\nTwo variants, BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, have been growing especially fast. At the beginning of October, each one accounted for about 1% of new infections in the United States, but they have been roughly doubling in prevalence each week. Together, they now account for more than 1 in 4 new Covid-19 infections nationwide, according to CDC data.\n\nBQ.1 is causing about 14% of new infections; BQ.1.1. is causing 13% of new infections. BA.4.6 is causing another 10%. BF.7 accounts for 7.5% of newly diagnosed Covid-19. A slew of other new variants accounts for smaller pieces of the Covid-19 pie.\n\nThese variants are not evenly distributed across the US. BQ.1.1 is now causing about 1 in 5 new Covid-19 infections in the Northeast, where cases and hospitalizations are rising. But that strain is causing just 3% of new Covid-19 infections in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThese variants are slightly different from each other, but they all carry some of the same key mutations that help them skirt immunity from vaccines and past infections. This makes them more likely to lead to breakthrough infections and reinfections.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn a statement released Friday, the World Health Organization’s Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution said the most mutated families of the rising subvariants – XBB and BQ.1 – aren’t different enough from Omicron to be considered separate variants of concern.\n\nXBB was detected in the United States in September, but it is not causing a significant number of cases in this country. It is particularly widespread in Singapore, where it is now the dominant circulating strain.\n\n“The two sublineages remain part of Omicron, which continues to be a variant of concern,” the group said in a statement.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/health/updated-boosters-omicron-imprint/index.html", "title": "Updated Covid-19 boosters offer protection, but new studies suggest ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe updated Covid-19 booster shots appear to work about as well against the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants as the original boosters they replaced, according to two new studies from research teams at Harvard and Columbia universities.\n\nThe research suggests that our bodies have been well-trained to fight the original virus, which emerged from Wuhan, China, and that boosters mostly reinforce that response. Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n“We see essentially no difference” between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn’t yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that’s long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes – hospitalization or death from Covid-19 – lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren’t the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho’s study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time – about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n“We can’t say that a few months from now, there won’t be any difference,” he said. “We won’t know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.”\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n“At least at this time point, there’s no discernible benefit” over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch’s studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch’s study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn’t pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn’t protect people any better in the real world.\n\n“We would not expect this to be clinically significant,” said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch’s team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn’t budge much after either vaccine.\n\n“Unfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,” Barouch said.\n\n‘A booster is a booster’\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results “can be considered a disappointment,” especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n“A booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,” Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people – less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up – have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n“Your old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,” Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn’t sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n“I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster – at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals – before next September, October,” he said.\n\n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen, but it’s what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.”\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn’t find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n“Your body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,” said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat’s the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, “but I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.”\n\nIt’s possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants – “things that just happen to really wake up the immune system” – can do it.\n\nBut it’s not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he’s thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna’s. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“For me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA’s advisers in June.\n\nHe says it’s one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n“Certainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,” said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body’s response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat’s something the FDA’s Marks has considered, too.\n\n“I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what’s best moving forward,” he told Stat. “Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/health/covid-variants-concern-new-year/index.html", "title": "Coronavirus: 2022 ends with looming risk of a new variant, public ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the world enters a new year, many public health and infectious disease experts predict that monitoring for new coronavirus variants will be an increasingly important part of Covid-19 mitigation efforts – and some are turning their attention to a surge in cases in China.\n\nSubvariants of the Omicron coronavirus variant continue to circulate globally, and “we’re seeing Omicron do what viruses do, which is it picks up mutations along the way that helps it evade a little bit of immunity that’s induced by previous infection or vaccination,” said Andrew Pekosz, a microbiologist and immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\n“We haven’t seen any major jumps in terms of Omicron evolution in some time,” he said. But “it’s getting to that stage where it’s something that we have to continue to monitor.”\n\nIn the United States, the Omicron subvariants XBB.1.5, BQ.1.1, BQ.1, BA.5 and XBB are causing almost all Covid-19 infections, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFor this week, the CDC estimates that XBB.1.5 now causes 40.5% of cases in the US, followed by BQ.1.1 at 26.9%; BQ.1 at 18.3%; BA.5 at 3.7%; and XBB at 3.6%.\n\n“SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly changing and accumulating mutations in its genetic code over time. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are expected to continue to emerge,” CDC researchers write in their data tracker. “Some variants will emerge and disappear, while others will emerge and continue to spread and may replace previous variants.”\n\nOmicron’s offshoots appear to dominate globally as well, but as the coronavirus continues to spread – especially in China after Beijing’s rapid easing of restrictions – there is now concern about where Covid-19 trends could be heading in 2023 and the risk of new variants emerging.\n\n“It is a worry,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “And that, of course, has led to the CDC’s very recent announcement that they are going to oblige people who come to this country from China to be tested and test negative before they can come into the country.”\n\nUS health officials announced Wednesday that, starting January 5, travelers from China will be required to show a negative Covid-19 test result before flying to the country. Passengers traveling to the US from China will need to get tested no more than two days before flying and present proof of the negative test to their airline before boarding.\n\nOfficials also announced that the CDC is expanding the traveler-based Genomic Surveillance Program to airports in Seattle and Los Angeles, bringing the total number of airports participating to seven with about 500 weekly flights from at least 30 countries covered, including about 290 weekly flights from China and surrounding areas.\n\nThe Chinese government has not been sharing a lot of information about the genetic composition of the viruses that it’s seeing there, Schaffner said.\n\n“Because the Chinese government was not doing that, that was the main reason CDC put this new travel requirement in place. It’s certainly not to prevent simple transmission of Covid from China here. We’ve got plenty of Covid. That would be like telling people not to pour a bucket of water into a swimming pool,” he said. “This travel testing requirement is a way to buy us some time and help create somewhat of a buffer between ourselves and China, should a new variant suddenly appear in that country.”\n\nHe added that the US will need “as much time as possible” to update vaccines and antivirals to respond to a potential emerging variant of concern.\n\n‘It really is a bit of a black hole’\n\nThe US testing requirements for travelers will “buy some time,” but they won’t prevent new Covid-19 cases from coming to the United States or new variants from emerging, said Dr. Carlos Del Rio, the executive associate dean for the Emory School of Medicine and Grady Health System in Atlanta.\n\n“I don’t think we’re going to see much benefit, honestly,” he said of the travel requirements. “The most important thing we need right now is, we need the Chinese to have more transparency and tell us exactly what’s going on, and that is pretty much a diplomatic decision. This is about diplomacy.”\n\nIn terms of the genetic data on coronaviruses in China that is accessible to the public, “It really is a bit of a black hole,” Pekosz said. Almost 250 million people in China may have caught Covid-19 in the first 20 days of December, according to an internal estimate from the nation’s top health officials, Bloomberg News and the Financial Times reported last week.\n\n“To me, what’s really a concern is the ongoing infections and whether they’re producing more variants in China that might be of particular concern for us, and testing people before they get on a plane won’t answer that question,” Pekosz said.\n\n“What we really need is to do a much better job of sequencing the viruses from individuals who are traveling from China so that we can aid in terms of understanding what kinds of variants are circulating there,” he said, adding that throughout the pandemic, Chinese officials have not been very transparent about their data on variants.\n\nMore spread, more variants\n\nConstant spread of a virus is what can lead to the emergence of variants. The more a virus spreads, the more it mutates.\n\n“For a variant to emerge – and this is true not only for Covid, but for influenza and for a lot of other viruses – the most critical thing is, the more cases that you have, the more likely that the virus will start to accumulate mutations that might have the ability to evade immunity more effectively or to transmit more effectively,” Pekosz said.\n\n“So when you have a situation like what’s starting to turn out in China, where you’re going to have millions upon millions of infections, every one of those infections is just one additional opportunity for the virus to pick up a random mutation that might make it better at infecting people,” he said. “Combine that with the fact that the Chinese population has been using less-than-optimal vaccines and has apparently not been as good about putting boosters into their population as other countries have, that means that there’s probably a lower amount of immunity in the population.”\n\nHealth authorities in China have “noticeably increased” the number of coronavirus genome sequences and other related data they are submitting to the global database GISAID, an initiative that maintains databases for scientists around the world to share data on flu viruses and coronaviruses.\n\nBut many experts argue that it’s not enough.\n\nGISAID said in an email to CNN on Wednesday that China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and several regional centers in the country, “have noticeably increased the number of submissions of genome sequence and associated metadata from samples taken in recent days.”\n\nThe number of genome sequences from China grew to just shy of 1,000, as of Friday, according to GISAID.\n\nGISAID also confirmed that the sequences from China “all closely resemble known globally circulating variants seen in different parts of the world between July and December 2022,” compared with the 14.4 million genomes in its database.\n\n“These latest data provide a snapshot of the evolution of the Omicron variants and shows that these most recently shared sequences from China are closely related to variants that have been circulating for some time,” according to GISAID.\n\nWhat the future may hold\n\nCovid-19 is in a relatively “stable” state right now in the United States, but the nation still sees about 350 deaths related to the disease each day, said Dr. Jessica Justman, an associate professor of medicine in epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and senior technical director of the global health program ICAP.\n\nWhile Covid-19 levels remain far below those of prior surges, trends are on the rise in parts of the US, new hospital admissions have jumped nearly 50% over the past month, and there is growing concern that case numbers could soar after the winter holidays.\n\nTo reduce the risk of increased Covid-19 spread, Justman said, it will be important for people in the new year to continue to stay up-to-date with their Covid-19 vaccinations.\n\nOnly 14.6% of the US population ages 5 and older has gotten their updated booster shot, according to CDC data.\n\n“So where are we going? That does take me to China,” Justman said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“I’m concerned that China right now is one giant incubator of SARS-CoV-2. There is the potential to have so many infections and with that, new variants,” she said.\n\n“I think we’re going to be looking at new variants of concern” in 2023, Justman said. “The question is: Will we go back to a point where we have a variant of concern that causes such severe illness that we don’t get the benefit of our protection from prior infections and from prior vaccinations? … I’m going to be optimistic and say I don’t think we’re going to go back to that point.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/health/ba-5-more-reinfections/index.html", "title": "BA.5 is causing more Covid-19 reinfections, data suggests, but they ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s not your imagination: As the rapidly spreading BA.5 coronavirus subvariant causes a surge in infections across the United States, more people are catching Covid-19 for the second or third time.\n\nBut on average, these reinfections do not seem to be happening more rapidly, according to a new analysis from the gene sequencing company Helix.\n\nBA.5, another offshoot of the Omicron variant, is now causing about 80% of new Covid-19 infections in the United States, according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHelix, which sequences Covid-19 tests to monitor variants, recently plumbed its data to find out how many times the same person tested positive for Covid-19 and whether there are more reinfections now compared to earlier waves.\n\nOut of nearly 300,000 infections since March 2021, the share that are reinfections almost doubled from 3.6% during the BA.2 wave in May to 6.4% during the BA.5 wave in July.\n\nThese reinfections don’t seem to be getting closer together, however.\n\nIn April, during the BA.2 wave, the average time between positive Covid-19 tests for the same person was about 230 days; by July, it was about 270 days, or about nine months.\n\n“The most recent data we had pulled showed that the fraction of all infections that are reinfections have increased quite a bit. There was a jump,” said Shishi Luo, associate director of bioinformatics and infectious disease at Helix.\n\nLuo says she thinks a mix of factors – including waning immunity, broad spread and mutations to BA.5 that help it sneak past the body’s defenses – are probably all contributing to the increase.\n\nOn average, people who are getting reinfected now were last infected about nine months ago. That doesn’t mean there aren’t some recent cases in which people have gotten new bouts of Covid-19 just weeks apart. Luo can see those in the data. But they aren’t the norm.\n\n“Statistically speaking, you’re more likely to get reinfected the longer it has been since your last infection, just based on the data we’ve generated,” she said.\n\nThe Helix data echoes the results of a recent study on reinfection from Qatar, which routinely screens its 2.8 million residents for Covid-19, testing about 5% of the population each week.\n\nThe BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants arrived in Qatar in May and were dominating transmission by June.\n\nResearchers used the national screening data to look at instances of reinfection.\n\nThey found that people who’d had Covid-19 infections before the arrival of the Omicron variant had little protection against a reinfection that caused symptoms during the BA.5 wave: just 15%.

In other countries, the recombinant variant XBB has been rising quickly and appears to be fueling a new wave of cases in Singapore.

Normally, that would be a reason for hope that the nation could escape the surges of the past two pandemic winters.

New research suggests that changes in these variants make them impervious to the last lab-created antibodies available to help treat and prevent severe cases of Covid-19, and the US government has run out of money to incentivize the creation of new ones.\n\nA crowded field of rising variants\n\nIt’s not clear whether this gang of new variants will continue to run around together, each sharing a piece of the Covid-19 infection pie, or whether one will rise to outcompete the others, as has happened in previous surges.\n\nThough they each descend from slightly different branches of the Omicron family tree, these new offshoots have evolved to share many of the same mutations, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution.\n\nSome experts think this convergence means we’ve entered a new phase of the evolution of the virus, one that will see circulation of several variants at the same time.\n\n“What is likely to happen is that we have several co-circulating, semi-dominate lineages going into the winter season,” said Nathan Grubaugh, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\n“That’s because with convergent evolution, perhaps several different lineages can independently obtain similar transmissibility levels versus a single new variant taking over.\n\n“This is what predominantly happens for most pathogens, such as the flu and RSV,” Grubaugh wrote in an email. “Now that the virus has adapted pretty well to human transmission, most of what is circulating has high fitness.”\n\nMaria Van Kerkhove, the Covid-19 response technical lead for the World Health Organization, said Wednesday that the large mix of new variants was becoming more difficult for WHO to assess because countries were dialing back on their surveillance.\n\n“So we need to be prepared for this. Countries need to be in a position to conduct surveillance, to deal with increases in cases and perhaps deal with increases and hospitalizations. We don’t see a change in severity yet. And our vaccines remain effective, but we have to remain vigilant,” she said.\n\nInaction gives the virus an edge\n\nFor now, the Omicron subvariant BA.5 still holds the top spot in the US. According to CDC estimates, it caused about 68% of new infections in the US last week, but it is quickly being outcompeted by several new sublineages – notably BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.\n\nThe BQs each caused just 6% of new infections in the US last week, but in recent weeks, the share of new Covid-19 infections caused by these viruses has doubled every six to seven days – a rapid rate of growth against BA.5, which is already a highly fit virus, says Dr. Anthony Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nAnd these are just two of the new crop of Omicron descendants making a move.\n\n“The projections vary a little, but generally, most people feel somewhere in the middle of November that they’ll wind up being a substantial proportion and have bumped BA.5 off as the dominant variant,” Fauci told CNN.\n\nThese variants are different from BA.4 and BA.5, but they’re descended from those viruses, the result of genetic drift. So they share many parts of their genomes with that virus.\n\nTheir changes aren’t on the scale of what happened when the original Omicron arrived on the scene in November 2021. That strain of the virus, which is now long gone, came out of genetic left field, leaving researchers and public health officials scrambling to catch up.\n\nFauci says that this time, we are as ready as we could be for the latest batch of variants.\n\n“It isn’t that different from BA.5 that it would completely escape the protection that you would get from vaccine” – if people would just get the shot, Fauci said.\n\nThe bivalent booster vaccine, authorized in September, protects against the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\n“We have a BA.5 bivalent updated vaccine as a booster that we’re pushing people to do. It’s matched against the still-dominant variant, which is BA.5, and almost certainly will have a reasonably good degree of cross-protection against the BQ.1.1 and the others, and yet the uptake of these vaccines, as we are already in the middle of October, is disappointing,” he said.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the CDC, 14.8 million people have gotten an updated bivalent booster six weeks into the campaign promoting it. That’s less than 10% of the population that’s eligible to get one.\n\nThe poor uptake of the new boosters, combined with the immune evasiveness of the new variants and the waning of population immunity, is almost surely a recipe for rising cases and hospitalizations in the weeks ahead.\n\n“It’s probably going to be significantly bigger than the BA.5 wave, at least that’s what I expect,” said Mark Zeller, a project scientist who monitors variants at the Scripps Research Institute. But Zeller says he doesn’t expect this winter’s surge to reach heights of January’s Omicron wave.\n\nHotez says people shouldn’t panic about this news but should pay attention.\n\n“We’re underperforming as a nation with people getting their bivalent boosters,” Hotez said.\n\nThe genetic changes these variants share appear to help them escape the immunity created by vaccines and past infections – a recipe for reinfections and breakthrough infections, particularly for people who haven’t had an updated booster.\n\nCritical therapies could soon stop working\n\nCrucially, some of the variants also appear to be impervious to the last lab-created antibodies available to ward off severe Covid-19 infections: an antibody treatment called bebtelovimab, which is made by Eli Lilly, and the combination of two long-acting antibodies in Evusheld, a shot made by AstraZeneca that helps keep people who are immunocompromised from getting sick in the first place.\n\nIf these antibodies stop working against the virus, the United States will still have Covid-19 antiviral drugs like Paxlovid, molnupiravir and remedsivir to help those at risk of severe complications.\n\nBut antibody therapies are particularly important for people with immune function that has been blunted by drugs, disease or age. These are the same people whose bodies don’t respond robustly to vaccines.\n\nThe antibodies are also needed to help people who can’t take antiviral therapies because of possible reactions with other medications.\n\nWhite House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha says the federal government has been spurring the development of new monoclonal antibodies during the pandemic by promising to purchase new therapies after they’re made.\n\nThe government can’t do that anymore, he said, because Congress has declined to pass additional funding for the Covid-19 response.\n\nAs a result, development of new antibodies – and other new therapeutics – is lagging.\n\n“So even if we got money today, it would take us many months to bring a monoclonal into the marketplace, and we don’t have the money today anyway,” Jha told CNN.\n\nJha said that means the nation is facing fall and winter with a smaller arsenal against the virus, just when it needs to expand its options.\n\n“There is not a monoclonal sitting ready to go tomorrow that we could just buy off the shelf,” he said.\n\nAntibodies are a losing proposition for companies because it takes millions of dollars of investment to make them and because the virus is evolving so fast, they might be effective for only a few months.\n\n“That is a terrible business model,” Jha said.\n\nThe administration has been thinking about ways to commercialize some parts of the Covid-19 response – to get out of the business of buying vaccines and therapies – ultimately passing the costs on to consumers and insurers. But Jha says the process has to be guided by “the needs on the ground and the realities of the virus.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHe says current realities require that the government continue to incentivize the production of new therapies, and he expects that the Biden administration will again try to ask Congress to pass more funding to do that.\n\n“And the truth is that if we want monoclonals to protect high-risk people – which we do – then at this point, given the speed of viral evolution, the US government has to be a major player in that role,” Jha said. “The market cannot take care of it by itself.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/health/ba4-ba5-escape-antibodies-covid-vaccine/index.html", "title": "New coronavirus subvariants escape antibodies from vaccination ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOmicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 appear to escape antibody responses among both people who had previous Covid-19 infection and those who have been fully vaccinated and boosted, according to new data from researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, of Harvard Medical School.\n\nHowever, Covid-19 vaccination is still expected to provide substantial protection against severe disease, and vaccine makers are working on updated shots that might elicit a stronger immune response against the variants.\n\nThe levels of neutralizing antibodies that a previous infection or vaccinations elicit are several times lower against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants compared with the original coronavirus, according to the new research published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.\n\n“We observed 3-fold reductions of neutralizing antibody titers induced by vaccination and infection against BA4 and BA5 compared with BA1 and BA2, which are already substantially lower than the original COVID-19 variants,” Dr. Dan Barouch, an author of the paper and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\n“Our data suggest that these new Omicron subvariants will likely be able to lead to surges of infections in populations with high levels of vaccine immunity as well as natural BA1 and BA2 immunity,” Barouch wrote. “However, it is likely that vaccine immunity will still provide substantial protection against severe disease with BA4 and BA5.”\n\nThe newly published findings echo separate research by scientists at Columbia University.\n\nThey recently found that the BA.4 and BA.5 viruses were more likely to escape antibodies from the blood of fully vaccinated and boosted adults compared with other Omicron subvariants, raising the risk of vaccine-breakthrough Covid-19 infections.\n\nThe authors of that separate study say their results point to a higher risk for reinfection, even in people who have some prior immunity against the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 94.7% of the US population ages 16 and older have antibodies against the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 through vaccination, infection, or both.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 caused an estimated 35% of new Covid-19 infections in the United States last week, up from 29% the week before, according to data shared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 are the fastest spreading variants reported to date, and they are expected to dominate Covid-19 transmission in the United States, United Kingdom and the rest of Europe within the next few weeks, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\n‘COVID-19 still has the capacity to mutate further’\n\nIn the New England Journal of Medicine paper, among 27 research participants who had been vaccinated and boosted with the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, the researchers found that two weeks after the booster dose, levels of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron subvariants were much lower than the response against the original coronavirus.\n\nThe neutralizing antibody levels were lower by a factor of 6.4 against BA.1; by a factor of 7 against BA.2; by a factor of 14.1 against BA.2.12.1 and by a factor of 21 against BA.4 or BA.5, the researchers described.\n\nAmong 27 participants who had previously been infected with the BA.1 or BA.2 subvariants a median of 29 days earlier, the researchers found similar results.\n\nIn those with previous infection – most of whom also had been vaccinated – the researchers described neutralizing antibody levels that were lower by a factor of 6.4 against BA.1; by a factor of 5.8 against BA.2; by a factor of 9.6 against BA.2.12.1 and by a factor of 18.7 against BA.4 or BA.5.\n\nMore research is needed to determine what exactly the neutralizing antibody levels mean for vaccine effectiveness and whether similar findings would emerge among a larger group of participants.\n\n“Our data suggest that COVID-19 still has the capacity to mutate further, resulting in increased transmissibility and increased antibody escape,” Barouch wrote in the email. “As pandemic restrictions are lifted, it is important that we remain vigilant and keep studying new variants and subvariants as they emerge.”\n\nA separate study, published in the journal Nature last week, found that Omicron may evolve mutations to evade the immunity elicited by having a previous BA.1 infection, which suggests that vaccine boosters based on BA.1 may not achieve broad-spectrum protection against new Omicron subvariants like BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nAs for what all this means in the real world, Dr. Wesley Long, an experimental pathologist at Houston Methodist Hospital, told CNN that people should be aware that they could get sick again, even if they’ve had Covid-19 before.\n\n“I think I’m a little bit worried about people who’ve had it maybe recently having a false sense of security with BA.4 and BA.5 on the increase, because we have seen some cases of reinfection and I have seen some cases of reinfection with people who had a BA.2 variant in the last few months,” he said.\n\nSome vaccine makers have been developing variant-specific vaccines to improve the antibody responses against coronavirus variants and subvariants of concern.\n\n“Reinfections are going to be pretty inevitable until we have vaccines or widespread mandates that are going to prevent cases rising again. But the good news is that we are in, I think, a much better spot than we were without the vaccines,” said Pavitra Roychoudhury, an acting instructor at the University of Washington’s Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, who was not involved in the New England Journal of Medicine paper.\n\n“There’s so much of this virus out there that it seems inevitable,” she said about Covid-19 infections. “Hopefully the protections that we have in place are going to lead to mostly mild infection.”\n\nEfforts underway to update Covid-19 vaccines\n\nModerna’s bivalent Covid-19 vaccine booster, named mRNA-1273.214, elicited a “potent” immune responses against the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, the company said Wednesday.\n\nThis bivalent booster vaccine candidate contains components of both Moderna’s original Covid-19 vaccine and a vaccine that targets the Omicron variant. The company said it is working to complete regulatory submissions in the coming weeks requesting to update the composition of its booster vaccine to be mRNA-1273.214.\n\n“In the face of SARS-CoV-2’s continued evolution, we are very encouraged that mRNA-1273.214, our lead booster candidate for the fall, has shown high neutralizing titers against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, which represent an emergent threat to global public health,” Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said in Wednesday’s announcement. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\n\n“We will submit these data to regulators urgently and are preparing to supply our next generation bivalent booster starting in August, ahead of a potential rise in SARS-CoV-2 infections due to Omicron subvariants in the early fall,” Bancel said.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is meeting next week to discuss the composition of Covid-19 vaccines that could be used as boosters this fall.\n\nThe data that Moderna released Wednesday, which has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, showed that one month after a 50-microgram dose of the mRNA-1273.214 vaccine was administered in people who had been vaccinated and boosted, the vaccine elicited “potent” neutralizing antibody responses against BA.4 and BA.5, boosting levels 5.4-fold in all participants regardless of whether they had a prior Covid-19 infection and by 6.3-fold in the subset of those with no history of prior infection. These levels of neutralizing antibodies were about 3-fold lower than previously reported neutralizing levels against BA.1, Moderna said.\n\nThese findings add to the data that Moderna previously released earlier this month, showing that the 50-microgram dose of the bivalent booster generated a stronger antibody response against Omicron than the original Moderna vaccine.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nModerna’s data suggest that “the bivalent booster might confer greater protection against the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron strains than readministering the original vaccine to increase protection across the population. Although the information is based on antibody levels, the companies comment that similar levels of antibody protected against clinical illness caused by other strains is the first suggestion of an emerging ‘immune correlate’ of protection, although it is hoped that this ongoing study is also assessing rates of clinical illness as well as antibody responses,” Penny Ward, an independent pharmaceutical physician and visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, said in a statement released by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Wednesday. She was not involved in Moderna’s work.\n\n“It has been reported previously that the bivalent vaccine is well tolerated with temporary ‘reactogenic’ effects similar to those following the univalent booster injection so we can anticipate that this new mixed vaccine should be well tolerated,” Ward said in part. “As we head towards the autumn with omicron variants dominating the covid infection landscape, it certainly makes sense to consider use of this new bivalent vaccine, if available.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/960455/quiz-of-the-week-7-14-april", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 7 - 14 April | The Week UK", "text": "Joe Biden’s visit to Ireland this week to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement has been closely watched by politicians both in Stormont and Westminster.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party refused to end its power-sharing blockade ahead of the US president’s arrival in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, resulting in a scaled-down visit.

An analysis of samples collected from India’s western state of Maharashtra has revealed local rises in the two mutations since December.\n\n“This double mutant could be a major reason behind the upsurge in Covid cases, but we need to wait for test results to determine if it is the case,” Mishra added.\n\n“Double mutation happens when two mutated variants of a virus come together to form a third variant,” M.C. Mishra, a former medical superintendent at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, told Deutsche Welle .\n\nIndia’s Health Ministry says the new strain carries two mutations of the coronavirus, E484Q and L452R, that “are not new”, the US broadcaster reports.

We are definite that the mutation is around, but it is too early to say what the exact effects are.”\n\nMedics in other countries are also anxious about the potential risks posed by the new double mutation strain.\n\nDr Kavita Patel, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington D.C., told CNBC that “it is something to watch very closely, and something that will not be limited to India. It is something we will likely see around the world as we have with other variants.”\n\n“This double mutation, number one, is incredibly serious. Number two, it is probably just the tip of the iceberg in what we would worry about in Asia,” added Patel, who served as a policy director in the Barack Obama administration.\n\n‘Five-step strategy’\n\nThe total tally of Covid cases reported in India stands at more than 12 million, while the death toll is approaching 165,000, according to latest figures from John Hopkins University.\n\nThe rise of the double mutation has dashed hopes that India had achieved a degree of herd immunity. Optimism rose after cases fell from around 100,000 infections per day in September to 11,000 per day in February.\n\nSuch a dramatic drop is unusual, especially as the country did not take any obvious steps to reduce infections, while also gradually reopening its economy over the same time period.\n\nBut whatever the reason for the brief respite, India’s healthcare system is now buckling under the strain of the fresh wave of infections.\n\nBosses at four major private hospitals in Nagpur, a city of 2.4 million people in Maharashtra, told The Telegraph that their facilities were at full capacity - a pattern being repeated across much of the country.\n\nThe newspaper adds that “local healthcare activists claim public hospitals are unable to admit patients without a high-profile referral”, while Indian news channel NDTV reports that viral photos on social media show that pairs of patients are being “crammed into single beds” at the Nagpur Government Medical College Hospital.\n\nAmid calls for urgent action, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan has announced a “five-step strategy” to drive down infections, “including effective containment and contact tracing for at least 14 successive days in 46 districts”.\n\nThe government “urged state health authorities to do their best to make sure that the new situation doesn’t undo India’s last year gains”, The India Express reports.

Look out for your roundup every Wednesday. If you haven’t subscribed yet, sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\nNearly two-and-a-half years since the coronavirus pandemic began, the most infectious and transmissible variant yet has arrived.\n\nRepeated Covid-19 waves have left millions of people dead, with only vaccines helping to blunt the toll. Now the virus is spreading again — evolving, escaping immunity and driving an uptick in cases and hospitalizations. The latest version of its shape-shifting, BA.5, is a clear sign that the pandemic is far from over.\n\nThe newest offshoot of Omicron, along with a closely related variant, BA.4, are fueling a global surge in cases — 30% over the past fortnight, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn Europe, the Omicron subvariants are powering a spike in cases of about 25%, though Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Program, has said that number may actually be higher, given the “almost collapse in testing.” BA.5 is on the march in China, ratcheting anxieties that major cities there may soon re-enforce strict lockdown measures that were only recently lifted. And the same variant has become the dominant strain in the United States, where it accounted for 65% of new infections last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nDr. Fauci explains why new BA.5 subvariant is concerning 04:58 - Source: CNN\n\n“We have been watching this virus evolve rapidly. We’ve been planning and preparing for this moment. And the message that I want to get across to the American people is this: BA.5 is something we’re closely monitoring, and most importantly, we know how to manage it,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, in a news briefing on Tuesday.\n\nOn the same day, WHO’s Emergency Committee said Covid-19 remained a Public Health Emergency of International Concern — its highest level of alert, first declared on January 20, 2020 — amid rising cases, ongoing viral mutation and increasing pressure on already overstretched health systems. In a statement, the committee, which is made up of independent experts, highlighted challenges to the ongoing global Covid-19 response, including a drop-off in testing and spotty genome sequencing, raising the question of just how accurately any nation might reasonably be able to monitor BA.5.\n\nOfficial data dramatically undercount the true number of infections in the US, epidemiologists say, leaving the nation with a critical blind spot as the most transmissible coronavirus variant yet takes hold. Some experts think there could be as many as 1 million new infections every day in the broader US population — 10 times higher than the official count.\n\nAs for how to manage the new wave, Jha urged Americans aged 50 and older to get second booster shots. Adults who are up to date with vaccinations are less likely to be hospitalized than those who are unvaccinated. But only about one in four adults in the US over 50 have gotten their recommended second boosters, data collected by the CDC show.\n\nUS health officials are urgently working on a plan to allow second Covid-19 boosters for all adults, a senior White House official confirmed to CNN on Monday, amid fears that younger adults’ immunity may be waning as Covid-19 cases rise with the dominance of BA.5.\n\nWhat makes BA.5 different? Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research, has called BA.5 “the worst version of the virus we’ve seen.” He explained in a recent newsletter: “It takes immune escape, already extensive, to the next level, and, as a function of that, enhanced transmissibility,” well beyond earlier versions of Omicron.\n\nIn other words, BA.5 can easily evade immunity from previous infections and vaccines, increasing the risk of reinfection. Though the variant does not appear to lead to more severe illness, in an interview with CNN on Monday, Topol said that given the extent of BA.5’s immune evasion, he expects to see an escalation in hospitalizations, as we’ve seen in Europe and elsewhere that the variant has taken root. “One good thing is it doesn’t appear to be accompanied by the ICU admissions and the deaths as previous variants, but this is definitely concerning,” he added.\n\nPublic health experts in the US may take some solace from the trajectory of the variant in Europe. WHO’s Ryan said last week that while many European countries are experiencing a jump in hospitalizations, “what we’re not seeing is an increase in intensive care unit admissions, so the vaccines are very much still working and it is those gaps in immunity that are causing the problem.”\n\nBut still, steep reductions in Covid-19 surveillance worldwide are hindering epidemiologists’ efforts as they race to trace the virus’ evolution.\n\n“Sub-variants of Omicron, like BA.4 and BA.5, continue to drive waves of cases, hospitalization and death around the world,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a media briefing on Tuesday. “Surveillance has reduced significantly – including testing and sequencing – making it increasingly difficult to assess the impact of variants on transmission, disease characteristics, and the effectiveness of counter-measures.”\n\n“New waves of the virus demonstrate again that the Covid-19 [pandemic] is nowhere near over,” he added.\n\nYOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.\n\nQ: Will we ever know how the pandemic began?\n\nA: A team of international scientists tasked with understanding the origins of the coronavirus pandemic released its first report on Thursday, saying that all hypotheses remain on the table, including a possible laboratory incident.\n\n“I don’t think that most people should have to change their daily activities, but I do think people need to be aware of their risk of contracting Covid-19 if they don’t take additional precautions,” Wen said. The question to ask yourself, she added, is this: How much do I want to continue to avoid infection?\n\nFor individuals who want to reduce their risk, Wen advises that they stay up to date with their boosters (in the US, everyone age 5 and older can receive a first booster, and those 50 and older can receive a second booster for a total of four shots). She also recommends wearing a high-quality N95 mask or equivalent in indoor, crowded settings, and staying outside for large gatherings as much as possible — something easier to do in the summertime.\n\n“For those who find masks uncomfortable, I’d encourage mask-wearing in the highest-risk settings — for example, mask while in a crowded security line at the airport and during boarding and deplaning,” she said.\n\nSend your questions here.

Those who are “not suitable” for vaccination will be exempt from the requirement, a city official said, without clarifying how they can provide the proof needed for exemption.\n\nThe vaccine mandate comes as Beijing reported three cases of the highly contagious Omicron subvariant. Several Chinese cities have imposed new curbs after detecting BA.5. Shanghai, which only recently emerged from a two-month lockdown, identified its first case on Friday and will perform two rounds of Covid tests this week. An outbreak of BA.5 has already shut down the northwestern city of Xi’an, home to 13 million people, where entertainment, sports and religious venues have been closed, and restaurants limited to takeaway and delivery services.\n\nCasinos in the gambling hub of Macao were ordered to shut for the first time since February 2020 because of a Covid outbreak, sending shares of their operating companies plunging, and fears of new lockdowns in Shanghai undermined the broader China market. Chinese stocks remained under pressure after Monday’s sell-off fueled by the threat of new Covid restrictions, especially the tech sector, Laura He reports.\n\nPeople stand in line at a coronavirus testing site in Beijing on July 4. Andy Wong/AP\n\nDrug-resistant infections and deaths have risen among hospital patients\n\nThe US had made significant progress in fighting drug-resistant infections in recent years. But those gains were largely erased during the Covid-19 pandemic, with hospital-acquired infections and resulting deaths rising 15% in 2020, according to new data, Deidre McPhillips reports.\n\nA special report released Tuesday by the CDC found that more than 29,400 people died from antimicrobial-resistant infections in the first year of the pandemic — nearly 40% of those deaths were among people who got the infection while in the hospital. The full number is probably even higher, given that data for half of the 18 pathogens identified as threats are unavailable or delayed.\n\nWHO has called antimicrobial resistance a “silent pandemic,” and drug-resistant infections were linked to nearly 5 million deaths globally in 2019. The Covid-19 pandemic probably contributed to the increased risk in the US, particularly because many people delayed care or left infections untreated — either because of closed clinics or fear of exposing themselves to Covid-19 — which can increase the risk of developing drug resistance.\n\nPulse oximeters don’t work as well for people of color\n\nOften when Dr. Thomas Valley sees a new patient in the intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine in Ann Arbor, he clamps a pulse oximeter on their finger — one of the many devices he uses to gauge their health and what course of care they require, whether they are a child having seizures, a teenage car accident victim or an older person with Covid-19.\n\nBut recently, Valley, an assistant professor in the University of Michigan’s Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, realized that the small device may yield less accurate oxygen readings in patients with dark skin. If the device isn’t calibrated correctly, the darker pigmentation can affect how the light is absorbed by the sensor, leading to flawed oxygen readings and patients being discharged when they shouldn’t.\n\nThe findings of Valley and his colleagues add to a growing body of research – dating back to the 1980s – that suggests flawed pulse oximeter readings among Black and brown patients can be a real and life-threatening issue in medical care. But the public has only recently been made more aware of this health disparity, and US health officials have announced plans to investigate the accuracy of pulse oximeters, Jacqueline Howard reports.\n\nTOP TIP\n\nAdvice for anxious new moms\n\nEdith Bracho-Sanchez, director of pediatric telemedicine and assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, didn’t think she’d be an anxious mom. But that changed when she had her son. “I stress over every decision I make for William. I make long pro and con lists, I discuss everything with my partner, sleep on things and ultimately, I pray,” she wrote in a recent column for CNN.\n\nKnowing how difficult it is to make decisions — big and small — she said she understood why some parents might struggle with the choice to vaccinate their children against Covid-19. This is why she says she did it, and her advice to anxious new moms like her:\n\nFirst, Covid-19 is an unpredictable illness. While most children have minor symptoms and recover well, many have landed in hospitals and emergency rooms, and to date, more than 400 children under the age of 5 have died from the illness in the US alone, according to the CDC. We also don’t yet fully understand the long-term effects of the disease.\n\nSecond, I know the vaccine is in the body for a short period of time and with a specific mission. It instructs the body to make protective antibodies against Covid-19, and the body’s own cellular mechanisms quickly break it down soon after. Because of this, there really is no plausible way it will interfere with my little William’s development, something about which I am constantly thinking.\n\nLISTEN TO OUR PODCAST\n\nIs it possible we’ve been going about conversation the wrong way our entire lives?

Most of these look like underachievers, with mutations of little consequence. But two of these offshoots – BA.2.12.1 and BA.2.12 – have been fueling a rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations in central New York state. And one of them, BA.2.12.1, is outpacing BA.2 in other regions, too.\n\nNew data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that BA.2.12.1 caused 19% of new Covid-19 infections in the US last week, up from an estimated 11% of cases the week before and 7% the week before that.\n\nThe speed at which BA.2.12.1 is outpacing BA.2 is roughly as fast as BA.2 outcompeted its cousin BA.1, according to Trevor Bedford, an epidemiologist and genomic scientist at the University of Washington’s School of Public Health.\n\nThough BA.2 is still very much around, it’s lost some ground. Last week, it caused an estimated 74% of Covid-19 cases, according to the CDC data, down from nearly 76% percent the week before.\n\nTogether, BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 accounted for an estimated 93% of new Covid-19 cases in the US last week.\n\n“BA.2.12.1 has increased rapidly in proportion in the US compared to other BA.2 sublineages,” especially in the region that includes New York and New Jersey, CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in an email.\n\nNew sublineages emerge\n\nLast week, the New York State Department of Health alerted residents to the new sublineages, warning that they were spreading about 25% faster than BA.2 and were causing Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations to increase, particularly in the central part of the state. It urged New Yorkers to “act swiftly” to consider wearing masks, to get booster vaccine doses, to get tested if they had symptoms and to seek treatment if infected.\n\nOfficials are concerned about BA.2 offshoots because they have swapped pieces of their spike proteins at key locations called L452Q and S704L.\n\nVirologists have seen mutations at those positions before. The Delta variant had a switch at 452, and this helped the virus bind more tightly to ACE2 receptors on our cells.\n\n“And those mutations are allowing the virus to enter cells faster and also contributing to evading antibody responses that are generated from vaccination or infection,” said Andy Pekosz of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\n“What we really just don’t know right now is how much those mutations are going to be contributing to increased spread or increased disease severity,” he said. “That’s something that’s going to take some time for us to figure out.”\n\nPekosz says he and others are working on that right now.\n\nThat cases are rising in New York is a bit worrisome, too. It means these viruses are good at getting past our immune defenses.\n\n“The vast majority of people in New York have either been vaccinated or infected or both. And so what we’re seeing is reinfections. We’re seeing this immune evasiveness,” said Dr. Daniel Griffin, a physician and researcher at Columbia University Medical Center.\n\nTwo other Omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5, have begun to circulate at low levels in other parts of the world, including South Africa, Botswana, Germany and Denmark. They also have mutations at 452, among others.\n\n“I think it’s interesting that we were moving into a different kind of regime for SARS-CoV-2 evolution, in that the virus is able to pick up mutations that are more transmissible, at least we’ve seen three times now with Omicron. So I think from a scientific point of view, that’s interesting,” said Shishi Luo, associate director of bioinformatics and infectious disease at Helix, a company that’s been tracking variants of the coronavirus.\n\nWill new sublineages affect public health?\n\nWhat that might mean for public health is still very much an open question. Luo says it’s too early to know how well the current Covid-19 vaccines defend against the subvariants, but she’s hopeful that because they are related to BA.2, protection against severe outcomes like hospitalization and death will hold up.\n\nShe notes that experts haven’t seen new subvariants drive up Covid-19 hospitalizations in countries like South Africa. So she’s hopeful that even if cases start to rise here, hospitalizations will continue to stay low.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIf you were vaccinated or previously infected – if your immune system has seen and recognized some of the virus before – and you catch Covid again, your chances of going to the hospital are reduced by about 90%, Griffin says. If you test positive quickly enough and get treatment, like monoclonal antibodies or Paxlovid, that’s another 90% reduction in the likelihood you’ll wind up in the hospital.\n\n“If we do everything right from here on out, we should not see a lot of people end up in the hospital,” Griffin said.\n\nHe points out that getting Covid is still not risk-free. He does occasionally see people who wound up with long Covid after being vaccinated and boosted.\n\n“It’s just a gamble. As long as people are getting infected, you keep having a chance of that despite vaccines,” Griffin said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}]}

Mohammad Nadeem Anwar and Saima Butt were supposed to fly from London-Heathrow to Islamabad, but were given a pair of termination letters instead of a gate assignment. A PIA spokesperson told Karachi-based newspaper DAWN that the airline had a zero-tolerance policy toward such behavior, a policy it has had to enforce on multiple occasions this year.\n\nAccording to reports from Scotland Yard, Anwar and Butt were arrested in the Terminal 3 departure lounge at Heathrow on Monday, and were each carrying one cell phone that had been reported stolen.

(AP) -- New crime data show Apple's addition of a \"kill switch\" to its iPhones last September has sharply reduced robberies and thefts, authorities said Thursday.\n\nThe report by state attorneys general, prosecutors, police and other officials from a year-old initiative called \"Secure Our Smartphones\" said Google and Microsoft will incorporate a kill switch into the next version of their operating systems on smartphones. The three systems - Android, iOS, and Windows Phone - are used in 97 percent of smartphones in the U.S.\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, part of the initiative, said the data show crimes meanwhile surged against people carrying phones without switches intended to make them useless to thieves.\n\n\"The statistics released today illustrate the stunning effectiveness of kill switches, and the commitments of Google and Microsoft are giant steps toward consumer safety,\" he said. The report noted a Consumer Reports estimate that 3.1 million mobile devices were stolen nationally in 2013, double a year earlier.\n\nIn New York City, robberies of Apple products fell 19 percent while grand larcenies dropped 29 percent in the first five months of 2014 compared with a year earlier, according to the report. Robberies and grand larcenies involving a Samsung smartphone, which didn't have a kill switch during much of that time, rose more than 40 percent. Samsung introduced a kill switch in April.\n\nCrime data from police in San Francisco and London, comparing the six months before Apple's switch to the six months following, showed similar trends, according to the report.\n\nIn San Francisco, iPhone robberies declined 38 percent, while robberies of Samsung devices increased 12 percent.\n\nIn London, Apple thefts declined 24 percent, while Samsung thefts increased 3 percent.\n\nSan Francisco District Attorney George Gascon, also part of the initiative, said that the statistics prove that a technological solution to prevent theft was possible. He called for legislation \"at all levels\" to make anti-theft solutions mandatory.\n\n\"Compared to all of the cool things smartphones can do these days, this is not that advanced,\" Gascon said. \"I believe ending the victimization of millions of Americans is the coolest thing a smartphone can do.\"\n\nGoogle spokesman Christopher Katsaros said Thursday the next version of Android will include \"a factory reset protection solution to help deter smartphone theft.\" The company plans to release more details shortly, he said.\n\nMicrosoft plans to offer \"theft-deterrent features\" as an update for all phones running Windows Phone 8.0 and newer, subject to mobile operator and phone manufacturer approvals by July 2015, vice president Fred Humphries posted online Thursday.

In 2017, the Chinese government was offering to spend $100 million to build an ornate Chinese garden at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. Complete with temples, pavilions and a 70-foot white pagoda, the project thrilled local officials, who hoped it would attract thousands of tourists every year.\n\nBut when US counterintelligence officials began digging into the details, they found numerous red flags. The pagoda, they noted, would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in Washington DC, just two miles from the US Capitol, a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection, multiple sources familiar with the episode told CNN.\n\nAlso alarming was that Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with materials shipped to the US in diplomatic pouches, which US Customs officials are barred from examining, the sources said.\n\nFederal officials quietly killed the project before construction was underway. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the security concerns in 2018.\n\nThe canceled garden is part of a frenzy of counterintelligence activity by the FBI and other federal agencies focused on what career US security officials say has been a dramatic escalation of Chinese espionage on US soil over the past decade.\n\nSince at least 2017, federal officials have investigated Chinese land purchases near critical infrastructure, shut down a high-profile regional consulate believed by the US government to be a hotbed of Chinese spies and stonewalled what they saw as clear efforts to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities.\n\nAmong the most alarming things the FBI uncovered pertains to Chinese-made Huawei equipment atop cell towers near US military bases in the rural Midwest. According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, the FBI determined the equipment was capable of capturing and disrupting highly restricted Defense Department communications, including those used by US Strategic Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile broad concerns about Huawei equipment near US military installations have been well known, the existence of this investigation and its findings have never been reported. Its origins stretch back to at least the Obama administration. It was described to CNN by more than a dozen sources, including current and former national security officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nF.E. Warren Air Force Base, a strategic missile base, is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, an area near a host of cell towers using Huawei equipment. From F.E. Warren Air Force Base/Facebook\n\nIt’s unclear if the intelligence community determined whether any data was actually intercepted and sent back to Beijing from these towers. Sources familiar with the issue say that from a technical standpoint, it’s incredibly difficult to prove a given package of data was stolen and sent overseas.\n\nThe Chinese government strongly denies any efforts to spy on the US. Huawei in a statement to CNN also denied that its equipment is capable of operating in any communications spectrum allocated to the Defense Department.\n\nBut multiple sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN that there’s no question the Huawei equipment has the ability to intercept not only commercial cell traffic but also the highly restricted airwaves used by the military and disrupt critical US Strategic Command communications, giving the Chinese government a potential window into America’s nuclear arsenal.\n\n“This gets into some of the most sensitive things we do,” said one former FBI official with knowledge of the investigation. “It would impact our ability for essentially command and control with the nuclear triad. “That goes into the ‘BFD’ category.”\n\n“If it is possible for that to be disrupted, then that is a very bad day,” this person added.\n\nTurning doves into hawks\n\nFormer officials described the probe’s findings as a watershed moment. The investigation was so secret that some senior policymakers in the White House and elsewhere in government weren’t briefed on its existence until 2019, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThat fall, the Federal Communications Commission initiated a rule that effectively banned small telecoms from using Huawei and a few other brands of Chinese made-equipment. “The existence of the investigation at the highest levels turned some doves into hawks,” said one former US official.\n\nIn 2020, Congress approved $1.9 billion to remove Chinese-made Huawei and ZTE cellular technology across wide swaths of rural America.\n\nBut two years later, none of that equipment has been removed and rural telecom companies are still waiting for federal reimbursement money. The FCC received applications to remove some 24,000 pieces of Chinese-made communications equipment—but according to a July 15 update from the commission, it is more than $3 billion short of the money it needs to reimburse all eligible companies.\n\nAbsent more money from Congress, the FCC says it plans to begin reimbursing approved companies for about 40 percent of the costs of removing Huawei equipment. The FCC did not specify a timeframe on when the money will be disbursed.\n\nIn late 2020, the Justice Department referred its national security concerns about Huawei equipment to the Commerce Department, and provided information on where the equipment was in place in the US, a former senior US law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nAfter the Biden administration took office in 2021, the Commerce Department then opened its own probe into Huawei to determine if more urgent action was needed to expunge the Chinese technology provider from US telecom networks, the former law enforcement official and a current senior US official said.\n\nThat probe has proceeded slowly and is ongoing, the current US official said. Among the concerns that national security officials noted was that external communication from the Huawei equipment that occurs when software is updated, for example, could be exploited by the Chinese government.\n\nDepending on what the Commerce Department finds, US telecom carriers could be forced to quickly remove Huawei equipment or face fines or other penalties.\n\nReuters first reported the existence of the Commerce Department probe.\n\n“We cannot confirm or deny ongoing investigations, but we are committed to securing our information and communications technology and services supply chain. Protecting US persons safety and security against malign information collection is vital to protecting our economy and national security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nInside Huawei's connection to rural America 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nUS counterintelligence officials have recently made a priority of publicizing threats from China. This month, the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a warning to American businesses and local and state governments about what it says are disguised efforts by China to manipulate them to influence US policy.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray just traveled to London for a joint meeting with top British law enforcement officials to call attention to the Chinese threats.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Wray said the FBI opens a new China counterintelligence investigation every 12 hours. “That’s probably about 2,000 or so investigations,” said Wray. “And that’s not even talking about their cyber theft, where they have a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined, and have stolen more of Americans’ personal and corporate data than every nation combined.”\n\nAsked why after years of national security concerns raised over Huawei, the equipment is still largely in place atop cell towers near US military bases, Wray said that, “We’re concerned about allowing any company that is beholden to a nation state that doesn’t adhere to and share our values, giving that company the ability to burrow into our telecommunications infrastructure.”\n\nHe noted that in 2020, the DOJ indicted Huawei with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\n“And I think that’s probably about all I can say on the topic,” said Wray.\n\nCritics see xenophobic overreach\n\nDespite its tough talk, the US government’s refusal to provide evidence to back up its claims that Huawei tech poses a risk to US national security has led some critics to accuse it of xenophobic overreach. The lack of a smoking gun also raises questions of whether US officials can separate legitimate Chinese investment from espionage.\n\n“All of our products imported to the US have been tested and certified by the FCC before being deployed there,” Huawei said in its statement to CNN. “Our equipment only operates on the spectrum allocated by the FCC for commercial use. This means it cannot access any spectrum allocated to the DOD.”\n\n“For more than 30 years, Huawei has maintained a proven track record in cyber security and we have never been involved in any malicious cyber security incidents,” the statement said.\n\nIn its zeal to sniff out evidence of Chinese spying, critics argue the feds have cast too wide a net — in particular as it relates to academic institutions. In one recent high-profile case, a federal judge acquitted a former University of Tennessee engineering professor whom the Justice Department had prosecuted under its so-called China Initiative that targets Chinese spying, arguing “there was no evidence presented that [the professor] ever collaborated with a Chinese university in conducting NASA-funded research.”\n\nAnd on Jan. 20, the Justice Department dropped a separate case against an MIT professor accused of hiding his ties to China, saying it could no longer prove its case. In February, the Biden administration shut down the China Initiative entirely.\n\nThe federal government’s reticence across multiple administrations to detail what it knows has led some critics to accuse the government of chasing ghosts.\n\n“It really comes down to: do you treat China as a neutral actor — because if you treat China as a neutral actor, then yeah, this seems crazy, that there’s some plot behind every tree,” said Anna Puglisi, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “However, China has shown us through its policies and actions it is not a neutral actor.”\n\nChinese tech in the American heartland\n\nAs early as the Obama administration, FBI agents were monitoring a disturbing pattern along stretches of Interstate 25 in Colorado and Montana, and on arteries into Nebraska. The heavily trafficked corridor connects some of the most secretive military installations in the US, including an archipelago of nuclear missile silos.\n\nFor years, small, rural telecom providers had been installing cheaper, Chinese-made routers and other technology atop cell towers up and down I-25 and elsewhere in the region. Across much of these sparsely populated swaths of the west, these smaller carriers are the only option for cell coverage. And many of them turned to Huawei for cheaper, reliable equipment.\n\nBeginning in late 2011, Viaero, the largest regional provider in the area, inked a contract with Huawei to provide the equipment for its upgrade to 3G. A decade later, it has Huawei tech installed across its entire fleet of towers, roughly 1,000 spread over five western states.\n\nAs Huawei equipment began to proliferate near US military bases, federal investigators started taking notice, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Of particular concern was that Huawei was routinely selling cheap equipment to rural providers in cases that appeared to be unprofitable for Huawei — but which placed its equipment near military assets.\n\nFederal investigators initially began “examining [Huawei] less from a technical lens and more from a business/financial view,” explained John Lenkart, a former senior FBI agent focused on counterintelligence issues related to China. Officials studied where Huawei sales efforts were most concentrated and looked for deals that “made no sense from a return-on-investment perspective,” Lenkart said.\n\n“A lot of [counterintelligence] concerns were uncovered based on” those searches, Lenkart said.\n\nBy examining the Huawei equipment themselves, FBI investigators determined it could recognize and disrupt DOD-spectrum communications — even though it had been certified by the FCC, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\n\n“It’s not technically hard to make a device that complies with the FCC that listens to nonpublic bands but then is quietly waiting for some activation trigger to listen to other bands,” said Eduardo Rojas, who leads the radio spectrum lab at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. “Technically, it’s feasible.”\n\nTo prove a device had clandestine capabilities, Rojas said, would require technical experts to strip down a device “to the semi-conductor level” and “reverse engineer the design.” But, he said, it can be done.\n\nAnd there was another big concern along I-25, sources familiar with the investigation said.\n\nWeather camera worries\n\nAround 2014, Viaero started mounting high-definition surveillance cameras on its towers to live-stream weather and traffic, a public service it shared with local news organizations. With dozens of cameras posted up and down I-25, the cameras provided a 24-7 bird’s eye view of traffic and incoming weather, even providing advance warning of tornadoes.\n\nBut they were also inadvertently capturing the movement of US military equipment and personnel, giving Beijing — or anyone for that matter — the ability to track the pattern of activity between a series of closely guarded military facilities.\n\nThe intelligence community determined the publicly posted live-streams were being viewed and likely captured from China, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Two sources briefed on the investigation at the time said officials believed that it was possible for Beijing’s intelligence service to “task” the cameras — hack into the network and control where they pointed. At least some of the cameras in question were running on Huawei networks.\n\nViaero CEO Frank DiRico said it never occurred to him the cameras could be a national security risk.\n\n“There’s a lot of missile silos in areas we cover. There is some military presence,” DiRico said in an interview from his Colorado office. But, he said, “I was never told to remove the equipment or to make any changes.”\n\nIn fact, DiRico first learned of government concerns about Huawei equipment from newspaper articles — not the FBI — and says he has never been briefed on the matter.\n\nDiRico doesn’t question the government’s insistence that he needs to remove Huawei equipment, but he is skeptical that China’s intelligence services can exploit either the Huawei hardware itself or the camera equipment.\n\n“We monitor our network pretty good,” DiRico said, adding that Viaero took over the support and maintenance for its own networks from Huawei shortly after installation. “We feel we’ve got a pretty good idea if there’s anything going on that’s inappropriate.”\n\nScouring the country for Chinese investments\n\nBy the time the I-25 investigation was briefed to the White House in 2019, counterintelligence officials begin looking for other places Chinese companies might be buying land or offering to develop a piece of municipal property, like a park or an old factory, sometimes as part of a “sister city” arrangement.\n\nIn one instance, officials shut down what they believed was a risky commercial deal near highly sensitive military testing installations in Utah sometime after the beginning of the I-25 investigation, according to one former US official. The military has a test and training range for hypersonic weapons in Utah, among other things.

Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nBill Evanina, who until early last year ran the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told CNN that it can sometimes be hard to differentiate between a legitimate business opportunity and espionage — in part because both might be happening at the same time.\n\n“What we’ve seen is legitimate companies that are three times removed from Beijing buy [a given] facility for obvious logical reasons, unaware of what the [Chinese] intelligence apparatus wants in that parcel [of land],” Evanina said. “What we’ve seen recently — it’s been what’s underneath the land.”\n\n“The hard part is, that’s legitimate business, and what city or town is not going to want to take that money for that land when it’s just sitting there doing nothing?” he added.\n\nA complicated problem\n\nAfter the results of the I-25 investigation were briefed to the Trump White House in 2019, the FCC ordered that telecom companies who receive federal subsidies to provide cell service to remote areas — companies like Viaero — must “rip and replace” their Huawei and ZTE equipment.\n\nThe FCC has since said that the cost could be more than double the $1.9 billion appropriated in 2020 and absent an additional appropriation from Congress, the agency is only planning to reimburse companies for a fraction of their costs.\n\nGiven the staggering strategic risk, Lenkart said, “rip and replace is a very blunt and inefficient remediation.”\n\nDiRico, the CEO of Viaero, said the cost of “rip and replace” is astronomical and that he doesn’t expect the reimbursement money to be enough to pay for the change. According to the FCC, Viaero is expected to receive less than half of the funding it is actually due. Still, he expects to start removing the equipment within the next year.\n\n“It’s difficult and it’s a lot of money,” DiRico said.\n\nSome former counterintelligence officials expressed frustration that the US government isn’t providing more granular detail about what it knows to companies — or to cities and states considering a Chinese investment proposal. They believe that not only would that kind of detail help private industry and state and local governments understand the seriousness of the threat as they see it, but also help combat the criticism that the US government is targeting Chinese companies and people, rather than Chinese state-run espionage.\n\n“This government has to do a better job of letting everyone know this is a Communist Party issue, it’s not a Chinese people issue,” Evanina said. “And I’ll be the first to say that the government has to do better with respect to understanding the Communist Party’s intentions are not the same intentions of the Chinese people.”\n\nA current FBI official said the bureau is giving more defensive briefings to US businesses, academic institutions and state and local governments that include far more detail than in the past, but officials are still fighting an uphill battle.\n\n“Sometimes I feel like we’re a lifeguard going out to a drowning person, and they don’t want our help,” said the current FBI official. But, this person said, “I think sometimes we [the FBI] say ‘China threat,’ and we take for granted what all that means in our head. And it means something else to the people that we’re delivering it to.”\n\n“I think we just need to be more careful about how we speak about it and educate folks on why we’re doing what we’re doing.”\n\nIn the meantime, the “rip and replace” program has remained fiercely controversial.\n\n“It’s not going to be easy,” DiRico said. “I’m going to be up nights worrying about it, but we’ll do what we’re told to do.”\n\nThis story has been updated to reference Wall Street Journal reporting.", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/05/02/bitcoin-cyber-currency-uk-case-grant-west/465075002/", "title": "Cryptocurrency seizure in London is first for Scotland Yard", "text": "LONDON — When Grant West was arrested on a train last year by undercover British police, surveillance footage showed passengers clapping at what looked like the quick capture of another petty criminal.\n\nBut West's arrest was a milestone for Scotland Yard: The 25-year-old was the first cybercriminal taken into custody and had his Bitcoin currency, worth about $700,000, seized by London Metropolitan Police.\n\n\"These people generally feel they can operate with impunity, that they can't be touched. We have now debunked that,\" said Mick Gallagher, the police investigator who led the two-year covert operation.\n\nA British court said Wednesday that West would be sentenced on May 25. His girlfriend, Rachael Brookes, an accomplice, was sentenced to two years community service.\n\nWest, who used the online name “Courvoisier,” pleaded guilty in December to a cyberattack on a fast-food firm plus multiple other offenses. Investigators said he was behind cyberattacks on more than 100 companies, including supermarkets, gambling shops and cellphone companies between July and December 2015.\n\nHe used phishing emails to lure people into revealing personal information, including passwords and credit card numbers, police said. West then sold the data to vendors on hidden websites known as the Dark Web. He converted his proceeds into Bitcoin and stored it across several virtual currency accounts.\n\nMore:New York AG launches initial probe into 13 cryptocurrency exchanges\n\nMore:Bitcoin plunges on regulator caution to investors about 'potentially unlawful' platforms\n\n\"When it comes to transactions on the Dark Web, (people) nearly universally use cryptocurrency,\" said Alex Lakatos, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., who has worked extensively on cases of forfeiture.\"The use of virtual currency for illicit purposes has been a huge success.\"\n\nInvestigators were able to confiscate West's Bitcoin accounts because he was logged onto his laptop when he was arrested on the train. Police also took his laptop and found his encrypted access codes were saved on the computer.\n\nWhile the sums seized from West are relatively modest, his case shows challenges law enforcement face when trying to track digital money, or cryptocurrencies — whether stolen or acquired through criminal activities.\n\nBefore West, Britain had made just one other such seizure. Two years ago, police in southern England seized more than $1 million in Bitcoin after searching the home of a suspect who was later convicted of selling drugs and money-laundering. Police found a Bitcoin password on a piece of paper in the suspect's home.\n\nSharon Cohen Levin, an authority on money-laundering who spent more than two decades at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Manhattan, said investigators often could identify that specific digital money was being used in criminal activity but were unable to identify who that money belongs to.\n\n\"There is not necessarily any place, for example, that you can subpoena to find information about Bitcoin-related activity,\" she said.\n\nBoth Britain and the United States have struggled to figure out how to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nGallagher, with the Metropolitan Police, said there are more than 150 types of cryptocurrences allowing varying degrees of anonymity, and criminals have exploited their use.\n\nOne of the most well-known examples was used by a young Texan named Ross Ulbricht, also known as Dread Pirate Roberts. Ulbricht used Bitcoin to build a massive illegal narcotics empire known as Silk Road. The FBI needed to catch him red-handed to prove his guilt. After a lengthy investigation, the FBI finally swooped in to arrest Ulbricht in 2013 while he was logged onto his computer in a San Francisco public library.\n\nAlexandre Cazes, the alleged mastermind behind the now shuttered Dark Web marketplace AlphaBay, amassed digital coins worth millions of dollars when he was found dead in a jail cell in Thailand last year. U.S. Justice officials concluded that Cazes, a Canadian citizen, killed himself, possibly to avoid extradition to the United States. AlphaBay sold illegal drugs, weapons and stolen identities.\n\nThere have also been an increasing number of large cryptocurrency thefts.\n\nCoincheck, a digital currency exchange in Japan, lost more than $500 million in virtual assets in January after a hacking attack. In 2014, an estimated $400 million in Bitcoin was stolen from Mt. Gox, another digital currency exchange based in Japan.\n\nHenri Arslanian, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency specialist at the consulting firm PwC, said some forms of digital money such as Bitcoin allow criminals to conduct \"decentralized, anonymous and instantaneous\" transactions.\n\nHe noted that cryptocurrencies may not always be the best option: \"Cash still has many advantages over Bitcoin.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2021/05/05/judge-rejects-speedy-trial-motion-triple-murder-suspect-sergio-correa/4956948001/", "title": "Judge rejects speedy trial motion for triple-murder suspect Sergio ...", "text": "NEW LONDON - During the first in-person court proceeding in a Griswold triple-murder case in months, a New London Superior Court judge on Wednesday again denied the defense’s motions for a speedy trial and a change of venue while also quashing a request to halt a warrant application submitted by the state.\n\nThe afternoon hearing before Judge Hunchu Kwak was convened to deal with several “housekeeping issues” left unresolved or that had arisen since a suppression hearing in October, said Attorney Joseph Lopez.\n\nLopez, along with co-councilor Corey Mainville, is representing 29-year-old Sergio Correa on murder, robbery, arson and other charges related to the brutal slayings of Kenneth, Janet and Matthew Lindquist in 2017.\n\nLopez unsuccessfully petitioned Kwak to prevent prosecutors from filing a new search warrant for Correa’s phone. The phone was the subject of a three-day suppression hearing in October during which Lopez argued it was seized illegally by state police detectives during a Dec. 28, 2017 interview with his client.\n\nThe iPhone 7 was seized without a warrant, though the state argues police had probable cause for its taking as it had been used in the commission of a crime. Police said the phone records showed Correa was the last person to have phone communications with Matthew Lindquist, the 21-year-old whose body was found in a wooded area near his family’s home months after being stabbed to death.\n\nLopez argued since Kwak has not yet ruled on the admissibility of the cell phone and its contents into evidence, any further searching of the phone’s data should be denied. Assistant State’s Attorney Stephen Carney said the FBI recently informed his office that technology had advanced enough to merit another search of the phone’s contents and would likely produce more information.\n\nKwak, in his ruling, said Lopez would have the opportunity to challenge the admissibility of any new information.\n\nKwak did support a separate motion by Lopez requesting the state produce documentation on how the Cellebrite company handled its inspection of the phone. The company, whose mobile forensics software is frequently used by law enforcement agencies, was at one point tasked by state police with trying to access Correa’s locked phone, though that process was not successful. The FBI was later able to gain access to the phone.\n\nKwak said Lopez’s arguments that Cellebrite’s operating procedures are relevant from a chain-of custody perspective, even if they could not open the phone, were valid. The state had already planned to bring in the former Cellebrite employee who handled the phone for cross-examination.\n\nRenewed motions by the defense for a speedy trial and change of venue were again rejected by Kwak based on the state Judicial Branch’s halting of criminal jury trials in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMainville noted juries have been seated for federal trials and three-judge panels for state criminal cases have also been selected. She also referenced the recent jury trial of former Minneapolis police office Derek Chauvin, found guilty in the death of George Floyd.\n\nUnswayed, Kwak reiterated his earlier stance that all jury trials in state courthouses are suspended and no jury selections for such cases have yet resumed, making any change of venue argument moot. He also reminded Mainville that her client was offered the option of a three-judge panel to hear his case.\n\n“I have no information on (when trials will resume) and if I did, I’d share it with you,” Kwak said. “I wish we could start next week. This case is number one on the list and I hope it can begin in September.”\n\nCorrea, dressed in a bright, yellow jail jumpsuit, spoke quietly to his lawyers during the proceedings as members of the Lindquist family watched the proceedings a few feet away.\n\nCorrea, who is being held on $3 million in bail, is accused, along with his adopted sister, Ruth, of fatally stabbing Matthew Lindquist before Sergio Correa brutally beat Kenneth and Janet to death in the hours before and after midnight on Dec. 20, 2017 as part of a scheme to steal rifles from the family’s 70 Kenwood Estates home.\n\nBoth Correas are charged with murder with multiple victims, three counts of felony murder, home invasion, first-degree robbery, first-degree arson and second-degree arson.\n\nRuth Correa previously confessed to helping her brother murder Matthew Lindquist, but denied taking part in the two parents’ murders – an assertion Correa disputes. She testified the robbery was planned by her sibling and Matthew Lindquist as part of a drugs-for-guns exchange that ended with her brother setting the Lindquist family's home on fire.\n\nShe is expected to testify against her sibling — as she did during a previous probable cause hearing — in exchange for a flat 40-year sentence on three counts of felony murder.\n\nJohn Penney can be reached at jpenney@norwichbulletin.com or at (860) 857-6965", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/04/27/knife-crime-britain-wales-national-emergency-record-stabbing-homicides/3470942002/", "title": "Knife crime in Britain: What's behind Britain's national emergency", "text": "LONDON – A boy, 7, threatens to \"knife\" a pregnant school teacher. Two high school students from opposite ends of the country, both 17, die in violent stabbings hours apart. After five separate knife attacks over four days in one area of Britain’s capital city, a 45-year-old woman's spinal cord is severed, leaving her paralyzed.\n\nKnife-related homicides took 285 lives in England and Wales from March 2017 to March 2018 – a record since data collection began in 1946. The data from the Office for National Statistics doesn't include Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\nUnlike the USA, where guns are tied to many deaths, only 4% of homicides here last year were from shootings; 39% were from \"sharp instruments,\" the top weapon.\n\nPolice leaders, youth workers and victims' families called for action over what Prime Minister Theresa May described as a public health emergency and a \"cancer\" affecting British society: violence by its youth.\n\nThe \"pervasive horror of knife crime\" must end, said Charles, prince of Wales, in his Easter message.\n\n\"It's getting worse, and I don't believe we've reached the peak,\" said Caroline Shearer, whose son Jay was fatally stabbed in 2012 at age 17.\n\nShearer runs Only Cowards Carry, an organization that teaches school kids about the grim physical realities of knife crime, from organ failure to macabre forensics, as part of an effort to prevent others from dying in similar circumstances.\n\n\"I was quite naive before my son was murdered. I believed that stabbings only occurred if drugs or gangs were involved,\" she said. Jay was killed by a vegetable knife at a private party. He was celebrating his exam results.\n\nMurder Inc. London's murder rate briefly tops New York City's\n\nCampaigners and academics have different explanations for what has caused the increase in knife crime when, official data shows, violent crime in Britain overall has fallen by about a quarter since 2013.\n\nSome blame socioeconomic factors, specifically cuts to public spending that reduced the reach of welfare programs that provide mental health services.\n\nOthers say the pervasive use of social media encourages copycat-like incidents. Still others point to fewer police on the streets, although May insists there is \"no direct correlation\" between a fall in police numbers and rising knife crime.\n\n\"We cannot simply arrest ourselves out of this problem,\" Britain's leader said this month during a summit on youth violence.\n\nThe number of incidents recorded by police on Britain's streets involving knives or sharp instruments is increasing – to 40,829 last year, a rise of 6 percent.\n\nAt least 40 people have been fatally stabbed in Britain in 2019. They came from all kinds of backgrounds, and at least 10 were teenagers, although the majority of homicide victims were from the 18- to 24-year-old group. Males are most affected.\n\nJodie Chesney was an enthusiastic Explorer Scout. Yousef Makki wanted to be a surgeon. The two 17-year-olds were stabbed to death on the same weekend in different parts of England.\n\nThe youngest victim, Jaden Moodie, 14, was pushed off a scooter and stabbed to death. Police said it was a targeted attack.\n\n\"This kind of phenomenon often seems to want to avoid being pinned down to cause and effect\" said David Wilson, a criminologist at England's Birmingham City University. \"What's clear is that lots of young men, in disproportionate numbers to what we've previously experienced, are being attacked, wounded and, in many cases, killed.\"\n\nStephen Addison, a former gang member and the founder of BoxUp Crime, an organization that works with inner city kids to combat youth crime and violence through boxing training, said he believes the real problem is Britain has a generation of young people who \"don't have purpose, who haven't connected to purpose.\"\n\n\"When you haven't connected to purpose, your time becomes limitless, and you do things without a concept of time, you make mistakes without a concept of time, you make decisions without a concept of time. A lot of kids are selling drugs, going to prison, coming out, stabbing people, going back to jail – all without a concept of time,\" said Addison, 28, who is exploring bringing BoxUp Crime to Los Angeles and New York City.\n\n\"The second young people connect with purpose, their time becomes limited. Then they start thinking: 'OK, I've only got a certain amount of time to do this, to box and make it to the Olympics or to set up a business.' We need to give these kids a sense of purpose.\"\n\nAddison turned his life around – found his purpose – at age 20 after he had a dream he was going to go to prison for murder. \"I am lucky to be doing what I'm doing,\" he said, adding that a lot of the friends he grew up with are either in prison or dead.\n\nIn December, Addison was awarded the British Empire Medal by Queen Elizabeth II for helping to change the lives of more than 4,000 young kids.\n\nThe rise in knife attacks in Britain – from 2011 and 2018, the number of crimes involving a \"sharp instrument\" has increased by almost a quarter – may be misleading for an American audience. Despite rhetoric from President Donald Trump that singled out Britain's knife issues, there is no place in Britain where it is as dangerous for a teenager, from a homicide perspective, as in the USA.\n\n\"I recently read a story that in London, which has unbelievably tough gun laws, a once very prestigious hospital, right in the middle, is like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds,\" Trump said last year while addressing a meeting of the National Rifle Association, which campaigns for Americans' right to bear arms.\n\n\"Yes, that's right, they don't have guns, they have knives, and instead there's blood all over the floors of this hospital,\" Trump said. \"Knives, knives, knives.\"\n\nIn the USA, 10,982 people were murdered in cases involving firearms in 2017 (the most recent period for which data was available), according to the FBI. In Britain, over the same period, there were 32.\n\nAfter a mass shooting at a school in 1996, Britain pursued legislative bans on assault rifles and handguns and tightened background checks for other types of firearms.\n\nHomicide rates:Gun violence rare in UK compared with USA\n\n\"Whether it's gun violence or knife violence, the best way to manage it is to select and recruit people who have access and trust by the people who are committing the violence to interrupt the spread. That stops the 'epidemic,' \" said Gary Slutkin, a physician and professor of epidemiology at the University of Illinois-Chicago.\n\nSlutkin has advocated treating violence, whether in the community, mass terrorism or hate crimes, as a contagious disease that needs to be managed like other public health threats. He developed his theory – that violence clusters, self-replicates and penetrates vulnerable communities like a contagious illness such as Ebola – while helping to fight infectious diseases when we worked for the World Health Organization in Africa.\n\nCentral to the idea is the use of \"Violence Interrupters,\" former gang members usually, who can intervene in petty disputes before they escalate and help educate and steer active gang members away from violence.\n\n\"The police can't do it on their own,\" Slutkin said. \"You need to treat it like an epidemic to get rid of it.\"\n\nCure Violence, the project Slutkin established to implement his idea, has been used by more than 50 communities in the USA and in dozens of countries from El Salvador to Syria.\n\nGlasgow, Scotland, used to have the highest murder rate of any city in Western Europe. Since adopting Slutkin's public heath approach to violence, murders have fallen. Mayor Sadiq Khan is exploring similar initiatives for London.\n\n\"It's quite incredible how when you speak to these youngsters, how matter of fact they are about knife crime,\" said Henry Smith, who founded Wickers Charity to help stop violent youth crime in east London after his brother-in-law was fatally stabbed outside an Indian restaurant two decades ago.\n\n\"It's not all of them, but they readily admit they carry knives, expect to be in fights and even stab people. They grow up with it,\" he said.\n\nShearer, whose son Jay was stabbed to death seven years ago, said she \"took heart\" from increased visibility around knife crime issues in Britain. \"The more time we take to solve this, the more deaths there will be,\" she warned.\n\nWant to read more?

Thousands of animals also died.\n\nDuring a cold snap on Dec. 5 that year, sulphur particles mixed with fumes from burning coal and made the yellow fog smell like rotten eggs. Some Londoners reported being unable to see their feet, and transportation was canceled with the exception of the London Underground. Birds flew into buildings, and robberies increased as thieves were able to make an easy getaway.\n\nThe smog eventually lifted on Dec. 9, after cold winds swept the fumes out to the North Sea.\n\nThe incident eventually led to the Clean Air Act of 1956, restricting the burning of coal in urban areas in the United Kingdom.\n\nA team of scientists now believe they have solved the mystery of the exact cause and nature of the fog, through lab experiments and measuring the atmosphere in China, which is home to 16 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world.\n\nTheir work was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n“People have known that sulfate was a big contributor to the fog, and sulfuric acid particles were formed from sulfur dioxide released by coal burning for residential use and power plants, and other means,” lead author Renyi Zhang, a scientist at Texas A&M University, said in a statement.\n\n“But how sulfur dioxide was turned into sulfuric acid was unclear. Our results showed that this process was facilitated by nitrogen dioxide, another co-product of coal burning, and occurred initially on natural fog.”\n\nThe study said that similar conditions often occur in China.\n\n“The difference in China is that the haze starts from much smaller nanoparticles, and the sulfate formation process is only possible with ammonia to neutralize the particles,” Zhang said.\n\nHe said sulfur dioxide is mainly emitted by power plants in China, while nitrogen dioxide comes from power plants and vehicles, and ammonia comes from fertilizer use and vehicles.\n\n“Again, the right chemical processes have to interplay for the deadly haze to occur in China. Interestingly, while the London fog was highly acidic, contemporary Chinese haze is basically neutral,” he added.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2018/08/26/lost-phone/1072054002/", "title": "Travel advice: What to do when you lose your phone while traveling", "text": "Christopher Elliott\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nOn a recent trip to London, Logan Abbott's phone disappeared. Although he's one of thousands of travelers whose gadgets go missing on the road, his story is remarkable.\n\nThat's because Abbott is the CEO of Wirefly.com, a company that helps consumers select a cellphone calling plan – an industry insider. You'd think a sophisticated phone user such as him would know how to prevent a loss. But it turns out anyone can lose a phone, even Abbott. The trick is in the recovery.\n\nMore than 29 million phones vanish each year according to Asurion, a company that insures smartphones, tablets and other electronics. Only 50 percent of people back up the data on their devices, and 28 percent of users said if they lost their gadget they would never be able to recover the data on it, according to research from Kaspersky, a cybersecurity and antivirus company.\n\nIf you lose your phone when you travel, you can take quick steps to recover it. And if you fail, you can at least restore your data and find a new device quickly.\n\nAbbott's recovery plan was simple but effective. \"I went to the Apple Store and bought a new iPhone,\" he says. \"Because I do daily backups to iCloud and my laptop, I was able to get back up and running with all my data without skipping a beat.\"\n\nHis advice? Remember to do a daily backup of your data.\n\n\"It’s also critical that you have a passcode on your phone so that whoever finds it can't access the data on your phone,\" he adds.\n\nWhat to do if you lose your phone when you travel\n\nIf your phone's gone, you'll want to go through the painful process of remotely wiping and bricking it. Call your mobile carrier as soon as you confirm your phone is lost so that they can disable the account. That way, you won't be responsible for any data use or phone calls made after the loss.\n\nReplacing the phone is pretty straightforward. Just visit the nearest phone store, buy a replacement, get a new SIM card – a smart card inside the phone that identifies you – attach the phone and SIM to your account, and you're back online. Mobile companies have different requirements. For example, AT&T requires a number called the IMEI and the SIM card serial number to activate a new phone. T-Mobile needs the SIM card number.\n\n\"Data recovery is a different story,\" says Andy Abramson, a frequent traveler who runs a Los Angeles communications agency.\n\nApple's iOS backs up to iCloud all the time, but it's not automatic. You have to set it up to perform the regular backup. If you're on Google's Android, everything is already backed up to the cloud, so you have to get online, and your contacts and data are synched. Abramson says it's important to understand your phone's backup mechanism before you travel, instead of trying to figure it out it after you've lost your phone.\n\nHow to not lose your phone when you travel\n\nKeep your cellphone close. At home, you can leave it lying around, but on the road, one careless moment could lead to a permanent loss. One solution is a new product called a Murray Belt ($50), a belt worn around the upper body that allows you convenient access to your phone and other travel documents. \"I wanted to develop a product that would provide a habitual location to keep my phone and put my mind at ease while I'm on the road,\" Murray Belt inventor Margaret Murray Bloom says.\n\nAnother storage idea: The PortaPocket WaistBelt & Pocket Kit ($26.95), a belt with interchangeable modules for storing your valuables.\n\nIf your phone goes missing, don't panic, says Lysa Myers, a security researcher at ESET, an antivirus software company. Your first step should always be to \"text or call your phone,\" she advises. \"That way, if it’s not really lost but just stuck in the couch cushions or something, you can locate it quickly.\"\n\nWhat else to pack\n\nThere's one foolproof way to avoid the panic that happens after you lose your phone when you travel.\n\n\"Carry a spare phone,\" says Andrea Woroch, a consumer expert. \"This way, you don’t get into a sticky situation should you lose your current phone, it gets stolen or even damaged by falling in the pool or ocean.\"\n\nThat's what I do. My kids inherited my old Pixel phone, and if I lose my phone, I'll borrow theirs. The children may not be happy, but at least we're still connected.\n\nHow to find your phone\n\n• Activate \"find my phone:\" On Android, you can go to the Find My Device page to retrieve the last known location of your device, but you have to activate the feature. Apple's Find My iPhone feature works similarly. Here's how to set up the service for your phone.\n\n• Use a tracker: One of the most popular trackers, Tile, works by connecting to your phone. But the device also has the reverse ability to find your phone. Simply double-press your Tile to make your phone ring – even if it’s on silent mode.\n\n• Try lost and found: It's not your father's lost-and-found department. Companies such as Crowdfind are using sophisticated technology to catalog found items and help track down owners. Airports such as Salt Lake City use Crowdfind to allow airport patrons to search the inventory at any time. You can verify ownership by giving a password to the device.\n\nChristopher Elliott is a consumer advocate.

It said all the missiles hit their target accurately.\n\n“The entire live-fire training mission has been successfully completed and the relevant air and sea area control is now lifted,” China’s statement said. Earlier, the Eastern Theater Command said it had conducted long-range, live-fire training in the Taiwan Strait, state broadcaster CCTV reported, as part of planned military exercises around the island.\n\nTaiwan reported Chinese long-range rockets had fallen near its islands of Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, which are in the Taiwan Strait, but located closer to the mainland than the main island of Taiwan. It later said a total of 11 Dongfeng (DF) missiles were fired to the waters north, south and east of the island between 1:56 p.m. and 4 p.m. local time (from 1:56 a.m. ET to 4 a.m. ET) on Thursday.\n\nThe Chinese missiles flew over Taiwan Island for the first time, a Chinese military expert said on state television channel CCTV on Thursday, representing a major escalation of China’s military intimidation against Taiwan.\n\nThe conventional missiles flew over airspace covered by Taiwanese defense missiles, said Maj. Gen. Meng Xiangqing, a professor of strategy at the National Defense University in Beijing.\n\n“We hit the targets under the observation of US Aegis combat system, which means the Chinese military has solved the difficulties of hitting long-range targets on waters,” Meng said on CCTV.\n\nThe Taiwanese Defense Ministry said in a statement late Thursday night that the trajectory of the missiles was above the atmosphere and therefore posed no risk to Taiwan.\n\n“Using the surveillance and reconnaissance systems, our military can accurately calculate the trajectory of the Dong Feng-series missiles fired by the Chinese Communist Party,” it said.\n\nBecause it was predicted that the missiles would land in the waters east of Taiwan, authorities did not trigger air raid alerts, it said.\n\nChinese state media said that exercises to simulate an air and sea “blockade” around Taiwan had started Wednesday, but offered little solid evidence to back up the claim. Later Thursday, images showed military helicopters flying past Pingtan island, one of Taiwan’s closest points to mainland China.\n\nThe military posturing was a deliberate show of force after Pelosi left the island on Wednesday evening, bound for South Korea, one of the final stops on an Asia tour that ends in Japan this weekend.\n\nWithin hours of her departure from Taipei on Wednesday, the island’s Defense Ministry said China sent more than 20 fighter jets across the median line in the Taiwan Strait, the midway point between the mainland and Taiwan that Beijing says it does not recognize but usually respects.\n\nIn addition, the ministry said that 22 Chinese warplanes had entered its air defense identification zone (ADIZ) on Thursday, and that all of them crossed the strait median line.\n\nThe ministry also said it detected four drones – in three separate batches – flying over “restricted waters” around the Kinmen islands, a group of Taiwan-controlled outlying islands close to China, on Thursday night local time.\n\nTaiwan’s defense ministry said in a statement Thursday night that the military fired flares to warn the drones away – without specifying the origin or type of drone – and that it continues to monitor the situation and remains on high alertness.\n\nTourists look on as a Chinese military helicopter flies past Pingtan island, one of mainland China's closest point from Taiwan on August 4, 2022. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said its military was remaining in a “normal” but wary posture, and called the live-fire drills an “irrational act” that attempted to “change the status quo.”\n\n“We are closely monitoring enemy activities around the sea of Taiwan and that of outlying islands, and we will act appropriately,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nTaiwan also accused China of “following North Korea’s example of arbitrary test-fire of missiles in waters close to other countries” in a statement issued by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday.\n\nThe exercises have caused disruption to flight and ship schedules, with some international flights canceled and vessels urged to use alternative routes for several ports around the island.\n\nAnd they have heightened tensions beyond Taiwan’s waters. Japan’s Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said Thursday that five missiles were believed to have landed within Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\n\n“This is a serious problem that concerns Japan’s security and the safety of its citizens. We strongly condemn it,” Kishi told reporters during a press conference.\n\nKishi said this was the first time that Chinese ballistic missiles had landed within Japan’s EEZ and that a protest had been lodged with Beijing.\n\nExercises exerting pressure\n\nTaiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen, who met with Pelosi during her visit, called China’s military drills “an irresponsible act,” adding that Taipei does not want to “provoke disputes” but will defend its sovereignty and national safety.\n\nIn a speech on Thursday night, Tsai said the exercises have “undermined the status quo of the Taiwan Strait, intruded (on) our sovereignty, and heightened tensions in the Indo-Pacific region.”\n\nWell in advance of Pelosi’s near 24-hour visit to Taiwan, China had warned her presence was not welcome. The ruling Chinese Communist Party claims the self-governed island as its own territory, despite never having controlled it.\n\nChina issued a map showing six zones around Taiwan that would be the site of drills in coming days. Taiwan’s Maritime and Port Bureau said earlier Thursday that China had added a seventh military drill zone, but later retracted that statement, saying the earlier notice was wrong.\n\nChinese state media on Thursday outlined a broad range of objectives for the exercises, including strikes on land and sea targets.\n\n“The exercises (are) focused on key training sessions including joint blockade, sea target assault, strike on ground targets, and airspace control operation, and the joint combat capabilities of the troops got tested in the military operations,” said an announcement from the Xinhua news agency attributed to the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) Eastern Theater Command, which has responsibility for the areas near Taiwan.\n\nChinese military helicopters fly past Pingtan island in Fujian province on Aug. 4. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, the Global Times tabloid said the drills involved some of China’s newest and most sophisticated weaponry, including J-20 stealth fighters and DF-17 hypersonic missiles, and that some missiles may be fired over the island – a move that would be extremely provocative.\n\n“The exercises are unprecedented as the PLA conventional missiles are expected to fly over the island of Taiwan for the first time,” the Global Times said, citing experts.\n\n“The PLA forces will enter areas within 12 nautical miles of the island and the so-called median line will cease to exist.”\n\nAccounts from Taiwan of Chinese military movement included the fighter jets crossing the median line and a report from Taiwan’s government-run Central News Agency, citing government sources, that two of China’s most powerful warships – Type 55 destroyers – were sighted Tuesday off the central and southeastern coast of the island, the closest being within 37 miles (60 kilometers) of land.\n\nBut there was little corroboration or firm evidence provided by China to back up the sort of claims posted in the Global Times.\n\nChina’s state-run television offered video of fighter jets taking off, ships at sea and missiles on the move, but the dates of when that video was shot could not be verified.\n\nSome analysts were skeptical Beijing could pull off what they were threatening, such as a blockade of Taiwan.\n\n“The official announcement (of the blockade) refers to just a few days, which would make it hard to qualify it on practical terms to a blockade,” said Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King’s College in London.\n\n“Blockades are hard to execute and long to implement. This exercise is not that,” he said.\n\nPatalano said the biggest impact of the exercises would be psychological.\n\n“During the period of time in question, ships and aircraft will likely reroute to avoid the area, but this is one primary objective of the chosen locations: create disruption, discomfort, and fear of worse to come,” he said.\n\nChinese military helicopters fly past Pingtan island, one of mainland China's closest point from Taiwan on August 4, 2022. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRerouting planes and ships\n\nChina’s retaliatory exercises have already caused disruption to flight and ship schedules in Taiwan, though the island is trying to lessen their impact.\n\nTaiwan’s transportation minister said agreements had been reached with Japan and the Philippines to reroute 18 international flight routes departing from the island – affecting about 300 flights in total – to avoid the PLA’s live-fire drills.\n\nKorean Air told CNN on Thursday that it has canceled flights from Incheon to Taiwan scheduled for Friday and Saturday due to safety reasons while China conducts its military drills. Flights will resume on Sunday.\n\nChina’s planned live-fire drills were also causing unease in Japan.\n\nJapan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said the drills posed a threat to his country’s security.\n\nOne of the six exercise areas set up by China was near Japan’s Yonaguni Island, part of Okinawa prefecture and only 68 miles (110 kilometers) off the coast of Taiwan.\n\nThat same Chinese exercise zone is also close to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, a rocky uninhabited chain known as the Diaoyus in China, and over which Beijing claims sovereignty.\n\n“In particular, a training area has been set up in the waters near Japan, and if China were to conduct live ammunition exercises in such an area, it could affect the security of Japan and its people,” Matsuno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States military was silent on the Chinese exercises and did not provide any answers to CNN questions on Thursday.\n\nJohn Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said Thursday that China has “chosen to overreact” to Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and that the White House expects further provocative actions “in the coming days.”\n\nPelosi met Taiwanese President President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei on Aug. 3. Taiwan Presidential Office via AP\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he hoped “Beijing will not manufacture a crisis or seek a pretense to increase its aggressive military action.” Speaking at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-US Ministerial Meeting in Cambodia, Blinken said the US remains committed to its “One China” policy.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chinese ambassador to France Lu Shaye warned that after “reunification” with Taiwan, there would be a “re-education” of the island.\n\nBesides keeping a close eye on Chinese military movements around the island, Taiwan also said it would strengthen security against cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.\n\nTaiwan’s cabinet spokesperson Lo Ping-cheng said in a Wednesday news conference that the government had enhanced security at key infrastructure points and increased the level of cybersecurity alertness across government offices.\n\nTaiwan is anticipating increased “cognitive warfare,” referring to disinformation campaigns used to sway public opinion, Lo said.\n\n\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/960455/quiz-of-the-week-7-14-april", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 7 - 14 April | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nWhen the United States, Japan, Australia and India first resuscitated their informal dialogue from a decade-long hiatus in late 2017, China was confident it would soon fail.\n\n“It seems there is never a shortage of headline-grabbing ideas,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said dismissively of the grouping in early 2018, months after it convened its first working-level meeting in Manila.\n\n“They are like the sea foam in the Pacific or Indian Ocean: they may get some attention, but soon will dissipate,” Wang concluded.\n\nMore than four years on, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue – better known as “the Quad” – is far from dissipating. Instead, it has only grown in momentum, profile and clout.\n\nConvened around the mantra of promoting a “free and open Indo-Pacific,” the four countries have held two naval exercises since 2020. Their leaders have assembled three times since last year – including an in-person summit at the White House.\n\nOn Tuesday, the four leaders will meet face to face again in Tokyo. Their summit will be a highlight of Joe Biden’s first trip to Asia as the US President, as he seeks to strengthen alliances and partnerships to counter China’s growing influence in the region.\n\nThe renewed activity has seen China’s initial scorn turn into alarm, with Beijing viewing the grouping as part of Washington’s attempt to encircle the country with strategic and military allies. Wang, the foreign minister, has decried the grouping as an “Indo-Pacific NATO,” accusing it of “trumpeting the Cold War mentality” and “stoking geopolitical rivalry.”\n\nLeaders from the Quad nations shown during their first in-person summit at the White House in September 2021. Sarahbeth Maney/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThat concern has only grown since the Ukraine crisis. Beijing’s backing of Moscow has further damaged its global image, leaving it more isolated on the world stage. And that is not helped by China’s insistence on a zero-Covid policy, in which stringent border restrictions are cutting the country off from a world that has largely moved on from the pandemic.\n\nWhile Biden travels the world to reinforce ties, his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping hasn’t left China in 25 months. Biden’s latest flurry of diplomacy, with stops in South Korea and Japan, has particularly irked Beijing.\n\n“The Indo-Pacific strategy cooked up by the United States, in the name of ‘freedom and openness,’ is actually keen on forming cliques,” Wang said Sunday as Biden wrapped up his trip to Seoul and headed to Tokyo.\n\n“It claims that it intends to ‘change China’s surrounding environment,’ but its purpose is to contain China and make Asia-Pacific countries serve as ‘pawns’ of US hegemony,” Wang added.\n\nBut experts stress that the Quad is not an Asian NATO and neither does it aspire to become one. Instead, they say its flexibility as an informal forum allows it to build more partnerships and expand areas for cooperation – including on the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework that Biden is expected to launch in Tokyo.\n\n“The Quad is trying to emphasize that it has a positive agenda, which is much more about delivering what the Indo-Pacific region needs – versus becoming an anti-China, NATO-like entity, which is a reputation that it’s been trying very hard to combat in the region,” said Kristi Govella, deputy director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall Fund.\n\nThe driving force behind the Quad\n\nChina’s initial dismissal of the Quad was partly based on precedent.\n\nA previous iteration of the Quad – proposed in 2007 by Japan’s then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe – lasted barely a year due to a divergence of interests and pressure from Beijing. It crumbled in January 2008, when Australia announced its withdrawal from the grouping to pursue closer trade ties with China.\n\nBut the geopolitical and strategic calculus in the region has shifted drastically over the past decade. Under Xi, China has abandoned former leader Deng Xiaoping’s decades-old mantra of “hide your strength, bide your time.” Instead, it has pursued a more assertive foreign policy, readily flexing its economic muscle and military might.\n\nA year after Xi took office, China started building – and increasingly militarizing – artificial islands throughout the contested waters of the South China Sea. It has increased its military posturing toward Japan, sending Chinese coastguard vessels into waters around the contested Senkaku Islands (known as the Diaoyu Islands in China) and flying warplanes into the airspace above.\n\nA Chinese air strip is clearly visible beside structures and buildings on the contested Mischief Reef in the Spratly group of islands in the South China Sea, March 20, 2022. Aaron Favila/AP\n\nEarly in the pandemic, China imposed a flurry of trade sanctions on Australia after Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19. And along its disputed Himalayan border with India, Chinese and Indian soldiers clashed in their deadliest conflict in four decades.\n\nThe tensions have driven these countries closer into the orbit of Washington, which under Biden has made the strategic rivalry with China a centerpiece of its foreign policy.\n\n“The biggest driver of the Quad’s revival is the growing assertiveness and aggressiveness of China,” said Yuki Tatsumi, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center.\n\n“Its behavior not only in the East and South China Seas but also in the Indian Ocean all the way down around the Pacific island area resulted in bringing Quad countries’ perception of China closer together.”\n\nAs Beijing grows more distant from the West and its allies, it has moved ever closer to Moscow – but their “no limits” partnership has become more of a liability for China as Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine draws global outrage.\n\n“Beijing’s backing of Moscow reconfirmed the image of China as the disrupter of the existing international order that the countries in this region all have benefited – and continue to benefit – from,” Tatsumi said.\n\nWhile the Quad has never explicitly mentioned China in public, it is hard to miss the thinly veiled references. Last September, when the four leaders met in person in Washington, they committed to “promoting the free, open, rules-based order, rooted in international law and undaunted by coercion” – a clear rebuke to China’s increasingly aggressive behavior in the region.\n\nIn response, Chinese diplomats have repeatedly lashed out at the Quad for “disrupting regional peace and stability.”\n\nBuilding “closed and exclusive small circles or groups is as dangerous as the NATO strategy of eastward expansion in Europe,” Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said in March.\n\n“If allowed to go on unchecked, it would bring unimaginable consequences, and ultimately push the Asia-Pacific over the edge of an abyss,” he said.\n\nNot ‘Asia’s NATO’\n\nNATO’s swift and coordinated response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has likely alarmed Beijing, say experts, who suggest its leaders are watching Western reaction to Ukraine with Taiwan in mind.\n\nChina views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve unification. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei are at the highest they’ve been in recent decades, with the Chinese military sending record numbers of war planes near the island – a show of force that is not lost on other countries in the region.\n\nWhen the Quad leaders convened in March to talk about the Ukraine crisis, they agreed that “unilateral changes to the status quo with force like this should not be allowed in the Indo-Pacific region.”\n\nJapanese, Indian and Australian ships sail in formation during Malabar exercises in August 2021. Justin Stack/DVIDS U.S. Navy/AP\n\nBut Jean-Pierre Cabestan, an expert on Chinese politics at Hong Kong Baptist University, stressed that the Quad is not a formal alliance like NATO.\n\n“It can’t be Asia’s NATO. What structures the region’s security is a set of bilateral alliances concluded by the US after World War II – with Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Philippines. So there’s not such a thing as NATO in east Asia,” he said.\n\nAnd unlike Japan and Australia, India is not a US ally – following a foreign policy tradition of non-alignment the country has adopted since independence.\n\nThere are structural differences too. Experts say in recent years the Quad has pivoted away from an overt focus on security issues to include more areas of cooperation, in an attempt to better address regional needs.\n\nAt their first virtual summit in March last year, the Quad leaders pledged to supply a billion Covid-19 vaccines across Asia by the end of 2022. The Quad has also formed working groups on climate change, technological innovation and supply-chain resilience.\n\nDuring his trip to Tokyo, Biden is expected to unveil the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework – a long-sought plan to step up US economic engagement with the region. Experts say the framework could provide momentum for closer economic cooperation among the Quad countries – such as in infrastructure and supply-chain resilience.\n\nIn the eyes of Beijing, these efforts will likely be seen as a direct challenge. On Sunday, Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, said while China is always happy to see proposals conducive to regional cooperation, it is opposed to attempts to create division and conflict.\n\n“Anyone attempting to isolate China with some framework will only isolate themselves. Rules made up to exclude China are bound to be abandoned by developments of our time,” he said.\n\nBut the Quad will need to demonstrate that it can deliver on its promises. Previous US attempts to boost economic ties with the region, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, have floundered, and the US will need to persuade potential allies and partners that it will stay committed to the region beyond Biden’s term.\n\nSusannah Patton, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, said the Quad had already exceeded many analysts’ expectations. “The Quad is a vehicle for (its members) to present a different vision of how the region should work, and to signal to Beijing that it won’t have things its own way all the time,” she said.\n\n“As for the future, how it evolves will in large part depend on China’s behavior. If China continues to undermine regional norms and coerce other countries, the Quad will respond.”", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/asia/china-taiwan-invasion-scenarios-analysis-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "title": "China has the power to take Taiwan, but it would cost an extremely ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nOn his first trip to Asia as United States President last week, Joe Biden gave his strongest warning yet to Beijing that Washington was committed to defending Taiwan militarily in the event of an attack from China.\n\nBiden’s comments, which compared a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, appeared to deviate from Washington’s decades-old policy of “strategic ambiguity” on the issue and seemingly raised the possibility of a military clash between US and Chinese forces.\n\nIt’s the third time Biden has made similar remarks since taking office and, just as on the other two occasions, they were quickly walked back by the White House – which insists its policy has not changed. However, it inevitably raises the question: if China tries to take Taiwan, are the United States and its allies able to stop it?\n\nAnd the alarming answer is: Quite possibly not. Analysts say China has more troops, more missiles and more ships than Taiwan or its possible supporters, like the US or Japan, could bring to a fight. That means that if China is absolutely determined to take the island it probably can.\n\nBut there’s a caveat; while China could likely prevail, any victory would come at an extremely bloody price for both Beijing and its adversaries.\n\nMany analysts say an invasion of Taiwan would be more dangerous and complex than the Allied D-Day landings in France in World War II. US government documents put the number of killed, injured and missing from both sides during the almost three-month-long Normandy campaign at almost half a million troops.\n\nAnd the civilian carnage could be far, far worse.\n\nTaiwan’s population of 24 million people is packed into dense urban areas like the capital Taipei, with an average of 9,575 people per square kilometer. Compare that to Mariupol, Ukraine – devastated in the war with Russia – and with an average of 2,690 people per square kilometer.\n\nDespite its numerical advantages in sea-, air- and land-based forces in the region, China has Achilles heels in each arena of war that would force Beijing to think long and hard about whether an invasion is worth the overwhelming human cost.\n\nHere are some scenarios of how a Chinese invasion might play out:\n\nThe naval war\n\nChina has the world’s largest navy, with around 360 combat vessels – bigger than the US’ fleet of just under 300 ships.\n\nBeijing also has the world’s most-advanced merchant fleet, a large coast guard and, experts say, a maritime militia – fishing boats unofficially aligned with the military – giving it access to hundreds of additional vessels that could be used to transport the hundreds of thousands of troops that analysts say China would need for an amphibious invasion.\n\nAnd those troops would need massive amounts of supplies.\n\n“For Beijing to have reasonable prospects of victory, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) would have to move thousands of tanks, artillery guns, armored personnel vehicles, and rocket launchers across with the troops. Mountains of equipment and lakes of fuel would have to cross with them,” Ian Easton, a senior director at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote in The Diplomat last year.\n\nGetting a force of that size across the 110 miles (177 kilometers) of the Taiwan Strait would be a long, dangerous mission during which those vessels carrying the troops and equipment would be sitting ducks.\n\n“The thought about China invading Taiwan, that’s a massacre for the Chinese navy,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThat’s because Taiwan has been stocking up on cheap and effective land-based anti-ship missiles, similar to the Neptunes Ukraine used to sink the Russian cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea in April.\n\n“Taiwan is mass-producing these things. And they’re small, it’s not like (China) can take them all out,” O’Brien said.\n\n“What’s cheap is a surface-to-ship missile, what’s expensive is a ship.”\n\nThe Chinese guided-missile destroyer Changsha returns to a port in Sanya City, China, in March 2017. Zeng Tao/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nStill, China could – given its numerical advantage – simply decide the losses were worth it, pointed out Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine captain and now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n“There’s gonna be hundreds if not thousands of (Chinese) vessels there to soak up those (Taiwanese) missiles,” Shugart said.\n\nMissiles aside, China would face massive logistical hurdles in landing enough soldiers. Conventional military wisdom holds that an attacking force should outnumber defenders 3 to 1.\n\n“With a potential defending force of 450,000 Taiwanese today … China would need over 1.2 million soldiers (out of a total active force of more than 2 million) that would have to be transported in many thousands of ships,” Howard Ullman, a former US Navy officer and professor at the US Naval War College, wrote in a February essay for the Atlantic Council.\n\nHe estimated such an operation would take weeks and that despite China’s maritime strength, it “simply lacks the military capability and capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan for the foreseeable future.”\n\nAircraft carrier killers\n\nSome of the problems that would face China’s navy in Taiwan would also face any US naval force sent to defend the island.\n\nThe US Navy sees its aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, bristling with F-35 and F/A-18 jets, as its spear in the Pacific and would have a numerical advantage in this area. The US has 11 carriers in total, compared to China’s two. However, only about half are combat ready at any one time and even these might be vulnerable.\n\nO’Brien and others point out that the People’s Liberation Army has more than 2,000 conventionally armed missiles, many of which it has developed with the US Navy’s prized aircraft carriers in mind.\n\nOf particular concern would be China’s DF-26 and DF-21D – touted by Beijing’s state-run Global Times tabloid in 2020 as “aircraft carrier killers” and the “world’s first ballistic missiles capable of targeting large and medium-sized vessels.”\n\nAs O’Brien puts it, “The US better be careful thinking about, in any kind of war environment, sending carrier battle groups close to China … If you’re fighting a state-to-state war, you’re going to stay far away from shore.”\n\nOthers are more confident in the US carriers.\n\nRear Adm. Jeffery Anderson, the commander of the US Navy’s Carrier Strike Group Three centered on the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, recently told CNN his ships are more than ready to deal with the kind of missiles that sank the Moskva.\n\n“One thing I do know about our US ships is they’re extremely survivable. Not only are they lethal, but they are extremely survivable,” he said.\n\nA Chinese air force fighter jet takes off during training exercises in 2017.

The directory shows the US with more than 2,700 combat aircraft, but those cover the world while China’s are all in the region.\n\nTaiwan holds ceremony for advanced F-16V fighter jets 02:11 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the air war, China also will have learned from Russia’s failures in Ukraine – where Moscow took months assembling its ground forces yet failed to soften up the terrain for them with a bombing campaign – and is more likely to emulate the “shock and awe” bombardments that preceded the US’ invasions of Iraq.\n\n“I’m sure the PLA is learning from what they’re seeing,” Shugart said. “You can read open-source translations of their strategic documents. They learned very carefully from what we did in Desert Storm and Kosovo.”\n\nBut even in the air China would face significant difficulties.\n\nA guided-missile-armed J-20 stealth fighter jet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force performs at Airshow China 2018. Shu ying/Imagine China/Reuters\n\nRussia’s failure to quickly seize control of the skies in Ukraine initially dumbfounded many analysts. Some put the failure down to the cheap antiaircraft missiles Western militaries have supplied to Kyiv.\n\nTaiwan has deals with the United States to supply it with Stinger antiaircraft missiles and Patriot missile defense batteries. And it also has been investing heavily in its own missile production facilities over the past three years in a project, when completed this summer, will see its missile production capabilities triple, according to a Janes report in March.\n\nOn the other hand, China would have an advantage over the US due to its closeness to Taiwan.\n\nA recent war game run by the Center for a New American Security concluded that an aerial conflict between the US and China would likely end in stalemate.\n\nCommenting on the result to Air Force Magazine, Lt.

Clinton Hinote, US Air Force deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said that while the US was used to dominating the skies some factors weren’t in its favor.\n\nChina had “invested in modern aircraft and weapons to fight us,” he noted, and US forces would also face the “tyranny of distance” – most of the US air power used in the war game operated out of the Philippines, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) away.\n\nThe war game simulated Chinese forces beginning their campaign by trying to take out the nearest US bases in places like Guam and Japan.\n\nHinote likened that move to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, saying China would be motivated by “many of the same reasons.”\n\n“The attack is designed to give Chinese forces the time they need to invade and present the world with a fait accompli,” he told the magazine.\n\nChina has a growing arsenal of short-, medium- and intermediate range ballistic missiles that can reach these far-flung targets.\n\nAs of 2020, the PLA had at least 425 missile launchers capable of hitting those US bases, according to the China Power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nA Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldier fires an anti-tank rocket during a live-fire military exercise in Wuzhong, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China in 2019. Reuters\n\nThe ground war\n\nEven in a scenario where China was willing to take these risks and managed to get a significant amount of troops ashore, its forces would then face another uphill battle.\n\nTaiwan has about 150,000 troops and 2.5 million reservists – and its entire national defense strategy is based on countering a Chinese invasion.\n\nLike their counterparts in Ukraine the Taiwanese would have the advantage of home turf, knowing the ground and being highly motivated to defend it.\n\nFirst, the PLA would need to find a decent landing spot – ideally close to both the mainland and a strategic city such as Taipei with nearby port and airport facilities. Experts have identified just 14 beaches that would fit the bill and Taiwan is well aware of which ones those are. Its engineers have spent decades digging tunnels and bunkers to protect them.\n\nTaiwan’s troops would also be relatively fresh compared to their Chinese counterparts, who would be drained from the journey over and would still need to push through the island’s western mud flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, toward Taipei.\n\nChinese troops could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely.\n\nAnother problem for Chinese troops would be their lack of battlefield experience. The last time the PLA was in active combat was in 1979, when China fought a brief border war with Vietnam.\n\nSoldiers of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fire a mortar during a live-fire military exercise in Anhui province, China May 22, 2021. cnsphoto/Reuters\n\nIn that effort, China “really got a bloody nose, it was not very successful operation,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n“So China’s military today is not battle tested, and it could suffer great losses, if it indeed attacked Taiwan,” Glaser said.\n\nOthers pointed out that even battle-tested troops could struggle against a well-motivated defensive force – noting that the Russian military was bogged down in Ukraine despite its recent fighting experience in Syria and Georgia.\n\nStill, as with the other scenarios, it is not only Chinese forces that might be handicapped by a lack of experience. Taiwan’s troops have also not been tested, and depending on the scenario, there are holes in even the US’ experience. As Shugart put it: “There is not a single US naval officer who has sunk another ship in combat.”\n\nWhat are the chances China attacks?\n\nGlaser, the German Marshall Fund analyst, thinks a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is unlikely.\n\n“I think that the PLA lacks full confidence that it can seize and control Taiwan. The PLA itself talks about some of the deficiencies in its capability,” she said.\n\n“And obviously, the war in Ukraine highlights some of the challenges that China could face; it is certainly much harder to launch a war 100 miles across a body of water than it is across land borders, (such as those) between Russia and Ukraine,” she said.\n\nShe noted that the strong Ukrainian resistance may be giving Taiwan’s people reason to fight for their land.\n\n“Given how Ukraine has really demonstrated a very high morale and willingness to defend its freedoms … I think that this is likely to change the calculus of not only military leaders in China, but hopefully also of (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping personally,” she said.\n\nO’Brien, the University of St. Andrews professor, wrote in The Spectator this year that any war over Taiwan would lead to devastating losses on all sides, something that should make their leaders tread carefully before committing troops.\n\n“If the Ukrainian war teaches us anything, it is that war is almost always a rash choice. Don’t underestimate your opponent, and don’t assume your systems will all work that well.”\n\nA Chinese amy tank takes part in military drills in 2018. Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAny other option?\n\nOf course, the PLA has options other than a full-blown invasion.\n\nThese include taking outlying Taiwanese islands or imposing a quarantine on the main island, Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow wrote last year in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nResidents of Taipei on edge about China after Russia invades Ukraine 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPossible PLA targets could be Taiping Island, Taiwan’s most far-flung outpost in the South China Sea; the tiny Pratas Island, a small outpost 170 nautical miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Hong Kong; Kinmen and Matsu islands, tiny territories just a few miles off mainland China’s coast; or Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWhile a PLA victory of any of the four is almost assured, it could come at the cost of galvanizing support for Taiwan in the rest of the world – much as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has united the West against it.\n\nBlackwill and Zelikow said the quarantine option might be more effective.\n\n“In a quarantine scenario, the Chinese government would effectively take control of the air and sea borders of Taiwan,” they wrote. “The Chinese government would run effectively a clearance operation offshore or in the air to screen incoming ships and aircraft. The screeners could then wave along what they regarded as innocent traffic.”\n\nAnything regarded as belligerent, such as US military aid for Taiwan, could be blocked or confiscated as a violation of Chinese sovereignty, they say. Meanwhile, China could allow the Taiwan government to function as normal except for foreign affairs.\n\nThis option would have an advantage in China’s eyes: the ball would be in the US’ court as to whether to use force to end the quarantine. Then it would be the US that would have to consider whether to risk a war that could cost countless lives.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Ivan Watson", "Brad Lendon", "Ivan Watson"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/politics/rimpac-navy-exercises-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "title": "RIMPAC, world's largest naval exercises, to include all 4 Quad ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nThe 2022 edition of the world’s largest naval war games, the Rim of the Pacific exercises, will feature key US partners from around the globe, including India, Japan and Australia – who have joined Washington in the Quad group – and five nations bordering on the South China Sea, one of the world’s most turbulent areas for military tensions.\n\nIn total, the exercises, based in Honolulu and San Diego, will see military units from 26 countries participating from June 29 to August 4.

Li Tang/VCG/Getty Images\n\nStill, while the launch of the Fujian amid much fanfare was clearly meant as a message to Beijing’s rivals, analysts caution against swallowing too much of the hype just yet.\n\nFirstly, the Fujian likely won’t be operational for another three to four years, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center. And even when it is operational, its size will make it an obvious target – any enemy will be keenly aware that sinking such an iconic vessel would be as much of a morale blow as a military disaster for China.\n\nThe launch ceremony for China's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, at Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, on June 17. Li Tang/VCG/Getty Images\n\nThen there is the simple fact that, impressive as they seem, aircraft carriers aren’t necessarily best suited to what experts see as the most plausible conflict scenarios in the near future – including clashes in the East and South China Seas and an invasion of Taiwan.\n\nEssentially, experts say, the Fujian might be China’s biggest ship, but it’s probably not the biggest problem on the minds of US naval commanders right now.\n\nHere are four types of ship at China’s disposal that arguably pose a far greater threat to US naval dominance.\n\nChina's type 055 guided-missile destroyer Nanchang in the Western Pacific on October 19, 2021. Sun Zifa/China News Service/Getty Images\n\nType 055 destroyer\n\nLaunched in 2017, these 13,000-ton stealth guided-missile destroyers are considered by many to be the most powerful surface combatants in the world.\n\nThe Type 055, big enough to be considered a cruiser by NATO standards, is equipped with 112 vertical launch tubes that can used to fire everything from anti-ship missiles to long-range land-attack missiles.\n\n“This ship in particular has a sophisticated design, stealth features, radars, and a large missile inventory. It is larger and more powerful than most US, Japanese, and South Korean destroyers,” RAND Corp. senior analyst Timothy Heath told CNN in 2018, when Beijing launched two of the warships in a single day – a testament to China’s impressive shipbuilding capabilities.\n\nA US Congressional Research Service report in March said at least 10 Type 055s are thought to have been launched or are under construction.\n\nThe deployment of the Lhasa, the second of Beijing’s five active Type 055s, to the Sea of Japan for drills amid growing tensions over Taiwan, was championed by China’s state-run Global Times tabloid last week.\n\n“The ship has achieved full operational capability and demonstrated its capabilities in deterring possible foreign military interference in the Taiwan Strait at a time when the US and Japan have been repeatedly provoking China over the Taiwan question,” the Global Times reported.\n\nThe potency of the Type 055 was underlined in footage that emerged on social media in April. It showed one launching what naval analyst H I Sutton said was a hypersonic YJ-21 anti-ship ballistic missile – a weapon often referred to as a “carrier killer.”\n\nGlobal Times played down the footage, describing the missiles as part of the country’s defensive strategy.\n\n“If the US does not make military provocations against China, including over the Taiwan question, it does not need to worry about the missiles,” it said.\n\nChina's Liaoning aircraft carrier is accompanied by navy frigates and submarines during an exercise in the South China Sea. Li Gang/AP\n\nType 039 submarine\n\nThese Yuan-class submarines are almost silent diesel-electric-powered boats with capabilities that could prove tough for US military planners to deal with.\n\nBeijing has built 17 of the Type 39A/B subs, with plans to increase that total to 25 in the next three years, according to the US Defense Department’s 2021 report to Congress on China’s military power.\n\n“The Type 039 SSs provide formidable ‘defense in depth’” in waters close to China, “and they appear to be developing some capability to engage” US forces farther out to sea, Schuster said.\n\nThe subs are equipped with air independent propulsion (AIP), which means they do not need to surface as frequently to get the air required for diesel combustion, which can then power their batteries.\n\n“When operating on batteries, AIP-equipped submarines are almost silent, with the only noise coming from the shaft bearings, propeller, and flow around the hull,” US Navy officers Michael Walker and Austin Krusz wrote in a 2018 report for the US Naval Institute’s Proceedings magazine.\n\nChina is pushing to launch more of the super-quiet subs, which are armed with anti-ship cruise missiles, the Defense Department report said.\n\nOne potent method of attack used by the Type 039 is to fire a “wake-homing” torpedo across the stern, or back, of a target vessel. The torpedo then follows in the wake of the target ship before exploding near its propulsion and steering systems.\n\nBecause surface ships detect submarines and torpedoes by sound waves, wake-homing torpedoes are particularly tough to defend against.\n\nThe advances in Chinese submarines come just as the US Navy is experiencing trouble with its anti-submarine capabilities.\n\nChief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday told Congress last month that the service wants to scrap nine of its littoral combat ships, some of the newest ships in the US fleet, because their anti-submarine systems “did not work out technically.”\n\nA merchant ferry at Yantai Port in Shandong province of China. Tang Ke/VCG/Getty Images\n\nMerchant ferries\n\nMerchant ferries might not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think about deadly naval capabilities – but therein lies their power.\n\nTo invade Taiwan, China would likely need to transport an invading force of hundreds of thousands of men – some analysts have suggested more than a million would be needed.\n\nVarious analysts – and US government reports – have concluded the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) naval fleet is not up to that task.\n\nBut what China does have is a massive fleet of civilian ferries that could be swiftly converted for military use – and according to some, may even have been designed for just that possibility.\n\n“China’s biggest ferry shipbuilder stated publicly in 2015 that one of its largest roll-on/roll-off ferries was built for dual military and civilian purposes, and one of China’s largest ferry operators has been similarly described as having a dual civil-military development philosophy,” Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine commander now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, wrote in a 2021 essay for War on the Rocks.\n\nHe added that civilian ferry companies operating in the Yellow and South China Seas have already been organized into PLA auxiliary units.\n\nCrunching the numbers, said Shugart, was staggering. He estimated that using civilian ships would give China an extra 1.1 million displacement tonnes. That figure is more than three times the displacement tonnage of all of China’s amphibious assault ships put together. And if China tapped Hong Kong’s roll-on/roll-off vehicle carriers it could gain an extra 370,000 tonnes of sealift, according to Shugart.\n\nIs that enough to take Taiwan by force?\n\nThat is hard to know. But Shugart said it did answer one question.\n\n“How many transport (ships) does the Chinese military have? Very probably, more than you might think.”\n\nChinese vessels moored at Whitsun Reef in the South China Sea in 2021. AP\n\nMaritime militia\n\nFerries aren’t the only supposedly civilian vessels military planners have on their radars.\n\nExperts also accuse China of creating a maritime militia, made up of more than a hundred vessels supposedly engaged in commercial fishing, to enforce its wishes in disputed seas.\n\nThe militia – which Beijing denies even exists – is made up of at least 122 vessels and likely as many as 174, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBut the actual number could be even greater. Various experts suspected the militia’s involvement when more than 200 Chinese fishing boats crowded the waters around Whitsun Reef in the South China Sea in early 2021. The reef is claimed by both China and the Philippines, which described the presence of the boats as a “clear provocative action.”\n\n“The People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia don’t fish,” Schuster told CNN last year. “They have automatic weapons aboard and reinforced hulls, making them very dangerous at close range. Also, they have a top speed of around 18-22 knots, making them faster than 90% of the world’s fishing boats.”\n\nThe militia has two main parts: professional militia boats and actual fishing boats employed by the Chinese military under a subsidy scheme, according to a November report from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nThe professionals lead such activities as harassing foreign drilling ships or blocking foreign fishing boats, and the subsidized fishers bring pressure in numbers, the CSIS report said.\n\nAnd with the world’s largest fishing fleet, China has plenty of reserves to call on.\n\nAbout that carrier again\n\nStill, none of this is to say that the launch of the Fujian is not a significant moment.\n\nAs in the US, aircraft carriers will in time become the centerpiece of the PLA’s navy – and a symbol of what the modern Chinese military is capable of, Schuster said.\n\n“Fujian’s launch should be viewed for what it portends rather than its limited immediate impact,” Schuster said.\n\n“China has now launched three carriers and brought two into full operational status during a period where the US Navy has struggled to bring one new unit to full operational status,” he said.\n\nSchuster was referring to the USS Gerald Ford, a supercarrier that has been plagued by problems since its commissioning in 2017 (by which time it was already three years late).\n\nThe supercarrier is yet to make its first operational deployment, though that is expected this fall.\n\nMeanwhile, China forges ahead.\n\n“They are building their navy at a faster rate than the US and all of its allies,” Schuster said.\n\n“Imperfect, but a good foundation.”", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/03/12/north-korea-tests-submarine-launched-missiles-seoul/11462714002/", "title": "US-South Korea military drills begin after North Korea submarine ...", "text": "Hyung-jin Kim\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSEOUL, South Korea — The South Korean and U.S. militaries launched their biggest joint military exercises in years Monday, as North Korea said it conducted submarine-launched cruise missile tests in apparent protest of the drills it views as an invasion rehearsal.\n\nNorth Korea’s missile tests Sunday signal the country likely will conduct provocative weapons testing activities during the U.S.-South Korean drills that are to run for 11 days. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered his troops to be ready to repel its rivals’ “frantic war preparation moves.”\n\nThe South Korean-U.S. drills include a computer simulation called the Freedom Shield 23 and several combined field training exercises, collectively known as the Warrior Shield FTX.\n\nSouth Korean and U.S. authorities didn’t immediately disclose details of Monday’s drills.\n\nBut they said earlier the computer simulation is designed to strengthen the allies’ defense and response capabilities amid North Korea’s increasing nuclear threats and other changing security environments. They said the field exercises would also return to the scale of their earlier largest field training called Foal Eagle that was last held in 2018.\n\nA recent U.S. military statement said the field exercises are to further enhance the two militaries’ “cooperation through air, land, sea, space, cyber and special operations, and improve upon tactics, techniques and procedures.”\n\nUS, SOUTH KOREA MILITARY DRILLS: North Korea ready for 'quick, overwhelming action' against US, South Korea over military drills\n\nMORE: North Korea launches two more ballistic missiles into Pacific 'firing range'\n\nNorth Korea said in state media that its launches of two cruise missiles from a submarine off its east coast showed its resolve to respond with “overwhelming powerful” force to the intensifying military maneuvers by the “the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet forces.”\n\nThe North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Monday called the missiles “strategic” weapons and said their launches verified the operation posture of the country’s “nuclear war deterrence.” This implies that North Korea aims to arm the cruise missiles with nuclear warheads.\n\nIt said the missiles flew for more than two hours, drawing figure-eight-shaped patterns and hit targets 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) away. The missiles were fired from the 8.24 Yongung ship, KCNA said, referencing a submarine that North Korea used to conduct its first submarine-launched ballistic missile test in 2016.\n\nThe reported launch details show Japan, including U.S. military bases in Okinawa, is within striking distance of the cruise missiles, if they are fired from the North’s eastern waters, said Kim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. He added the weapons could reach even the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam if the submarine could operate at a greater distance from North Korean waters.\n\nSunday’s actions were the North’s first underwater missile launches since it test-fired a weapon from a silo under an inland reservoir last October. Last May, the country test-launched a short-range ballistic missile from the same submarine.\n\nNorth Korea’s command of submarine-launched missile systems would make it harder for adversaries to detect launches in advance and would provide the North with retaliatory attack capability. Experts say it would take years, extensive resources and major technological improvements for the heavily sanctioned nation to build a fleet of several submarines that could travel quietly in seas and reliably execute strikes.\n\nKim Dong-yub, the professor, said Sunday’s tests were the North’s first known launches of cruise missiles from a submarine as its previous underwater launches all involved ballistic missiles. He said that North Korea is pushing to obtain various types of missiles and launch platforms to boost its ability to evade detection before launch or interception during flight.\n\nSouth Korea’s military confirmed the latest North Korean missile launches, saying they were fired from a submarine in waters near the North’s eastern port city of Sinpo on Sunday. Sinpo has a major submarine-building shipyard.\n\nSouth Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said that it maintains a readiness in close coordination with the United States. It said the South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing details of Sunday’s launches.\n\nAfter a record number of missile tests last year, North Korea has carried out several additional rounds since Jan. 1. Before Sunday’s launches, the country also test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile potentially capable of reaching the mainland U.S.; short-range, nuclear-capable missiles designed to hit South Korea; and other weapons.\n\nExperts say Kim, who sees his nuclear arsenal as his best security guarantee, is trying to pressure the United States into accepting the North as a legitimate nuclear power and relax international economic sanctions.\n\nNorth Korea sees regular South Korea-U.S. military exercises as a major security threat, though the allies say their drills are defensive. Some observers say North Korea uses its rivals’ drills as a pretext to test weapons and modernize its nuclear arsenal to secure an upper hand in dealings with the United States.\n\nIn past years, the U.S. and South Korea cancelled or scaled back some drills to pursue diplomatic efforts to denuclearize North Korea and out of concern about the COVID-19 pandemic. The two countries once more expanded exercises after North Korea conducted more than 70 missile tests in 2022 and adopted an increasingly aggressive nuclear doctrine.\n\nIn recent weeks, the U.S. flew powerful, long-range bombers for joint aerial drills with South Korean fighter jets. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said the deployment demonstrated U.S. commitment to use a full range of military capabilities, including nuclear, to defend its Asian ally in the event of outright conflict with North Korea.\n\nLast Thursday, Kim supervised a live-fire artillery drill simulating attacks on a South Korean airfield. He ordered his military to maintain the capability to “overwhelmingly respond ” to enemy actions, which he said included “all sorts of more frantic war preparation moves” according to KCNA.\n\nThe news agency reported Sunday that Kim also convened a key meeting on military affairs to adopt unspecified steps to make “more effective, powerful and offensive use of the war deterrent” in light of U.S. and South Korean maneuvers.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/china/china-ukraine-warning-us-asia-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "What China really means when it talks about NATO's eastward ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nWhen Russian armed forces launched an unprovoked assault on Ukraine last month, Beijing appeared to side with Moscow, accusing the United States and its NATO allies of inviting conflict by allowing their security bloc to expand eastward.\n\nNow, as China faces pressure from the West to condemn the Russian invasion, it’s ramping up similar rhetoric to talk about America’s footprint in Asia.\n\nIn recent days, senior Chinese Foreign Ministry officials and influential Communist Party publications have accused the US of seeking to build a NATO-like bloc in the Indo-Pacific, with one official warning of “unimaginable” consequences if it does.\n\nAt a conference in Beijing on Saturday, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said the Ukraine crisis could be used as a “mirror” to view the security situation in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nLe didn’t name the US, but he explicitly referred to the Indo-Pacific strategy – a plan the Biden administration detailed last month to strengthen America’s role in the region, such as through supporting democracy and bolstering its alliances and partnerships, including with Taiwan.\n\nBuilding “closed and exclusive small circles or groups” in the region “is as dangerous as the NATO strategy of eastward expansion in Europe,” Le said at the event at Tsinghua University, according to a version of the speech published by China’s Foreign Ministry.\n\n“If allowed to go on unchecked, it would bring unimaginable consequences, and ultimately push the Asia-Pacific over the edge of an abyss,” he said.\n\nChina’s criticism of NATO follows attempts to portray itself as a neutral actor in the Ukraine crisis, refusing to denounce Russia’s attacks on civilians, while stressing its humanitarian aid to Ukraine and denying it considered providing military support to Moscow.\n\nHowever, China’s bid to draw parallels between the US strategy in the Indo-Pacific and NATO’s “eastward expansion” in Europe closely echoes talking points from Moscow, raising serious doubts as to Beijing’s supposed neutrality.\n\nRussian leader Vladimir Putin has repeatedly attempted to use concerns over NATO to justify his brutal invasion of Ukraine. Now, experts say China is seeking to use the current crisis in Ukraine to not only amplify its portrayal of the US as an alleged instigator of conflict, whether in Europe or in Asia, but to warn of the consequences if the US and countries in the region align against China.\n\nChina ‘takes advantage’ of crisis\n\nWashington’s emphasis on the Indo-Pacific has come as China pushes a more aggressive foreign policy, doubling down on its territorial claims, while taking a harder line in response to perceived challenges.\n\nIn recent years, China has disavowed a UN tribunal ruling dismissing its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea, while continuing to militarize its positions there and harass other claimants. It’s also ramped up its threats on self-governing Taiwan, with record incursions of fighter jets into the island’s air defense identification zone in recent months.\n\n“It’s no surprise that China would take advantage of the Ukraine crisis to lash out at the Indo-Pacific strategy,” said Li Mingjiang, an associate professor and Provost’s Chair in international relations at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University.\n\nLi pointed to China’s “growing anxieties” over the rejuvenation of the “Quad” security forum between India, Japan, Australia and the US, and of the AUKUS security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the US, as well as the strong commitment from the US to maintain its longstanding role in the region, outlined in Biden’s Indo-Pacific strategy last month.\n\n“The intention is clear – China wants to send this message to the US and countries in the region that the Indo-Pacific strategy and American security alliances could also generate some similar security dynamics (to those) seen in Europe, involving Russia,” Li said.\n\nThat message is also being sent ahead of an “extraordinary” NATO summit on Thursday, where US President Joe Biden will meet allied leaders in Brussels to discuss the situation in Ukraine – in another showing of the striking solidarity of the bloc since the start of the crisis.\n\nA message to America\n\nVice Foreign Minister Le’s warnings about the US presence in the Indo-Pacific were echoed Monday by the Chinese Ambassador to ASEAN at a news conference in Jakarta.\n\nThere, Ambassador Deng Xijun accused the US of “creating a set of ‘gang rules’ while claiming to uphold the international order” and taking the region “down an evil path,” according to Chinese state-run media The Paper.\n\nA similar tone was adopted in an opinion piece in China’s People’s Liberation Army Daily, republished last weekend on the website of the influential Communist Party journal Qiushi, which took aim at the Indo-Pacific strategy and said the US creation of blocs was an “important reason for the continuing souring and escalation of the Ukraine issue.”\n\nThis is not the first time that China has sought to draw parallels between the US strategy in the Indo-Pacific and NATO in recent years, and the concerns get at the heart of a key stance that has drawn Russia and China closer together: their mutual distrust of the US.\n\nThat was underlined in a 5,000-word joint statement released weeks before the invasion of Ukraine, in which both voiced their opposition to the “further enlargement of NATO” and pledged to “remain highly vigilant about the negative impact of the United States’ Indo-Pacific strategy.”\n\nBut experts point out there are vast differences between NATO, a security alliance, and the US strategy in Indo-Pacific, which is not just about security, but includes a range of policies. The US, with its own long Pacific Ocean border and island state of Hawaii, also has territories in the Indo-Pacific, including Guam.\n\nOther nations have also increased activities in the region in an effort to counter China’s influence. In the past year, Britain sent its largest concentration of maritime and air power for joint exercises in the Philippine Sea, while Germany sent a warship through the South China Sea for the first time in almost two decades. France also last year announced a plan to boost its maritime cooperation with the South Pacific. China has often pushed back against such actions, decrying what it sees as efforts to contain it.\n\nThe Chinese stance, meanwhile, ignores the fact US security partnerships have come in response to China’s own rapid military modernization, according to Drew Thompson, a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.\n\nThe US is “increasingly drawn into deeper and stronger security alliances because of (China’s military) modernization” and Beijing’s “lack of openness and transparency” toward its neighbors about its intentions, Thompson said.\n\nBut China’s leaders “don’t see a connection between other countries in the region hedging against China’s military modernization” through relationships with the US, he added.\n\nThe question of Taiwan\n\nAnother issue much closer to home may also explain why China is keen to call up its concerns over the US in the Asia-Pacific region amid the Ukraine crisis – Taiwan.\n\nThis was suggested in a 110-minute video meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday, where Xi’s concerns regarding Taiwan were clearly a focal point for the Chinese side.\n\n“Some people in the US have sent a wrong signal to ‘Taiwan independence’ forces. This is very dangerous. Mishandling of the Taiwan question will have a disruptive impact on the bilateral ties,” Xi told Biden, according to a Foreign Ministry readout.\n\nAnalysts have drawn comparisons between the authoritarian threats to Ukraine and Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy which Beijing claims as its own and has not ruled out taking by force. Earlier this month, a group of former US defense and security officials traveled to Taipei in a signal of American support amid the European crisis.\n\nThis connects too with China’s larger concerns in the Indo-Pacific, said RSIS’s Li.\n\n“If there’s a conflict over the Taiwan issue, a worst case scenario (for China) would be that China would not only have to fight a war against Taiwan, against the US, (but that) perhaps some US allies would be involved against China,” he said.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/asia/north-korea-missile-intl/index.html", "title": "US, Japanese and South Korean warships perform missile defense ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nUnited States, South Korean and Japanese warships performed a missile defense exercise in the Sea of Japan on Thursday, two days after North Korean sent a ballistic missile over Japan, the US-Indo Pacific Command said in a statement.\n\nThe two US warships, the guided-missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville and the guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold, both part of the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier strike group, participated in the exercise along with two Japanese and one South Korean destroyer, the US statement said.\n\nThursday’s exercise also came just hours after North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles, the latest in a spate of missile launches by Pyongyang in the past two weeks.\n\n“This exercise enhances the interoperability of our collective forces and demonstrates the strength of the trilateral relationship with our Japan and Republic of Korea (ROK) allies, which is forward-leaning, reflective of our shared values, and resolute against those who challenge regional stability,” the US Pacific Command statement said.\n\nEarlier, South Korean security officials said a US Navy aircraft carrier strike group was moving into waters off the Korean Peninsula.\n\nSouth Korea’s National Security Council (NSC) held an emergency meeting on Thursday after the short-range ballistic missiles launches, the sixth such launch in 12 days, the country’s Presidential Office said in a statement.\n\nThe NSC warned that North Korea’s provocation will face a stronger response following Pyongyang’s launch on Tuesday of the intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that flew over Japan.\n\nSouth Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff also said on Wednesday that the US carrier strike group would be redeployed to the waterway, in what it characterized as a “very unusual” move meant “to demonstrate the resolute will of the SK-US alliance to respond decisively to any provocation or threat from North Korea.”\n\nAn F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter operates on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan in the Sea of Japan on Wednesday.

These two members have gone out of their way to justify the DPRK’s repeated provocations and block every attempt to update the sanctions regime,” she said.\n\nReferring to Russia and China, Thomas-Greenfield said, “Two permanent members of the Security Council have enabled (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un” to continue these “provocations.”\n\nA USS Ronald Reagan crew members observes the launch of an F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet in the Sea of Japan on Wednesday.

He’s also signaling to Japan, ‘I can reach you and I’m not afraid to do so.’”\n\nSchuster also said that Kim can be expected to up the ante soon by testing a nuclear weapon.\n\nLewis agreed, saying a nuclear test could come “anytime.”\n\nSouth Korean and US officials have been warning since May that North Korea may be preparing for a nuclear test, with satellite imagery showing activity at its underground nuclear test site.\n\nIf North Korea conducts a test, it would be the country’s seventh underground nuclear test and the first in nearly five years.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Yoonjung Seo Caitlin Hu", "Brad Lendon", "Yoonjung Seo", "Caitlin Hu"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/01/asia/north-korea-missiles-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "North Korea fired the highest number of short-range missiles in a ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nThe South Korean military said Wednesday North Korea launched the highest number of short-range missiles in a day as Seoul retaliated to Pyongyang’s latest barrage of weapons tests, further escalating tensions in the region.\n\nNorth Korea fired as many as 23 missiles of different types to the east and west of the Korean Peninsula, including a surface-to-air missile into the waters off the east and west coasts of the Korean Peninsula, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.\n\nOne of the missiles launched by Pyongyang was a short-range ballistic missile that landed close to South Korean territorial waters for the first time since the division of Korea, Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.\n\nJCS said the missile landed in international waters 167 kilometers (104 miles) northwest of South Korea’s Ulleung island, about 26 kilometers south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) – the de facto inter-Korean maritime border that North Korea does not recognize.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told journalists North Korea is firing missiles at an \"unprecedently high frequency\" in the wake of escalating tensions in the region. Kyodo/Reuters\n\nJapan’s Defense Ministry said North Korea conducted another launch later on Wednesday, including at least one more ballistic missile toward the east that has fallen into the sea outside of Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\n\nThe ballistic missile flew a short distance at a maximum altitude of less than 50 km, Toshiro Ino, the deputy minister of defense, told reporters on Wednesday evening local time.\n\n“North Korea has rapidly escalated its provocations, launching more than a dozen missiles today alone and reportedly firing more than 100 artillery shells into the Japan sea since announcing an extremely provocative statement earlier in the day” Ino said.\n\nNo damage to aircraft or vessels has been confirmed as of now.\n\nWhen asked whether North Korea had in the past launched this many missiles throughout a day, Ino told reporters that in 2006 and 2009 the North had fired several missiles throughout the day from 3 a.m. to 5 p.m. local time, and 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. local time, respectively, without mentioning an exact number of missiles.\n\nA South Korean defense official said earlier the missiles landed to the west of the peninsula in the Yellow Sea, known as the West Sea in Korea, and to the east in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.\n\nAn air raid warning on Ulleung island, located about 120 kilometers east of the peninsula, was lifted about 2 p.m. local time on Wednesday. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the North Korean test was an “effective territorial encroachment.”\n\nAt an emergency National Security Council (NSC) meeting, Yoon “ordered that a stern response be swiftly taken so that North Korea’s provocation pays a clear price,” according to South Korea’s presidential office.\n\nIn an immediate response, South Korea launched three air-to-surface missiles from F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets on Wednesday morning, according to JCS.\n\nJCS said the South Korean Air Force targeted international waters north of the NLL at an equal distance to that which the North Korean missile had earlier landed south of the line.\n\n“Our military’s precise strike showed our will to firmly respond to any North Korean provocations including short-range ballistic missile, and our capability and readiness to precisely target the enemy,” JCS said.\n\nNorth Korea is “fully responsible” for the situation as they are the ones continuing to provoke despite warnings, JCS added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that North Korea is launching missiles at an “unprecedentedly high frequency.”\n\nKishida also called for a National Security Council meeting to be held as soon as possible due to the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n“North Korea’s unprecedented launch of multiple ballistic missiles is recklessly threatening the security of the Republic of Korea,” Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Penny Wong, tweeted on Wednesday.\n\n“Pyongyang must cease this action,” she added.\n\nSouth Korea responded to North Korea's barrage of missiles on Wednesday by firing three air-to-surface missiles from F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets.

Then, an employee standing behind the counter spins around a touch screen and slides it in front of you. The screen has a few suggested tip amounts – usually 10%, 15% or 20%. There’s also often an option to leave a custom tip or no tip at all.\n\nThe worker is directly across from you. Other customers are standing behind, waiting impatiently and looking over your shoulder to see how much you tip. And you must make a decision in seconds. Oh lord, the stress.\n\nCustomers and workers today are confronted with a radically different tipping culture compared to just a few years ago — without any clear norms. Although consumers are accustomed to tipping waiters, bartenders and other service workers, tipping a barista or cashier may be a new phenomenon for many shoppers. It’s being driven in large part by changes in technology that have enabled business owners to more easily shift the costs of compensating workers directly to customers.\n\n“I don’t know how much you’re supposed to tip and I study this,” said Michael Lynn, a professor of consumer behavior and marketing at Cornell University and one of the leading researchers on US tipping habits.\n\nAmerica has tipping fatigue. Liz Hafalia/San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images\n\nAdding to the changing dynamics, customers were encouraged to tip generously during the pandemic to help keep restaurants and stores afloat, raising expectations. Total tips for full-service restaurants were up 25% during the latest quarter compared to a year ago, while tips at quick-service restaurants were up 17%, according to data from Square.\n\nThe shift to digital payments also accelerated during the pandemic, leading stores to replace old-fashioned cash tip jars with tablet touch screens. But these screens and the procedures for digital tipping have proven more intrusive than a low-pressure cash tip jar with a few bucks in it.\n\nCustomers are overwhelmed by the number of places where they now have the option to tip and feel pressure about whether to add a gratuity and for how much. Some people deliberately walk away from the screen without doing anything to avoid making a decision, say etiquette experts who study tipping culture and consumer behavior.\n\nTipping can be an emotionally charged decision. Attitudes towards tipping in these new settings vary widely.\n\nSome customers tip no matter what. Others feel guilty if they don’t tip or embarrassed if their tip is stingy. And others eschew tipping for a $5 iced coffee, saying the price is already high enough.\n\n“The American public feels like tipping is out of control because they’re experiencing it in places they’re not used to,” said Lizzie Post, co-president of the Emily Post Institute and its namesake’s great-great-granddaughter. “Moments where tipping isn’t expected makes people less generous and uncomfortable.”\n\nStarbucks has rolled out tipping this year as an option for customers paying with credit and debit cards. Some Starbucks baristas told CNN that the tips are adding extra money to their paychecks, but customers shouldn’t feel obligated to tip every time.\n\nOne barista in Washington State said that he understands if a customer doesn’t tip for a drip coffee order. But if he makes a customized drink after spending time talking to the customer about exactly how it should be made, “it does make me a little bit disappointed if I don’t receive a tip.”\n\n“If someone can afford Starbucks every day, they can afford to tip on at least a few of those trips,” added the employee, who spoke under the condition of anonymity.\n\n“Un-American”\n\nThe option to tip is seemingly everywhere today, but the practice has a troubled history in the United States.\n\nTipping spread after the Civil War as an exploitative measure to keep down wages of newly-freed slaves in service occupations. Pullman was the most notable for its tipping policies. The railroad company hired thousands of Black porters, but paid them low wages and forced them to rely on tips to make a living.\n\nCritics of tipping argued that it created an imbalance between customers and workers, and several states passed laws in the early 1900s to ban the practice.\n\nIn “The Itching Palm,” a 1916 diatribe on tipping in America, writer William Scott said that tipping was “un-American” and argued that “the relation of a man giving a tip and a man accepting it is as undemocratic as the relation of master and slave.”\n\nBut tipping service workers was essentially built into law by the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which created the federal minimum wage that excluded restaurant and hospitality workers. This allowed the tipping system to proliferate in these industries.\n\nIn 1966, Congress created a “subminimum” wage for tipped workers. The federal minimum wage for tipped employees has stood at $2.13 per hour — lower than the $7.25 federal minimum — since 1991, although many states require higher base wages for tipped employees. If a server’s tips don’t add up to the federal minimum, the law says that the employer must make up the difference. But this doesn’t always happen. Wage theft and other wage violations are common in the service industry.\n\nThe Department of Labor considers any employee working in a job that “customarily and regularly” receives more than $30 a month in tips as eligible to be classified a tipped worker. Experts estimate there are more than five million tipped workers in the United States.\n\nTips on tipping\n\nJust how much to tip is entirely subjective and varies across industries, and the link between the quality of service and the tip amount is surprisingly weak, Lynn from Cornell said.\n\nHe theorized that a 15% to 20% tip at restaurants became standard because of a cycle of competition among customers. Many people tip to gain social approval or with the expectation of better service. As tip levels increase, other customers start tipping more to avoid any losses in status or risk poorer service.\n\nThe gig economy has also changed tipping norms. An MIT study released in 2019 found that customers are less likely to tip when workers have autonomy over whether and when to work. Nearly 60% of Uber customers never tip, while only about 1% always tip, a 2019 University of Chicago study found.\n\nWhat makes it confusing, Lynn said, is that “there’s no central authority that establishes tipping norms. They come from the bottom up. Ultimately, it’s what people do that helps establish what other people should do.”\n\nYou should almost always tip workers earning the subminimum wage such as restaurant servers and bartenders, say advocates and tipping experts.\n\nThe option to tip at coffee shops has become ubiquitous. Adobe Stock\n\nWhen given the option to tip in places where workers make an hourly wage, such as Starbucks baristas, customers should use their discretion and remove any guilt from their decision, etiquette experts say. Tips help these workers supplement their income and are always encouraged, but it’s okay to say no.\n\nEtiquette experts recommend that customers approach the touch screen option the same way they would a tip jar. If they would leave change or a small cash tip in the jar, do so when prompted on the screen.\n\n“A 10% tip for takeaway food is a really common amount. We also see change or a single dollar per order,” said Lizzie Post. If you aren’t sure what to do, ask the worker if the store has a suggested tip amount.\n\nSaru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, which advocates to end subminimum wage policies, encourages customers to tip. But tips should never count against service workers’ wages, and customers must demand that businesses pay workers a full wage, she said.\n\n“We’ve got to tip, but it’s got to be combined with telling employers that tips have to be on top, not instead of, a full minimum wage,” she said.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/uk/queen-elizabeth-funeral-security-plans-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Queen Elizabeth's funeral: London braces itself for massive security ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLondon police chiefs and medics are bracing themselves for a security nightmare at the Queen’s funeral on Monday as they balance the need to protect the world’s top leaders and dignitaries with the public’s desire to mourn their much-loved monarch.\n\nSome have compared the event in scale to the London Olympics, but in truth the state funeral – the first in Britain since Winston Churchill died in 1965 – is likely to dwarf the 2012 sporting extravaganza.\n\nCodenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every detail before her death.\n\nThe city has already seen unprecedented crowds viewing the official lying-in-state, which will run until 6.30 a.m. (1.30 a.m. ET) on Monday, just hours before the funeral procession to Westminster Abbey commences. The sheer numbers caused queueing to be temporily paused on Friday.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News earlier this week, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said of the scale: “If you think about the London marathon, the carnival, previous royal weddings, the Olympics – it’s all that in one.”\n\nThe three police forces which operate in the British capital – the Metropolitan Police, the City of London Police and British Transport Police – initiated their well-rehearsed plans across London as soon as the death of Elizabeth II was announced on September 8.\n\nThe funeral will be the “largest single policing event” that London’s Metropolitan Police force has undertaken, its Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy told reporters Friday.\n\n“As a single event, this is larger than the 2012 Olympics. It is larger than the Platinum Jubilee weekend. And the range of officers, police staff, and all those supporting the operation is truly immense,” he said.\n\nIt is also set to “be the largest global protection operation the Met Police has ever undertaken” as “hundreds of world leaders and VIPs” descend upon London, he said.\n\nWhen asked specifically how high-profile guests would be transported to London’s Westminster Abbey for the funeral service, Cundy declined to give specific details, saying it would not be conducive to a “safe and secure event and policing operation.”\n\nMeanwhile the mammoth logistical operation has involved myriad other aspects, such as medics, toilets, street cleaning and road closures.\n\nThe size of the crowds turning out to pay their last respects is “impossible” to predict, according to Andy Byford, commissioner for Transport for London (TfL).\n\nByford described the funeral as “the biggest event” the transport network has ever faced in an interview with Britain’s PA Media news agency.\n\nComparing it to the Olympics, he said: “This is more challenging. It’s over a long period and although there are estimates, it is impossible to say with certainty how many people will turn up to the various elements, so we’ve assumed the highest possible number and we’re aligning our service to match that.”\n\nInvitations have been sent to world leaders, politicians, public figures and European royals, as well as more than 500 international dignitaries. The security considerations are mind-boggling.\n\nCrowds have been growing in London in the run-up to the Queen's funeral. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nThe British government is taking the lead on logistics but has refused to comment on specific “operational security arrangements.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden was among the first to confirm his attendance at the event, which will be attended by up to 2,000 people. Japanese Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako will also travel to London, as will many other royals and global leaders.\n\nHundreds of police officers from other forces are supporting the Met, yet the attendance of so many VIPs will pile on the pressure.\n\n“Everything will have been negotiated,” said Morgan, explaining that some concessions will have been made. There simply aren’t enough police and protection officers to give an escorted convoy to everybody who would normally get it on a standalone visit. Therefore people are being put together on a logistical basis,” Morgan said continued.\n\nHuge crowds have waited for hours to catch a glimpse of the Queen lying in state before her funeral. Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSimon Morgan is a former royalty protection officer who was responsible for overseeing senior royals including the Queen and new King between 2007 and 2013.\n\n“It will be seamless,” Morgan, who now runs private security firm Trojan Consultancy, told CNN. “The policing plan and security behind it is a two-fold operation: security and public safety are both intrinsic.”\n\nMorgan said the events surrounding the state funeral have been in the pipeline for decades. “London Bridge came to fruition in the 60s. It’s been subject to review at least three times a year.\n\n“Elements are discussed and indeed some elements have been already used in isolation,” he said, citing the Queen Mother’s funeral in 2002, royal weddings and the Platinum Jubilee as examples.\n\nRegular reviews were vital in combating the changing nature of security threats – from Irish nationalism in the 1970s and 80s, to Islamic extremism more recently.\n\nWhite House aides have declined to provide specific security details for President Biden’s visit, but say they are working with their British counterparts to ensure the demands of presidential security are met. The FBI will monitor potential threat streams and share any information with UK security service MI5.\n\nWhen reports emerged last week that world leaders would be required to ride on a bus to the funeral, US officials were skeptical and shot down the suggestion Biden would travel to Westminster Abbey in a coach.\n\nIn 2018, when other world leaders traveled together in a bus to a World War I memorial in Paris, then-US President Donald Trump traveled separately in his own vehicle. The White House explained at the time the separate trip was “due to security protocols.”\n\n“Everything will have been negotiated,” said Morgan, explaining that some concessions will have been made. There simply aren’t enough police and protection officers to give an escorted convoy to everybody who would normally get it on a standalone visit. Therefore people are being put together on a logistical basis,” Morgan said.\n\n“There’s no compromise in relation to security and a lot of visiting dignitaries will be very aware of the optics of demanding their own protection teams.”\n\nPolice must also consider the “fixated threat,” he said. “That’s someone who is fixated on a member of the royal family. A lot of those people are subject to mental health orders and subsequently came to the attention of medical professionals and sometimes law enforcement.”\n\n“Single cause” activists also pose a risk, Morgan said. The force has already come in for harsh criticism over its treatment of republican protesters.\n\n“Every single one of these causes wants to use global media attention to highlight what’s important to them,” he added.\n\nSymon Hill, from Oxford, told CNN how he was aggressively arrested after calling out “not my King” at a ceremony which proclaimed Charles III’s accession. He said he had been left “gobsmacked” after “police intervened, grabbed hold of me, handcuffed me, and put me in the back of a police van.”\n\nHe added: “Surely arbitrary arrest is not something we should have in a democratic society.”\n\nAccording to Morgan, police aim not to ban peaceful protests but ensure public order, as demonstrations can sometimes provoke confrontation when emotions are running high.\n\n“The police are very much in a ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’ situation,” he said.\n\nWhile police are spearheading the operation, many others are closely involved – among them military, transport and utility bosses.\n\nPreparing London for the Queen's funeral has been a massive operation which has been decades in the planning. Richard Baker/In Pictures/Getty Images\n\nConcerns over health are paramount. As well as the official emergency services, around 2,000 volunteers and employees from St. John Ambulance have provided 24-hour support in London and Windsor for the lying-in-state, as well as her funeral.\n\n“In our planning for this sad occasion, we estimated we’d need around 1,000 volunteers, but more than double that have said they can make themselves available,” St. John Commissioner of Operations Mike Gibbons said in a statement.\n\nPatrick Goulbourne, assistant commissioner, operational resilience and control, at London Fire Brigade, told CNN his team worked “over many years with partners.”\n\nThey have carried out fire safety inspections on over 40 key central transport hubs and have also been carrying out around 160 fire safety inspections a day at hotels, restaurants, shops and more. In addition, there have been 10 fire engines and around 50 firefighters assisting people in line to see the Queen’s coffin around the clock.", "authors": ["Lianne Kolirin"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/13/health/family-covid-isolation-guidelines-wellness/index.html", "title": "What to do if your family member contracts Covid-19 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThese days, it’s much easier to contract the coronavirus as the highly contagious Omicron variant spreads worldwide. As people face this current reality, it’s important to note that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recently changed its guidelines around isolation and quarantine. Many have questions about what to do if they or a family member ends up catching Covid-19.\n\nWhat if a child tests positive — how should parents and guardians care for that child safely? What if a parent has Covid-19 but their children don’t? How long should someone be in isolation? When should people be tested? What if everyone in the family contracts Covid-19 — do they need to be isolated from one another?\n\nTo answer your questions, I spoke with one of our experts, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health,” and the mom of two young children.\n\nCNN: You’ve talked a lot about the difference between isolation and quarantine. What’s the difference and why is it important?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: There is a big difference, and it’s important to distinguish the two. The guidance is very different, depending on if you’re in isolation versus quarantine. Isolation is what you do when you are diagnosed with Covid-19. Quarantine is what you might have to do if you are exposed to Covid-19 but have not yet been diagnosed. The CDC has very different guidelines for isolation versus quarantine, so that’s why the specific vocabulary is important.\n\nCNN: A lot of families are facing situations where someone is testing positive. If one member of the family —say a parent — gets diagnosed with Covid-19, what should they do next?\n\nWen: That person should immediately isolate from others. The person who was just diagnosed with Covid-19 should be presumed to be potentially infectious. Everybody else in the family should also get tested immediately. It’s possible that the person who tested positive was not the first person to contract Covid-19, and other members may also test positive.\n\nCNN: What if everybody tests positive? Do they need to isolate from one another?\n\nWen: If everyone has Covid-19, they do not need to isolate from each other. That’s because it’s highly unlikely that they have different strains of coronavirus; they probably all got the same strain from one another, and they aren’t going to reinfect each other so quickly. The entire family, of course, should be isolating from other people.\n\nCNN: What if it’s a child who tests positive, and everybody else is testing negative? Who’s going to care for the child?\n\nWen: This is very difficult, especially if it’s a younger child who can’t care for themselves. I would look at the circumstances of the household. Let’s say that there are two parents or primary caregivers, and both are vaccinated, boosted and generally healthy. Let’s say that there is another child who is not vaccinated, and therefore at higher risk for severe outcomes from Covid-19 compared with one who is vaccinated.\n\nIf a young child tests positive for Covid-19 and other family members are at high risk, having the child form a pod with one parent is an option, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen advised. Adobe Stock\n\nIn that scenario, I’d recommend splitting up the household so that one parent cares for the child who has Covid-19 and the other one cares for the child who does not have it. The two different “pods” should not interact with one another during the isolation period. If possible, they shouldn’t share any indoor space. They should sleep in different rooms, not share the same bathroom, and not get together indoors at all during this time. The parent caring for the child with Covid-19 should wear a mask when with the child to try to reduce the likelihood of getting infected themselves.\n\nThe situation becomes more challenging if there is only one parent or caregiver. Ventilation — opening windows and doors when feasible — can help, as can very careful handwashing and masking.\n\nCNN: Does isolation mean that you must be inside the whole time? Can you still go out and get fresh air?\n\nWen: Technically, isolation does mean that you have to be inside and away from others. However, this is where you can use common sense. If you live in a house, townhouse or apartment where you don’t have to pass any shared space to get fresh air, you could go outside. Please be careful, stay very well-distanced from others, and do not share indoor space with people. None of us wants to infect others inadvertently.\n\nCNN: How long should someone be in isolation?\n\nWen: The CDC’s new guidelines essentially shorten the isolation period from 10 days to five days, with an additional five days wearing a mask. This means that you should stay fully isolated for the first five days. After that, you can go out — to work, to the grocery and so forth — but you should wear a high-quality, well-fitting mask when out in public. Don’t go to settings where you will be maskless, such as restaurants.\n\nWhen it comes to people in the same family, this guidance means you really shouldn’t have meals together or have other casual, maskless encounters with uninfected members of your family in the 10-day period. If families are in two pods, the two shouldn’t mix for 10 days inside their house.\n\nCNN: If someone had symptoms on Monday, got tested on Wednesday and then got results back on Friday, when does the five-day clock start?\n\nWen: Monday. The five-day clock starts when someone first starts getting symptoms. If someone is tested and they are asymptomatic but have a positive result, the five-day clock starts when they first got the test. If you are unsure — for example, if you are feeling a little rundown Sunday but don’t really have full symptoms until Tuesday — use the date that you are certain of the symptoms.\n\nRemember that the count starts at day zero. Day one is the first full 24 hours after the onset of symptoms or after the positive test.\n\nCNN: When should you get tested again?\n\nWen: The CDC is not recommending testing to get out of isolation. What they are saying is that you can take a rapid antigen test at day five, but then if it’s positive, you must keep isolating for another five days.\n\nI disagree here with the CDC. If you have rapid tests readily available, I think you can test starting day five. If it’s negative on day five and negative the next day (day six), I think it would be reasonable to end isolation. This could be crucial for families, for whom being separated from one another is a major inconvenience. Importantly, a PCR test, while more accurate for initial diagnosis, is not the test to use after your diagnosis is already confirmed. That’s because the PCR test is so sensitive that it picks up on small fragments of virus, and people infected with Covid-19 could still be testing positive by PCR weeks after they are no longer infectious.\n\nCNN: What about those who tested negative for Covid-19 initially? When should they get tested again?\n\nWen: The CDC recommends that those individuals exposed to someone with Covid-19 get tested no sooner than five days after their exposure. The agency further breaks this down into whether you are vaccinated and boosted, versus if you are not. It also considers those who had Covid-19 in the past 90 days to be the same as if they are vaccinated and boosted. If you are not, you need to quarantine until a negative test result at least five days after and then wear a mask for five more days in public. If you are, then you do not need to quarantine, but you should still get a test in five days.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHere’s where I would add a bit more nuance to the CDC guidance. First, if you have rapid tests readily available, I think it’s reasonable to test family members every day. They may not be cleared from quarantine until at least five days later, but if they end up testing positive sooner, it would change how family members interact with one another. Perhaps the entire family is already exposed and will test positive in a day or two, which eliminates the need to separate one another.\n\nSecond, even though the CDC says that those exposed do not need to quarantine if they are up to date on vaccines, employers and schools may have different guidance.

Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.\n\nCNN —\n\nA period product that’s eco-friendly, stylish and easy to use might sound impossible. But period underwear might be just that.\n\n“Period underwear is a relatively newer period hygiene product that serves to be an alternative to more traditional products that people might be aware of, like pads and tampons,” said Dr. Jessica Shim, a physician in the division of gynecology at Boston Children’s Hospital and a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nThe technology used varies among brands, but typically involves several layers of material — such as cotton, nylon, merino wool or polyester — geared toward absorbency of blood and wicking moisture from the vulva so the wearer feels dry, Shim said. Some brands use antimicrobial technology for combating odor or inhibiting bacterial growth.\n\nPeriod underwear has grown popular over the past few years for several reasons. For one, being low-waste and reusable makes these products more eco-friendly than single-use ones. Conventional menstrual products can be up to 90% plastic, and about 49 billion of these single-use items are consumed annually in the United States alone, according to the United Nations Environment Programme’s Life Cycle Initiative.\n\nBrands behind conventional period products aren’t required by the US Food and Drug Administration to list every material included in their products, so knowing exactly what you’re putting in contact with your body is another great reason to use period underwear, said Sarah Frank, a doctoral student and lecturer in the departments of sociology and legal studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nPeriod underwear is also a good alternative for people getting comfortable with their changing bodies, those uncomfortable with inserting products into their bodies, athletes needing products to stay put and people who take care of menstrual hygiene for loved ones with disabilities, Shim said.\n\n“Patients who are nonbinary (or) transgender may find it to be more convenient to use and not have to discard disposable products in public restrooms,” she added.\n\nHere’s how to choose the best pair for you and care for them.\n\nHow absorbent is period underwear?\n\nPeriod underwear brands offer a variety of absorbencies since people have different flows.\n\n“They’re typically saying the amount of tampons or sometimes the amount of blood that the underwear will absorb,” Shim said. “The light one will absorb (the same amount as) one tampon and the medium absorbency underwear will list maybe two to five tampons.”\n\nSome brands recommend changing period underwear every 12 hours to prevent odor or leakage. Feeling wetness or skin irritation or seeing blood on your clothes can indicate that you need to change the pair because the underwear has absorbed all it can.\n\n“Period underwear are designed to be a day-long or most-of-the-day option,” said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, Darney-Landy Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, via email.\n\n“If someone is bleeding beyond what the underwear can hold, it may be worth getting a different type or having an additional method like a tampon or menstrual cup.”\n\nHow should period underwear be worn?\n\nPeriod underwear can be worn on its own or for extra security while wearing a tampon, menstrual cup or disc, Shim said.\n\nIf you’re going to sleep in period underwear, make sure your pair’s gusset runs long or high enough up your bottom so it can catch blood while you’re lying down, Frank said.\n\nHow many pairs do I need?\n\nHow many you might need per day and for your whole cycle depends on your flow and how long your period typically lasts. You could need anywhere from a few to more than several pairs, Frank said.\n\nTry wearing period underwear at home first so you can do a test run and make any needed adjustments in a safe space, Brandi said.\n\n“For some people, they may be practical because it prevents trips to the store when you have run out of pads or tampons,” said Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB/GYN and pain medicine physician based in California.\n\n“For other people, changing underwear if you are out of the house and your period underwear is full might be impractical as you would need a backup and a plastic bag to take your bloody pair home,” said Gunter, author of “The Vagina Bible: The Vulva and the Vagina — Separating the Myth From the Medicine.”\n\nWhat’s the best way to wash period underwear?\n\nSpecific care instructions depend on the manufacturer’s instructions, but typically, hand- or machine-washing period underwear with cold water is best, Shim said. These items can be washed alone or with other clothes.\n\nIf you hand-wash your underwear, do so until the water runs clear so you don’t put the same blood and bacteria against your body again, Frank said.\n\nPreserve the period underwear’s technology and get more wears out of your supply by avoiding use of fabric softeners and by air-drying, Shim said.\n\nIf your pair has lots of absorbed blood, you can wring it out before throwing it in the washing machine, Frank said.\n\n“It does require you to at least hands-on touch your underwear,” Shim said. “For some people, that concept really is discomforting for them.”\n\nDo period underwear smell?\n\nIf you’re not used to free bleeding, you might worry that you or others around you will be able to smell the blood sitting in an undergarment outside your body. But if you’ve properly cleaned your period underwear and haven’t worn them past their absorbency capacity, there shouldn’t be a noticeable smell, these experts told CNN.\n\nWhat about the cost?\n\nA box of around 40 tampons or pads can cost about $10 to $25, so seeing that one pair of period underwear costs about $15 to $50 can be intimidating, Frank and Shim said.\n\nOver time, however, period underwear can be financially beneficial since they would replace the need to restock single-use products every month for the rest of the time you have a period, Shim said.\n\n“Although it may be a long-term cost-effective option, it requires a sizable up-front investment, which means that it may not be an option that is equitably available to all people,” Brandi said.\n\nHow long does period underwear last?\n\nPeriod underwear can last for several years if properly cared for. But materials can wear down, so stocking up on several pairs isn’t a one-time investment, Frank said.\n\nShifts in period flow and body size or shape are other factors that can influence how long you can wear the same pairs.\n\nDoes period underwear affect symptoms and period length?\n\nSome people on social media platforms and product reviews have reported a lighter flow or shorter period while wearing period underwear. But experts say these observations are most likely more due to a difference in how much blood products absorb than the period underwear themselves changing someone’s menstruation amount or length.\n\n“(When) wearing tampons, for example, you’re constantly thinking about when you need to change it,” Shim said. “That might cause you to perceive your period to maybe be more bothersome and heavy because of how often you’re changing out these disposable products, versus seeing a pair of underwear last you the whole day. That might give you a good sign like, ‘Oh, OK, great — maybe my period is a lot more manageable than I’ve thought otherwise.’”\n\nAnecdotal reports of milder cramps, however, could have more merit.\n\n“I have not seen any data that would suggest that period underwear can alleviate symptoms, but not having a product inserted into the body could potentially impact the patient’s experience of cramping,” Brandi said.\n\nSome people have pelvic floor muscle spasms and might feel pain using internal period products, Gunter said.\n\n“People should be able to access and use whatever type of period management tools that work best for them, including period underwear,” Brandi said.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/health/monkeypox-questions-update/index.html", "title": "What is monkeypox, and how can you stay safe while it spreads ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration has declared the monkeypox outbreak in the US to be a public health emergency.\n\n“We’re prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus, and we urge every American to take this virus seriously and to take responsibility to help us tackle this virus,” US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said.\n\nMonkeypox is a poxvirus, related to smallpox and cowpox. It generally causes pimple- or blister-like lesions and flu-like symptoms such as fever, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe lesions typically concentrate on the arms and legs, but in this outbreak, they’re showing up more frequently on the genital and perianal area.\n\nThe rash is “showing up in different parts of the body than we typically expect to see it,” Dr. John Brooks, the CDC’s chief medical officer of HIV prevention, said in late May.\n\nHe and other experts have been emphasizing that fact “to remind people that people may come in for an evaluation of what they think is an STD, but we’d like the provider to think ‘Could it be monkeypox as well?’ if the circumstances fit the story,” he said.\n\nHow is monkeypox spread?\n\nMonkeypox spreads through close contact, according to the CDC. That includes direct physical contact with lesions as well as “respiratory secretions” shared through face-to-face interaction and touching objects that have been contaminated by monkeypox lesions or fluids. The virus may also pass to a fetus through the placenta.\n\nMany of the cases in the outbreak appear to be connected to sexual contact, often during sex. The CDC says research is ongoing on whether monkeypox can spread through semen or vaginal fluids, or whether the virus can spread asymptomatically.\n\n“Monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted infection in the typical sense, but it can be transmitted during sexual and intimate contact, as well as with personal contact and shared bedding and clothing,” Brooks said.\n\nThe CDC says it’s not clear whether monkeypox can spread through semen or vaginal fluids, but the virus can’t spread asymptomatically.\n\nWho is at risk of monkeypox?\n\nAnyone who has had contact with someone with a monkeypox-like rash, or who has had contact with someone who has a probable or confirmed case of monkeypox, is at high risk for infection.\n\nHowever, a large number of cases in this outbreak have been in men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men, and public health officials are focusing their prevention efforts in this group. The virus is not unique to this community, but the nature of its close-contact spread has led to a disproportionate impact.\n\nAccording to the CDC, those at higher risk during this outbreak include people who “had skin-to-skin contact with someone in a social network experiencing monkeypox activity,” including men who have sex with men who meet partners online, through an app or at a social event.\n\nWhat should I do if I have monkeypox symptoms?\n\nIf you notice a new rash or other monkeypox symptoms, avoid any close contact with other people until you have seen a doctor and gotten tested.\n\n“When you see a healthcare provider, wear a mask, and remind them that the virus is circulating in the area,” the CDC says.\n\nIf you’re diagnosed with monkeypox, the agency recommends isolation at home and away from family members until the rash or lesions are gone.\n\nWhat’s the treatment for monkeypox?\n\nAccording to the CDC, there is no approved treatment specific for monkeypox. But because it’s genetically similar to smallpox, doctors can use similar treatments, such as antiviral medications.\n\nThe CDC is making doses of tecovirimat, an antiviral medication also known as Tpoxx, available for monkeypox patients at risk of severe disease. This may include those whose infection has advanced into the severe stage and people with weakened immune systems. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has also announced a study of Tpoxx as a monkeypox treatment.\n\nTreatment for monkeypox should also include efforts to manage symptoms and complications, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIs there a monkeypox vaccine?\n\nTwo vaccines are available in the US to prevent monkeypox, but not everyone is eligible to get one.\n\nThe US has “ample supply” of the smallpox vaccine ACAM2000, which can also be used to prevent monkeypox. However, it shouldn’t be used in people with certain health conditions, according to the CDC.\n\n“We have 100 million doses of ACAM2000,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said in late June, but its side effects mean that it “in my mind as a public health person, would not be worth giving it widely throughout the general population.”\n\nAnother vaccine, Jynneos, is specifically intended for monkeypox, but it’s in short supply. Federal stock is being distributed to municipalities based on the number of cases and the population at risk in a given area.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Health and Human Services, more than 600,000 doses of Jynneos have been distributed from the Strategic National Stockpile and another 150,000 doses are expected to arrive in September. The CDC has estimated at least 1.5 million people in the US are eligible for monkeypox vaccination.\n\nThe Biden administration has announced the release of a stock of Jynneos doses from Denmark, which it says should make an additional 786,000 doses available in the US. The government expects to make almost 2 million doses available this year and 2.2 million more in the first half of 2023.\n\nJynneos is a two-dose vaccine, with a four-week gap between doses. But in light of the shortages, some experts have called for a single-dose regimen until supply improves.\n\nMonkeypox vaccination can be used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and outbreak response PEP (PEP++), according to the CDC.\n\nPrEP refers to vaccinations given to members of high-risk communities, such as lab or health care workers, before they may come into contact with the virus.\n\nPEP means vaccinating people after a known exposure to prevent disease or help ease symptoms. For prevention, the CDC recommends that the vaccine be given up to four days after exposure. PEP given four to 14 days after exposure may result in milder disease.\n\nPEP++ is the CDC approach for people with unconfirmed exposure to the virus but with risk factors that may make them more likely to get it.\n\n“When coupled with self-isolation and other prevention measures when symptoms first occur, PEP++ may help slow the spread of the disease in areas with large numbers of monkeypox cases,” the CDC says.\n\nCan I get a vaccine?\n\nMonkeypox vaccine demand is high, but supply shortages and eligibility restrictions mean it can be difficult to find at this point.\n\nEligibility for the vaccines remains somewhat strict.\n\nPeople who are known, confirmed contacts of people with monkeypox are eligible to be vaccinated. Also eligible are presumed contacts who had a sex partner in the past 14 days diagnosed with monkeypox, those who had multiple sex partners in the past 14 days in an area where monkeypox is spreading, and those whose jobs may expose them to monkeypox, according to the CDC.\n\nIf you think you meet one of these criteria and want to find out about your eligibility, contact your doctor or your local health department.\n\nHow do I keep myself safe?\n\nThe CDC recommends avoiding close contact or shared objects with someone with monkeypox. Frequent hand-washing is also recommended.\n\nFor social gatherings including parties, raves, clubs and festivals, the CDC says to stick to events with more clothing, where skin-to-skin contact may be less frequent.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAvoid sex or close physical intimacy if any person involved has monkeypox. The CDC recommends specifically to avoid touching any rash that may be on a partner’s body. To help prevent the spread of monkeypox while sexually active, maintaining 6 feet of distance, keeping clothes on during sex, and using condoms and/or gloves can lower chances of exposure.\n\n“However, condoms alone may not prevent all exposures to monkeypox, since the rash can occur on other parts of the body,” the CDC says.", "authors": ["Virginia Langmaid"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/30/us/jackson-water-system-failing-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Jackson, Mississippi, water: The water crisis has gotten so bad, the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRecent torrential rain coupled with years of water system issues have resulted in a crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, where the city doesn’t have enough water to fight fires, flush toilets or even hand out to residents in need.\n\nJackson’s main water treatment facility began failing Monday, according to Gov. Tate Reeves. The National Guard was called up to help distribute bottled water as crews work to get the water treatment plant back online, state officials said.\n\nBut the distribution itself proved unsustainable. Residents of all ages were seen waiting in lines more than a mile long at Hawkins Field Airport for at least two hours Tuesday for just one case of bottled water. The event was supposed to span three hours, but barely ran two as people were eventually turned away when the 700 cases of water ran out.\n\n“I keep saying we’re going to be the next Michigan,” said Jeraldine Watts, 86, who was able to get water at a grocery store Monday night. “And it looks like that’s exactly what we’re headed for.”\n\nWatts was referring to the water crisis in the city of Flint, which has battled water issues since a 2014 water crisis in which lead-contaminated water fed to residents’ faucets.\n\nPeople line up for water in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 30, 2022. CNN\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN’s Pamela Brown the city is working on more water distribution events. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide nearly 30 water trucks to help supplement the city events, the mayor said.\n\n“I have been assured by MEMA that they will supplement those locations with about 28 tanker trucks distributed at various points across the city,” Lumumba told CNN.\n\nExplanations for Jackson’s failing system are complicated: Damage this summer to pumps at the main water treatment facility made failure increasingly likely as the summer progressed, the governor said; and flooding of the Pearl River after heavy rains last week affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide, Lumumba said.\n\nThis week’s troubles come as the water system has been plagued with problems for years and with the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.\n\nThe state is “surging our resources to the city’s water treatment facility and beginning emergency maintenance, repairs and improvements,” Gov. Reeves said. “We will do everything in our power to restore water pressure and get water flowing back to the people of Jackson.”\n\nWater for those in the state’s most populous city would have to be provided “for an unknown period of time,” Reeves said.\n\nThe water shortage is expected to last “the next couple of days,” according to the mayor’s office.\n\nLumumba also announced Monday the city’s public works director – a role that oversees the water treatment facilities – has been reassigned. Marlin King will instead serve as deputy director and Jordan Hillman, the city’s planning and development director, will be the interim public works director, according to Melissa Payne, the mayor’s spokesperson.\n\nKing did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Payne said King’s reassignment “is part of restructuring” and is not a result of the current water crisis.\n\nResidents say faucet water is discolored\n\nState Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr. said he didn’t have running water Monday, but on Tuesday, discolored water came out of his faucet that he used to flush the toilet. He and his family used bottled water Tuesday morning to brush their teeth, Crudup told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota.\n\nCrudup said that although the city has experienced water issues in the past, rain played a part in the current water emergency.\n\n“It’s been building up for years, but we have had an unprecedented amount of rain in the last two to three weeks, and it just kind of created this havoc, what we are dealing with right now,” he said.\n\nJackson resident Daryl Page told CNN he’s been searching for clean, bottled water since the city’s been under a boil water notice “for a whole month.” He was driving to a distribution site, but as he arrived, he noticed there was nothing there.\n\nFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, August 18, 2022, as part of the city's response to longstanding water system problems. Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n\n“Everyone is turning around because there is nothing here,” Page said, adding that his next plan of action was to drive to another site in hopes that he could find cases of water there.\n\nBecause of Monday’s failure, officials announced all Jackson public schools will shift to virtual learning Tuesday.\n\nHospitals are also feeling the strain. Jackson’s University of Mississippi Medical Center released a statement Tuesday saying the Jackson Medical Mall air conditioning is not functioning properly “because the water pressure feeding its chillers is too low.” Portable restrooms are being used in locations experiencing low water pressure, the statement said.\n\nThe university medical center statement also said a fire watch was declared for its Jackson-based facilities, “because fire suppression systems are fed by the city water system. Low pressure in the systems may cause them to be less effective.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the water crisis in Jackson and the White House has been “in regular contact with state and local officials, including Mayor Lumumba, and made clear that the Federal Government stands ready to offer assistance,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“(The Federal Emergency Management Agency) is working closely with the state officials to identify needs, and the EPA is coordinating with industry partners to expedite delivery of critical treatment equipment for emergency repairs at the City of Jackson water treatment facilities,” she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency said “ensuring all people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority.”\n\n“We are in communication with officials in Mississippi and stand ready to provide support should the State request federal assistance,” the EPA statement read. “In the interim, we are available to provide technical support and information to Mississippi officials as they navigate their plan to address the immediate concerns at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant.”\n\nLater Tuesday, the governor said FEMA has received the state’s declaration asking the federal government to declare the water shortage a federal emergency.\n\nWater system issues go back decades, mayor says\n\nThe problem this week stems from one of two water treatment facilities in the city: the O.B. Curtis plant, which is run by the city of Jackson, according to the governor.\n\nThe main pumps at O.B. Curtis were severely damaged recently, and the facility began operating on smaller backup pumps about a month ago, around the time the latest boil water notice began in July, the governor said, without elaborating about the damage.\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that “it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve,” the governor said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi, seen on March 24, 2022. Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut Lumumba said during a Monday news conference that it was only a matter time before the water system failed because Jackson’s water system has been faced serious issues for years.\n\n“I have said on multiple occasions that it’s not a matter of ‘if’ our system would fail, but a matter of ‘when’ our system would fail,” the mayor said, adding that the city has been “going at it alone for the better part of two years” when it comes to the water crisis.\n\nIn early 2020, the water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection. The agency wrote the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites, based on observations of the water’s turbidity, or cloudiness, as well as “disinfection treatment concerns, and/or the condition of the distribution system.”\n\nIn March 2020, the EPA issued an order requiring the city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to “address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control” and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things.\n\nThe city also has endured weather-related shutdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm shut down Jackson’s entire water system, leaving tens of thousands of residents without water for a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents have been under some sort of boil water notice or advisory several times since that storm, including the state-ordered notice posted in July.\n\n“We were here two Februarys ago when we had system failures, and the world was watching us and the world is watching us again,” Lumumba said during Monday’s news conference.\n\nThe mayor also pointed to recent flooding from the Pearl River as an event that triggered the latest water pressure issues.\n\nBecause O.B. Curtis received additional water from the reservoir during the flooding from last week to this week, the facility had to change the way it treats the water, which has led to the reduction of water being put out into the system and reduced tank levels. This is affecting the water pressure at residents’ homes, he said.\n\n“As one crisis may be diverted, another one rears its head,” Lumumba said Monday during a news conference after addressing the flooding in the city.\n\nO.B. Curtis is meant to provide about 50 million gallons for the city daily. The other plant, which usually provides about 20 million gallons daily, has been approved to ramp up its output amid the shortage, authorities said.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, mentioning Jackson without naming specific projects.\n\nHowever, Lumumba has said it would take $2 billion to fully repair and replace the dated system, which city, state and federal officials say also has too much lead in its water in some places.\n\nLumumba declared a water system emergency Monday. The proclamation noted not only the flooding but also numerous previous “unsuccessful attempts to rectify water system issues.”\n\nCNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for restoring water pressure and flow and performing emergency maintenance and repairs, the state would split the cost with the city, Reeves said Tuesday.\n\n“We will cash flow the operation, and the city will be responsible for half the cost of the emergency improvements that we make,” the governor said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference at the plant, Reeves said he is “encouraged” and at the same time “discouraged” by some of the news coming out of the facility.\n\n“We do have a plan in place to potentially bring in an additional rented pump that will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons of water additionally, hopefully, which will be installed by tomorrow morning. That is progress and will help,” he said.\n\nReeves added there is no time frame as of now for safe drinking water, but that over the next 24 to 36 hours residents will see significant truckloads of clean water start to be delivered to Jackson.\n\nOver the next few days, more than 108 semi-trucks of water are coming into Jackson and seven mega distribution sites will have 36 truckloads of water a day for the public to be able to retrieve, according to Lt. Col. Stephen McCraney, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency director.\n\nSystemic issues also contributed to water crisis\n\nLumumba previously told CNN a lack of political will and years of neglect on a national level has prevented Jackson from getting the help it needs to fix its water and sewer crisis. Besides the infrastructure issues, the plant has also been faced with staffing issues, according to the mayor and governor.\n\n“A far too small number of heroic frontline workers were trying their hardest to hold the system together, but that it was a near impossibility,” the governor said Monday.\n\nJackson’s ongoing water system problems already had some residents reporting low to no water pressure and raw sewage flowing in city streets and neighborhoods before this month.\n\nNow, some residents are taking to Twitter – where #jxnwatercrisis and #jacksonwatercrisis were trending – to post pictures of buckets and even tubs full of brown water coming out of their drains.\n\nSome on social media also pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of the city’s ongoing water issues and lack of resources, given that 82.5% of Jackson’s population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data, while the state’s legislature is majority White.\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson called out the Mississippi governor on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n”.@tatereeves, what are you waiting for!? We demand on behalf of the Jackson communities that you request federal aid from @FEMA and other agencies to ensure people have access to a basic human right: WATER,” Johnson’s tweet read. “Make the damn call. This is personal.”\n\nJackson has undergone drastic changes in the past half century. Its economic decline has occurred rapidly over the past two decades, fueled by population decline and demographic shifts.\n\nThe city’s population shrank from almost 200,000 in 1990 to about 160,000 in 2020. Its decline in population in these three decades was driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990. By 2020, 82% of the city’s residents were Black.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/24/health/hypermobile-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-health-hnk-spc-dst-intl/index.html", "title": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome affects millions. Why isn't the medical ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne day in July 2021, my then 15-year-old daughter Poppy stumbled and fell while walking down some stairs, grazing her knee. It wasn’t a serious wound, but over the weeks it didn’t heal.\n\nAround the same time, her wrists and knees became sore; her ankles started rolling when she walked; her hands began shaking; her headaches and stomach aches became more frequent and intensely painful. She was always exhausted.\n\nBefore her health declined, Poppy had enjoyed horse riding and gymnastics, she’d competed in cross country races and been a fearless goalkeeper for the school hockey team.\n\nBut within a couple of months, as walking became increasingly difficult, she asked me for a walking stick. We found one that folds up and fits neatly in her school bag.\n\nI took Poppy to doctors who conducted tests, but they couldn’t find out what was wrong with her. Then, in October, a breakthrough.\n\nA podiatrist who was measuring Poppy for insoles to support her aching feet asked if Poppy could bend her thumb to reach her forearm. She could. Could she pull her little finger back to form a 90-degree angle with the back of her hand? She could do that, too.\n\n“Have you heard of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?” the podiatrist asked me. I hadn’t – so as soon as I got home, I went looking on the internet.\n\nThere are 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), according to research and advocacy organization The Ehlers-Danlos Society. Most types are very rare, and can be diagnosed using genetic tests. However, the genes that cause hypermobile EDS (hEDS) – the most common form, accounting for about 90% of cases – are unknown, so diagnosis is based on a checklist of symptoms. The list includes a hypermobility rating, known as the Beighton Score.\n\nPoppy had enough symptoms to qualify for hEDS, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a doctor one year ago, on Christmas Eve. He told us that although we can do our best to alleviate some symptoms, there is no cure.\n\nPoppy reacted to the news better than I did. She had known for some time that something was fundamentally wrong. The diagnosis was upsetting but identifying her illness also gave her a sense of relief. I felt shocked and overwhelmed, and I cried for weeks.\n\nReading about EDS was like a dreadful slow reveal.\n\nI learned that it’s a genetic disorder that causes the body to make faulty connective tissue, and connective tissue is everywhere – in the tendons, ligaments, skin, heart, digestive system, eyes and gums.\n\nWeak connective tissue leads to hypermobility, which may sound like a good thing, but some people with bendy bodies suffer a mind-boggling array of symptoms, including joint dislocations and subluxations (like a mini dislocation, when the joint partially slips out of place), soft stretchy skin, abnormal scarring, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain and fatigue.\n\nThe severity of symptoms varies wildly. Patients with milder cases can lead relatively normal lives, while others become housebound, and some can’t digest food and must be fed through tubes.\n\nWhat’s more, people with hEDS are prone to other conditions, including POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which makes you dizzy when you stand up) and MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome, which gives you allergy-type symptoms).\n\nI learned a lot of new acronyms and they all spelled bad news.\n\nZebras or horses?\n\nI initially thought hEDS was rare, because all forms of EDS are commonly referred to as rare. But within a few weeks, I felt like I was seeing references to hEDS everywhere. Actor, writer and director Lena Dunham; actor and presenter Jameela Jamil; and drag queen Yvie Oddly live with it. I deep dived into EDS Twitter and EDS Instagram, while Poppy found it comforting to watch TikTok videos made by teenagers with the condition.\n\nDrag queen Yvie Oddly, who has hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, crab walks down the pink carpet at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2019. Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images\n\nI discovered multiple patient groups on Facebook, each with tens of thousands of members, which turned out to be great sources of support. I asked questions (what kind of shoes are best for weak ankles? Which knee braces are easiest to pull on and off?) and kind strangers sent helpful advice. At the same time, scrolling through countless personal stories of pain, despair and shattered dreams made me feel terrified about what might lie ahead.\n\nI noticed common themes. Many EDS patients had spent years seeking the correct diagnosis; others felt they’d been neglected and gaslit by doctors.\n\nThere was also a lot of talk of zebras.\n\nLinda Bluestein, a Colorado-based physician who specializes in EDS and other hypermobility conditions, and has hEDS herself, explains why.\n\n“I was told in medical school, ‘when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras,’” she says. Many trainee doctors receive the same advice – when a patient presents with symptoms, “look for the common thing.” That’s why EDS patients commonly refer to themselves as zebras – and also use the fabulous collective noun “dazzle.” The name represents rarity and evokes the stripy stretch marks that are a common feature on EDS skin.\n\nBut if people with hEDS are medical zebras, why am I encountering so many of them?\n\nBluestein says that for many years it was thought that one in 5,000 people had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. But she says the limited research that’s been carried out into the prevalence of hEDS suggests the true number of cases is “much, much higher” than that.\n\nDr. Linda Bluestein has treated hEDS patients who have been searching for a diagnosis for decades. Linda Bluestein\n\nBluestein points me to a 2019 study carried out in Wales – a country of 3.1 million people. An examination of primary care and hospital records from 1990 to 2017 found that one in 500 people there has either hEDS or joint hypermobility syndrome (a similar condition with a slightly different set of symptoms). She says it’s “a good study” but believes it’s still an underestimate. The Ehlers-Danlos Society says more population studies need to be done to give a more accurate view of its incidence elsewhere.\n\nBut despite this possible prevalence, and how debilitating hypermobility disorders can be, the average time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms is 10 to 12 years, according to The Ehlers-Danlos Society.\n\nBluestein has firsthand experience of this. Growing up, she wanted to become a ballet dancer and trained six days a week. When puberty hit, she started experiencing joint pain and migraines, and at 16 had her first orthopedic surgery. She realized she wouldn’t succeed in the ballet world and instead pursued her “back-up plan,” to become a doctor. But despite her career choice, Bluestein only received her hEDS diagnosis when she was 47 – more than 30 years later.\n\n“I told my doctor on numerous occasions, ‘there is something wrong with me, I don’t heal well, I get injured more easily than other people’,” she says. “And he just never, never listened.”\n\nWhy, for so many patients, does it take so long to get diagnosed?\n\n‘The worst possible model’\n\nIn 2014 a leading EDS expert, Professor Rodney Grahame, remarked at a conference that “no other disease in the history of modern medicine has been neglected in such a way as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.”\n\nFar more women than men are diagnosed with EDS, which could help to explain the neglect, because the medical profession has a long history of overlooking health complaints made by women.\n\nA 2009 study, conducted by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases, surveyed 414 families of EDS patients from five countries and found that the average delay to an EDS diagnosis was four years for men – but 16 years for women.\n\nThe report states that women with EDS tend to be “diagnosed later because their pain and hypotonia (poor muscle tone) aren’t considered as physical symptoms but rather as psychological symptoms or common complaints.”\n\n“We tend to get dismissed a lot more easily,” says Bluestein. “People jump to the conclusion that we’re histrionic females.”\n\nAnxiety is very common in patients with hypermobility issues, says Bluestein, which can cloud the picture. “When people with anxiety present to a physician, it can suck all the air out of the room, so that the physician almost can’t see anything else.”\n\nThis can ramp up the patient’s anxiety further “because people aren’t validating our symptoms, and then we start to doubt ourselves,” she says.\n\nWhat’s more, medicine is divided into silos which creates the “worst possible model” for EDS patients, says Bluestein.\n\n'We're born with this and will never be free:' Hear stories from people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 05:02 - Source: CNN\n\nShe explains that undiagnosed patients might consult a neurologist for their migraines, a rheumatologist for joint pain, a cardiologist for palpitations, a gastroenterologist for digestive issues and a urologist for bladder symptoms. Each doctor focuses on the symptoms that fall within their specialty but doesn’t consider the other ailments. “Nowhere along the way does somebody realize that there are certain conditions that could tie all of these things together and explain everything,” says Bluestein.\n\nThe 2009 rare diseases study found that during the quest for a diagnosis, 58% of EDS patients consulted more than five doctors, and 20% consulted more than 20.\n\nThe consequences of not getting diagnosed for years can be devastating.\n\nMelissa Dickinson, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, Georgia, says she experienced symptoms of a “mystery illness” since childhood. Then in 2013, she “went on honeymoon to Mexico, relatively healthy, and came back disabled and with a dislocated neck.”\n\nWhile on vacation, Dickinson says she got food poisoning and was prescribed ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that can pose a serious risk of aortic aneurysm to people with EDS. Instead, she says it triggered significant nerve damage, digestive issues that almost made her go blind because her body wasn’t absorbing nutrients, and put her in a wheelchair.\n\nDickinson, who finally received her hEDS diagnosis in 2014, says taking the wrong medication “wrecked me from head to toe.” Now that she’s receiving treatment, “I can walk with mobility aids, but most of my body has to have constant support to function.”\n\nLara Bloom, president and CEO of The Ehlers-Danlos Society, who herself has hEDS, says many patients have “medicalized PTSD.”\n\n“They have had to stop their careers, they’ve had to drop out of school, their relationships have broken down.” The delay inevitably results in worsening symptoms and a declining quality of life, she says. In worst-case scenarios, patients “are dying by suicide, they’re self-harming.”\n\nSometimes, the failure to diagnose EDS has led to children being taken away from their parents.\n\nIn 2010, Americans Rana Tyson and her husband Chad were falsely accused of harming their 4-week-old twin daughters, who had unexplained fractures in their legs.\n\nAlong with their older sister, the baby girls were taken by state authorities in Texas and sent to live with relatives. “It was the worst day of my life,” Tyson tells me in a phone call.\n\nFive months later, a geneticist identified the twins as having a connective tissue disorder, and they were subsequently diagnosed with EDS and a vitamin D deficiency. The family was reunited but “12 years later, it still hurts,” says Tyson.\n\nBloom says some other parents of children with EDS have been wrongly accused of “fabricated or induced illness (FII)” – a rare form of abuse, formerly known as Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy, in which a parent or care giver deliberately causes symptoms or tries to convince doctors that a healthy child is ill.\n\nEllie Pattison, who has hEDS, has been repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder. Ellie Pattison\n\nEllie Pattison, a 19-year-old student who lives in County Durham, England, suffers from severe digestive issues linked to hEDS.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Ellie was repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder, she says, while her mother Caroline was accused of FII on three separate occasions. Caroline successfully fought to keep her daughter at home, says Ellie, but the ordeal has left the whole family with “an unimaginable amount of trauma.” Ellie says she suffered from PTSD and endured years of horrific nightmares, triggered by living with the fear from a young age that she could be forcibly separated from her family.\n\nThis underlines why prompt diagnosis is so important, says Bloom. “Our hope and dream is for people to get diagnosed when their symptoms begin.”\n\nThe search for answers\n\nIn the case of hEDS, a crucial first step is to find out what causes it.\n\nCortney Gensemer, a biomedical scientist in the Norris Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina’s department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology, is trying to solve this mystery. She and research mentor Russell Norris, head of the lab, have been studying a gene mutation they believe causes hEDS (the results of the study are currently under peer review).\n\nLike Poppy, Gensemer was diagnosed with hEDS as a teenager. She says the disease affects every aspect of her work. Looking down a microscope is particularly painful at times – her neck is unstable because of her hEDS, and she’s had metal screws put into some of her neck vertebrae to fuse them.\n\nCortney Gensemer working in the Norris Lab and recovering from neck surgery earlier this year. Cortney Gensemer\n\nNorris kitted the lab out with special equipment, including motion sensor doors (standard lab doors are very heavy), adjustable chairs and ergonomic pipettes that are gentle on the hands. “If I didn’t have all that stuff, I don’t think I’d be able to do it,” says Gensemer.\n\nTo find a hEDS-causing gene, Gensemer says she and Norris sampled DNA from a large family with cases spanning four generations and looked for a mutation that appears only in relatives who have the disease. They identified a “strong candidate gene” and inserted it into mice using gene editing tools.\n\nGensemer and Norris found that the hEDS mice had significantly more lax tissues, and floppier tails than regular rodents. “You can tie a loose knot into the mutant mouse tail. With a normal mouse tail, you can (only) bend it into a circle,” Gensemer says.\n\nThe gene that Gensemer and Norris found won’t account for all hEDS cases, she says. They believe that eventually multiple genes will be identified, and hEDS may be split into different subtypes. This would help to explain why different patients have different symptoms. Crucially, if genetic information sheds light on how the connective tissue is “messed up,” it could lead to effective treatments, says Gensemer.\n\nThe Ehlers-Danlos Society is also looking for genes as well as blood markers, working with a team of experts to sequence and analyze the DNA of 1,000 hEDS patients from around the world. And at the UK’s University of Warwick, Ph.D. candidate Sabeeha Malek, another scientist with hEDS, has proposed that EDS might be caused by a fault in the way that collagen binds to cell membranes in connective tissue. If she’s right, she hopes her work will lead to a skin biopsy test that could identify all forms of the disease.\n\nSabeeha Malek is working to identify biomarkers that could make EDS diagnosis easier. Sabeeha Malek\n\nProgress is being made but on a very small scale. “If you look at any major academic institution, there are multiple labs studying cancer, multiple labs studying heart disease. When you look at a disease that affects one in 500 people, and probably more than that, there should be a lab studying it at every single academic institution,” says Gensemer.\n\nGensemer hopes that as more discoveries are made and data is accumulated it will “change the way the medical community looks at the disease” – and that it will be taken more seriously.\n\nA giant kitten for my zebra\n\nA year has passed since Poppy’s diagnosis. The initial shock has subsided, and while I’m still grieving the loss of her health, we’ve both learned to accept our new reality and have adjusted to living with EDS.\n\nI’ve assembled a team of supportive doctors and therapists and acquired an arsenal of paraphernalia to fight pain and manage symptoms, including braces and kinesiology tape to hold her joints in place; ice packs, heat pads, tiger balm and arnica gel for sore muscles; and a cupboard full of medications and supplements.\n\nWith Poppy often stuck at home, I also got her a giant kitten that she calls Bagel, and he provides the best therapy.\n\nPoppy with Bagel. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nWriting this article has taught me a lot more about EDS: It’s been upsetting to report on the terrible experiences some have suffered, but I’ve been awestruck by the dedication of people, many with the condition themselves, who are working to find solutions.\n\nI don’t know what the future holds for Poppy. Some patients’ symptoms improve with age; others experience an increase in pain and a loss of mobility. I’ve learned there’s a limit to what we can control but there’s a lot we can do, to tackle symptoms and make life easier. And I believe that change is coming.\n\nWith a better understanding of the condition and diagnostic tools on the horizon, my biggest hope is that there will be a cure one day – and that it will come in time for Poppy.", "authors": ["Sarah Lazarus"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/health/pandemic-year-three-predictions/index.html", "title": "Here's what could lie ahead for the US in the third year of the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThings seem to be looking up as the US crosses into year three of the Covid-19 pandemic. Vaccines still do a good job of keeping people alive and out of the hospital. There’s increasing access to tests and treatments. The numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths are heading in the right direction.\n\nIf living in a Covid world has taught us anything, however, it’s that the coronavirus can surprise even the smartest public health experts, and the world certainly isn’t out of the woods yet.\n\nA new variant could easily develop and slip past the protection of current treatments and vaccines, setting us back to what life was like in 2020. That makes it hard to predict what happens next week, let alone in a few months.\n\nHowever, based on what they’re seeing now, here’s what the experts think could happen in the next year of the pandemic. Each of these predictions has an unspoken “variant depending” at the end.\n\nWhat will spring and summer be like?\n\nThe numbers in the US look good. Only 2% of the US population – that’s about 7 million people – lives in a county with a “high” Covid-19 community level, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rest are at “low” or “medium” community levels, areas where there’s no recommendation to wear a mask or where the immunocompromised should take extra precautions.\n\nIn fact, over the next four weeks, the CDC forecasts decreases in hospitalizations and deaths. The trend could continue, particularly as the weather improves and people head outside, where it’s less likely that they’ll catch Covid.\n\nThese positive trends could mean the US will see a normal or at least near-normal spring and summer (variant depending, of course).\n\n“I am very optimistic,” said Dr. William Lang, WorldClinic medical director and former White House deputy physician. “I’m optimistic for what things look like for everybody being able to get back to normal activities over the summer.”\n\nBut normal doesn’t mean a return to pre-2020 life. “Fewer” cases still mean tens of thousands of Americans are getting infected. And as of Friday, even with deaths at the lowest level in three months, there are an average of about 1,200 Americans dying from Covid-19 each day, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\n“Everyone has to recognize, relatively speaking, we’re still very early in this, right? This is not going away,” said Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford University.\n\nIf the pandemic moves into more of an endemic phase, meaning enough people have immune protection through natural infection and vaccination, it doesn’t mean you can burn your masks. Rather, it means the spread of Covid will slow and result in fewer deaths and hospitalizations. But this state of endemicity is not guaranteed.\n\nOne metric to watch is a rising trend in cases and hospitalizations in the UK. Karan thinks that is mainly happening because of waning immunity, and the US could see similar trends.\n\n“With the combination of our immunity waning and the virus mutating, future surges are unpredictable,” Karan said.\n\nWhat about autumn and winter?\n\nWith the unpredictability of the coronavirus, it’s hard to know what will happen in the fall and winter, said David Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University Medical Center.\n\nREAD: You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19\n\n“This virus has thrown us some real curveballs,” Montefiori said. Some experts say the coronavirus could eventually become seasonal like flu, but he doesn’t think it’s there yet.\n\n“Thinking of this as a seasonal virus like flu, that hasn’t been the case so far. The variants seem to be periodic,” Montefiori said. “Roughly every four to six months, we have a new variant.”\n\nHe is optimistic, though, because Americans have so much immunity built up through vaccination, infection or a combination of the two.\n\n“We might have another surge later this year, even early summer, but if there isn’t one, that’s saying the immunity we’ve built up as a population is doing a good job.”\n\nThe concern, of course, is that a variant emerges that escapes the vaccines. “The good news is that vaccines can be quickly modified,” Montefiori said.\n\nWith more access to tests and treatments now, many experts believe that the US is better prepared for a fall or winter surge than it was last year. Some say Covid-19 cases could climb for a while when colder weather sends people back inside and as they become more complacent about taking precautions.\n\n“Ultimately, the virus is going to have a tough time in our population, but it’s going to take a long time,” said Dr. John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. “I think the real long view is, endemicity is going to be the case. Eradication is not possible.”\n\nMuch depends on how quickly the planet can get vaccinated, Swartzberg said. The more people are vaccinated, the fewer there are to serve as hosts where the virus can mutate and produce – you guessed it – variants.\n\nLess than 10% of people in low-income countries are vaccinated, according to the International Rescue Committee. The US and other countries have pledged to send more vaccines overseas this year.\n\nWhat’s next for vaccines for adults?\n\nYou may be need a fourth shot of the Covid-19 vaccine this year. The CDC already recommends that those who have weakened immune systems get one. Public health officials in the US have said they are very carefully monitoring if, or when, a fourth dose may be needed for the broader population, with a potential fall timeline in mind.\n\nThe vaccines still seem to protect against hospitalization and death, particularly if you are boosted, but protection could wane over time and is a little less effective against the Omicron variant. The currently authorized boosters are made to protect against the original coronavirus from late 2019.\n\nThe next vaccines could be specifically tuned to the variant – or variants – that are in circulation, Moderna Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Burton said Wednesday. Or they could be a combination shot.\n\nModerna and Pfizer have confirmed that they are testing vaccines that focus on Omicron.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla said his company will soon submit data on another vaccine dose for federal health officials to consider.\n\n“I think our data suggests that they’re protecting, they are improving dramatically the protection, the fourth dose compared to the third, for Omicron after some time, after let’s say three to six months,” Bourla said in a Washington Post Live discussion on Thursday.\n\nGlobally, there are 234 other Covid-19 vaccines in development. Perhaps furthest along in the process is the one from Novavax. It is in the middle of the regulatory process with the FDA and could be authorized this year.\n\nWhat’s next for vaccines for kids?\n\nPfizer and Moderna are expected to report results from their trials involving children under the age of 5 in the next few weeks.\n\nPfizer is also working on trials of a third vaccine dose for children ages 5 to 11. Children 12 and older can already get a third shot, as can kids 5 and older who are immunocompromised.\n\nFor the littlest kids, scientists think a vaccine may not be authorized until April. Pfizer originally said it thought it could have one out earlier this year, but it added a third dose of the vaccine to its trials to see if it is more effective.\n\nThe vaccines can’t come soon enough for some parents. During the Omicron surge, the largest increase in hospitalization rates was among kids ages 4 and under, according to the CDC.\n\nBut many more kids for whom vaccines are now authorized still need to get them. They are the age group with the lowest vaccination rate in the US.\n\n“There still hasn’t been nearly as much uptake as vaccines as we would want,” said Dr. Shira Gertz, a pediatric critical care physician and researcher at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey. “Getting a vaccine is so much better than getting the disease.”\n\nThe politics of it might be tricky, but schools could require that kids get vaccinated against Covid-19 before they return to class in the fall, like they do with other diseases. Only a handful of schools currently do, like those in Los Angeles, the District of Columbia and New Orleans, according to the Center on Reinventing Public Education.\n\nWhat’s next for treatments and tests?\n\nThere are 23 antivirals and 63 other treatments in late-stage clinical trials, according to Bio, a pharmacy industry association.\n\nAlthough Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine is authorized for people as young as 5, treatments for children remain limited. It’s begun a Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial of its Covid-19 antiviral treatment, Paxlovid, in children ages 6 to 17.\n\nFor treatments to work effectively, people have to get them quickly. The Biden administration’s new test-to-treat program allows pharmacies with clinics to test someone for Covid-19 and immediately prescribe medication if they test positive. That program will play an even more vital role if cases surge again.\n\nWhat’s next for masks?\n\nHawaii is the last state in the country to end its indoor mask mandate. That ends March 25.\n\nOn Thursday, the federal requirement that people wear masks on public transportation, including planes, was extended for another 30 days.\n\nPeople may be sick of them, and masks have become a hot political subject, but broader mask mandates could always come back if case numbers rise and hospitals fill up.\n\nMasking is hugely effective. Research from January 2021 that analyzed several studies of mask use in adults found that masks reduced the transmission of the virus significantly. And a National Institutes of Health study published Thursday found that during the Delta surge, schools with mandatory masking had 72% fewer cases of in-school transmission than those with mask-optional policies.\n\n“I think readers need to remember that even if we say ‘this is what we’re doing now,’ we reserve the right to change stuff as needed,” said Dr. Sharon Nachman, chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Stony Brook University in New York. Americans need to be flexible and adjust to the threat around them, she said.\n\nWhat about money for all these mitigation measures?\n\nMoney to pay for the tests and treatments and vaccine research won’t last forever, and more funding is not in the latest federal spending bill. The $15.6 billion earmarked for pandemic preparedness got stripped out. That was only half of what the Biden administration had asked for.\n\nThe spending bill raises the CDC budget by $582 million, but it leaves out the pandemic waivers that gave schools extra federal funds to cope with Covid-19 outbreaks.\n\nThe money that has bolstered many rural “safety net” hospitals expires soon. Safety net hospitals are those that, by legal obligation or mission, provide health care regardless of someone’s ability to pay or insurance status. So more rural hospitals could close this year, and the US has already lost a record number of them during the pandemic.\n\nIt’s a tenuous time. Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said supplies of therapeutics, testing and vaccines are finally at a level where they meet demand.\n\n“If there’s issues with funding and any of those areas of progress start to fall off, we’re going to be right back to the situation where we’re playing catch-up and don’t have enough,” he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, introduced a standalone Covid supplemental bill to manage the pandemic at home and around the world, but it’s unlikely to pass.\n\nWhat about the long-term consequences of Covid?\n\nScientists continue to study people with long Covid to try to understand the condition’s symptoms and treatments. As many as 30% who’ve tested positive for the virus may have long-term symptoms like fatigue, breathing trouble, joint and chest pain, and heart problems, studies show.\n\nMental health has been an ongoing challenge for adults and kids during the pandemic. Four in 10 adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depression during the pandemic, up from 1 in 10 before the pandemic. In communities of color, mental health issues are disproportionately undertreated. For kids, the Biden administration’s national mental health strategy, announced this month, will try to address some provider and program shortages to address their needs.\n\nMore than 206,800 children in the US have lost their primary caregiver to Covid, and advocates are also pushing for programs to address their needs.\n\nWill this ever be over?\n\nPeople need to be flexible and not let down their guard too soon, the experts say.\n\n“When places relax measures at the wrong moment, transmission spikes dangerously, and we lose more lives,” Pan American Health Organization Director Dr. Carissa F. Etienne said Wednesday, urging countries to base decisions on risk assessments and health data and to tighten public health guidance if cases start to rise.\n\nThe bottom line, Lang said: Covid is here to stay, but the pandemic part could be in our rearview mirror – or at least move into a more manageable stage – if people get vaccinated and boosted.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“The Covid vaccine is much more effective in preventing deaths than the flu vaccine in preventing deaths,” he said. “So, you know, we really can combat this thing by people getting vaccinated and boosted.”\n\nGertz also recommends that people pay attention to the numbers around them.\n\n“We have to continue to be diligent and aware of what’s going on in our immediate surroundings,” she said. That doesn’t mean people will be in masks forever, but they should wear them when necessary, and take prevention measures like washing their hands. “Actually, we should always wash our hands.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/16/health/anxiety-early-signs-in-kids-wellness/index.html", "title": "Anxiety: Early signs in children | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nYour child doesn’t want to go to the playground to play with other kids. Or she doesn’t want to attend a friend’s birthday party or the class pool party.\n\nHow do you know whether she’s just having a bad day or if it’s a sign of ongoing anxiety she might be experiencing?\n\nAnxiety disorders are marked by persistent and excessive worries. While someone with generalized anxiety might worry about various everyday things, someone with social anxiety typically has “intense or persisting fears or worries about being judged negatively by other people,” said Rachel Busman, a White Plains, New York-based clinical psychologist and cognitive and behavioral consultant who specializes in anxiety. “You’re worried about saying or doing something that’s going to make you look dumb or incompetent.”\n\nOne-fifth of children worldwide have anxiety symptoms that are “clinically elevated,” or worse than what’s considered normal, according to a 2021 study. In the United States, 9.4% of children ages 3 to 17 – about 5.8 million – had diagnosed anxiety between 2016 and 2019, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAnxiety symptoms can be difficult to spot, but the sooner parents notice signs, the earlier mental health professionals “can help parents and kids understand what’s happening,” said Dr. Rebecca Baum, a professor of general pediatrics and adolescent medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nChildren with anxiety might begin to avoid anxiety-inducing situations. This behavior can facilitate a cycle that makes their fears bigger and bigger, Baum added.\n\nBut “the earlier we have tools, the earlier we can set kids on a path that encourages them to be resilient and helps them face the things they’re fearful of,” Busman said.\n\nRead on to learn about early physical, behavioral and emotional signs of general or social anxiety, and how to help your child.\n\nGeneral anxiety\n\nCommon signs of general anxiety in children – according to the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, Michigan State University, Baum and Busman – include:\n\nDifficulty concentrating\n\nTrouble sleeping, bed-wetting or bad dreams\n\nNot eating properly\n\nClinginess\n\nLack of confidence to try new things or inability to deal with simple, everyday problems\n\nAvoidance of everyday activities, such as seeing friends or going out in public or to school\n\nInability to talk in some social situations\n\nReassurance seeking (repeated questions to reconfirm worries, such as exactly when and where you’re going to pick them up from school, or if the weather’s really going to be nice enough for a playdate)\n\nPhysical symptoms such as using the toilet often; tearfulness; headaches; dizziness; lightheadedness; sweatiness; stomachaches; nausea; cramps; vomiting; fidgeting; or body aches (especially if they usually occur before an educational or social obligation)\n\nTantrums, irritability or defiance could be misunderstood as disrespectful behavioral problems, but anxiety could be the underlying cause, Busman said. Refusal to do homework could be because they are anxious about making mistakes.\n\nChildren “don’t necessarily have the tools to say, ‘This is really causing me distress,’” Busman said. “So, they act out.”\n\nSocial anxiety\n\nMany symptoms of social anxiety are like those of general anxiety but come up in social settings, Busman said.\n\nChildren struggling with social anxiety might show these signs, according to Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, the National Social Anxiety Center and the Mayo Clinic:\n\nAvoiding or refusing to go to school\n\nRefusing to speak in social settings or speaking in a soft or low tone\n\nPoor social skills, such as fearing strangers or not making eye contact\n\nFearing or having difficulty with using public restrooms, speaking on the phone, giving public performances, eating in front of others, being called on in class, or being separated from parents\n\nPhysical symptoms including fast heartbeat, trembling, trouble catching their breath, feeling their mind has gone blank and muscle tension\n\nHaving conversations that count\n\nGetting to the bottom of what’s anxiety-inducing for your kid is important, but it must be done compassionately – without grilling, which could make her feel defensive or put on the spot, and lead to her not wanting to talk with you at all.\n\nCurious and nonleading questions are good, Busman recommended. Open prompts such as “I noticed you seemed hesitant going into that activity. What’s up?” might work better than “Were you scared of going in, or did you not like those people?”\n\nAsk your child how a certain event went, what she liked about it and what was hard.\n\nVery young children might be unable to identify specific fears, such as saying something stupid or other kids seeing their anxiety, according to Anxiety Canada – so some kids might verbalize those concerns in ways that make sense to them, such as “I didn’t want people to look at my drawing” or “My voice really sounds funny,” Busman said.\n\nIf your child’s honest about what’s making them anxious, avoid invalidating the experience by saying “That’s nothing to be scared about” or “Don’t be a baby.” Also avoid affirming fears. Saying “That does sound so scary; I’m so sorry you had to do that” can make the child feel more fragile, Busman said.\n\nA good balance is saying, “That does sound hard” and then a statement that acknowledges your child’s capability to face the challenge and that you know you two can figure it out together, Busman added.\n\nIf your child’s anxious about starting soccer practice and not kicking the ball, use some form of the above statement and reassure her that she’ll improve with practice, but don’t overdo it by saying she’ll kick the winning goal – which might not happen.\n\n“We sometimes get nervous about somehow having our children experience less than perfect moments,” Busman said, but teaching that imperfection is OK is crucial. Your child might miss the ball sometimes, and being liked by everyone isn’t realistic.\n\n“Navigating stress is an important part of childhood,” Baum said. Parents and caregivers can model this by “talking about times when they’ve been anxious about something but tried to tackle it, even if it didn’t turn out exactly how they had hoped.”\n\nIf you’re worried that talking to your child’s teachers could cause stigma or a problem where there might not be one, know that consulting them is worthwhile since they observe your child for many hours in different environments daily and therefore “are often really good sources of information,” Busman said. “Sometimes how kids are at home isn’t how they are at school and vice versa.”\n\nA teacher can tell you how your child is interacting with peers and whether she’s still sad or anxious after you drop her off at school.\n\nWhen worries persist and “interfere with a child’s ability to do the things they need to do to be kids,” Busman said, “that’s a good time to seek some more support.”\n\nThe best treatment for anxiety disorders is cognitive behavioral therapy that involves some level of exposure therapy, which can help kids get comfortable doing the things they are scared of, Busman said.\n\nYour child’s primary care provider can help “distinguish between what’s typical for the child’s age/developmental level and what might be cause for concern,” Baum said. “Even if symptoms are typical for the child’s age, families still may appreciate help managing them successfully.”\n\nBaum added, “Getting right up to and even just past the child’s comfort zone (is) the spot where growth happens.”", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/05/16"}]}

She was 93.\n\n“Barbara Walters passed away peacefully in her home surrounded by loved ones. She lived her life with no regrets. She was a trailblazer not only for female journalists but for all women,” Walters’ spokesperson Cindi Berger told CNN in a statement.\n\nWalters began her national broadcast career in 1961 as a reporter, writer and panel member for NBC’s “Today” show before being promoted to co-host in 1974. In 1976, Walters joined ABC News as the first female anchor on an evening news program.\n\nAt that network, Walters launched “The Barbara Walters Specials” and “10 Most Fascinating People” before becoming a co-host and correspondent for ABC News’ “20/20” in 1984. Along the way, she interviewed every US president and first lady since Richard and Pat Nixon.\n\nFor more than five decades, Walters was a name to reckon with, whether speaking with world leaders on news programs, in celebrities’ homes for her regular “Barbara Walters Specials” or on “The View,” a daytime talk show in which a diverse panel of women discuss the latest headlines.\n\nBarbara Walters sits on the set of NBC's \"Today\" show in New York on April 23, 1976. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nHer shows, some of which she produced, were some of the highest-rated of their type and spawned a number of imitators. Indeed, “The View” – which debuted in 1997 – paved the way for American talk shows “The Talk” and “The Chew,” as well as such entries as Britain’s “Loose Women” and Norway’s “Studio5.”\n\nWalters left “The View” in 2014, but remained a part-time contributor to ABC News for two years.\n\n“I knew it was time,” Walters told CNN’s Chris Cuomo at the time. “I like all the celebration, that’s great, but in my heart, I thought, ‘I want to walk away while I’m still doing good work.’ So I will.”\n\nLooking upon the numerous women who had looked up to her throughout her career, Walters said they were her legacy.\n\n“How do you say goodbye to something like 50 years in television?” she said in conclusion. “How proud when I see all the young women who are making and reporting the news. If I did anything to help make that happen, that is my legacy. From the bottom of my heart, to all of you with whom I have worked and who have watched and been by my side, I can say: ‘Thank you.’ “\n\nWalters was married four times, to business executive Robert Katz, producer Lee Guber and twice to entertainment mogul Merv Adelson. The second marriage to Adelson ended in 1992. She is survived by her daughter, Jackie, whom she and Guber adopted in 1968.\n\nWalters’ big ‘get’ interviews\n\nWalters was born September 25, 1929, in Boston. Her father, Lou, was a nightclub owner and theatrical impresario, and young Barbara grew up around celebrities – one reason she never appeared fazed by interviewing them.\n\nWalters earned her college degree from Sarah Lawrence College in 1953.\n\nBarbara Walters is seen at a news conference on September 30, 1976, in New York. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nNotoriously competitive, Walters was dogged in her pursuit of big “get” interviews, so much so that there were long-standing reports of rivalry between her and another of ABC’s news stars, such as Diane Sawyer, who joined the network in 1989. That included, most recently, jockeying to land the first interview with Caitlyn Jenner, which Sawyer conducted in 2015.\n\nWalters, though, was no slacker in terms of landing major interviews, including presidents, world leaders and almost every imaginable celebrity, with a well-earned reputation for bringing her subjects to tears. Highlights included her 1999 interview with Monica Lewinsky – which was watched by an average of 48.5 million viewers – and a historic 1977 joint sit-down with Egypt’s Anwar Sadat and Israel’s Menachem Begin.\n\nWalter’s first job on air was on NBC’s “Today” show in the 1960s, where she reported what were then perceived as “women’s stories.” In 1974, she was officially named co-anchor of the show. Two years later she became, for a time, the best-known person in television when she left “Today” to join ABC as the first woman to co-anchor a network evening newscast, signing for a then-startling $1 million a year.\n\nThough her term in that position was short-lived – co-anchor Harry Reasoner never warmed to her – she had the last laugh, staying at the network for almost four decades and co-hosting the magazine show “20/20” (with her old “Today” colleague, Hugh Downs), “The View” and countless specials.\n\nShe was both mercilessly parodied – on the early “Saturday Night Live,” Gilda Radner mocked her as the sometimes mush-mouthed “BabaWawa” – and richly honored, with multiple Emmys, a Peabody and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nSometimes seen as brash, usually by men questioning her forthright demeanor, she could only shrug at the criticism.\n\n“If it’s a woman, it’s caustic; if it’s a man, it’s authoritative. If it’s a woman it’s too pushy, if it’s a man it’s aggressive in the best sense of the word,” she once observed.", "authors": ["Todd Leopold Emma Tucker Jamiel Lynch", "Todd Leopold", "Emma Tucker", "Jamiel Lynch"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/09/entertainment/gallery/people-we-lost-2022/index.html", "title": "Photos: People we've lost in 2022 | CNN", "text": "1.

He was around 85.\n\nOne of the most celebrated, if controversial, fashion icons of the 20th and 21st centuries, Lagerfeld passed away early Tuesday, according to AP.\n\nSuch was the enigma surrounding the designer that even his age was a point of mystery for decades, with reports he had two birth certificates, one dated 1933 and the other 1938.\n\n“Thanks to his creative genius, generosity and exceptional intuition, Karl Lagerfeld was ahead of his time, which widely contributed to the House of Chanel's success throughout the world,\" CEO Alan Wertheimer said in a release posted to the brand's website. \"Today, not only have I lost a friend, but we have all lost an extraordinary creative mind to whom I gave carte blanche in the early 1980s to reinvent the brand.”\n\nBruno Pavlovsky, Chanel's president for fashion, added, \"The greatest tribute we can pay today is to continue to follow the path he traced by – to quote Karl – ‘continuing to embrace the present and invent the future.’ ”\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2019\n\nThe Chanel release also confirmed that Lagerfeld would be succeeded as creative director by Virginie Viard, his longtime studio director and collaborator.\n\nFendi's chairman and CEO Serge Brunschwig lauded Lagerfeld's \"immense culture, his ability to rejuvenate at all times, to taste all the arts, to not overlook any style\" in a press release issued to USA TODAY Tuesday.\n\n\"He leaves us an enormous heritage, an inexhaustible source of inspiration to continue. Karl will be immensely missed by myself and all the Fendi people,” Brunschwig said.\n\nOn Jan. 22 Lagerfeld, who had looked increasingly frail in recent seasons, worried fans when he did not come out to take a bow at Chanel's couture show in Paris, which the company attributed to fatigue. It was the first time in recent memory that Lagerfeld, who had designed for the house since 1983, did not come out to receive applause at the end of one of his shows.\n\nViard, appeared in his place, emerging from the door of a lavish Italian \"villa\" that was the set painstakingly created by the house to showcase its spring-summer designs.\n\nNever shy about his own genius, Lagerfeld considered himself world renowned for his \"cutting-edge, aspirational and relevant approach to style,\" with a fashion sensibility \"rooted in a DNA that’s accessible-luxe and cool,\" and a \"signature aesthetic combining timeless classics with a modern, rock-chic edge,\" according to his website.\n\n\"His visionary creativity expands beyond fashion to include illustration, photography, styling and publishing.\"\n\n\"Edgy\" might be a better one-word summary of Lagerfeld – the man, his fashion and his art. He designed clothes that made people gasp with delight; he said things that made people gasp with shock.\n\nAt one point in 2013, he said he wanted to marry his closest companion – his cat, a white Siamese named Choupette, who has nearly 50,000 Twitter followers and an Instagram account where she frequently snarks about this and that.\n\nKarl Lagerfeld's death: Celebrities mourn the fashion icon\n\nBut that was only one of the headlines chronicling outre conduct over the years: He once used strippers and a porn star as models, thus annoying Anna Wintour who walked out of one of his shows in 1993.\n\nAn unapologetic supporter of fur in fashion (even though he doesn't wear it himself), he invited the wrath of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, which tried to throw a pie at him at a New York event in 2001. They missed and hit Calvin Klein.\n\n\"A fashion dinosaur who is as out of step as his furs are out of style,\" sneered PETA of Lagerfeld.\n\nThen there were the uproars after he called supermodel Heidi Klum \"insignificant\" in the fashion world because she was \"too glamorous\" in 2009; criticized singer Adele as \"a little too fat\" in 2012; and later that year dissed Pippa Middleton's face, suggesting she only show her backside.\n\nFrom the 1950s, Lagerfeld exchanged frequent public barbs with rival French designer Yves Saint Laurent until the latter died in 2008. He even got into a fracas with Oscar queen Meryl Streep when he claimed in 2017 that she dropped out of wearing a Chanel dress to that year’s Oscars in favor of a brand that would pay her.\n\n\"He lied,\" Streep snapped indignantly.\n\nIn 2013, Lagerfeld told French magazine \"Paris Match\" he was born in 1935, but as of 2019, even his own assistant still didn't know the truth. They told the Associated Press he liked \"to scramble the tracks on his year of birth – that's part of the character.\"\n\nBorn in Hamburg to a father whose company made evaporated milk and the daughter of a local politician, Lagerfeld migrated to Paris, where he finished his education at Lycée Montaigne.\n\nHe started his career in 1954 when he won first prize in a contest to design a wool coat, a design subsequently produced by designer Pierre Balmain who offered Lagerfeld, then 17, a job as his assistant. By 1957, he was an art director for designer Jean Patou.\n\nLagerfeld also started his own label, Karl Lagerfeld, which though less commercially successful than his other ventures, was widely seen as a sort of a sketchpad where the designer worked through his audacious ideas.\n\nIn 1982, he took over at over Chanel, which had been dormant since the death of its founder, Coco Chanel, more than a decade earlier.\n\n\"When I took on Chanel, it was a sleeping beauty – not even a beautiful one,\" he said in the 2007 documentary 'Lagerfeld Confidential.' ''She snored.\"\n\nLagerfeld was open about his homosexuality – he once said he announced it to his parents at age 13 – but kept his private life under wraps. Following his widely known relationship with a French aristocrat who died of AIDS in 1989, Lagerfeld insisted he prized his solitude above all.\n\n\"I hate when people say I'm 'solitaire' (or solitary.) Yes, I'm solitaire in the sense of a stone from Cartier, a big solitaire,\" Lagerfeld told The New York Times in an interview. \"I have to be alone to do what I do. I like to be alone. I'm happy to be with people, but I'm sorry to say I like to be alone, because there's so much to do, to read, to think.\"\n\nAs much as he loved the spotlight, Lagerfeld was careful to obscure his real self.\n\n\"It's not that I lie, it's that I don't owe the truth to anyone,\" he told French Vogue in an interview.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nClassic Karl Lagerfeld: Designer's cat has two maids and does 'eye beauty treatments'\n\nQuotable Karl Lagerfeld: Designer calls models 'stupid,' 'sordid creatures", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/01/22/kaye-ballard-dies-at-93-rancho-mirage/2620474002/", "title": "Kaye Ballard dies in Rancho Mirage at 93 after lifetime of achievement", "text": "Kaye Ballard had a contented smile on her face as she watched herself, larger than life, at the Palm Springs International Film Festival screening of her documentary, “Kaye Ballard: The Show Goes On,” this month at the Palm Springs Cultural Center.\n\nShe had been greeted in the lobby by mobs of fans, taking pictures and congregating around her wheelchair like close personal friends. It made her caregiver nervous, and she advised Ballard to leave the theater early more than once. Her heart was weak.

When she was gone, a reporter sitting across the aisle sensed she was really gone.\n\nLatest:Kaye Ballard remembered at memorial as big talent with humongous heart\n\nMore:Broadway icon Carol Channing remembered in the Coachella Valley as 'unsurpassable'\n\nMore:'Monkees' TV director and Indian Wells resident James Frawley dies in desert he loved\n\nBut there was one more celebration. A film festival official called her Saturday night, Jan. 12, and said her documentary had been named one of the Best of the Fest. Ballard was thrilled, said her closest friend, Myvanwy Jenn. Then she began to fade away.\n\nBallard, 93, died Monday night at her home in Rancho Mirage after lapsing into unconsciousness less than a week after being notified that “Kaye Ballard: The Show Goes On” would go on to have another festival screening as a Best of the Fest.\n\n“I loved that she was at the theater the night the film opened at the festival,” said Festival Chairman Harold Matzner. “She received a serenade of applause from all the people who gathered from a sold-out performance. I’m sure she loved that. I’m glad it was finished in time for her to see it and enjoy it.”\n\n“The irony of all this,” added actor Gavin MacLeod, “is, you can go back a year, a year-and-a-half, and PBS did a movie on Rose Marie’s life. And Rosie died I think three days later. Kaye said, ‘I want my movie to be better than Rosie’s.’ Then Kaye’s movie is shown at the festival, and then the award, and then she goes. It’s like these two dynamite personalities got a chance to see their lives flash in front of them on screen before they said, ‘Bye-bye.’\n\nMore:Premiere of documentary on Palm Springs legend leads week's entertainment events\n\nMore:Premiere of documentary on Palm Springs legend leads week's entertainment events\n\n“Kaye was my favorite leading lady, and my favorite friend, and there is a vacancy in our lives because of her leaving that only God can fulfill.”\n\nBallard had one of the most illustrious careers in show business in the mid-20th century. She first exhibited her talents in Cleveland, where she was born Catherine Gloria Balotta to Italian emigrant parents. She was doing impressions of French entertainment legend Maurice Chevalier at age 5. She developed into a painter, singer, actor, musician and comic impressionist.\n\nBallard was offered a scholarship to Cleveland Art College, but chose to perform instead in vaudeville. A stage producer in Detroit was so impressed by her multiple talents, he recommended her to Spike Jones, the most popular comic big band leader of the Swing Era. Jones, who had novelty hits like \"Cocktails For Two\" and \"Yes, We Have No Bananas,\" invited her to look him up if she ever got out to Los Angeles. So Ballard bought a one-way plane ticket to L.A. and landed a job as a singer and a comic tuba player with his band.\n\nShe was performing with the Spike Jones Orchestra at the posh Trocadero supper club in L.A. when Mel Torme came in to sing with Nat King Cole in the lounge, Ballard said. Torme had written a new Christmas song that started with, \"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire ...\"\n\nMore:Kaye Ballard memorial service scheduled after outpouring of love\n\nMore:Kaye Ballard gets a third act with debut of her documentary at the film festival she loves\n\nWhen Jones' band stopped went on tour to New York, Ballard got a chance to see Laurette Taylor in Tennessee Williams' \"The Glass Menagerie,\" which inspired her to get serious about acting, and Ethel Merman in Irving Berlin's \"Annie Get Your Gun,\" which convinced her to go into musical theater.\n\nBallard made her Broadway debut in 1946 when she was invited by someone who had seen her with Jones to join the cast of the musical, \"Three To Make Ready,\" with \"The Wizard of Oz\" star Ray Bolger and such future legends as Arthur Godfrey, Julie Wilson and Gordon McRae.\n\nFrom there, she did such shows as \"Touch and Go,\" which included a Royal Command Performance for King George VI, which got her an introduction to the future Queen Elizabeth; \"Top Banana\" with Phil Silvers, in which she replaced Rose Marie for the road tour, and \"The Golden Apple,\" which landed her on the cover of Life Magazine and enabled her to introduce the standard, \"Lazy Afternoon.\"\n\nThroughout the rest of her life, with all of the other endeavors she tried, including film, record albums and and a book, Ballard always came back to the stage. Her list of theatrical credits in New York and around the country is remarkable, including:\n\n\"Carnival,\" \"Gypsie,\" \"Annie Get Your Gun,\" \"Sheba,\" \"High Spirits,\" a female version of \"The Odd Couple,\" \"Funny Girl,\" \"Chicago,\" \"The Pirates of Penzance,\" \"Royal Flush,\" \"Reuben, Reuben,\" \"Follies,\" \"Look Ma, I'm Dancin',\" \"Minnie's Boys,\" \"The Decline and Fall of the Entire World As Seen Through the Eyes of Cole Porter Revisited,\" \"Molly,\" \"The Beast In Me,\" \"Wonderful Town,\" \"She Stoops To Conquer,\" \"The Pirates of Penzance,\" \"No, No Nanette\" and \"Over the River and Through the Woods.\"\n\nOther notable productions included \"Nunsense,\" which won a Carbonell Award for South Florida theater, \"4 Girls 4,\" which she performed at the McCallum Theatre,\" \"Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes,\" which she performed for most of a season at the Springs Theater in the Palm Springs Convention Center, \"From Broadway with Love,\" with Donna McKcKechnie and Liliane Montevecchi, and \"The Fabulous Palm Springs Follies,\" where she appeared as a guest artist as an opportunity to sell copies of her book, \"How I Lost 10 Pounds in 53 Years: Kaye Ballard, A Memoir,\" in the lobby in 2004.\n\nShe toured with two critically acclaimed one-woman shows, \"Kaye Ballard — Working 42nd St., At Least,\" and \"Hey Ma... Kaye Ballard,\" which she also brought to the McCallum. She did her last touring production in 2012 at age 86, \"Doin' It For Love,\" a tribute to Broadway standards and performers, and the stories behind them with Montevecchi and Lee Roy Reams.\n\nShe said she was proud of having always been a working entertainer, without ever having to take a job outside of show biz.\n\n\"I’m very happy because I’m doing the things I’ve done for 60 years,\" she said in 2012. \"I’m just doing the best of the things, like Sophie Tucker and Jimmy Durante (material), and telling things that were in my book. It’s really wonderful.\"\n\nAfter her first Broadway show, Ballard next went into cabaret, headlining New York's finest supper clubs, such as the Blue Angel and Bon Soir. She had a voice that rivaled Judy Garland's and, with her comedy and acting skills, she became a magnet for New York music publishers and their \"song pluggers.\" In 1954, she introduced a Bart Howard song called \"In Other Words\" for Hampshire House Publishing, led by her future Rancho Mirage neighbor, Howie Richmond. It became known as \"Fly Me To the Moon\" after Frank Sinatra recorded it.\n\nGretchen Reinhagen, a New York singer-actress whose family has long been part of the Coachella Valley theater community, did her own New York cabaret show saluting Ballard, called “Special Kaye: A Tribute to the Incomparable Kaye Ballard,” and performed it at the Annenberg Theater with Ballard in attendance.\n\n“There is a huge fan base for her and deservedly so,” Reinhagen said at the time. “I saw her a couple of years ago with 'The (Fabulous Palm Springs) Follies' and it was like seeing a master class. I don’t think people know her as the incredible musician she is. I think people in the theater world or cabaret are very familiar with her cabaret work, as well as her Broadway career. I think some of the broader population that know her from ‘The Mothers-In-Law’ don’t know about ‘Working 42nd Street At Last.’”\n\nBallard made her first television splash in the 1957 made-for-TV Rodgers & Hammerstein musical, \"Cinderella,\" starring Julie Andrews. She became part of the Kraft Music Hall Players on NBC's \"The Perry Como Show\" with Don Adams and Sandy Stewart in 1961-62. But it was the 1967-69 sit-com, \"The Mothers-In-Law\" that made Ballard a household name. She starred with Eve Arden as two very different neighbors who were forced to become in-laws when their kids surprised them by marrying one another.\n\nDesi Arnaz directed the shows and the writers of \"I Love Lucy,\" Bob Carroll Jr. and Madelyn Davis, wrote the brilliant scripts. But Roger C. Carmel, who played the husband of Ballard's character, left the show after the first season in a salary dispute and the show didn't work with Richard Deacon playing Carmel's character.\n\nBallard moved on to a recurring part \"The Doris Day Show\" in 1970, with Rose Marie again in a higher-profile featured role, and she made an appearance on \"Here's Lucy,\" starring Lucille Ball and her two kids, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr.\n\nLucie, now living in Palm Springs, remembers Ballard coming to the desert to visit her family, with her father and his second wife, Edie, during \"The Mothers-In-Law.\"\n\n\"I have known her for over 50 years,\" Arnaz said. \"My father produced her series and she bought his house here in Rancho Mirage. She has always been very supportive of the direction I wanted to take in this business, even mentioning me in her autobiography, saying I would make a great director one day — years before I actually started directing. I always appreciated that. Kaye was a force to be reckoned with and I will miss her.\"\n\nRancho Mirage was home to some of the greatest female talents in the history of show biz in the 1970s. They included Ball, the biggest name in television, Dinah Shore, the leading female recording artist of the 1940s; Mary Martin, a rival to Merman as Broadway’s top stage musical actress; Alice Faye, the biggest star at 20th Century-Fox before walking away from the movies, and Ruby Keeler and Ginger Rogers, the top female movie dance stars of the 1930s and ‘40s, respectively.\n\nBallard felt overshadowed by these women in terms of celebrity. But her activity in theater, where casts grow personally connected after weeks or months of working together, had given her an extended family that reached across the globe.\n\nBallard never married or had children. She wrote in her memoir, “I found an emotional connection with women like Liz (Smith, the admittedly bisexual syndicated columnist who was Ballard’s road manager in the 1950s) that I could never find with a man. I don’t know why or how it happened, but I do know it has kept me single my entire life.”\n\nBut Ballard’s show-biz family was always all welcome at her house in the desert. She became an unofficial ambassador enticing celebrities to visit and often move to the Coachella Valley.\n\n“When I first met her, I was a big fan of hers,” MacLeod recalled. “We were doing ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show’ (in the early ‘70s) and I got a call. ‘Would I play Herbie with Kaye Ballard at a real burlesque theater in San Diego.’ I said, ‘Are you kidding?’ That was the beginning of our relationship. We spent a lot of time with Kaye and I had never been to Palm Springs. She said, ‘I live in Rancho Mirage, in Desi’s old house.’ So, (wife) Patti and I came down here and fell in love with it and we’ve had places down here since the ‘Mary Tyler Moore’ days. First in Palm Springs and then all over. It was because of Kaye. I don’t know if we would have come down here (otherwise). Now we have our burial plots right down the street from us.”\n\nPhotographer and event producer Michael Childers, who saw Ballard in \"Carnival\" when he was 16, credits her with introducing him to the desert and his life partner, John Schlesinger, the director of films such as “Midnight Cowboy” and “Marathon Man.”\n\nChilders said he got to know Ballard while taking still photos of “The Mothers-In-Law.” She told him Schlesinger had just come to Los Angeles and was lonely. He was “very nice and very charming,” Ballard told him, and she suggested they meet for a drink at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel bar. Childers read that Schlesinger could be “mercurial and difficult on the set,’ so he asked an actor friend to come along. But he soon told the friend to get lost.\n\n“He was charming, delightful and wonderful and I thank Kaye Ballard for introducing me to my partner of 38 years,” Childers said. “It wouldn’t have happened without Kaye Ballard. And, when we moved here in 1998, she was the first person to take us under the wing and introduce us to all the locals — the movers and the shakers.\n\n“She loved the desert. She was the first great desert booster that I met.”\n\nBallard performed at two of Childers’ “One Night Only” benefit variety shows at the McCallum, and Childers said, “The audience went crazy when they saw her.” She regularly attended charity events and performed at a few of them, including a roast of the late journalist Gloria Greer to benefit ACT For MS, and a tribute to Merv Griffin to benefit the La Quinta Arts Foundation. She received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Palm Springs Women In Film & Television in November for helping to break the glass ceiling marginalizing women in show business.\n\nBut her passion was the Palm Springs International Film Festival. She served on the board of the Palm Springs International Film Society under Camelot Theatres founders Ric and Rozene Supple in the 1990s after being a regular at the foreign film screenings since the festival’s inception in 1990. She was no longer on the board when Matzner joined, but he noticed how much the other celebrities at the gala liked her.\n\n“When I arrived on the scene in 2000, the gala had a green room and she was in it and she knew everybody,” he said. “We very quickly eliminated the green room after my first year because we wanted the stars to be part of the audience. But, Kaye has always been very, very helpful to me personally and to the film festival. She is a real ambassador for this film festival and always has been. So, when she got to the point where she really couldn’t walk, we treated her as a member of our film festival inner circle. Her star status qualified her for the red carpet, and she was always invited.”\n\nMatzner recognized how happy Ballard seemed to be “in that milieu” of show biz people. Childers saw it, too.\n\n“She needed people around her all the time,” Childers said. “She was no good alone. She loved entertaining, giving parties, and the days in Hollywood, when she had lots of money, she had lots of parties where I met everybody in Hollywood. She was a people person.”\n\nBut Ballard was in awe of people with great talent. She originally planned to call her autobiography, “I Just Happened To Be There” because she was so impressed by all the people she met from the pantheon of show business. She said after meeting French chanteuse Edith Piaf, and then seeing her in concert, “I couldn’t talk to her normally ever again.”\n\n“I met Elvis Presley in Palm Springs,” she said. “I was driving along Palm Canyon and I pulled right upside his black (Stutz Blackhawk), and I said, ‘I love you!’ He said, ‘I love you, too, Miss Ballard.’ I said, ‘Ah!’ I almost drove off the road. I thought, ‘Elvis Presley said my name! He knows who I am! That was the thrill of a lifetime.”\n\nBut she was just as proud of recognizing up-and-coming talent and helping them with their careers. She boasted of introducing comic actor Paul Lynde to producer Leonard Sillman, who launched his career by putting him in “New Faces Of 1952.” She suggested Jerry Stiller and his wife, Anne Meara, do a comedy act together. They became famous as Stiller & Meara before they became famous as Ben Stiller's parents.\n\nSatirist Paul Krassner, who edited the pioneering comic Lenny Bruce’s autobiography, “How to Talk Dirty and Influence People,” credited Ballard with getting Bruce one of his first big New York gigs at the Blue Angel.\n\n“I think every person who understood Kaye at all would agree that the most salient fact about her was that, in a profession where the ego is most often supreme, she thrived on finding genuine happiness in the success of others, whether they happened to be huge stars or simply people she took pleasure in knowing,” said her Rancho Mirage friend, Hal Wingo, one of the founding editors of People magazine.\n\n“As much as she sought out and enjoyed the limelight of show business in a very long and diversified career, she equally enjoyed the company of other talented performers she respected and admired, even to the point of refusing top billing every time she thought another person was more deserving, though very few were.”\n\nBallard also had regrets about things she didn’t accomplish. In 2003, she told The Desert Sun she needed to work and, “I would give anything to be on a television show.” She auditioned for “Becker,” she said, and sent a tape in for “The Sopranos.” Neither panned out.\n\n“If I had my life to live over, I would live my life differently,” she said. “I would have gone after Howard Richmond!”\n\nBut friends said Ballard could be her own worst enemy.\n\nChilders recalls the time he booked Doris Roberts to perform at his “One Night Only” and Ballard was upset. He later discovered Ballard had wanted the role of the Italian mother in “Everybody Loves Raymond,” which Roberts got.\n\n“She would have been great as the Italian mother,” he said, “but she refused to go in to L.A. to do a screen test. She said, ‘You can look at my old TV footage on ‘The Mothers-In-Law.’ Well, that’s not how the business works.’ That was sad to see she didn’t get that.”\n\n“Kaye was not always easy to understand,” added Arnaz. “She could be abrasively cruel and then hilariously compassionate to the same person within minutes. She was a superb entertainer, a sensational vocal talent who, sadly, never believed she got the breaks she deserved, and it ate away at her.”\n\nBut Ballard was beloved in the Coachella Valley. She was the only local celebrity to receive two lifetime achievement awards from the Desert Theatre League. She has a star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars at the corner of Palm Canyon and Tahquitz Canyon drives, next to the marker for Marilyn Monroe, with whom she took acting classes at Actors Studio in New York. The city of Rancho Mirage renamed the street on which she lived Kaye Ballard Lane in 2003, putting her in a league with Sinatra as probably the only local celebrities to live on streets named after them.\n\nShe did a “Going Out Of Business” show at the Camelot Theatre in 2014 with friends such as the late Carol Channing, Shecky Greene and Peter Marshall, and it sold out in two weeks. It was filmed for the documentary that was made about her and it provided a warm ending to a film that was primarily intended to inform people about the vastness of Ballard’s career.\n\nChanning says in the film Ballard was the only friend she could talk to about her own personal let-downs.\n\n“She and Channing,” lamented Childers. “What a loss. What an empty hole we have in this desert now without them.”\n\nMatzner, who invested in the documentary that took three-and-a-half years to make, said he loved the movie more than he expected when he watched it at the film festival.\n\n“I had no idea she had done all that work,” he said. “It covered so many years. It was the right thing for her to do to give people a chance to see how broad her work really was.”\n\n\"There is no dynamite talent like that,\" added McLeod. \"In the movie, you can see what a multi-talented person she was, and she was that way as a friend, too.\"\n\nWingo, who was an executive producer of “Kaye Ballard: The Show Goes On,” said he'll remember Ballard for her work and the depth of her friendship.\n\n“When self-interest and ego satisfaction were being dished out to humans,” Wingo said, “Kaye was still in the line waiting for a second helping of awe and wonder. Those traits were her constant companions throughout a career of comedic brilliance and stunning vocal competence in every arena of show business, from vaudeville to Broadway, television and films.\n\n“But, what must be remembered now is that none of those achievements were any match for the grandeur and strength of her own generous heart. That's the great loss we all experience in losing her.”\n\nWingo, serving as a family spokesman, said Ballard did not want any form of funeral service and her body will be cremated. Her nearest relatives, he said, are nieces and nephews, In lieu of flowers, Ballard asked that donations in her name be made to the Palm Springs Animal Shelter, the Coachella Homeless Shelter or any Coachella Valley veterans groups.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/entertainment/howard-hesseman-wkrp-cincinnati-dies/index.html&quot;", "title": "Howard Hesseman, the hard rocking DJ on 'WKRP in Cincinnati ...", "text": "(CNN) Actor Howard Hesseman, best known as the hard-rocking disc jockey Dr. Johnny Fever on the sitcom \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" has died, according to his manager, Robbie Kass.\n\nHesseman died Saturday afternoon from complications related to colon surgery, Kass told CNN.

In 2022, she competed in Season 7 of Fox’s “The Masked Singer.”\n\nThough she had an impressive body of work, the later part of her career was marked by Alley’s penchant for stirring controversy, especially through social media.\n\nIn a 2007 interview, Alley said she was proud of her no holds barred ways.\n\n“I’ve always felt like if someone asks me something, they want the real answer,” Alley told Good Housekeeping. “I think there’s also something about being from Kansas. Usually people think I’m from New York. The only similarity between New Yorkers and Midwesterners is that what you see is what you get.”\n\nKirstie Alley looks back on her 'Cheers' years (2005) 01:44 - Source: CNN\n\n‘Her charisma was always iconic’\n\nJohn Travolta, who costarred with Alley in 1989’s hit “Look Who’s Talking” as well as two sequels, wrote on Instagram on Monday, “Kirstie was one of the most special relationships I’ve ever had. I love you Kirstie. I know we will see each other again.”\n\nJamie Lee Curtis – who worked with Alley in 2016 on episodes of TV’s “Scream Queens” – shared a statement on Facebook to pay tribute to the late actress, writing, “She was a great comic foil in @tvscreamqueens and a beautiful mama bear in her very real life. She helped me buy onesies for my family that year for Christmas. We agreed to disagree about some things but had a mutual respect and connection. Sad news.”\n\nJosh Gad tweeted, “My heart breaks for Kirstie and her family. Whether it was her brilliance in ‘Cheers; or her magnetic performance in the ‘Look Who’s Talking’ franchise, her smile was always infectious, her laugh was always contagious and her charisma was always iconic. RIP.”\n\nAlley’s “Cheers” co-star Ted Danson told Deadline he had just watched Alley in an episode of the show while on a plane before learning of her death.\n\n“I was on a plane today and did something I rarely do. I watched an old episode of ‘Cheers,’” Danson told the outlet. “It was the episode where Tom Berenger proposes to Kirstie, who keeps saying no, even though she desperately wants to say yes. Kirstie was truly brilliant in it. Her ability to play a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown was both moving and hysterically funny.”\n\n“She made me laugh 30 years ago when she shot that scene, and she made me laugh today just as hard. As I got off the plane, I heard that Kirstie had died. I am so sad and so grateful for all the times she made me laugh,” Danson added. “I send my love to her children. As they well know, their mother had a heart of gold. I will miss her.”\n\nAnother “Cheers” star, Rhea Perlman, told CNN in a statement that she and Alley became friends instantly on the set of “Cheers.”\n\n“Kirstie was a unique and wonderful person and friend. Her joy of being was boundless,” Perlman said. “We became friends almost instantly when she joined the cast of Cheers. She loved kids and my kids loved her too. We had sleepovers at her house, with treasure hunts that she created. She had massive Halloween and Easter parties and invited the entire crew of the show and their families. She wanted everyone to feel included. She loved her children deeply. I’ve never met anyone remotely like her. I feel so thankful to have known her. I’m going to miss her very, very much.”\n\n“Baywatch” actor Parker Stevenson, who was married to Alley from 1983 to 1997 and is the father of her two children, also paid tribute to her on social media. In an Instagram post, confirmed to be Stevenson’s by a representative for the actor, he wrote: “Kirstie, I am so grateful for our years together, and for the two incredibly beautiful children and now grandchildren that we have. You will be missed.”", "authors": ["Dan Heching Amy Simonson Taylor Romine", "Dan Heching", "Amy Simonson", "Taylor Romine"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/us/2022-in-review-fast-facts/index.html", "title": "2022 In Review Fast Facts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHere is a look back at the events of 2022.\n\nNotable US Events\n\nJanuary 3 - The US Food and Drug Administration expands the emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine boosters to children ages 12 to 15.

In 2022, that was Queen Elizabeth II. Her death in September at age 96 after 70 years on the throne was a global event, reminding even her critics of the virtues of continuity, duty and the importance of family, especially when put to the most extreme of public tests.\n\n“In a world of constant change, she was a steadying presence,” said President Joe Biden. Elton John, who sang at Princess Diana’s funeral in 1997, said of the queen, \"I’m 75 and she’s been with me all my life. I’m glad she’s at peace.\"\n\nIn contrast, the death in August of another titan of the 20th century, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, 91, drew muted responses and outright hostility in the Russia he helped open to the West in the 1990s.\n\nRussian leader Vladimir Putin, who called Gorbachev’s willingness to dissolve the Soviet Union “the greatest geopolitical disaster of the century,” moved to reverse all that by invading Ukraine. Putin offered respectful condolences but was said to be “too busy” to attend Gorbachev’s funeral.\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2022\n\nWhatever the outcome in Ukraine, Gorbachev’s legacy has been mostly obliterated; his achievements at risk of being a footnote in history.\n\nIn the end, how any death is treated needs to go beyond politics, jealousies or shifting legacies. Instead, the departed should be measured by the simplest of things – how their lives were lived, whether people around them were inspired and what kinds of imprints were left on family, friends and, yes, history. That’s what makes compiling USA TODAY’s annual Passages report so rewarding.\n\nMany deaths in 2022 did bridge the generation gaps – actor Sidney Poitier, 94, the first Black man to win an Academy Award; country legend Loretta Lynn, 90, who shocked audiences by singing about “The Pill”; outspoken diplomat Madeleine Albright, 84, the first woman to serve as secretary of state; Boston Celtics superstar Bill Russell, 88, an astonishing 11-time NBA champion; and Bob McGrath, 90, of \"Sesame Street\" who reached every generation.\n\nThen, near year's end, three more prominent personalities passed away. Pope Benedict XVI, 95, died almost eight years after resigning because of ill health in 2015. His papacy was marked by an attempt to return to conservative Catholic values, which were softened by his successor Pope Francis, who asked for prayers for Benedict in the final days.\n\nThe world also lost soccer superstar Pelé, 82, just 11 days after the World Cup. A three-time World Cup winner, many consider him the greatest soccer player of all time and a symbol of Brazilian pride and history. And trailblazing broadcaster Barbara Walters, 93, who interviewed everyone from Fidel Castro to Monica Lewisnky, left a legacy that opened doors for female journalists.\n\nBut such transcendent personalities seem fewer and fewer. Remembrances can depend on where you stand in the timeline.\n\nThat’s because every generation carries its own set of hard-wired memories. For baby boomers, the deaths of 1950s rocker Jerry Lee Lewis, 87; “Be My Baby” hitmaker Ronnie Spector, 78; teen idol Bobby Rydell, 79; and Lamont Dozier, 81, composer of much of the Motown sound, touched chords not felt by those born later. So too did the death of uber baby boomer Michael Lang, 77, who came up with Woodstock.\n\nOlder Americans were shaken by the loss of versatile actress Angela Lansbury, 96; “Leave It to Beaver” actor Tony Dow, 77; Dwayne Hickman, 87, who played TV’s first emo, Dobie Gillis; Tim Considine, 81, of “My Three Sons”; and Nichelle Nichols, 89, whose role as Uhura on “Star Trek” was so impactful that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. convinced her to not leave the show.\n\nGeneration X and much of Generation Y – the last to grow up before the age of social media – found extra sorrow with the death of “Grease” star Olivia Newton-John, 73; Fleetwood Mac’s elegant songwriter/singer Christine McVie, 79; sitcom star Bob Saget, 65, who winked a naughtier style of stand-up comedy; Tony Sirico, 79, the irrepressible Paulie Walnuts of “The Sopranos”; and Kevin Conroy, 66, who voiced Batman on the animated series for more than a decade.\n\nA disco dazzle of the 1980s was “Flashdance” and “Fame” singer Irene Cara, 63. “She made me believe if you were Latin you could make it!” said actor John Leguizamo. “She fueled my community.”\n\nMillennials were especially shaken by the deaths of singer Aaron Carter, 34; promising TV star Tyler Sanders, 18; rappers Takeoff, 28, of the Atlanta trio Migos, and Lil Keed, 24; Disney’s “Snowdrop” star Kim Mi-soo, 29; comedian Teddy Ray, 32; and Kazuki Takahashi, 60, creator of the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga and gaming world, so mystifying to parents.\n\nAlso mourned was Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, 50. “The world was so lucky to have his gifts,” said Finneas, brother of Billie Eilish.\n\nA world of entertainers gone\n\nMany stars died whose names alone are enough to identify them: tough guys Ray Liotta, 67, Henry Silva, 95, and Paul Sorvino, 83. Others are known for their roles: Britain’s David Warner, 80, played everyone from a time traveling Jack the Ripper to Bob Cratchit in “A Christmas Carol”; Louise Fletcher, 88, the eternal Nurse Ratched; ingenue Yvette Mimieux, 80, the gentle Weena from “The Time Machine”; and Robert Morse, 90, who sang “I Believe in You” to a mirror.\n\nKirstie Alley, 71, is remembered for “Cheers” and “Look Who’s Talking.” From “Altered States” to “Body Heat,” William Hurt, 71, was a reliable box office draw, as was James Caan, 82, whose roles ranged from the explosive Sonny Corleone in “The Godfather” to Brian Piccolo in “Brian’s Song.” Gone too are blaxsploitation star and producer Max Julien, 88; actress Anne Heche, 53; Broadway and soap opera star Joan Copeland, 99; and Sally Kellerman, 84, who played Maj. Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan in the movie version of “M*A*S*H.”\n\nJoe Turkel, 94, the eerie bartender in Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining,” was also a maker of replicants in “Blade Runner”; Veronica Carlson, 77, tried to fend off Christopher Lee’s Dracula; Fred Ward, 79, was a reliable bruiser; and Greek actress Irene Papas, 93, starred with Anthony Quinn and Gregory Peck in “The Guns of Navarone.”\n\nTelevision stars who died include Taurean Blacque, 82, of “Hill Street Blues”; Roger E. Mosley, 83, helicopter pilot in “Magnum, P.I.”; Clarence Gilyard Jr., 66, of “Matlock”; Robert Clary, 96, a Holocaust survivor who starred in “Hogan’s Heroes”; Mary Alice, 85, of “A Different World”; Emilio Delgado, 81, who played Luis on “Sesame Street”; and Stephen “tWitch” Boss, 40, DJ and dancer on the “Ellen” talk show.\n\nAlso gone are the affable David Birney, 83, of “Bridget Loves Birney”; Johnny Brown, 84, of “Good Times”; Howard Hesseman, 81, of “WKRP in Cincinnati”; Conrad Janis, 94, of “Mork and Mindy”; Leslie Jordan, 67, of “Will and Grace”; and Maggie Peterson, 81, who had a crush on Sheriff Taylor in “The Andy Griffith Show.”\n\nFrom “Seinfeld,” actresses Liz Sheridan and Estelle Harris, both 93 and TV mothers of Jerry and George respectively, died, along with the gruff Philip Baker Hall, 90, unforgettable as a “library cop” tracking down an overdue book: “Well I got a flash for you, joy boy: Party time is over. You got seven days, Seinfeld.”\n\nLaughter is remembered from Louie Anderson, 68; Judy Tenuta, 72; Larry Storch, 99; Gilbert Gottfried, 67; Ivan Reitman, 75, director of ”Ghostbusters”; Pat Carroll, 95, trailblazing female comedian; and Gallagher, 76, who provided ponchos to protect the front row when he smashed watermelons with a giant hammer.\n\nBehind the scenes were directors such as Jean-Luc Godard, 91, of the French New Wave; Peter Bogdanovich, 82, of “The Last Picture Show”; Peter Brook, 97, of “Lord of the Flies”; and Bob Rafelson, 89, of “Five Easy Pieces.” There was also Alan Ladd Jr., 84, president of 20th Century Fox; James Rado, 90, creator of Broadway’s “Hair”; and Douglas Trumbull, 79, whose special effects helped shape modern blockbusters.\n\nTheir music lives on\n\nFrom the early days of doo-wop and soul came “In the Still of the Night” by Fred Parris, 85, of The Five Satins; the Philadelphia stylings of William Hart, 77, of the Delfonics, along with Thom Bell, 79, producer of the 1970s “Philadelphia Sound”; and the radio comfort of “Chapel of Love” by The Dixie Cups’ Rosa Lee Hawkins, 76. Other early influencers included Charlie Gracie, 86; Mable John, 91; Chicago blues master Jimmy Johnson, 93; Bobby Hendricks, 84, of The Drifters; Memphis drummer Howard Grimes, 80; and Betty Davis, 77, sometimes known as the “funk diva,” and Miles Davis’ second wife.\n\nRock and folk lost Meat Loaf, 74; guitarists Danny Kalb, 80, of The Blues Project, and Wilko Johnson, 75, of Dr. Feelgood; Ronnie Hawkins, 87, whose Hawks became The Band; Gary Brooker, 76, of Procol Harum; Alan White, 72, of Yes; and Andy Fletcher, 60, of Depeche Mode.

Jazz will remember the sounds of Pharoah Sanders, 81, Ramsey Lewis, 87, and James Mtume, 75.\n\nAlso gone are Andrew Woolfolk, 71, of Earth, Wind and Fire; rappers Coolio, 59, Hurricane G, 52, and hip-hop pioneer DJ Kay Slay, 55. And everyone knows the theme from James Bond by Monty Norman, 94.\n\nNewsmakers who changed the world\n\nNewsmakers lost in 2022 include Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe, who was assassinated at age 67; inspector David Kay, 82, who debunked claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 88, who could work both sides of the aisle; Harlem civil rights icon the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, 73; Georgia’s the Rev. Charles Sherrod, 85; Robert “Bud” McFarlane, 84, who resigned after being implicated in the Iran-Contra affair; Ken Starr, 76, whose probe of Bill Clinton real estate shifted to the president’s affair with an intern; and Donald Trump’s first wife, Ivana Trump, 73, who helped design many of his hotel properties.\n\nSports legends remembered\n\nThe voice of almost all American sports was Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully, 94, who memorably proclaimed “in a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has happened.” Other sports journalists included Jane Gross, 75, who opened the way for women to report from locker rooms; ESPN NFL analyst John Clayton, 67, and anchor Fred Hickman, 66; and The New Yorker’s Roger Angell, 101, whose descriptions of baseball had you smelling the grass in center field.\n\nLost too were San Francisco Giants pitcher Gaylord Perry, 84, who admitted that his spitball helped record 3,534 strikeouts; LA Dodgers player Maury Wills, 89, who stole a then-record 104 bases in 1962; Tommy Davis, 83, a two-time batting champ; Pittsburgh Pirates World Series champion Gene Clines, 75; St. Louis Cardinals reliever Bruce Sutter, 69; and Joan Joyce, 81, softball great who struck out Boston Red Sox slugger Ted Williams at a charity game.\n\nThe NFL remembers Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris, 72, famed for his \"Immaculate Reception\" in a 1972 playoff game; Ray Guy, 72, the only punter in pro football’s Hall of Fame; quarterbacks Len Dawson, 87, Daryle Lamonica, 80, and John Hadl, 82; two-time Washington Super Bowl champion Dave Butz, 72; receivers Charley Taylor, 80, and Don Maynard, 86; Dan Reeves, 77, who reached nine Super Bowls as player or coach but never won one; Hall of Famer Charley Trippi, 100, from the 1940s and '50s; and Dwayne Haskins, 24, Pittsburgh Steelers backup quarterback who was fatally struck by a truck.

She was born in Hawaii and moved to New York, where she became a stenographer, according to details of her early life provided by the court. No cause of death was given.\n\nThurgood Marshall, the first Black justice in the court’s history, had retired in 1991 and died in 1993. But Cecilia Marshall, known for her warmth, exuberance, and enduring interest in the court, continued to attend oral arguments and extracurricular court festivities, often with their son Thurgood Marshall Jr.\n\n“You wanted to sit next to her at any event,” Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement Tuesday that captured her personality. “She had an easy sense of humor that could be – in an appropriate setting, of course – a bit saucy.”\n\nThurgood Marshall stands with his family prior to being sworn in as the first black member of the US Supreme Court. Left to right are his sister-in-law, Mrs. Sally Acoba; sons, Thurgood, Jr. and John; and wife, Cecilia. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nHe noted that Marshall often sat in a reserved section for spouses at oral arguments and Supreme Court Historical Society events. Roberts said she rarely missed an investiture or other Supreme Court occasion.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, who was a law clerk for Justice Marshall during the 1987-88 session, said in a statement on Tuesday, “Every clerk to Justice Marshall received a sort of bonus: the steadfast friendship and support of his wife Cissy. She was a marvelous woman, and we all loved and admired her. The community of TM clerks will today feel a great loss.”\n\nBorn Cecilia Suyat in 1928 in Pu’unene, Maui, in Hawaii, she would later move to New York City, where she took night classes at Columbia University to become a stenographer. She worked for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1948-1955.\n\nThurgood Marshall, before joining the bench in 1967, led the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. In that position, he was chief counsel for the series of cases that led to the historic Brown v. Board of Education decision striking down the “separate but equal” doctrine in public schools.\n\nThe couple married in December 1955 and had two sons, Thurgood Jr. and John.\n\nCecilia Marshall, who lived in Falls Church, Virginia, served over the years on the board of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Supreme Court Historical Society. The Supreme Court public information office said she was also active in church activities and community service. In addition to her two sons, she is survived by four grandchildren and three great grandchildren.", "authors": ["Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}]}

She managed $500 million in capital development funds to make sure resources were evenly distributed among New York City public schools.\n\nCalling the rats \"public enemy No. 1,\" the mayor said the rat czar has the chops to get rid of them and make New York City a better place for those who live there.\n\n\"The rats are going to hate Kathy, but we're excited to have her leading this important effort,\" Adams said.\n\nAnother reason to avoid rodents: NYC's rats found infected with virus that causes COVID\n\nOwls and rats: Flaco, the zoo owl roaming New York City, now feasting on rats after fleeing coop\n\nMayor Adams announces billion-dollar investment to rid NYC of rats\n\nCorradi will use a $3.5 million fund to try new methods to control rat populations, expand outreach and education and increase maintenance and remediation work. The money also will be used to launch the Harlem Rat Mitigation Zone, a rat reduction plan that covers 28 New York City Housing Authority properties, 73 New York City Parks locations, nearly 70 Department of Education schools and more than 10,000 private properties.\n\nThe money will ensure that the city can make hires in Harlem to control rat populations, including 19 full-time staff and 14 seasonal staff to inspect, exterminate and maintain or clean public spaces. Also covered will be new equipment and extermination supplies.\n\nPrivate properties in Harlem also will be inspected twice a year for rat-related violations, and city locations will be inspected monthly, the city announced.\n\n\"On behalf of all New Yorkers, we welcome Kathy to the war on rats,\" said Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi. \"She will lead a team of experts with focus and energy, every day diligently depriving rats of food, water and shelter. And the rest will be history.\"\n\nWhat threats do rats pose?\n\nIn 2021, at least 13 people were hospitalized and one died from leptospirosis, a condition that attacks the kidneys and liver, The Associated Press reported. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bacteria that cause leptospirosis are spread through animal urine. In addition to rats carrying the bacteria, cattle, pigs, horses, dogs and other wild animals also carry it.\n\nMost human infections are associated with rats, though, the AP reported.\n\nChief of Staff Camille Joseph Varlack addressed the risks associated with high rat populations, as well as the symbolism behind their overtaking of the city.\n\n\"Rats are more than just a quality-of-life issue – they are a symbol of systemic issues that for too long have plagued New Yorkers, particularly low-income and communities of color,\" Varlack said. \"I'm thrilled to have Kathy Corradi as our first rat czar, who will coordinate across agencies, bring a scientific, data-driven approach to the role, and deliver on Mayor Adams' vision to finally control our rat population.\"\n\nTo cut back on rat numbers, the city recommends that people:\n\nStore trash in containers and follow trash set-out times to reduce the time that trash is exposed.\n\nDo not feed wildlife.\n\nPick up after dogs.\n\nSeal cracks or holes around buildings, sidewalks and under doors.\n\nKeep green spaces around a property clean and maintained.\n\nCover or destroy earthen rat burrows (also known as rat holes).\n\n\"As the first director of rodent mitigation, I'm excited to bring a science and systems-based approach to fight rats,\" Corradi said at the event. \"New York may be famous for the Pizza Rat, but rats, and the conditions that help them thrive, will no longer be tolerated – no more dirty curbs, unmanaged spaces or brazen burrowing. I'm honored to lead this work, grateful to Mayor Adams for this opportunity, and look forward to sending the rats packing.\"\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.\n\nThe Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip. Here, we’ve put together a day-by-day guide on what will happen from now until the state funeral.\n\nFollowing the Queen’s death, her oak coffin – draped with the Royal Standard for Scotland and a wreath of flowers – sat in the ballroom at Balmoral, where estate staff had the chance to pay their last respects.\n\nOn Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time. The first leg of the Queen’s final journey saw the royal cortege make a six-hour journey to Edinburgh and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland. The trip by road ordinarily takes around three hours, however, it was driven slowly to allow people to witness the procession and bow their heads as it passed.\n\nAn honor guard made up of the Royal Regiment of Scotland greeted the hearse in Edinburgh with a royal salute before the coffin was transferred to the Throne Room by a military bearer party.\n\nMeanwhile, back in London, the King met with the Commonwealth secretary general before hosting a reception for the high commissioners from the realms of which he is now head of state in Buckingham Palace’s Bow Room.\n\nOn Monday morning, the King started the day with a trip to Westminster Hall where both Houses of Parliament expressed their condolences. He and his wife Camilla then flew to Edinburgh, where they headed straight to the Palace of Holyroodhouse.\n\nIn the afternoon, the King led a procession carrying the Queen’s coffin to St. Giles’ Cathedral for a service of thanksgiving attended by members of the royal family, as well as a congregation made up “from all areas of Scottish society,” according to a senior palace official. Afterward, the coffin rested there for 24 hours to allow the Scottish public to see it.\n\nFollowing the service, the King had an audience with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, and a meeting with the presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament. Charles, accompanied by the Queen Consort, also went to the Scottish Parliament to receive a motion of condolence.\n\nIn the evening, the King and members of the royal family mounted their own guard – or vigil – of the Queen’s coffin.\n\nThen-Prince Charles and his brother Edward, left, stand vigil beside their grandmother's coffin while the Queen Mother lies in state at Westminster Hall in 2002. Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday, the King and Camilla visited Belfast, Northern Ireland, as part of his first tour as monarch of the nations that make up the United Kingdom. The couple visited Hillsborough Castle and viewed an exhibition on the Queen’s long association with Northern Ireland. The King then met the secretary of state for Northern Ireland in addition to other party leaders, and received a message of condolence led by the speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\nBack in Scotland, the Queen’s only daughter, Princess Anne, accompanied her mother’s body as it was flown back to London. The coffin traveled 8.2 miles (13.2 kilometers) by hearse to Edinburgh Airport, where it departed for RAF Northolt.\n\nA state hearse brought the monarch’s remains to Buckingham Palace, where the King, the Queen Consort, as well as other members of the Windsor clan, were waiting for the coffin’s arrival at around 8 p.m. (3 p.m. ET). The Dean of the Chapels Royal conducted prayers and a bearer party founded by The Queen’s Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards placed the coffin on trestles in the center of the Bow Room to rest overnight.\n\nWednesday saw an extraordinary procession take the coffin on a gun carriage from Buckingham Palace over to Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the Palace of Westminster, where the Queen will lie in state until the morning of the funeral.\n\nFor this journey, the coffin was be adorned with the Imperial State Crown and a flower wreath. The procession set off at 2:22 p.m. (9:22 a.m. ET) along The Mall, across Horse Guards Parade, past Downing Street toward Westminster.\n\nSenior royals including King Charles III and Princes William and Harry walked behind their beloved matriarch. They were followed by senior staff from the royal households as well as close personal staff and members of the Household Division. As crowds watched the procession – which took around 40 minutes – Big Ben tolled and minute guns fired by The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery at Hyde Park echoed across the capital.\n\nThe Queen’s coffin was placed on a raised platform – or catafalque – in the middle of the hall and is being guarded around the clock by officers from the Household Division, the King’s Bodyguard or the Royal Company of Archers.\n\nUpon its arrival at Westminster Hall, a short service was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, after which the hall opened for the public to pay their respects.\n\nKing Charles III walks with his sons behind the Queen's coffin on Wednesday. Daniel Leal/Pool/AP\n\nMembers of the public filed past the Queen’s coffin during its first full day lying in state at Westminster Hall on Thursday.\n\nThe hall will be open 24 hours a day until 6:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m.) on the day of the Queen’s funeral. The UK government has warned that those wishing to pay their respects “will be required to queue for many hours, possibly overnight.” All those attending the lying in state will go through “airport-style” security with only small bags permitted.\n\nBrass plaques in the 11th-century hall mark the spot where Edward VII lay in state in 1910, George V in 1936, George VI in 1952 and Queen Mary a year later. The hall, which is 900 years old, is also where wartime British Prime Minister Winston Churchill lay in state in 1965.\n\nOn Friday, the lying in state continued for a second full day. Huge numbers of people lined up in central London for a chance to visit the coffin and be part of this historic moment.\n\nSeparately, King Charles and Camilla visited Wales on Friday, bringing their tour of all four nations that make up the United Kingdom to a close.\n\nPublic access to the lying in state continues into the weekend. And in a surprise announcement, the Queen’s eight grandchildren – including Princes William and Harry – will stand vigil beside her coffin on Saturday evening.\n\nSunday marks the final full day the Queen’s body will lie in state in Westminster Hall.\n\nThe UK public has also been invited to observe a minute’s silence at 8 p.m. (3 p.m. ET) in a national moment of reflection.\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September 19 – declared a public holiday across the UK – the Queen’s lying in state will end. The coffin will then travel in procession once more to Westminster Abbey for the state funeral, the details of which will likely come in the following days.\n\nWestminster Abbey, founded in 960 AD by Benedictine monks, is one of the most recognizable landmarks in London. The historic church has been the setting for every coronation since 1066, and was where the then-Princess Elizabeth married Prince Philip in 1947. But there hasn’t been a funeral of a monarch there since that of George II in 1760.\n\nHeads of state and dignitaries from around the world are expected to be invited to the British capital to join members of the royal family to celebrate the Queen’s life and unwavering service to the nation and Commonwealth. While a guest list has not yet been announced, US President Joe Biden plans to attend the funeral.\n\nOther familiar faces at the televised service will be some of the 15 prime ministers to have served during the Queen’s reign.\n\nAt its conclusion, the coffin will travel in procession to Wellington Arch, before making its final journey out of London to Windsor.\n\nThe George VI Memorial Chapel in St. George's Chapel, Windsor, where the Queen's father and mother were interred.

It’s where Prince Philip’s funeral service was held, as well as more jubilant occasions like the nuptials of the Queen’s grandchildren.\n\nFollowing the service for the Duke of Edinburgh in 2021, his coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault, set below the chapel, where many royal family members have been laid to rest. However, he will be relocated to lie together with the Queen in the King George VI Memorial Chapel, located elsewhere within St. George’s Chapel.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Lauren Said-Moorhouse Max Foster", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/19/queen-elizabeth-funeral-live-updates/10419491002/", "title": "Queen funeral updates: Elizabeth laid to rest alongside Prince Philip", "text": "The U.K. and much of the world spent Monday mourning Queen Elizabeth II, who was celebrated at a funeral at Westminster Abbey and brought to her final place of rest, St. George's Chapel.\n\nWith the funeral concluded, and a private burial service held at 7:30 p.m. local time, a period of Royal Mourning is set to last for the next seven days, according to the wishes of the new king.\n\nWhile the mourning period continues for the royal family, the transition of power has already occurred. The queen's eldest son, Charles Philip Arthur George Windsor, 73, is now King Charles III of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But the date for the formal coronation ceremony for the new king has not yet been announced.\n\nShortly after the queen was laid to rest, the royal family's official Twitter account shared a new photo of Queen Elizabeth II climbing a hill with a walking stick in one hand and a coat draped over the other. She looks off in the distance, wearing sunglasses and a head scarf, as lush greenery fills the landscape behind her.\n\nAlong with the photo, the account shared a quote from William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\": \"May flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest.\"\n\nQueen laid to rest alongside husband, Prince Philip\n\nThe queen was laid to rest in an intimate ceremony away from cameras in Windsor, where she was reunited with her husband and her parents.\n\nCharles and senior royal family members gathered late Monday for the private interment ceremony at St. George’s Chapel, a gothic church on the grounds of Windsor Castle that has hosted royal weddings, christenings and burials since the 15th century.\n\nIn contrast to the pomp and pageantry of her grand state funeral, royal officials said the queen's internment was a “deeply personal family occasion.” They said the queen was interred together with Prince Philip’s remains at the King George VI memorial chapel, an annex within St. George’s.\n\nWhen Philip, the queen's husband of 73 years, died last year, his coffin had been placed in a different part of St. George’s Chapel, ready to be moved to the memorial chapel to join the queen when she died.\n\nElizabeth II’s parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, were also interred there along with the ashes of Princess Margaret, the late monarch’s younger sister who died in 2002.\n\nSt. George's is the resting place of 10 former British monarchs, including Henry VIII and the beheaded Charles I. It is also the home of the Order of the Garter, an ancient order of chivalry founded by King Edward III in 1348.\n\nWestminster Abbey: See Queen Elizabeth at the iconic church where she was married, crowned, laid to rest\n\nSpeaking ill of the dead?:We can't ignore Queen Elizabeth's complicated legacy\n\nWhen will King Charles' coronation take place?\n\nCharles will be crowned probably within the year; the ancient ritual of the coronation requires advance planning, although a lot of that has already been done. But there hasn't been a coronation since June 1953 when Elizabeth was crowned, following the death of her father King George VI. Queen Elizabeth II was 25 when she took the throne.\n\nMost people in the U.K. have never lived through such a momentous event. But there's little puzzlement in the royal palaces, in Parliament or the British government, and almost certainly none in Charles' mind.\n\nOpinion:King Charles III must do better than his mother on colonialism and reparations. Will he?\n\nWhat happens next has been carefully planned out for decades, based on combining ancient funeral and coronation traditions with practical measures to cope with such modern realities as instant communication, traffic control, social media and the vestiges of a pandemic.\n\nThe queen's funeral was expected to draw millions of viewers\n\nThe state funeral, expected to be the biggest gathering of world leaders in years, drew millions of people to the streets of London and likely billions more to their TVs and computer screens. The funeral and events surrounding it were designed to help unite the royal family and divided subjects while helping ensure the monarchy survives another century.\n\nLondon’s mayor’s office said up to two million people were expected to line the streets as members of the royal family and hundreds of foreign dignitaries and heads of state descended on Westminster Abbey. More than 10,000 police officers were on patrol in London with reinforcements supplied from all of Britain’s 43 police forces, authorities said.\n\nThe royal family:A look at the British royal family tree, spanning four generations\n\nRead more about what to expect from the reign of King Charles III: What kind of sovereign will he be?

Today we said a final farewell to Her Majesty The Queen,” he wrote in the caption.\n\nSandra Oh attended the funeral at Westminster Abbey, posting several photos on Instagram, featuring the actress wearing mourning colors.\n\nAnd Elton John posted photos, too, remembering some moments he shared with the queen and noting she will be \"sorely missed.\"\n\n“My own memories of her are filled with joy and admiration,\" he wrote. The Queen honoured me with a CBE, a knighthood and the Companion of Honour. I was lucky enough to perform at three of her Jubilees. They were always joyous and humbling experiences. But it was the moments out of the public eye that I will most fondly remember her for.\"\n\nWhat is the committal service at Windsor Castle?\n\nThe queen headed to her final resting place in Windsor Castle where a committal service took place before she was lowered into the Royal Vault.\n\nThe committal service was conducted by the dean of Windsor, David Connor. Events include prayer and a choir performance at St George's chapel. Nearly 800 people were expected to attend, including royal family members, and the hymn, \"All My Hope on God is Founded,\" was performed.\n\nWhile the procession took place, the Imperial State Crown sat atop the queen’s coffin along with her scepter and orb.\n\nDuring the committal service, the crown, scepter and orb were removed from the top of the coffin. The items were placed on an altar at St. George’s Chapel, and marked the final separation of the late queen from her crown.\n\nThe “Wand of Office” was broken by the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Andrew Parker. The breaking of the wand is a tradition in a sovereign’s funeral, according to The Independent, and hasn’t been seen since King George VI died in 1952.\n\nThe new king stood by quietly during the moments of farewell and appeared somber and a bit teary-eyed before his mother’s coffin was lowered into the vault.\n\nPast tears:Did Queen Elizabeth cry at Prince Philip's funeral? How she manages to stay stoic\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss arrives at St George's chapel\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss and husband Hugh O'Leary attended the queen's state funeral. They were also among early arrivals to St George's chapel for the committal service.\n\nAt the state funeral, Truss read a prayer from Bible’s John 14: 1-9.\n\nPrincess Kate, daughter Princess Charlotte honor the queen with poignant accessories\n\nMother and daughter duo Princess Kate and Princess Charlotte, who attended the state funeral, both wore simple black dresses topped with black overcoats, paired with black tights and black shoes. But their jewelry choices paid tribute to a beloved matriarch.\n\nPrincess Charlotte wore a dainty brooch on her coat in the shape of a horseshoe, a tribute to the queen, her great-grandmother, who had a lifelong passion for horses. The queen often attended races and was also a successful owner and breeder.\n\nPrincess Kate, the wife of Prince William, wore two pieces of jewelry that once belonged to her grandmother-in-law. She wore Bahrain Pearl Drop Earrings and a four-strand pearl choker necklace, both from the queen's collection, People reported.\n\nFuneral attire:Princess Kate, daughter Charlotte honor Queen Elizabeth with sweet details\n\nRoyals escort the queen's casket to Wellington Arch, Windsor Castle\n\nFollowing the funeral, the coffin – accompanied by units of the armed forces in dress uniforms and members of her family – was carried through the capital’s streets.\n\nAt Wellington Arch near Hyde Park, it was placed in a hearse and driven to Windsor Castle – where Elizabeth spent much of her time – for another procession before a committal service in St George’s Chapel. She will be laid to rest with her late husband, Prince Philip, at a private family service.\n\nWhat is the hearse the queen is in?\n\nThe queen’s coffin was moved from the gun carriage to the royal hearse at Wellington Arch as it was taken to Windsor. The hearse drove 25 miles west of London to Windsor Castle and St George's Chapel, a mini-cathedral that seats 800 and is often used for royal weddings. It's where Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan were married in 2018.\n\nAt Windsor, the state hearse traveled in procession to St George’s Chapel via the Long Walk. Once inside, a committal service began at 4 p.m. local time, 11 a.m. EDT.\n\nThe glass-walled hearse allows the queen’s coffin to be viewed – and it is lit up when it is dark out.\n\nFuneral program: What happened at queen's funeral\n\nThe funeral concluded just after noon, local time. The pall bearers escorted the queen's coffin onto the gun carriage.\n\nThe queen will be buried in a special chapel beneath the floor of St George's with her parents, sister Princess Margaret, and husband, Philip.\n\nThe program also included:\n\nPatricia Scotland Commonwealth Secretary-General read a lesson from Corinthians 15 as a tribute to the queen’s life of dedication to service and the nation.\n\nA sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nChoirs sang the Anthem, taken from \"Songs of Farewell\" by Hubert Parry, a favorite of King Charles'.\n\nA short anthem, composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams for the queen’s coronation in 1953, presenting a reflective moment in the service.\n\nThe third hymn, \"Love Divine, All Loves Excelling\" is a Welsh tune, and was sung at the wedding of The Prince and Princess of Wales at Westminster Abbey in 2011. The arrangement is by James O’Donnell, a former organist at the Abbey.\n\nThe Archbishop gave the commendation over the queen’s coffin. The commendation will include the familiar line, \"Go Forth, O Christian Soul, From This World,\" which is often heard during funerals.\n\nThe choirs sang a new anthem, composed for the service by Sir James McMillan. The words are taken from Romans 8, which leads with the hopeful, confident line, \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\"\n\nThe dean pronounced the blessing from the altar, and the congregation will remain standing for the last post, which will be sounded by the state trumpeters of the household cavalry.\n\nThis was followed by two minutes’ silence, to be observed across the United Kingdom.\n\nThe trumpeters then sounded the reveille, before the national anthem was sung.\n\nThe sovereign’s piper played the traditional lament, ‘Sleep, dearie, sleep.’\n\nAt the conclusion of the lament, at noon local time (7 a.m. ET), the pall bearers entered and moved the queen’s coffin to the state gun carriage.\n\nCharles writes note to the queen tucked in funeral wreath atop coffin\n\nThe funeral wreath on the queen's coffin was anything but funereal – it was a massive assembling of color and symbolism topped with a note from Charles. \"In loving and devoted memory. Charles R,\" it read.\n\n\"Charles R\" is the monarch’s official signature, with R being Latin for \"Rex\" or king. (Elizabeth’s signature was Elizabeth R for \"Regina,\" Latin for queen.)\n\nThe sight of that note immediately evoked memories of the note that sat on Princess Diana’s coffin during her funeral procession to Westminster Abbey in 1997. It was from her sons and signed \"Mummy.\"\n\nAccording to Buckingham Palace’s notes on the funeral, the queen’s wreath included, at the king’s request, flowers and foliage cut from the gardens of Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and the king’s private home Highgrove House.\n\nThe foliage was chosen for its symbolism: Rosemary for remembrance. Myrtle for the ancient symbol of a happy marriage, and cut from a plant grown from a sprig of myrtle in the queen’s 1947 wedding bouquet. English oak symbolizes the strength of love.\n\nAlso included are scented pelargoniums, garden roses, autumnal hydrangea, sedum, dahlias, and scabious, in shades of gold, pink and deep burgundy, with touches of white to reflect the Royal Standard on which it sits.\n\nAnd at the request of the king, a longtime environmentalist, the wreath is made in a sustainable way, formed in a nest of English moss and oak branches and without the use of floral foam.\n\nWho attended the queen’s funeral?\n\nThe guest list for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II amounted to hundreds of people, a mix of members of the British royal family, foreign royals (many of them relatives of the queen), domestic and foreign government leaders, including President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, British religious and military leaders, members of the royal households, and scores of ordinary people, from the National Health Service, for instance, who were invited to mark their service to the nation.\n\nThe top British royals:\n\nKing Charles III\n\nCamilla, Queen Consort\n\nPrincess Anne Princess Royal, Vice Adm. Sir Tim Laurence\n\nPrince Andrew Duke of York\n\nPrince Edward Earl of Wessex, Sophie Countess of Wessex\n\nPrince William, Prince of Wales, Catherine, Princess of Wales\n\nPrince George of Wales\n\nPrince Charlotte of Wales\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\n\nEarl of Snowdon\n\nPeter Phillips\n\nAlso there are some two dozen other members of the queen’s family, including descendants of her mother’s Scottish family. All eight of her grandchildren are there and some of the older 12 great-grandchildren, including the new second and third in line in the succession, Prince George of Wales, 9, and Princess Charlotte of Wales, 7.\n\nMany of the foreign royals who attended also are related to the British royal family through descent from Queen Victoria, sometimes known as the \"grandmother\" of Europe in the 19th century. The monarchs of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain are there. Also, Japan’s Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, making their first overseas trip since assuming the throne of Japan in 2019.\n\nThe Bidens top the foreign leaders list, which also includes France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Ireland’s President Michael Higgins. Also there: Ursula von der Leyen, representing the European Union that Britain quit amid many recriminations in 2016. Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also are there, representing three of the major Commonwealth nations over which the queen also reigned.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral:See King Charles III, Prince Harry, all royals who attended\n\nIs Prince Harry at the funeral? Harry wore military medals, but not his uniform\n\nPrince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, were visiting the U.K. from their home in California to promote several causes they are involved with when the queen died.\n\nAt Monday's funeral, Harry wore his military medals but not his uniform. He wore the uniform during a vigil on Saturday with Queen Elizabeth's grandchildren.\n\nRoyal experts have explained that only working members of the royal family will wear the military uniform for the five events during the late monarch's period of mourning and state funeral.\n\nHarry walked in to Westminster Abbey alongside his brother, Prince William. But during the service, Harry and Meghan sat in the second row behind his father, while William, Princess Kate and their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte sat across the aisle in the first row.\n\nIs Sarah 'Fergie' Ferguson at the funeral?\n\nSarah Ferguson, affectionately known as Fergie, attended the state funeral for the queen Monday. The Duchess of York, 62, has remained close with the royals despite her divorce from Prince Andrew in 1996. The former pair share daughters Princess Beatrice, 34, and Princess Eugenie, 32, who were also in attendance.\n\nFollowing the queen's death, Ferguson wrote in a tribute on Twitter that \"she was was the most incredible mother-in-law and friend.\"\n\n\"I will always be grateful to her for the generosity she showed me in remaining close to me even after my divorce,\" the Duchess of York added. \"I will miss her more than words can express.\"\n\nState funeral at Westminster Abbey\n\nThe queen's casket entered Westminster Abbey around 11 a.m. local time Monday. The choir of St. George's Chapel sang The Sentences as the queen's coffin procession, including King Charles, Prince William, Princess Kate, Prince Harry, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince George, Prince Charlotte, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, followed the coffin into the abbey.\n\nDavid Hoyle, Dean of Westminster, opened the service before attendees joined together to sing The Hymn, \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\n\nDuring the funeral, speakers included Most Rev. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury; Rev.

Rev. Dame Sarah Mullally. As the funeral concluded, the choir sang \"God Save the King.\"\n\nFuneral music: Hymns sung at queen's funeral\n\nThe music during the funeral will be sung by the choir of the Westminster Abbey and included The Sentences, written by William Croft, whose Sentences have been used since the mid 1500s, and at every State Funeral since the early 18th century.\n\nThe choir of St George's Chapel sang The Sentences during the procession as the casket entered. The choir of Westminster Abbey began the funeral service in song, later joining with the choir of the Chapel Royal for a rendition of \"Like as the Heart.\" The funeral's attendees sang \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\n\nThe choir also sang \"The Lord’s My Shepherd,\" which also was heard at the Wedding of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh in 1947. The choir sang \"God Save the King,\" featuring different lyrics from what many have known for decades as \"God Save the Queen,\" as the funeral concluded.\n\nDetails about Queen Elizabeth's coffin\n\nThe oak coffin was made more than 30 years ago, funeral directors previously confirmed to USA TODAY. Leverton & Sons, which has served as funeral directors to the royal household said it inherited the coffin made for the queen by another firm, Kenyons.\n\nAndrew Leverton, a funeral director at Leverton & Sons, previously told British outlet the Times \"It is made from English oak, which is very difficult to get hold of.\n\n“Oak coffins are now made from American oak. I don’t think we could use English oak for a coffin now. It would be too expensive,” he told the outlet.\n\nThe coffin is also lined with lead, Leverton & Sons said. The lead lining makes the coffin so heavy that eight military bearers carried it Monday.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's casket:Queen to be buried in decades-old coffin lined with lead that takes 8 people to carry\n\nImperial State Crown: Details about crown atop casket\n\nThe majestic Imperial State Crown sits atop the queen’s flag-draped coffin as the queen was moved to Westminster Abbey, along with her scepter and orb.\n\nThe crown, the same one the young Queen Elizabeth II wore for her coronation in 1953, is adorned with stones including the 317-carat Cullinan II diamond, one of several stones cut from the more than 3,000-carat Cullinan Diamond, mined in South Africa in 1905, when the nation was a British colony. The main stone – the 530.2-carat Cullinan I diamond, also called the Star of Africa – rests at the top of the monarch’s scepter.\n\nAs the royal jewels are in the news, so are repeated calls to return the diamonds to their country of origin. The queen's death at 96 on Sept. 8 has also renewed the conversation of the royal family's ties to colonialism and the queen's lack of apology or atonement.\n\nCalls for reparation from former colonial powers are not new, but they have resurged in recent years. Barbados in November 2021 removed the queen as its head of state, becoming the region’s newest republic. Six other Caribbean countries have signaled their intent to follow suit.\n\nThe monarchy:Imperial State Crown and royal scepter glimmer, but some say on back of colonialism\n\nWhat is the gun carriage used to carry the queen?\n\nWhen the coffin emerged from Westminster Hall, the pallbearers placed it on the green gun carriage that was used for the funerals of the queen’s father, grandfather and great-grandfather, all kings.\n\nKing Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward flanked the procession, followed by several other members of the royal family including Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nKing Charles, more royals arrive at funeral\n\nKing Charles was met with applause by crowds as his motorcade arrived at Westminster Hall for the queen's coffin procession to Westminster Abbey. Prince William and Prince Harry joined him.\n\nOne car contained Queen Consort Camilla and Catherine, Princess of Wales, with her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Another featured Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex.\n\nMore members of the royal family, including Prince William, Catherine, Princess of Wales, Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrived shortly after.\n\nThe funeral’s order of service showed that George and Charlotte will walk together behind their parents. They will be followed by Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and other royal family members.\n\nThe royal children’s 4-year-old brother, Prince Louis, is not expected to be present at the funeral, which will be attended by some 2,000 people.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Prime Minister Liz Truss, more world leaders arrive\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, accompanied by first lady Jill Biden, is among the top world leaders who arrived at Westminster Abbey ahead of the funeral.\n\nBiden arrived at Westminster Abbey for the queen’s funeral in his armored limousine, The Beast. He was among the few international diplomats who, for security reasons, did not ride on a fleet of chartered luxury buses provided for other world leaders. Biden stepped out of the The Beast a few minutes after 10 a.m. local time. He did not say anything or address the press.\n\nMany other leaders arrived Monday morning via bus; the Bidens arrived separately. British Prime Minister Liz Truss and husband Hugh O'Leary, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and wife Sophie Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and wife Brigitte Macron, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and wife Michelle Bolsonaro and Israeli President Isaac Herzog and wife Michal Herzog were also spotted arriving.\n\nThe president signed the official condolence book and attended a reception Sunday at Buckingham Palace hosted by King Charles III.\n\nBiden is among many world leaders who traveled to the United Kingdom to honor Queen Elizabeth’s long reign. During his visit, Biden told media the queen \"was the same in person as her image: decent, honorable and all about service.\"\n\n\"Our hearts go out to the royal family, King Charles and all of the family. It’s a loss that leaves a giant hole and sometimes you think you’ll never overcome it,\" the president said, adding that he told Charles the queen will be with him \"every step of the way, every moment.\"\n\nThe day before the funeral:Biden arrives in London for funeral; Queen's grandchildren stand vigil by coffin\n\nTom Parker Bowles, more royals' family members arrive\n\nLess than an hour and a half before the funeral is set to begin, notable arrivals connected to the royal family began to trickle in. Queen Consort Camilla's family was also photographed arriving at Westminster Abbey, including Laura Lopes, Camilla's 44-year-old daughter, and Tom Parker Bowles, her 47-year-old son. Princess Kate's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, were also photographed upon arrival.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nWhere will Queen Elizabeth II be buried?\n\nThe queen will be buried at St George Chapel at Windsor Castle, where many of her ancestors are buried, including her parents, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother.\n\nFollowing the funeral at Westminster Abbey, the coffin procession will begin, joined by King Charles, other members of the royal family, past and present members of the queen's household, governors general and prime ministers of the realms.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral details:When is it? Will it be on TV? Your questions, answered\n\nKing Charles thanks the public for 'messages of condolence' ahead of queen's funeral\n\nAhead of Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, King Charles III issued a statement Sunday evening thanking people in Britain and across the world for \"the many messages of condolence.\"\n\n\"Over the last ten days, my wife and I have been so deeply touched,\" the king said. \"In London, Edinburgh, Hillsborough and Cardiff we were moved beyond measure by everyone who took the trouble to come and pay their respects to the lifelong service of my dear mother.\"\n\n\"As we all prepare to say our last farewell, I wanted simply to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those countless people who have been such a support and comfort to my family and myself in this time of grief,\" Charles concluded his statement.\n\nAhead of the queen's funeral Monday, a new photograph was released Sunday.\n\nAccording to the royal family on Facebook, the photo was taken to mark the queen's Platinum Jubilee earlier this year. She was the first British monarch to reach this milestone.\n\n\"Tomorrow, millions will come together to commemorate her remarkable life,\" the post read.\n\nPrince Charles is now King Charles III. Here's what to know about UK's new monarch.\n\nHow old is Westminster Abbey, site of Queen Elizabeth funeral?\n\nWestminster Abbey, where Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral will be held Monday, has a centuries-long association with the royal family, hosting generations of coronations, royal weddings and funerals.\n\nThe church, which was consecrated in 1065 and “has been the setting for every coronation since 1066” and 16 royal weddings, a statement on the abbey’s website says.\n\n“Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's connection with Westminster Abbey ran like a thread through her early life and her long reign,” the site says. “As an 11-year-old girl, she watched as her father was crowned here. As a young adult, she married here and was crowned here.”\n\nFourteen English monarchs were buried there between 1066 and 1760, including Queen Elizabeth I, the daughter of King Henry VIII, who was interred in the abbey in 1603. The Unknown Warrior, whose body was brought from France in 1920, is buried in the abbey’s nave. Author Charles Dickens is among those buried in Poets' Corner of the abbey.\n\nThe funeral of Princess Diana was held at the abbey in 1997 and the Queen Mother’s funeral took place there in 2002. More recently, Prince William and Duchess Kate, now the Prince and Princess of Wales, were married there in 2011.\n\nVisual guide to the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey\n\nQueen's funeral more than ceremony, designed to show monarchy's stability\n\nThe queen, who died Sept. 8 in Scotland at age 96 after 70 years on the throne, was widely considered the glue holding the U.K. together. She was also the most canny of her Windsor ancestors about using ceremony and splendor to bond the monarchy and the people who pay for it.\n\nNot since 1965, for former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, has Britain mounted a state funeral, which is usually reserved for monarchs, with exceptions for distinguished figures such as Churchill, the queen's first prime minister of her reign.\n\nRoyal funerals are planned decades in advance by governments and the crown, and the plans are updated regularly. The monarch plays a crucial role in deciding details. The choice of flowers in the wreath on her coffin, the music and prayer selections, even the bespoke design of the Royal Hearse (lots of glass and inside light so the casket can be seen even at night), were all decisions made by the queen.\n\nSurvival of the monarchy:Why Queen Elizabeth II's funeral is more than just ceremony\n\nMourners line the streets during queen's funeral\n\nAt 6 a.m. local time, snipers were on rooftops, sniffer dogs were on the streets, drains were being searched and surveillance drones have been banned from all of central London. Around 20 miles of barriers have been erected to control crowds as the queen’s coffin travels the short distance from Westminster Hall, where it is lying-in-state, to Westminster Abbey, and then onward to Windsor Castle after the funeral for burial.\n\nA full five hours before the funeral gets underway, London’s transportation network was already busy on a public holiday, with the subway system seeing members of the public rushing to secure viewing spots in and around Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster. Many carried small fold-up chairs, and Londoners almost entirely wore black in the quiet of the city. Volunteers in purple vests every few yards provided help with directions and other needs.\n\nHyde Park, one of London's central parks, is a designated screening spot for Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral on Monday. The 11 a.m.-ceremony will be broadcast live on large screens for attendees to see for free at the park, and the Hyde Park site will show the procession through London following the funeral, the procession through Windsor and the Committal Service at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nSigns and staff are present across the city to direct people to either the park or other \"viewing areas\" where they may catch a real glimpse of the state funeral route. The park and viewing areas include dedicated spots for anyone who has an accessibility need, including British Sign Language interpreters and a dedicated location for wheelchair users.\n\nPeople watched the funeral and procession from almost everywhere – lining the streets 10-deep to sitting on blankets in parks.\n\nLucy Hartnell, 26, from Hertfordshire, organized a picnic at Hyde Park of what she and friends assumed were “queen favorites” including strawberries, cucumber finger sandwiches, Prosecco, cupcakes and chips. They took the tube into London and were \"shocked\" how easy it was for them to get to Hyde Park to view the funeral.\n\nThey said they attended to not miss a big event and aren’t really pro-royal or anti-royal, which has been a large debate among young people.\n\n\"We’re not super against the royals or for them, we just wanted to be part of them moment,\" Hartnell said.\n\nThey said the transition to a king likely won’t affect them, but they said the area where they grew up is very pro-monarchy. \"Our grandparents care a lot. We don’t care that much either way. People our age are like 'we should get rid of the monarchy.' But no one cares enough to actually do anything about it … we just like having them,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Nicole Fallert, Kim Hjelmgaard, Jane Onyanga-Omara, Maria Puente, Laura Trujillo, Amy Haneline and Morgan Hines, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/960455/quiz-of-the-week-7-14-april", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 7 - 14 April | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Hugo Burnand/Royal Household 2023/AP In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next\n\nThe moment Elizabeth II died, her eldest child, Charles, automatically became monarch. As sovereign, he has chosen to take the name King Charles III.\n\nAll rights and responsibilities of the Crown now rest with King Charles III.\n\nHe becomes head of state not just in the UK but in 14 other Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada. He will become head of the 56-member Commonwealth, although that is not a hereditary position, after his succession to the role was agreed by Commonwealth leaders at a meeting in London in 2018.\n\nHe has become head of the British Armed Forces, the judiciary and the civil service, and he is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He is the Fount of Honour, which means all honors, such as knighthoods, will now be given in his name.\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution, so the role of monarchy is defined by convention rather than law. He has a duty to remain politically impartial, which means he will come under greater scrutiny if he continues to express the views he is known for.\n\nHe has championed alternative medicines and organic farming techniques. In 1984, he hit out at the “glass stumps and concrete towers” of modern architecture. He has spent decades warning of the dangers of climate change. In the so-called “black spider” memos, he raised the issues he was concerned about directly with ministers.\n\nIn a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Charles acknowledged having ruffled feathers with his past interventions. But he promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once sovereign, saying he would operate within “the constitutional parameters.”\n\nElizabeth stayed “above politics” and never expressed herself in any way on any issue and as a result she rarely divided opinion. She managed to retain popular support and cross-party support in parliament, which was the one body with the power to dethrone her.\n\nWe will never know what she discussed in her regular audiences with her prime ministers, beginning with Churchill, but Charles is a more outspoken character. Will he go quiet on policy matters in public but continue to lobby in private? Will the prime minister act on it?\n\nThe prime ministerial audiences are one of several constitutional duties to which King Charles III will be expected to step up and they will bring him in regular contact with policymakers. He appoints the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, approves legislation and official appointments, receives the credentials of foreign ambassadors and hosts world leaders on state visits.\n\nCharles has also adopted the symbolic position as Head of Nation, meaning he becomes the symbol of national identity, unity, and pride. He represents continuity and celebrates excellence on behalf of the country. That’s why we see the monarch opening national events and leading commemorations.\n\nPeople would look to Elizabeth in times of crisis, but will they rally around King Charles III in the same way? He is more divisive not just because of his honest views but also because of the bad taste still left from his acrimonious divorce from his immensely popular first wife, Diana.\n\nAll the official royal residences including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will now be under his control. There are also other residences such as Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk which the Queen owned privately – and the nation will have to see to whom she leaves them in her will.\n\nEither way, Charles’ wealth has ballooned. By far the biggest slice of the family’s fortune, the £16.5 billion ($19 billion) Crown Estate, now belongs to him as reigning monarch. But under an arrangement dating back to 1760, the monarch hands over all profits from the estate to the government in return for a slice, called the Sovereign Grant.\n\nThe estate includes vast swathes of central London property and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It has the status of a corporation and is managed by a chief executive and commissioners — or non-executive directors — appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\nThe grant, which covers the cost of his official duties and amounted to £86.3 million ($99.2 million) for the 2021/2022 financial year. He will take charge of the Royal Collection, which includes one of the most valuable art collections in the world. He also picks up the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate dating back to 1265, which was valued at about £653 million ($764 million) according to its most recent accounts. Income from its investments cover official costs not met by the Sovereign Grant, and helps support other Royal family members.\n\nKing Charles III has become one of the richest men in England overnight.\n\nCamilla\n\nCharles and Camilla attend the Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel on June 13, 2022 in Windsor, England. Toby Melville/Getty Images\n\nFor years, the big question around Charles’ wife surrounded her title. At the time their wedding was announced in February 2005, the official statement said: “It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH The Princess Consort when The Prince of Wales accedes to The Throne.” That was a very clear signal that Camilla would not use the title of Queen. Her office at Clarence House distanced itself from that statement in the intervening years, however, saying it was a matter for the reigning monarch.\n\nThen, in February 2022, the Queen expressed her desire for her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort when Charles became King in a message marking the start of her platinum jubilee year – a statement that appeared to resolve the issue for good.\n\nThe Queen’s wishes were welcomed by the couple themselves. That same weekend, a statement released by a spokesperson said they had been “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”\n\nWhere will the couple live? Well, traditionally the new monarch would move into Buckingham Palace but in 2011, the BBC reported that Charles was considering moving his entire court to Windsor and turning Buckingham Palace into an events center. That would be a dramatic and controversial shift but might also assert King Charles III as the new boss.\n\nWilliam and Catherine\n\nWilliam and Catherine are pictured with their children, George, Charlotte and Louis, and the Queen, Charles and Camilla at Buckingham Palace during platinum jubilee celebrations on June 5, 2022. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nUp until now, Charles has been responsible for covering the costs of his heir, Prince William.\n\nWilliam has now inherited his father’s titles of The Duke of Cornwall, which comes with an estate which last year delivered an income of £23 million ($26 million). That money now goes straight to William and he becomes independently wealthy.\n\nHis new title is HRH The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge and tradition dictates that, as first in line to the throne, he also becomes Prince of Wales. And Catherine becomes Her Royal Highness, The Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nWilliam and Catherine will be able to solidify their own independent court, which is currently based at Kensington Palace in west London, in an apartment that was refurbished shortly after their marriage. It seems unlikely that William would want to move, so the King’s former residences, including Clarence House and Birkhall in the Scottish Highlands, will likely remain vacant until Charles offers them to other members of the family, or finds an alternative use. The family resides at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor during school term time.\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will follow their parents’ titling. They are now Their Royal Highnesses Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cornwall and Cambridge. Colloquially they are likely to be known as George, Charlotte and Louis Wales.\n\nHarry and Meghan\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry react as they attend the annual One Young World Summit in Manchester, north-west England on September 5, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt’s unlikely that Charles’ second son, Harry, will be offered a royal office unless he and wife Meghan return to their royal duties, and the King would also need to confirm that they can continue to use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, which is part of the royal estate. They currently live with son Archie and daughter Lilibet in California but were allowed to continue using Frogmore as their official residence during the Queen’s reign.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced in early 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties, they said they would “work to become financially independent.” The terms of the split stipulated that while the pair would always remain part of the family, they would no longer use their HRH titles.\n\nAs grandchildren of the monarch, Archie now automatically becomes Prince Archie of Sussex while Lilibet will be Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Whether they use those titles will only become known the first time their parents refer to them publicly.\n\nPrince Andrew and other family members\n\nKing Charles III also becomes responsible for distributing roles, responsibilities and resources to other members of the royal family.\n\nCharles has never been close to his brother Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties over his links to the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022 he was stripped of his HRH title, as well as others associated with the military and charity roles. That raises the question of whether the new King continues to allow Andrew to use his Buckingham Palace apartment and offers financial support.\n\nThen there are his other siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and more distant relatives such as the Gloucesters and Kents who retain royal residences at Kensington.\n\nPrincess Anne attends a service at St Giles' Cathedral on June 30, 2022 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nCharles will need to decide how much family support he needs to carry out his duties and who he wants to offer it. Then he can reveal what support he offers in return. Many of these decisions would already have been taken and the first telling signs of where his loyalties lie will be seen in who gets to keep which residences and especially who gets an upgrade.\n\nAnne and Edward, and his wife Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, are expected to continue with their public duties following decades of dedicated service but the new King needs to balance that against pressure for a slimmed down monarchy in austere times.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/uk/royal-news-newsletter-09-16-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Inside Westminster Hall, where the Queen is lying in state | CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in a special September 16 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family.

Here, in the oldest part of the Houses of Parliament, it reverberates instantly around the space, stopping people in their tracks and capturing their attention.\n\nMoments later, footfalls on ancient steps resound as soldiers from units serving the Royal Household march into the room to relieve the guard around the Queen’s coffin.\n\nMembers of the public watch as the new guard makes its way in perfect synchronicity to the central platform, mesmerized by the jingling of medals as the soldiers move.\n\nWith another tap, the old guard troops out and its replacement takes up position, standing perfectly still beneath the 11th-century hall’s medieval roof.\n\nThe crowd reanimates once more and the lines streaming past the catafalque resume. Here, beneath these ancient timber beams, ancient traditions are playing out in present day.\n\nThe Queen has been lying in state since Wednesday, when her coffin was conveyed to Westminster Hall in a somber procession that saw King Charles III, Princes William and Harry and other senior royals follow behind on foot. It will remain here until the morning of the Queen’s state funeral on Monday.\n\nThe Queen’s mother and father both lay in state here before her: King George VI in 1952, and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother in 2002. So did her grandfather George V in 1936 and her great-grandfather Edward VII in 1910 – the first royal to lie in state.\n\nTo maintain a continuous vigil, each watch lasts for 20 minutes. Lauren Said-Moorhouse/CNN\n\nState funerals are only reserved for monarchs, however, there has been one exception: Elizabeth II’s first prime minister, Winston Churchill. He also lay in state in the hall after his death in 1965.\n\nAs candlelight glistens on the symbols of state atop the coffin – the Imperial State Crown and the Sovereign’s Orb and Sceptre – mourners pay their respects to the late monarch. Some young, some old, families with children in school uniforms, those of faith and those of none – all are here to say farewell and thank the Queen for her lifelong service.\n\nThe walk from one end of the hall doesn’t take long – a few minutes at most. After waiting for hours in The Queue, sometimes overnight, the fleeting moment they’ve all been waiting for finally arrives.\n\nMen pause briefly to bow to the coffin while several women perform a deep, respectful curtsey. Some simply smile or nod their head. Others take a moment to blow a kiss toward the catafalque. Then there are the older military veterans, with medals proudly displayed, who stand to attention and perform one last salute to their former commander-in-chief.\n\nMembers of the public view the Queen's coffin, which is draped with the Royal Standard, on which lie the Instruments of State -- the Imperial State Crown and the Orb and Sceptre.

But as each person finds their own way to acknowledge the Queen, some stopping the flow of movement for the briefest of seconds, no one complains. Those in line wait patiently for the person ahead of them to do what they need to do before they move forward, and on toward the exit.\n\nAs the mourners reach the far side of the hall, almost every single person – including us – stops and turns back for one final look and to say a silent goodbye to the only monarch most have ever known.\n\n(CNN’s James Frater contributed to this story.)\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThe King walks with his family behind the Queen's coffin on Wednesday.

Multiple official agencies were brought together. Meticulous plans were secretly drawn up. Intricate logistical technicalities were ironed out. A route was carefully mapped out. And no country’s population could have been better prepared for it.\n\nWe are talking, of course, about the line that Britons must join in order to pay their respects to the Queen. This is not an ordinary line. It has taken on symbolic meaning, a ritual to be undertaken, an embodiment of the national mood. It is, in short, not a queue but The Queue.\n\nIt snakes from Westminster Hall, where the late monarch’s body is lying in state, for miles along the south bank of the Thames river. It stretches past landmarks such as the London Eye, the Globe theater and London Bridge. On Friday morning, the line was closed, having reached capacity for “at least six hours,” according to the UK government’s live tracker.

At state occasions, a crown or tiara rested atop a perfect coif. At the stables of Balmoral, where she tended to her ponies in Wellington boots and a Barbour jacket, a patterned scarf was always tied under her chin. But most often, it was a hat.\n\n“You almost can’t see it in isolation. There’s always a brooch, there’s usually pearls, there’s usually white gloves,” Beatrice Behlen, senior curator of fashion and decorative arts at the Museum of London, said in a 2019 phone interview. “And then the matching hat.”\n\nHats were a part of the Queen’s life from childhood, when she was photographed in bonnets and berets. She would continue to wear them through adolescence and young adulthood, often coordinating with younger sister Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother. From the outset, her tastes were bold and provocative.

It was seen as a recognition of the sensitivities around a title that was destined for Charles’ first wife, Diana.\n\nIt’s the same reason Camilla doesn’t use the title of Princess of Wales.\n\nThe Queen would be expected to consult her direct heirs Charles and William before making such a significant announcement about titles, which suggests they both agreed and felt the British public is ready to accept Camilla as Queen.\n\nThe 95-year-old monarch laid out her vision for institution’s transition in an extraordinary message released as she reached the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne.\n\n“I would like to express my thanks to you all for your support. I remain eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me,” the Queen said.\n\n“And when, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his wife Camilla the same support that you have given me; and it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.”\n\nWhen her father died in 1952, Elizabeth II — then just 25 years old — became the Queen of England.

Stroud/Hulton Royals Collection/Getty Images 70 years ago, Queen Elizabeth II took the throne Prev Next\n\nIt’s a hugely significant intervention from the monarch, who is the only person who can define royal titles.\n\nCamilla became something of a public pariah following the breakdown of Charles and Diana’s union in the mid-90s.\n\nDiana had blamed Camilla for ruining her marriage, saying in a 1995 television interview, “There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.” A year earlier, Charles had also appeared on television and confessed his infidelity, but maintained he had only been unfaithful once his marriage had crumbled.\n\nPositive public sentiment for the Princess of Wales was only further cemented when she was killed in a Paris car crash in 1997.\n\nIn the intervening years, Camilla retreated to the shadows, supporting Charles quietly from a distance.\n\nBut as time has gone by, sentiment toward the Duchess of Cornwall has softened. And the Queen’s moves to future-proof the monarchy reflects Camilla is no longer viewed as the royal mistress but a central figure in “the firm.”\n\nOn Saturday, Prince Charles and Camilla announced they were “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words” according to a spokesperson.\n\nElizabeth ascended to the throne on February 6, 1952, following the death of her father, King George VI, at the age of 56.\n\nThroughout her reign, Elizabeth has often used landmark moments to reaffirm her devotion to her duties, and did so once more in her message on Saturday, despite the fact she is nearing her 96th birthday.\n\n“As we mark this anniversary, it gives me pleasure to renew to you the pledge I gave in 1947 that my life will always be devoted to your service,” she said.\n\nThe Queen also expressed “a sense of hope and optimism” for the year ahead, before conveying her gratitude to her family for their support and paying tribute to her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\n“I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrifices that go with it. It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my father’s reign,” she shared.\n\nThe monarch ended her message by restating she looked forward “to continuing to serve you with all my heart” and shared her hope her jubilee would provide an opportunity for people to come together after the difficulties of recent years.\n\nTraditionally, the Queen marks her Accession Day at her countryside retreat of Sandringham in Norfolk, about 100 miles north of London. It’s a chance for her to reflect upon the death of her father away from the glare of the public. In keeping with previous years, no public engagements are expected on Sunday.\n\nThe nation will have the chance to honor the monarch’s historic reign in a series of jubilee-themed festivities set to take place throughout the year, culminating in a blockbuster, four-day public holiday in June.\n\nOver the long weekend, beacons will be lit across the United Kingdom; Buckingham Palace will host a music concert; street parties are being encouraged; and a pageant will bring together more than 5,000 personnel, performers, key workers and volunteers from the UK and the Commonwealth.\n\nQueen Elizabeth's history with US Presidents 02:00 - Source: CNN\n\nHowever, the Queen did host a special reception earlier Saturday for some Sandringham community members on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee.\n\nShe welcomed pensioners and representatives from several local charities to the Sandringham House ballroom to celebrate her historic milestone with cake.\n\nOne of those in attendance was former cookery student Angela Wood, who helped develop a recipe intrinsically linked to the start of her reign – Coronation Chicken, a dish of cold chicken in a curry cream sauce served with a side salad.\n\nThe Queen appeared to be in great spirits during the engagement, according to Britain’s PA Media news agency.

Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nIt’s difficult to imagine a worse start to 2022 for Prince Andrew.\n\nThe Queen’s second son has been stripped of his cherished royal titles and will be the only one of his siblings no longer referred to as His (or Her) Royal Highness, Buckingham Palace announced Thursday. The extraordinary statement came a day after a federal judge rejected a bid to have a civil suit against him in New York thrown out. Judge Lewis Kaplan effectively said Andrew does have a case to answer after being accused of sexual assault.\n\nNow he’s facing the prospect of a very public trial later this year on allegations brought by Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was sexually trafficked to the royal by convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, when she was underage. Andrew has previously denied all allegations and has said that he does not recall ever meeting the then-17-year-old, nor does he remember ever having the picture taken with her that has been featured repeatedly in media around the world.\n\nA royal source told us that all Andrew’s titles – his military affiliations and other royal patronages – were returned to his mother effective immediately and will be redistributed to other members of the family.\n\nWe’ve been told the decision involved many of the Windsors, but the Queen will have had the final say, in close consultation with her direct heirs – Princes Charles and William.\n\nTo be clear: Andrew retains his own Duke of York title and he is still a member of the royal family, but, like the Sussexes, he will no longer represent the Queen in an official capacity.\n\nA statement from Buckingham Palace regarding The Duke of York: pic.twitter.com/OCeSqzCP38 — The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) January 13, 2022\n\nThe loss of the military titles in particular will be extremely painful for the prince, who, as a veteran of the Falklands War, took that part of the job most seriously.\n\nIn a press release on Thursday, announcing the Queen’s decision, it was made clear that Andrew will no longer have any royal public duties and will be defending himself as a private citizen in the allegations made by Giuffre.\n\nThe Duke of York does still have legal options he can pursue in the sexual assault lawsuit, but each comes with a degree of risk and no guarantee he’ll be able to mend his stained reputation. In a nutshell, the prince can opt to appeal the judge’s ruling, fight by going to trial, default or settle.\n\nSeveral legal experts we’ve spoken to in the past 48 hours have suggested an out-of-court settlement may be the best approach. But Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, has indicated his client may prefer to have her day in court.\n\n“I think it’s very important to Virginia Giuffre that this matter be resolved in a way that vindicates her and vindicates the other victims. I don’t think she has a firm view as to exactly what a solution should be,” he said in an interview with the BBC. “But I think what’s going to be important is that this resolution vindicates her and vindicates the claim she has made.”\n\nA source close to Prince Andrew told CNN Thursday that he will “continue to defend himself” against the sexual abuse lawsuit.\n\n“Given the robustness with which Judge Kaplan greeted our arguments, we are unsurprised by the ruling. However, it was not a judgement on the merits of Ms Giuffre’s allegations,” the source said.\n\n“This is a marathon not a sprint and the Duke will continue to defend himself against these claims,” the source added.\n\nThe Queen and her second son chat at the Windsor Horse Show in May 2017. Mark Cuthbert/UK Press/Getty Images\n\nAndrew’s permanent removal from royal duties will surely have been a tough call for the matriarch, but one she clearly felt was needed in her capacity as head of the institution. The message here is this: The case in New York is simply too damaging to the family and the reputation of the monarchy – so he had to go.\n\nWith no official duties to perform, he will no longer receive public funds but will be free as a private citizen to take paid work in the private sector or source money through other private means to fund his very expensive legal effort. That would have been seen as a conflict of interest while he was an HRH.\n\nThe sovereign herself has faced some criticism for not acting fast enough as the scandal began to engulf Andrew back in 2019, following his car crash interview with the BBC over his relationship with Epstein. Many at the time felt he lacked empathy for the disgraced financier’s victims and that his titles should have been revoked then, rather than more than two years later.\n\nMark Stephens, a media lawyer with the London-based firm Howard Kennedy, believes the family and public were “prepared to give him some latitude to defend himself on the grounds that you’re innocent until proven guilty.”\n\nThe prince’s attorneys had argued that Giuffre’s lawsuit violated the terms of her 2009 settlement agreement with Epstein in Florida, in which she agreed to a “general release” of claims against Epstein and others. That settlement, released to the public recently, shows that Epstein paid Giuffre $500,000 to drop the case without any admission of liability or fault. The prince’s name does not explicitly appear as a party.\n\nThe pair attended the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn in London on December 13, 2018. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nHowever, Stephens continued, “When he sought to say, with one side of his mouth, ‘I never met this woman’ and with the other, ‘Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile, settled my case for me or any case for me,’ I think that that was too much for the British public to stomach, and that was when the public, I think, decisively moved against Andrew and anyone that was seen to support him.”\n\n“The criticism of the Queen and her tacit support for her son has really only occurred since Brettler (the duke’s lawyer) made that argument to Judge Kaplan, and it sounded more loudly since the results of that argument have come down,” he added.\n\nThe question now is: Will the duke’s permanent exile be enough reputational damage control in the eyes of the public? Legal experts say the Queen has responded authoritatively, acting promptly instead of waiting for any verdict should the case reach the trial stage. She only retains the crown by virtue of parliamentary support and that, in turn, relies on public support.\n\nNick Goldstone, head of dispute resolution at international law firm Ince, called the removal of military titles and royal patronages, combined with no longer being able to use the HRH style in an official capacity, a “significant development.”\n\nHe said it was “probably enough” to quell further criticism of inaction from the public, adding “it certainly appears to have brought the Duke of York’s public life as a royal to an end for the foreseeable future.”\n\nPrince Andrew stands with his mother and other members of the royal family during Trooping The Colour, the Queen's annual birthday parade, on June 8, 2019 in London. Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images\n\nStephens, too, believes the palace moved quickly and decisively. “Essentially, he’s been put out to pasture, and he’s been reduced in status to the same status as Prince Harry,” he said, adding: “The handing back of his titles and honorifics makes it clear that he has no part in the future of the public civic life of this country.”\n\nMost notably that means Andrew won’t have a front seat at the upcoming jubilee celebrations to mark the Queen’s 70 years on the throne. He will be there for group photos but without the prime position assumed by an HRH.\n\nAndrew will now be hoping the public are able to compartmentalize the lawsuit and allow 2022 to be defined as a royal jubilee year instead of a scandalized one. That’s clearly the hope of the rest of the family.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nSo, it’s been announced that Prince Andrew will stop using the “HRH” style in any official capacity. Let’s break down what it all means.\n\nThe letters stand for His or Her Royal Highness, a style used to denote senior members of the royal family.\n\nSince the early 18th century, it’s been customary for the title to be issued to sons and grandsons (and later, daughters and granddaughters) of the monarch.\n\nIt is bestowed upon royal members at the discretion of the monarch at the time, but was used liberally until World War I.\n\nThen, in 1917, George V restricted how many minor royals were getting the title – at a time when there was public suspicion about the German origins of the House of Windsor, speedily renamed that year from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nThe Duke of York at the 100th Anniversary Ceremony of The Royal Air Force at Westminster Abbey on July 10, 2018 STAR MAX/AP\n\nQueen Elizabeth II has loosened those guidelines, giving HRH status to a number of senior royals.\n\nToday, children and grandchildren of the monarch traditionally get the HRH title – though it was historically withheld from granddaughters. The title doesn’t stretch to all the minor royals, but does include family members like the Queen’s cousin Prince Michael of Kent, who is far down the line of succession.\n\nNot everyone has accepted the offer of an HRH. Princess Anne, the Queen’s daughter, declined the title for her own children, Peter and Zara. The move has allowed them to carve out relatively normal lives away from significant public scrutiny.\n\nAfter her divorce from Prince Charles, Diana had her HRH taken away. Instead, she was given the courtesy title of “Diana, Princess of Wales.” Similarly, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was also stripped of her HRH following her divorce from Prince Andrew.\n\nMost recently, the Sussexes gave up their HRH titles after announcing they would step back from the royal family and relocating to the United States.\n\n(With reporting by CNN’s Rob Picheta)\n\nANNOUNCEMENTS\n\nQueen Elizabeth II visits the set of the long-running television series Coronation Street, in Manchester, England on July 8, 2021.

June is shaping up to be a fun and flamboyant celebration of Britain’s longest-serving monarch.\n\nWe’ve mentioned before that to mark the unprecedented anniversary, a number of events will take place throughout the UK over the year – culminating in a four-day national holiday weekend from Thursday, June 2 until Sunday, June 5, known as the Jubilee Weekend.\n\nOne of the initiatives is the “Platinum Pudding” contest – a nationwide baking competition seeking out a new dessert dedicated to the Queen (Think “The Great British Baking Show” – but bigger!) UK residents aged eight and over are eligible to create a recipe, and finalists will be judged by a panel including famed baker Mary Berry, renowned chef and “Masterchef UK” judge Monica Galetti and Buckingham Palace head chef Mark Flanagan. The winning recipe will be made available to the public ahead of the long weekend.\n\nThe Trooping the Colour parade will return to kick off things off. But we’ll also have beacons lit across the nation, Buckingham Palace’s music concert and street parties. It all culminates with a pageant that will include 5,000 personnel, performers, key workers and volunteers from the UK and the Commonwealth.\n\nThis pageant will involve a “River of Hope” section, featuring 200 silk flags that will process down The Mall – the road in London that leads to Buckingham Palace – like a river. Schoolchildren are invited to create a picture of their hopes and aspirations for the planet over the next 70 years as the artwork for the flags. Get the full story here.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING\n\nDowning Street apologizes to the Queen.\n\nDowning Street officials have apologized to Buckingham Palace following a report in The Telegraph newspaper that alleged that two parties were held there on April 16 last year – the night before Prince Philip’s funeral. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s deputy official spokesman told journalists on Friday: “It is deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning, and Number 10 has apologised to the palace.” Under England’s coronavirus restrictions, social gatherings indoors were limited at this time. The very next day, the nation watched as the Queen sat alone in St. George’s Chapel in Windsor. The photograph of the solitary grieving monarch elicited enormous sympathy from the public, both at home and abroad.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip. Jonathan Brady/Getty Images\n\nPrince Charles says painting ‘refreshes the soul.’\n\nAt the largest exhibition of his watercolors to date, painting enthusiast Prince Charles has described the restorative benefits of art, saying it “transports me to another dimension,” adding that his hobby “refreshes parts of the soul which other activities can’t reach.” A new show brings together nearly 80 of the prince’s landscape paintings. Like Queen Victoria, the prince is a “keen watercolorist” who “paints whenever his schedule allows,” according to his official website. He regularly depicts the royal family’s estates, including Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House, and has also produced watercolors in Turkey, Nepal and the Swiss Alps.

Now we're about to see how they do a major funeral during a pandemic, when Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, is laid to rest on Saturday.\n\nThe royal ceremonial funeral for Queen Elizabeth II's husband of 73 years, who died April 9 at Windsor Castle at age 99, will combine antique tradition, the restraints of the coronavirus pandemic, the transcendence of the Church of England funeral rite and the idiosyncratic \"no fuss\" personality of the \"Iron Duke\" himself.\n\nThe duke's final sendoff, which he helped devise, will be much reduced from the usual ceremonial funeral (like the Queen Mother's in 2002 and Princess Diana's in 1997) as a result COVID-19, and it won't be in London but within the sprawling confines of Windsor Castle.\n\nNever-before-seen photo:Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth II pose with their 7 great-grandchildren\n\nLike most funerals of the last year, Prince Philip's has been put at a distance for the public: Mourners can't line up for hours to sign condolence books, as they did by the hundreds of thousands in 1997; they're asked to go online instead. They've been asked not to gather to lay flowers in front of royal palaces as they did in 1997 by the millions; they've done so regardless. The flowers are collected every night and transferred to Marlborough House, the London headquarters of the Commonwealth.\n\nMost disappointing, they won't get to participate in an act of mass mourning, lining the the streets of London to watch and weep as the coffin trundles by.\n\nHere's what to expect, based on announcements from Buckingham Palace and reports by the BBC, which will be televising the funeral.\n\nWhat will we see first?\n\nShortly before 10 a.m. EST, Prince Philip's coffin – covered in his personal royal standard and topped with his sword, naval cap and a wreath of flowers – will be moved from the private chapel at the castle where it has been since his death, to the State Entrance of the castle.\n\nIt will be brought into the castle Quadrangle and placed on a customized Land Rover, one the duke helped design. Led by a military band and accompanied by military chiefs of staff, the cortège will move down the hill, flanked by pallbearers from the military and his staff, to St. George's Chapel, the mini-cathedral where the service will be.\n\nThe half-mile route will be lined by more military personnel from all services, guns will be fired from the East Lawn every minute throughout and a bell will toll in one of the towers at the west end of the castle.\n\nA royal love story:Look back at Prince Philip's 73-year marriage to Queen Elizabeth II\n\nAs the coffin is borne up the West Steps, at 10 a.m. EST, a national minute of silence will commence.\n\nAt the top of the steps the coffin will be met by the Dean of Windsor, the Archbishop of Canterbury and an honor guard and a military band, which will play the national anthem.\n\nMembers of the Household Cavalry will line the steps and Royal Navy pipers will pipe a nautical call, \"the Still,\" as the coffin is carried up the steps. As the coffin enters, the Royal Navy pipers will pipe \"Carry On\" as the chapel doors close.\n\nA family mourns:Prince Harry, Prince William share Prince Philip tributes; Countess Sophie reveals final moments\n\nAll of the procession, except the royal family, will remain outside. The coffin will be carried inside to the choir or Quire, placed on a catafalque, and the service will begin.\n\nAfter the service, the duke will be interred in the Royal Vault beneath the chapel floor. This part of the funeral will be private. The entire ceremony will likely take just under an hour.\n\nWhich royals will attend the funeral?\n\nUnder Britain's pandemic rules, only 30 people will be allowed to attend, thus requiring ruthless paring of the list. Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave up his seat to make more room for family.\n\nBuckingham Palace announced the list on Thursday:\n\nThe queen, her heir Prince Charles the Prince of Wales, his sons, Prince William Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry Duke of Sussex, and Charles' and William's duchess wives, Camilla and Kate.\n\nPhilip's three other children, Princess Anne the Princess Royal, Prince Andrew Duke of York, and Prince Edward Earl of Wessex, will be there with Anne's husband, Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence, and Sophie Countess of Wessex.\n\nPrince Philip dies at 99:Boris Johnson, the Bidens, Piers Morgan mourn the Duke of Edinburgh\n\nHis other grandchildren attending: Anne's children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall and husband Mike Tindall; Andrew's daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie and their husbands; and Edward's children, Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James Viscount Severn.\n\nPhilip's 10 great-grandchildren will not attend, not even Will and Kate's future king son, Prince George, 7.\n\nThree of the duke's German relatives, the grandchildren of his older sisters who married German royals, will attend, invited at his instructions. His Mountbatten first cousin, Countess Mountbatten of Burma, will be there.\n\nOther invitees are some of the queen's relatives: Her late sister Princess Margaret's children, the Earl of Snowdon and Lady Sarah Chatto and her husband. Some of the queen's Windsor cousins will be there, including Princess Alexandra and the Dukes of Kent and Gloucester.\n\nWho will walk behind Prince Philip's coffin?\n\nThe tradition, dating back at least to his great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, is that male descendants, usually dressed in military uniforms, walk behind the coffin in the funeral cortège. (But not the queen; she will be driven from the castle to the chapel.)\n\nIn antique pictures and film of previous royal funerals, the coffin, covered with a royal standard, plus a crown for a sovereign, and flanked by military troops on horseback, military bands and bagpipers, rests on a gun carriage pulled by horses or ranks of troops through the streets of London.\n\nThis will be a much shorter procession but with as much military flavor as can be mustered, in keeping with the duke's service in the Royal Navy.\n\nOnly the duke's children and male grandchildren will walk in formation behind the coffin, the palace said Thursday:\n\nPrince Charles and his sister Princess Anne together, then Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. Prince William and Prince Harry, currently estranged due to Harry's decision to self-exile to California, will be separated by their older cousin Peter Phillips. Vice Admiral Tim Lawrence will walk with the Earl of Snowdon, and members of the duke's staff will bring up the rear of the procession behind the coffin.\n\nMore:Queen Elizabeth returns to royal duties four days after death of Prince Philip\n\nThe tradition is that all those who could wear a uniform, because of either serving or through honorary links with military commands, would do so, including Charles, William and Anne.\n\nBut the queen defused potential tension by deciding late Wednesday that all senior royals must wear civilian clothes to the funeral. This will mean less embarrassment for Harry and Andrew, both of whom actively served in British forces (Harry in Afghanistan, Andrew in the Falklands) but lost their roles after stepping back from royal duties in recent years.\n\nMore:Prince Harry to attend Prince Philip's funeral; Meghan advised by doctor not to fly to UK\n\nSmall groups of his descendants walking abreast will likely remind millions of the ceremonial funeral of Princess Diana in 1997, when young William and Harry, their uncle Charles Spencer, their father and grandfather walked in the street behind her coffin from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey, evoking floods of tears from the millions of onlookers who lined The Mall.\n\nWhat will be the most unusual element of the funeral?\n\nThe Land Rover as his \"gun carriage\" or his hearse. The duke's interests in science, engineering, technology and design led him to help design a bespoke Land Rover, which he chose to bear his coffin nearly two decades ago.\n\nAccording to Buckingham Palace, the duke was a longtime fan of Land Rovers. The open top rear section of the hearse was designed and custom-made to the duke's specifications, and the original Belize green color was repainted dark bronze green, a color used for many military Land Rovers. Land Rover has maintained the vehicle since it was built and prepared it for the funeral in collaboration with the Royal Household, the palace said.\n\n\"The Land Rover is a stroke of genius,\" says the American royal biographer, Sally Bedell Smith. \"It is so much in his character – he used to drive around Sandringham in an electric van in the '80s – that he would devise this.\"\n\nWill the royals be masked?\n\nIn keeping with pandemic rules, the congregation will wear masks for the service and members of the royal family will wear day dress or morning coat with medals. The BBC crew operating the TV cameras will also be masked.\n\nAnother COVID-19 unknown: Will the queen be forced to sit alone or far from her relatives due to social distancing rules? Will Prince Harry also have to sit alone, having arrived from California only days ago?\n\nHe has been quarantined at Frogmore Cottage at Windsor but the British pandemic rules are strict and allow for few exceptions.\n\nAlso in line with the rules, the guests won't sing during the service; a small choir of four, seated far away in the nave, will sing music chosen by the duke.\n\nMore:Prince Charles remembers 'dear papa' Prince Philip; Harry, Duchess Meghan, more royals mourn\n\nWhat is the Royal Vault?\n\nBeneath its floors, St. George's Chapel is stuffed with royal burials, but the Royal Vault is especially crowded. Constructed starting in 1804, there are three British kings including George III and his two sons, George IV and William IV.\n\nWill this be the Duke of Edinburgh's permanent resting place?\n\nNo. When the queen dies, the duke will be moved to the tiny King George VI memorial chapel – where the queen’s father, her mother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and the cremains of her sister, Princess Margaret, are also interred – to lie beside his wife again.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/15"}]}
